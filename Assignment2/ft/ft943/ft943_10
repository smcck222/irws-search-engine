FT  15 SEP 94 / Prudential rises 16% despite fall from UK life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, reported a 16 per
cent rise to Pounds 280m in first-half pre-tax profits, but profits from the
UK life business fell.
The drop in profits from the UK long-term business, from Pounds 139m to
132m, reflected a decline in sales of insurance products and the cost to
shareholders of financing new unit-linked business.
It also took account of provision for potential reductions in bonuses on its
with-profits policies which are not set until the year-end in March.
Prudential and other insurers have cut bonus rates in line with lower
investment returns in recent years.
Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive, expected UK sales to be subdued in the
second half, but said that in the longer term the need for savings and
protection products should mean substantial demand.
The interim dividend was raised 9 per cent to 4.9p (4.5p).
Commenting on factors behind the uncertainty and caution among customers, Mr
Newmarch highlighted two areas of regulatory activity. The first was the
report from City regulators on compensating customers who have suffered from
poor advice to transfer out of occupational pension schemes, which is due
next month. The second means that from the start of next year life insurers
have to volunteer more information to customers about policies and charges.
Prudential's pension transfer sales are also being informally investigated
by Lautro, the regulator for the life insurance industry. The inquiry began
in April, and could last another couple of months. Prudential said it has
acted properly on pension transfers and has always conducted its sales
activities well within regulatory rules.
Pre-tax profits from Jackson National Life, Prudential's US subsidiary, rose
to Pounds 36m (Pounds 31m), while total profits were also helped by Pounds
17m from other international business, compared with a Pounds 6m loss last
year.
This profit included Pounds 5m for the sale of Prudential's Irish subsidiary
to the Irish Permanent Building Society.
Pre-tax profits from Prudential's general insurance businesses - UK domestic
and motor insurance and Mercantile and General Reinsurance - were sharply
increased to Pounds 53m (Pounds 18m).
Shareholders' other income fell to Pounds 32m from Pounds 53m as a result of
lower investment returns and a rise in corporate spending.

FT  15 SEP 94 / BZW moves towards a new generation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of Barclays, yesterday
signalled a move towards a new generation of management with an announcement
to staff that Mr John Spencer, its 50-year-old deputy chief executive, is to
leave the firm at the end of the year.
Mr Spencer is to be succeeded as chief executive to BZW's markets division
by Mr Sam Marrone, an American who is currently chief executive of BZW
Securities in New York. The firm may decide on a successor to Mr Spencer as
deputy chief executive later this year.
The move follows a request from Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' chief executive,
for BZW to establish a successor to Mr David Band, BZW's chief executive
since 1988. Although Mr Band, who is 51, has no immediate plan to move, it
is thought that he may do so in two or three years.
Mr Band could then become chairman of BZW, a post currently held by Sir
Peter Middleton, who is also deputy chairman of Barclays. There was
speculation over whether Sir Peter would remain at the bank after Mr Taylor
was appointed last year, but Mr Taylor is believed to regard him highly.
BZW said yesterday that Mr Spencer had decided to leave of his own accord
and that the parting was 'entirely amicable'. He has worked at Barclays for
24 years, recently bringing the bank's foreign exchange and money markets
operations into BZW, and developing new risk management systems for trading.
The move leaves no clear successor to Mr Band, but the question could be
resolved with the appointment of a new deputy chief executive. The appointee
would probably be drawn from the eight-member management committee headed by
Mr Band which runs BZW's operations.
BZW told staff that Mr Marrone, a 51-year-old former US marine, is to move
to London at the end of the year. As well as heading the markets division,
he will share responsibility for the debt capital markets operation with Mr
Graham Pimlott.
Mr Dennis Rooke, deputy chief executive of the markets division and head of
global money markets and foreign exchange, will take on liaison
responsibility for the Middle East. Mr Ben Grigsby, joint deputy chief
executive of the markets division, will succeed Mr Marrone in New York.
Some Barclays directors had regarded Mr John Varley, formerly deputy chief
executive of the equities division, as a candidate to succeed Mr Band in the
longer term. But Mr Varley decided to leave BZW earlier this year for
personal reasons.
Mr Pimlott, to whom Mr Taylor has given responsibility for large corporate
lending as well as merchant banking would be a candidate to succeed Mr Band.
Mr Band joined BZW from the US bank J. P. Morgan in 1988.
If Mr Band were to become chairman of BZW, Sir Peter might take on other
responsibilities within Barclays, despite being over the bank's official
retirement age.

FT  15 SEP 94 / ECC looks for acquisitions to build up speciality chemicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English China Clays, the UK minerals and chemicals group, said yesterday it
was prepared to make acquisitions worth up to Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m) to
build up its speciality chemicals business.
Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive, said: 'That is the next stage for us - to
start an acquisition build-up as well as organic growth.' The group, which
in June demerged Camas, its construction materials arm, also said it was
beginning to see scope for price increases in the buoyant European paper
market.
Mr Teare said: 'We are seeing our customer base starting to get into a more
healthy financial state. We have had to restrain our desire for price
increases. We have shared the pain, now we should share the gain.'
ECC reported a 30 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 40.2m to
Pounds 52.2m in the six months to June 30, including a Pounds 21.6m
contribution from land sales by the group's construction division. Camas
reported increased pre-tax profits yesterday, up from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds
4.9m. The group's speciality minerals business, ECC International (ECCI),
improved operating profits in Europe, but offset this by declines in the
Americas and Pacific.
ECCI's sales of European-sourced minerals increased by 6 per cent to Pounds
217m, with strong growth in both the paper and ceramics markets, aided by an
increase in sales of US-sourced clays in Europe.
Operating profit rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 22.8m and underlying trading
margins improved from 9.7 to 13.1 per cent.
This was achieved in spite of incurring Pounds 5.7m of reorganisation costs.
Mr Teare said more than 300 jobs had been shed in the first half and 486
since June last year - representing 11 per cent of the group's workforce.
In ECCI's Americas and Pacific division, sales increased by 3 per cent to
Dollars 217.1m, but operating profit fell 15 per cent to Dollars 23.3m.
Margins fell from 13 to 10.7 per cent. It blamed lower pricing to the paper
industry,higher distribution costs for Georgia clays and lower plant
utilisation for expanded US clay operations.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Post-Meridien time begins: Forte's control of French chain
propels it to new markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Throughout this week, the French and UK press confidently predicted that
Forte had won control of Meridien, the international hotel chain owned by
Air France.
The only doubter was Forte itself. The UK hotel and restaurants group's
caution partly reflected its fear of the lobbying power of Accor, its French
competitor and rival bidder for Meridien. Earlier this year, Accor delayed a
decision by Air France to sell the chain to Forte, arguing that it should
remain in French hands.
Forte also did not want to be seen as having failed again. Earlier this year
it failed to win Ciga, the Italian luxury hotel group, which went to ITT
Sheraton of the US.
This week, Forte's 13-year campaign to take full control of Savoy Hotel, the
UK luxury hotel group, was thwarted by the Savoy's two-tier share structure.
Mr Rocco Forte, Forte chairman, did, however, win the right to be
represented on a three-member chairman's committee.
Yesterday's announcement that Forte is to acquire Meridien is a
comprehensive victory. By taking over Meridien's 54 hotels, Forte has
doubled its international portfolio of first-class establishments.
More important, it has taken Forte into the Asia and Pacific regions, the
world's fastest-growing business and tourist markets, where Forte has no
hotels. Other important markets, such as North America and the Middle East,
are strengthened. Business travellers who use a hotel chain in one part of
the world increasingly want to use it in another. Winning Meridien was
crucial if Forte was to compete in the business market.
Getting overall control of the Savoy group might have been more emotionally
satisfying for Forte, but from a commercial point of view, the struggle for
Meridien was more important.
Forte says the purchase might result in an earnings dilution of 5 per cent
in the first year. Mr Bruce Jones, an analyst at Smith New Court thought it
could be less, given the increase in bookings that should result from a
larger chain.
Having won his struggle, Mr Forte faces three questions. How will he pay for
Meridien, how will he run it and does his group now have the right balance
of businesses?
The initial cost will be FFr1.09bn (Pounds 130m) for Air France's 57 per
cent stake in Meridien. Forte is required to make an offer to minority
shareholders. If they all accept the total price would rise to FFr1.9bn.
Forte has three options in funding the purchase. The first is to use
existing borrowing facilities. Forte has committed but unused facilities of
Pounds 500m.
A second option is arranging bridging finance until Forte sells its 25 per
cent stakes in Gardner Merchant, the contract catering group, and Alpha
Airports, the airline catering company. Both disposals are likely during
1995.
The third option is a rights issue. Mr Forte said: 'It's an obvious
possibility, but it's not necessarily the way we will go.'
Successfully managing Meridien will not be easy. Last year, it recorded a
net deficit of FFr29.7m. Mr Forte says the chain has suffered from the
uncertainty generated by its sale and from its previous status as a
nationalised industry.
Forte will also have to persuade hotels to stay in the chain. Of the 54
acquired, 44 have other owners and are managed by Meridien under management
contract. Mr Forte accepted that some contracts might be lost. If they are,
the price Forte pays will be reduced. But he added: 'We're fairly bullish
about our position with the owners.'
Some have criticised Mr Forte for selling the contract and airline catering
businesses. Contract catering in particular is seen as a recession-resistant
industry.
Mr Forte is adamant that his group was right to concentrate on its hotel and
restaurant business. 'It was the best thing we've ever done. We're now
concentrating on fewer businesses. In a service business like ours, it's
important for the people at the top to be close to the action.'

FT  15 SEP 94 / Clarke lowers hopes of pre-election tax cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke has told cabinet colleagues that the government may find
it impossible to make significant tax cuts before the next election.
In a move to reduce expectations further after his decision this week to
rule out income tax cuts in the November Budget, the chancellor of the
exchequer has made clear that fiscal prudence will also take precedence in
1995 and 1996.
For this year, the chancellor is preparing a broadly neutral tax package and
has indicated that there is no question of a reversal of the tax increases
already pending.
He plans to reject the expected calls at next month's Conservative party
conference to scrap the second stage of the imposition of value added tax on
domestic fuel. He is pressing also for substantial cuts in the government's
spending targets to ensure that the benefits of faster growth and lower
inflation are converted into a lower borrowing requirement.
Mr Clarke has acknowledged that his stance will be unpopular in the short
term. It will alarm the many ministers and backbench Tory MPs who believe
the government cannot leave it later than next year's Budget to demonstrate
its tax-cutting credentials.
But the chancellor is preparing to launch an autumn campaign to persuade
Tory MPs that the government's hopes of political recovery rest on
delivering steady economic growth and low inflation rather than on
unsustainable tax cuts.
After delivering tax increases rather than the promised tax cuts after the
1992 election, Mr Clarke has made clear that the priority must be to rebuild
the government's credibility with the electorate.
Unless borrowing falls well below present projections, the opposition
parties would find it easy to persuade the voters that any pre-election tax
cuts would quickly be reversed.
Colleagues believe that the chancellor still hopes that faster than expected
reductions in borrowing will allow him to combine fiscal austerity with
reductions in income tax before the general election, due by spring 1997.
He has made clear that his decision this week to raise interest rates to
pre-empt any rise in inflation will be mirrored in an equally tough fiscal
stance.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK tops EU league of 48-hour weeks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly half of the 7m male employees in the European Union working a 48-hour
week or more are employed in the UK, according to the annual Employment in
Europe published by the European Commission.
The report helps to explain the UK's strong resistance to the European
working time directive, passed earlier this year, which places strict
controls on working more than 48 hours per week.
Between 1983 and 1992, average hours usually worked per week declined by
just under 4 per cent. The largest reduction was in the Netherlands, where
average hours fell by 13 per cent. By contrast, in Italy and the UK the fall
was only 1 per cent or less.
But the UK is the only EU country which has non-wage labour costs which bear
less heavily on low-paid workers. The report also implicitly backs the UK
government's arguments against a minimum wage by stating that 'low pay is a
relatively minor source of poverty levels of income'. Overall, poverty is
associated with low pay, but in Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland and the
UK, being out of work is the main cause of poverty.
The report also found that:
More people in the EU are now employed in construction than in agriculture.
And almost as many people are employed in business services - the biggest
growth sector between 1985 and 1992 - as in agriculture.
In Germany and Spain, 90 per cent of the unemployed find jobs through public
employment services. In the UK and Portugal, it is less than 30 per cent and
in Greece, less than 10 per cent.
In Belgium, 63 per cent of any increase in labour costs goes to the state.
In other words, the total cost of raising an employee's pay is nearly three
times the addition to their net pay.
In general, exchange rate movements rather than differentials in
productivity or wage rises have been the most important determinant of the
cost competitiveness of European producers.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Mirror group plans cable TV channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mirror Group Newspapers will announce today that it plans to launch a
national cable television channel.
The channel, which may be launched early next year, will provide
entertainment 24 hours a day and will show only British-made programmes.
It is the first significant move into television by the popular newspaper
group since the death of former owner Mr Robert Maxwell, who had cable and
satellite interests. The management team at MGN, lead by chief executive Mr
David Montgomery, has been seeking a way into the television market for some
time.
MGN did bid for a contract to provide a news channel for London cable
subscribers but it was awarded to Associated Newspapers, publishers of the
Daily Mail. Channel One, which has moved into Channel 4's former
headquarters in Charlotte Street, will be launched this year.
MGN's subscription-based channel, which will be delivered by satellite to
the cable networks, will not be available to satellite viewers. It is not
thought that MGN will have to increase its borrowings to launch the channel.
Agreements have been reached in principle with cable operators such as
Comcast, US West and Southwestern Bell. The channel may be available in more
than 500,000 homes at the start.
The cable industry, which is forecasting about 1m subscribers at the end of
the year, is determined to increase the quality of 'cable exclusive'
programming.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Beijing bars Jardine from role in Hong Kong port project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China has ruled out the participation of the Jardine group, the trading
empire which has long been central to Hong Kong's fortunes, in a consortium
to extend the colony's container port.
The move puts on hold the development of the world's busiest container
facility, and casts a doubt over Jardine's ability to expand its business in
China or Hong Kong after the 1997 handover of the colony.
In a thinly veiled attack on the company and governor Chris Patten,
Beijing's semi-official Hong Kong China news agency questioned the
qualifications of Jardine to operate a container terminal, and alleged it
had won the right to develop the port because of political favouritism.
Maintaining that the group 'lacks the necessary experience and expertise in
developing and managing modern container terminals', the commentary said
Jardine 'has no confidence in, and does not wish to make any commitment to,
the future of Hong Kong'.
China's move, which came on the eve of a visit to Hong Kong by Mr Douglas
Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, marks a worsening in Sino-British ties,
which appeared to be on the mend.
Jardine has had a tempestuous relationship with the Chinese leadership over
the past decade. This year it angered China when it decided to de-list from
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange partly because it had little faith in China's
ability to administer the colony fairly after it resumes sovereignty in
1997.
The last straw, however, appears to have been the 11th hour change in voting
intention of Mr Martin Barrow, a Jardine executive, at a crucial point in
this June's Legislative Council debate on Mr Patten's democracy legislation.
His decision to abstain delivered a one-vote victory to the government.
Beijing's attack yesterday was vigorously contested by Sir Hamish Macleod,
Hong Kong's financial secretary, who said that the colony operated a 'level
playing field' for all contracts.
'Our objectivity in such matters has been a key factor in attracting bids,'
he added.
In the first six months of this year throughput at Hong Kong's container
port rose 26 per cent compared with the same period last year. Construction
of the port extension, already 18 months delayed, appears to hinge on the
ejection of Jardine from the Tsing Yi consortium, in which it has a 30-40
per cent equity stake. Jardine is thought to be under pressure from partners
to withdraw.

FT  15 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Forte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Air France's decision to sell Forte its Meridien stake was a welcome victory
for minority shareholders. Whether it sets a precedent for other French
companies is more doubtful. If Air France's board had picked Accor's lower
bid, it would have been against the advice of the European Commission and
Meridien's own management. Even so, it was a close call.
As for Forte, this deal was strategically far more important than the Savoy
imbroglio. Before Meridien, Forte only really fulfilled its slogan 'Host to
the world' in the UK. It is now reinforcing its international presence with
Meridien's 54 hotels in 34 countries. The deal also allows Forte to move
upmarket without investing substantial sums in bricks and mortar. That
reduces Forte's relative exposure to the property roller-coaster.
Although the acquisition makes strategic sense, Forte could be criticised
for overpaying. It would have been easy for the group to succumb to that
temptation after being outbid for Ciga. The trouble for outsiders is that
Meridien's inner workings remain obscure. Forte estimates the deal will
dilute earnings by about 5 percentage points for the first year and be
neutral after that. Nevertheless, the prospect of an eventual sale of its
stake in Gardner Merchant means Forte can afford Meridien without recourse
to a rights issue. If the deal allows Forte to escape from the international
hoteliers' second division, the sum of Pounds 230m will be a small price to
pay.

FT  15 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Prudential
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential Corporation's figures contained a number of bright spots: the
group delivered an increase in profits from Jackson National Life, the US
subsidiary which had threatened to become a headache, and there was a bounce
in the contribution from non-life insurance. Coupled with a robust dividend
increase, this was enough to counter the drop in new business and profits in
the core UK life business, but not to eliminate doubts about the group's
position in the medium term.
Despite a battery of diversification initiatives, there is no avoiding the
Prudential's dependence on the domestic market, which is facing a plethora
of problems. Bad publicity is inevitable as the deadline for the new
commission disclosure regime approaches and the Securities and Investment
Board puts the finishing touches to compensation plans for poor pension
transfer advice. The new disclosure rules will only exacerbate the lack of
underlying growth in the life insurance market. Margins in traditional life
products are being squeezed, leaving companies such as the Pru to chase
lower margin investment business such as Peps.
The shares, driven down by these uncertainties during the course of the
year, now yield a third more than the market average. This provides support,
but only so long as investors do not start to question the Pru's capacity to
generate above average dividend increases in the medium term.

FT  15 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's UK inflation and unemployment data prompted the initial
conclusion that Monday's base rate rise was not a pre-emptive strike after
all. A closer look, though, reveals scant evidence that inflation is already
taking off. The year-on-year rise in consumer prices is still lower than it
was in June. The increase in average manufacturing earnings is decelerating
and unit labour costs are falling. Retailers may be trying again to move
away from discounting, but against the background of softening consumer
confidence it is difficult to be sure that higher prices of clothing and
footwear will stick.
The markets thus have no obvious ground to conclude that a first base rate
rise need be quickly followed by a second. That is small consolation for the
equity market which was looking over-valued after its summer rally. It must
now adjust to a more modest earnings prospect for 1995, because higher base
rates will ensure a slowdown in demand if the recovery does not falter of
its own accord. Where yesterday's reaction does look overdone, at least from
a purely domestic perspective, is in the gilts market.
The snag is that gilts remain coupled to the international trend.
Yesterday's fall of more than one point at the long end was also a
reflection of fresh worries about the interest rate trend in Germany. In
this uncertain climate, there is not much scope for the yield gap between
the two markets to narrow much beyond its present 150 basis points. But it
will compound the problem for equities if gilts slip further as a result of
developments on the continent.

FT  15 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Competition calls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The expected approval of a new form of competition between the UK and the US
will shake up the international telephone cartel. With operating margins on
transatlantic calls thought to be over 50 per cent, the scope for price
cutting is huge. But not all operators will fare equally badly. BT could
even emerge a winner. It is required by its regulator to cut its average
price level anyway. So if international charges did not come down, it would
have to cut other rates. Mercury, though, looks a big loser. It is heavily
dependent on international calls for profits.
The impact will also be felt in continental Europe. Operators will have to
cut transatlantic prices or see traffic diverted through the UK. Of the
quoted companies, Italy's STET and Spain's Telefonica are the most
vulnerable. Not only are their international charges particularly high;
approximately 10 per cent of their traffic is with the US. Holland's KPN and
Tele Danmark should not suffer as much. Their charges are relatively low and
only about 5 per cent of their traffic is with the US.
As the old cartel arrangements crumble, the competing global alliances
formed over the past year will come to the fore. Increasing amounts of
traffic will be channelled over their proprietary networks. Again, BT looks
well placed. Its alliance with MCI gives it a presence on both shores of the
Atlantic. AT&amp;T's position is weaker as it so far has no UK presence, while
the alliance between Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and Sprint is barely
off the drawing board. Non-aligned European operators will now be under
increased pressure to join one of the main alliances. Otherwise, they face
losing some of their most lucrative traffic.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Revolt against Washington: The US president's falling
popularity will hinder Democratic candidates as they prepare for midterm
polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday Marion Barry, convicted four years ago on cocaine charges, was in
effect elected for the fourth time as mayor of Washington, DC. On Monday
Oliver North, whose criminal conviction on Iran-Contra offences was only
overturned on a technicality, was basking all over Virginia in the day-long
company of Senator Robert Dole, titular head of the party of Abraham
Lincoln.
There might not seem much in common, beyond brushes with the law and
political ambition, between Mr Barry, whose Democratic primary victory
virtually assures that he will get his old job back on November 8, and Mr
North, who has a good chance of becoming the next US senator from Virginia.
But their very disparate supporters - poor and black in the nation's capital
and disgruntled and white in the contiguous state to the south - are saying
pretty much the same thing and it resonates across the country.
The message, which amounts to 'we want ours', is that the disenfranchised
and dispossessed, as they see themselves, have had enough of the political
establishment. It was a voice heard loud enough in the 1992 presidential
elections when 62 per cent of the country voted for Bill Clinton and Ross
Perot and against the Washington status quo. But now it is the Democrats who
represent the establishment. Mr Clinton's message of 'change' is faltering
in the public perception while the party cannot hide the fact that it has
ruled Congress largely uninterrupted for the past 40 years.
For the Democrats, the triumph of the disgraced and discredited Mr Barry is
simply another embarrassment. For Mr Dole, who earlier this summer had
expressed reservations as to whether Mr North was the sort of person he
wanted representing his party in the Senate, the prospect of any Republican
gain on November 8 is now reason enough to cast personal doubt aside. He
has, after all, always fancied his instinct for the jugular and the
Democratic throat is invitingly exposed.
Its margin for safety in the congressional and state midterms, especially in
the Senate, is slim. It commands the Senate by 56 seats to 44, the House by
256 to 178 (with one independent) and the governorships by 29 to 19 (with
two independents). As usual, Democrats are defending far more seats than
Republicans and anything much worse than the average loss incurred by every
new president in maiden midterms since the war - four in the Senate and 26
in the House - could hand the Senate back to the Republicans for the first
time since 1986. A real Democratic debacle, unlikely as it may be, could
produce a Republican House, last seen in 1954.
It may seem odd that this should be so, given the relative health of the US
economy, the dominant issue in Mr Clinton's election two short years ago.
But the midterms, with their focus on local issues and personalities, rarely
are driven by national themes. The public mood remains very sour on
politicians in general and on Democrats in particular.
Mr Perot may only intermittently visit this planet and his nascent political
organisation, United We Stand, still rests in the cradle. But his
supporters, all contactable on computerised registration lists, are
increasingly identified with Republican, not Democratic, positions. Voter
turn-out, compounded by Democratic disaffection, is likely to be typically
low, which favours the more motivated Republicans, above all the zealots on
the right.
Mr Clinton's own popularity, now 40 per cent and falling, is of no help to
Democratic candidates who are distancing themselves by the dozen from him.
The failure to pass meaningful healthcare reform has deprived the president
and his party of a prime domestic issue, while the crime bill was so messily
approved that credit is hard to claim. The Democratic national committee is
in disarray, its young Clintonista chairman, David Wilhelm, put out to
pasture, with the White House political staff under Leon Panetta too
preoccupied in Washington to fill the void.
Foreign policy is not intruding much but the prospect of an unpopular
invasion of Haiti does not help Democrats, except possibly with blacks.
Opposition to illegal immigration is a popular cause in California and
Florida, providing rich pickings for two incumbent governors in tight races,
Pete Wilson, the California Republican, and Lawton Chiles, the Florida
Democrat, both only too willing to blame local problems on Washington
mismanagement. The immigration issue suggests that the strain of
isolationism so evident in the 1992 campaigns of Perot and Pat Buchanan, the
Republican conservative, is still virulent.
Although only a handful of incumbents was turfed out in party primaries this
year, holding office is probably no more of an asset now than even in 1992.
Up for grabs on November 8 are 35 Senate seats, 22 held by Democrats; all
the House; and 36 governorships, 21 of them in Democratic hands. Open seats,
created mostly by retirement, leave the Democrats further exposed since they
occupied six of the nine Senate seats and 49 places in the House.
Additionally, as many as 35 of the party's large House freshman class appear
vulnerable.
In the Senate, a six, not seven, seat Republican net gain is all that is
required in practice, since Senator Richard Shelby, the Alabama Democrat, as
often as not votes with the opposition and could even be tempted into
switching sides. The best Democratic hope at present seems to be to limit
the haemorrhage to four or five seats.
But the list of its endangered species is disturbingly long. It even now
includes Maine, where Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, would
have walked back in had he not chosen retirement but where Republican
congresswoman Olympia Snowe is now favoured. Ohio, Arizona, Michigan and
Oklahoma are incumbent-less Democratic seats at serious risk, while at least
three prominent senators, Dianne Feinstein in California, Harris Wofford in
Pennsylvania and Frank Lautenberg in New Jersey, appear in the tightest of
races.
Even presumably rock-solid Democratic seats, such as those held by Edward
Kennedy in Massachusetts and James Sasser in Tennessee, are now, according
to local polls of varying reliability, fragile. It does, however, boggle the
mind that Mr Kennedy, 32 years a Senator, might lose to Mitt Romney, son of
George Romney, a fleeting favourite in the 1960s for the Republican
presidential nomination.
Offsetting this, the Democrats retain some hopes of picking up the open
Republican-held seats in Minnesota and Wyoming and conceivably that occupied
by Conrad Burns in Montana. They also console themselves with the knowledge
that a lot can happen in two months.
The realistic Republican target in the House seems to put control beyond
reach, but a 30-seat pick-up would give the party more seats than it had
held in 40 years and would surely shift the chamber's ideological balance
appreciably to the right. This would be manna from heaven for Congressman
Newt Gingrich, the aggressive conservative from Georgia who is virtually
certain to assume the Republican leadership. Some of the wafer-thin margins
of victory won by the administration on issues such as the budget, trade and
the ban on automatic weapons would be hard to replicate.
Republican control of the Senate would not mean business as usual for either
President Clinton or the rest of the world. Columnist William Safire of the
New York Times recently noted with barely disguised glee some of the
consequences for key committee chairmanships if power were to change hands.
Senator Jesse Helms, the rightwing scourge of all liberally-inclined
diplomats and foreigners, could, if he wanted, have foreign relations,
unless he chooses to protect his North Carolina tobacco farmers by taking
agriculture. Strom Thurmond, age 91 and hardly less conservative with the
passing years, would succeed Sam Nunn at armed services. Al D'Amato would
surely turn the banking committee into a running forum for Whitewater
charges. It is a partisan team that would give the White House fits and
pretty much ensure short shrift for any presidential policy initiatives in
the next two years.
Intriguingly, the Republicans stand on the brink of what would be a relative
nirvana without necessarily offering much of a coherent alternative of their
own to the policies of President Clinton and his party. The party's own
severe fault lines between its traditional centre and hard-line right remain
palpable and a potential handicap for the national campaign in 1996.
Nor, history suggests, would a midterm disaster for Mr Clinton necessarily
consign him to the 1996 presidential wastebasket. House seats lost in both
Eisenhower's and Reagan's first midterms (18 and 26 respectively) were
larger than the 15 and eight of 1978 and 1990 under Jimmy Carter and George
Bush, who did not survive the next elections. But that may be a small
consolation if the morning of November 9 lives up to Mr Dole's expectations.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
President Clinton's troubles are coming in battalions. Now he has had to
abandon his request to attach a 'fast-track' authority to the passage of the
results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. This
setback is not without advantages. But the disadvantages outweigh them,
since the US capacity to enter serious new trade negotiations has probably
been crippled.
The purpose of a fast-track authority is to ensure that Congress will vote
on the results of a negotiation as a whole. In the absence of such an
authority, US partners believe negotiations are likely to prove fruitless,
since their results are exposed to the death of a thousand amendments.
True, the US has entered trade negotiations without such an authority in the
past. But the current resurgence of protectionist sentiment makes that
course riskier for its partners and less rewarding to itself than during the
early years of the Uruguay Round. In any case, nothing much happened in the
Uruguay Round either until a fast-track authority was granted.
The reason Mr Clinton has been forced to drop the request, which had been
attached to the Uruguay Round package, says much about why it was important.
His administration and, indeed, most Democrats regard the incorporation of
labour and environmental standards in further trade negotiations as
essential, while Republicans regard their inclusion as anathema. The result
of the conflict was a stalemate not just on fast track, but on passage of
the round itself.
Rightly, the administration decided that the round was the first priority.
Ratification should now proceed apace, which ought to shame laggards
elsewhere, not least the European Union. It is also difficult to weep tears
for the lack of an obligation to negotiate on labour and environmental
standards. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, will still be able
to raise these topics in negotiations. But he will, fortunately, be unable
to tell his counterparts that they must give the US something in these areas
to meet conditions set by Congress.
The prior question, however, is whether there will be any negotiations. The
Clinton administration's intention to pursue trade negotiations actively
within the Americas and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum has
been derailed. The president has a summit with the former grouping in Miami
in December, and with the latter grouping in Jakarta in November. What can
he now bring them?
It may, in fact, prove impossible for the administration to impart momentum
to any trade negotiations for the balance of its term. But what does not go
forward may well go backwards. That is still more likely when many of the
new Congressmen are likely to incline towards protectionism. It is good news
that the US should soon write finis to the long effort to negotiate the
Uruguay Round. But that is the past. The future of trade policy is now
shrouded in doubt.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Leading Article: A new Ken
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke has seen the future and it is wearing a hair-shirt. Not
content with Monday's display of monetary austerity, the chancellor of the
exchequer is telling his party to expect the same prudence with regard to
taxes. He is asking the government to gamble that making the voters feel
safe is a surer re-election strategy than trying to make them feel good.
On the face of it, Mr Clarke's approach makes good economic and political
sense. Sterling's humiliating departure from the European exchange rate
mechanism left the public, as well as the financial markets, distrustful of
the government's macro-economic credentials.
A single pre-emptive interest rate increase, like Monday's half-point rise,
will not convince them that the Conservatives are once again the party of
sound money. Resisting pre-election tax cuts, on the other hand, might look
impressively frugal, particularly if the Conservatives continue to lag so
far behind in the polls.
Yet Mr Clarke's hair-shirt has a number of holes. The first is practical: he
may not convince the rest of his party that austerity makes sense. Resisting
tax cuts in this November's Budget will not be too difficult, since many in
the party had already accepted that an early giveaway was unlikely. In 1995
and 1996, however, the pressure for some pre-election crowd pleasers could
be considerable.
In fact, no credible chancellor can definitively rule out tax changes -
whether increases or cuts - for the coming two or three years. The target of
Mr Clarke's sombre warnings would seem to be, not supporters of lower taxes,
per se, but those who would wish him to lower them in the run-up to the next
election, even if the government's public spending targets had not been met.
Mr Clarke may be correct that trying to revive a voter feel-good factor with
tax cuts could backfire on the government if the fiscal deficit were to
remain high. In truth, however, the public sector borrowing requirement is
likely to fall dramatically over the period, thanks to the combined effect
of lower inflation and economic recovery.
Indeed, the figure for 1993-94 is likely to be about Pounds 30bn-Pounds
31bn, considerably less than the Pounds 36bn predicted at the time of the
last Budget. Keeping to last year's nominal spending targets has proved
simpler than many supposed, since very low inflation enables a greater
volume of spending at no additional cost.
It is possible that Mr Clarke is simply playing a chancellor's traditional
role, by lowering pre-budgetary expectations. Certainly, if ministers really
believed that tax cuts were ruled out, they would have every incentive to
think of ways to spend the extra cash granted them by lower inflation. Mr
Clarke should be careful not to encourage quiet pre-election profligacy of
this kind.

If that palls, the faithful can go to Glorianna's or the Old England, also

The buck has stopped inside the clink for Catalina Villalpando, who ran the

Villalpando, whose notoriety until now had been confined to her application

There may be precious few new ideas in British politics, but it sometimes
seems as if there is an even bigger shortage of political slogans.
Take the late Iain Macleod who, when he was minister of labour, called on
his Conservative party to face up to the challenge of automation and other
developments with a pamphlet entitled Change is our ally. Now Paddy Ashdown,
the leader of the Liberal Democrats, has produced a paper setting out his
agenda for taking politics beyond the three-party system and into the 21st
century.
Its title? Making change our ally.

Sounds as if one very important person is going to be missing from today's
junkets following the loan-signing in Warsaw of Poland's debt reduction deal
 -and it is not Citibank's Bill Rhodes. Polish president Lech Walesa has
cried off, citing a previous engagement in Poznan where he is due to fire
the closing shot in the first ever Nato manoeuvres on Polish soil.
Some western bankers are miffed since the president's diary seems remarkably
empty today. He's not due on parade in Poznan till tomorrow. Could it be
that Walesa is playing safe and distancing himself from a deal which could
turn out to be a mite too generous to the banks? Much more likely is that he
is desperate to get Poland into Nato and doesn't want to do anything to
upset the Nato high command.
Bankers are much more expendable.

<TEXT>
The Keele connection continues its conquest of Whitehall, leaving products
of the Oxbridge finishing school strewn in its wake. Keele University
graduate Richard Mottram will take the top job in the Ministry of Defence
when Sir Christopher France retires in March.
Back in his old department, Mottram will have another Keele man as his
deputy - Moray Stewart. And at the weekly meeting of permanent secretaries
(the 'College of Cardinals') he will be in the company of John Vereker, the
Keele graduate who is permanent secretary at the Overseas Defence
Administration.
Mottram, 48, was the star prosecution witness at the trial of Clive Ponting
over leaked documents on the torpedoing of the Argentine cruiser, General
Belgrano, during the Falklands war. As private secretary to the then defence
minister, Michael Heseltine, Mottram gave evidence in camera on a top-secret
document, known as the 'Crown Jewels', which dealt with the events leading
up to the sinking.
Mottram, permanent secretary at the Office of Public Service and Science for
the past two years, has been looking after William Waldegrave's civil
service reforms. Tipped for the top defence job for some years, he may yet
be a candidate to succeed Oxford- educated Sir Robin Butler when
the latter retires as cabinet secretary and head of the civil service in
1998.

CALIFORNIA: for governor, Pete Wilson against Kathleen Brown. If Mr Wilson,
the Republican incumbent, wins re-election convincingly, an improbable
prospect as the year began, he would become a huge national political force
 -to the point, some serious pundits believe, of becoming the instant
favourite for the party's presidential nomination in 1996. A 'new face,
west-east' ticket pairing him with Christie Whitman, the popular tax-cutting
governor of New Jersey, has many Republicans salivating - though not the
religious right because both are pro-choice on abortion.
If Ms Brown, the state treasurer from California's most illustrious
political family (daughter of Governor 'Pat', sister of Governor Jerry),
revives her faltering campaign and triumphs, she, too, would assume great
national significance, if not for 1996 then certainly for the millennial
election.
Mr Wilson is benefiting from a state economy finally in recovery and he has
taken a tougher line than Ms Brown against illegal immigration and on crime.
But he could end up as 1994's Jim Florio, the New Jersey governor who also
appeared to have risen from pits of unpopularity last year only to be beaten
at the wire by Ms Whitman.
For the Senate, Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic incumbent and former mayor
of San Francisco, against Congressman Michael Huffington, the transplanted
Texas oil heir married to the ambitious former Ms Arianna Stassinopoulos,
who makes Hillary Clinton look positively retiring. No race anywhere will be
more expensive and Mr Huffington will probably more than double the Dollars
10m he spent in 1992 to win his House seat. Lavish campaign advertising has
narrowed Ms Feinstein's lead appreciably, but both Mr Huffington and his
wife are now facing much media scrutiny and some derision.
NEW YORK: for governor, Mario Cuomo, the Democrat going for a fourth term,
against George Pataki, hitherto obscure Republican state legislator. The
state may be getting bored with its prince of the Hudson, who keeps
declining offers to move to Washington. A Cuomo loss would be devastating to
liberal Democrats nationally.
VIRGINIA: for the Senate, the joke is that the state would rather vote for
none of the four candidates. Two independents muddy the 'character' war
between Chuck Robb, the incumbent, two-term senator whose confessed
extramarital sex life has left him open to criticism, and Ollie North. Doug
Wilder, former Democratic governor, is running because he cannot abide Mr
Robb, and Marshall Coleman, the Republican, wants to stop Mr North. Neither
will win, but how they do may decide the outcome.
The North advantage is that at least his fanatical core support is solid,
especially from the religious right, now a real power in Virginia. The Robb
edge lies in the populous Washington suburbs which hoped they had seen the
last of North.
TEXAS and FLORIDA: noteworthy because two sons of former president George
Bush are Republican candidates. George W. Jr takes on the salty Ann Richards
in Texas, while Jeb has a chance of handing Lawton Chiles his first ever
defeat in a Florida election.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Polish lessons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The debt-reduction accord signed with great fanfare in Warsaw yesterday is a
case of virtue rewarded. Nearly five years after pioneering 'shock therapy'
market reforms, Poland is an economic success story, by post-communist
standards, with a growth rate last year of 4 per cent. The debt agreement,
which halves the country's Dollars 14bn commercial debt, will complete the
nation's economic transformation, by making Poland a member in good standing
of the international financial community.
While Poles have a right to celebrate, their less successful neighbours to
the east and south would do well to consider how they earned it. The first
Polish lesson is speed. Radical economic reforms work best when, as in
Poland, they are implemented immediately after the collapse of the old
regime, when governments have the greatest credibility and citizens the
greatest endurance. The initial caution - or cowardice - of the countries
which failed to follow Poland's lead has made their task much more
difficult.
The second lesson is steadfastness. Market reforms - as Poles know from the
first six months of 1990 when prices soared, and wages and production
plummeted - are initially traumatic. But the conclusion that countries like
Russia need less shock and more therapy is mistaken. The wiser council,
which Polish leaders heeded, is to endure the shock and patiently await the
therapeutic outcome.
Even so, shock alone is not enough. The third Polish lesson is that a
package of reforms can be much more than the sum of its parts.
Privatisation, the one area in which Russia has moved more radically than
either Poland or Hungary, is no bad thing, but it is not the key to
successful reform. What matters, instead, is to create a market through
liberalisation and macro-economic stabilisation. Governments must force
enterprises to live, or die, in that market, by severing the umbilical cord
that ties inefficient state factories to the state treasury, ultimately
strangling both.
This is, of course, no easy task, because many inefficient state factories
must be shut down and their workers be made at least temporarily unemployed.
The fourth Polish lesson, which applies with even greater force to Russia
and Ukraine, is that western financial backing, at the right moment, can
provide a life-jacket for countries about to throw themselves into the
initially frigid waters of reform.
The west gave Poland that support, in the form of a stand-by stabilisation
loan, followed by debt forgiveness. Kiev's leaders are, for example, still
dithering on the brink of radical reforms. The time for the new government
of President Leonid Kuchma to make decisive changes is running out. They
must act radically and comprehensively, as the Poles did, but first they
need a firm and detailed promise of substantial western support in reward
for taking the plunge.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Interest cost of UK opt-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, would have had a whiff of the worse than
expected UK Retail Prices Index and the faster than expected drop in
unemployment by the time he accepted the Bank of England's advice to raise
base rates. This was last Friday, 48 hours after his monthly meeting with
the governor, Eddie George, at which he had asked for a couple of days to
consider.
Nevertheless, these two indicators on their own would not have been
decisive. The 0.1 percentage point rise in the underlying RPI could well
have been a blip due to the end of the summer sales. Moreover, the fall in
unemployment is not yet being accompanied by a rise in the total number of
jobs, let alone full-time ones.
The main reasons for the base rate move were listed in a Treasury statement.
Some of the elements could have been cited a few months ago, such as the
growth of M0 (cash balances) persisting above the monitoring range. Other
trends, such as rising output expectations and higher sterling commodity
prices, and more vigorous recovery abroad have intensified.
The two most important elements were, however, the upward revisions in the
GDP estimates and detailed analysis suggesting rising prices of intermediate
products.
Vigilance is required in reacting to the GDP estimates. For instance, the
headline figure of 3.7 per cent real growth in the year up to the second
quarter of 1994 includes North Sea oil, which is both highly volatile and
exerts little direct pressure on the UK activity. The Treasury invented a
measure called 'non-oil GDP' with which it made great play when it suited
its purpose. This is still the most relevant measure today. Non-oil GDP has
on the latest estimate risen by 3 per cent, which is hardly breathtakingly
high.
Simply to look at this growth rate and contrast it with a guesstimate of
underlying growth of capacity of 2 to 2 1/4 per cent per annum is a howler.
The degree of spare capacity and unemployment are crucial. A 3 per cent
growth rate means something very different when the country is emerging from
a severe recession from what it does if the economy is running along its
trend line or bumping against the limits of capacity.
In fact the best domestic reason for raising UK short-term interest rates
was given in a reader's letter to the FT by Dr J. Popham (September 13). It
was simply that the risk in raising rates at this stage of the cycle, when
world output is recovering strongly, would be much smaller than the risk in
not raising them - which could reinforce the sceptical view that the UK has
not kicked its inflationary habits.
I doubt if the Bank of England would quarrel with the view of the former
chancellor, Norman Lamont, that short-term UK interest rates are likely to
rise to 7 per cent. The governor's speeches, while avoiding crystal gazing,
have assumed that UK short-term rates have been abnormally low in the
aftermath of recession, and that normal growth would require something
higher. If the appropriate real rate of interest is about 4 per cent, then 2
1/2 percentage points have to be added for inflation, even on an optimistic
estimate, and perhaps  1/2 per cent as a risk premium.
These considerations apply to other European countries where short-term
interest rates have not yet risen. In the main this is because recovery has
come later on the Continent. But there are other differences which are
revealed by looking at long-term rather than short-term rates.
Since the beginning of the year, average bond yields have risen in the Group
of Seven countries by nearly 2 percentage points. The rise in yields on UK
indexed gilts would suggest that about 1 percentage point of this increase
represents higher real interest rates and the rest a deterioration in
inflationary expectations.
The European Monetary Institute has apparently carried out a study of the
behaviour of bond rates. It did not explain the worldwide rise, but fell
back on the next best thing, which was to investigate the differential
increases from one country to another.
The charts are a rough attempt to replicate it. They show that Japan has
both the lowest level of bond yields and has experienced the smallest
increase in them - by a very wide margin. (In August, the Japanese yearly
inflation rate became for the first time negative at minus 0.2 per cent.)
The US and Germany cluster close together with bond yields of about 7 1/2
per cent, although Germany has a slightly faster rise of nearly 2 percentage
points. Only slightly behind comes France.
The UK on the other hand heads the also-rans. Before the base rate rise, it
had experienced both a larger increase in bond yields than the countries so
far mentioned and had seen them rise to a higher level. Ten-year bonds rose
in the UK in 1994 by some 2.7 percentage points. The yield was standing
before the base rate rise at 8.8 per cent - a higher level than in these
other countries. The only G7 country it clearly beat was Italy, whose
well-known problems have been reflected in bond yields of well over 12 per
cent.
It is anyone's guess why the UK, which has achieved a near-record underlying
inflation low (superior to any other G7 country except Japan and France),
has not done better in the bond stakes. Sterling has been weak against the
D-Mark and European currencies, but strong against the dollar. Its
trade-weighted index has been above the low point reached after the forced
withdrawal from the ERM, but it has been sagging for most of this year. It
was indeed an element in the government's base rate decision. The hope was
that a sterling crisis would be pre-empted well before the markets started
talking about one. Obviously the chancellor plays down this element in view
of the peculiar emotions which any idea of looking at the sterling rate
arouses in some Tory MPs.
The Treasury and Bank claim that what market developments mainly show is the
need to reinforce the credibility of the new anti-inflationary machinery in
Britain, the high point of which is the regular monthly meeting between the
chancellor and governor. They hope that such confidence will be reinforced
by a pre-emptive strike such as this week's base rate move.
But I fear that there may be more to it than that. Another development is
that European monetary union has recovered some credibility, as the European
economy has recovered and hard core countries have remained within hailing
distance of their old ERM parities. But the idea has also become entrenched
that the UK and Italy will not be among the initial members. And is not the
anti-inflationary credibility of a likely Emu member still higher than that
of an outsider?
In fact Britain stands as good a chance of fulfilling the Maastricht
criteria for Emu membership as most of the probable members. The present
British government looks likely to exercise its opt-out mainly because
anything else would split the Tory party from top to bottom. Meanwhile,
financial markets are not yet completely convinced (a) that Labour will win
the next election, (b) that, if it does, it will have the courage to follow
the instincts of its present leadership and join Emu (although my own view
is that it would) and (c) that, even if a Labour government did join Emu,
this would outweigh its pro-trade union instincts.
The important point is that opting out of Emu does have an economic price
which the UK may already be paying in long-term interest rates higher than
those of partner countries, and in the need to reinforce confidence by base
rate increases earlier than it otherwise might. This is not an element of
policy which either the Treasury or Bank would at present emphasise: which
is all the more reason for others to do so.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Minimum solvency to protect pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RON AMY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Pensions body calls for more time on short-falls'
(September 12) suggests that the National Association of Pension Funds has
changed its views on the need for a minimum solvency requirement (MSR) as
proposed in the government's white paper on pensions. This is not the case.
The NAPF continues to believe the MSR is an essential part of the new
framework to ensure greater protection of members' benefits. It will provide
an early warning of a scheme running into financial difficulties and will be
important in underpinning the proposed compensation scheme.
However, the annual minimum solvency test is only a snapshot at a point in
time. The best way to maintain the security of members' benefits is for the
employer to make a long-term commitment to fund the scheme on a prudent
basis, subject to regular review by independent actuaries. Satisfying the
MSR on a regular annual basis should be seen as a by-product of such prudent
long-term funding.
Where a scheme is being funded on a prudent long-term basis, any shortfall
against the MSR is very likely to be temporary and should not automatically
have to be corrected in the short time spans proposed by the government. In
such circumstances, and if the employer's covenant is good, the new
Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority should have authority to allow
longer periods for solvency to be restored.
Such an approach would help to ensure that precipitate and unnecessary
action is not taken where the MSR deficit is judged to be of a temporary
nature and is likely to be corrected by continuing normal funding.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DEREK LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am responding to points made by Mrs Paddy Seligman in her letter
published in several newspapers and referred to in your report 'Howard
accused on jail rule change' (September 13). Neither the home secretary nor
the prison service has sanctioned any relaxation of security for IRA
prisoners or provision of any special privileges.
When the special unit which held the IRA prisoners at Whitemoor was first
opened, in July 1992, it was not general practice to conduct rub-down
searches of visitors to prisoners in all such units. Following a review of
policies, instructions were issued by prison service headquarters in May of
last year which required full rub-down searches for all visitors in all
special secure units.
That policy has applied at Whitemoor since the reopening of the special
secure unit in June 1993. It will be a matter for the inquiry which is now
under way to confirm that this policy was being fully implemented. The
prison service policy is that no special privileges are given to IRA
prisoners that are in any way different from other prisoners of the same
security category.
Maintenance of security is the top priority for the prison service. Our
policy is to ensure adequate staff are available to maintain security. There
have been no reductions in the number of security staff at Whitemoor, which
is fully staffed.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Coal sale must stress viability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEORGE R J GUISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You are right to argue that the taxpayer should receive the highest
possible return on the sale of British Coal, but wrong to claim that this is
measured solely by the highest bid ('Privatising British Coal', September
12).
The highest return to the taxpayer would be for the problems of the
long-suffering coal industry to be taken from government's door and never to
return. The chance of this happening will be maximised by selecting
whichever bid demonstrates the greatest financial and operational viability
and a fair price for future cash flows.
For example, a very highly geared bid which crashed a few years down the
road, perhaps at election time, would have all the bleeding hearts back at
the Department of Trade and Industry's and the Treasury's doors. Ministers
would be nostalgic for the relative tranquillity of October 1992.
For the coal industry to move irreversibly into the private sector, the
winning bid must also demonstrate a leadership which has the support of the
workforce as well as the marketing and technical skills to maintain sales of
a commodity, currently in chronic over-supply, while continuing to produce
at an internationally competitive cost.
The government should therefore be seeking a proposal which not only
proffers a fair price but, even more importantly, has the least chance of
returning the industry to its own doorstep.

Sir, I very much appreciate Quentin Peel's and Judy Dempsey's articles about
Germany such as the one on the German election campaign, 'Firmly footed for

a clear and unbiased view.
What I dislike, however, is the translation of Bundestag into lower house
(and, likewise, Bundesrat into upper house). Since there are neither
commoners nor lords in this country, no reference should be made to class. I
think the British reader does not need such translation.

occurring are not influenced by the history of that event. Either Mr

<TEXT>
Sir, Your report of Mercury One-2-One's new business tariff ('Lord Young
left with a face to match his bright red bow tie', September 9) compared the
quarterly access charge for our Inside Option (Pounds 64.47) with the
quarterly charge for a fixed BT business line (Pounds 32.66). A more
relevant comparison would have been against the combined cost of subscribing
to both a BT business line and a cellular phone - typically Pounds 107.66
per quarter.
By offering daytime 'fixed' calls from an office/workshop location that are
cheaper than BT and 'mobile' calls that are substantially cheaper than on
the conventional cellular networks, Mercury One-2-One has created a very
competitively priced and self-contained communications package with great
appeal to the self-employed business community.
Our market trials of Inside Option demonstrated that the self-employed
entrepreneurs who form the bedrock of the economy are less fixed in their
thinking about innovations in telecommunications than many commentators.

YEARS OF HOPE: DIARIES, PAPERS AND LETTERS 1940-1962 By Tony Benn
Hutchinson, Pounds 25, 442 pages
Tony Benn has been so spectacularly wrong on so many subjects over the years
that it is pleasant to record his achievements. By far the greatest is that
he has written the best, and probably most accurate, British political
diaries of our time.
Years of Hope is the sixth and presumably final volume. Sub-titled Diaries,
Papers and Letters 1940-1962, it helps to explain a great deal of what came
later, but was published earlier.
'I am going to try out a political diary,' Benn wrote in January 1951,
having just been elected to Parliament as the 'baby' of the House at the age
of 25. 'What I want to do is to highlight the most significant events of
which I am a witness and set down contemporary accounts and opinions which
my memory would probably distort to suit current purposes were I to try to
recall them later on.'
The Benn of the 1950s was not quite as assiduous in his daily jottings as
the Benn of the '60s, '70s and '80s. Yet he stuck to his basic principle:
write it down as you see it and hear it at the time, however fatuous it may
seem afterwards.
A lesser man would have eliminated some of the entries in Years of Hope.
Here, for example, is Benn's comment on a party at the American embassy in
London in April 1959 at which he admits that he and his wife had 'a whale of
a time': 'One wondered how a society led by these sort of people could
possibly withstand the thrust and dynamism of the Chinese communes working
away so feverishly and seriously on the other side of the world.'
Back at the embassy for dinner in December, he recorded: 'This was gracious
living at its height. I cannot but feel that western civilisation has
reached its peak and is now slowly declining before the upsurge of pressure
from the more serious societies.'
He thought (January 1960) that American culture had 'detribalised Britain to
some extent and we shall be better off still when we get the full blast from
Russia and China'.
Benn was not alone in his delusions. The recorded entry for October 21 1960
reads in full: 'Rang Audrey Callaghan. She said Jim was very depressed, but
had come back from Czechoslovakia convinced that socialism does work.'
He wrote of Harold Wilson in the same year: 'My contempt for him grew each
time I met him and I don't think that he has one-tenth the character of
Gaitskell.' That was in spite of the fact that Benn's opinion of Gaitskell,
character and otherwise, was low, except perhaps when Gaitskell was nice to
him.
The paradox was that in those days Benn seemed a rather moderate member of
the Labour party. Some of his friends and contemporaries were well to the
left of him: for instance, Woodrow Wyatt, Bob Mellish and George Thomas (now
Lord Tonypandy). Subsequently the others moved to the right; Benn is one of
the few figures in politics to have moved steadily leftwards as he grew
older.
There is perhaps a partial explanation in Years of Hope. Benn was very much
a child of his time. Public school and Oxford, he accepted the second world
war and his duty to volunteer. He trained as a pilot, longing to get into
battle. He used all the boyish RAF language like 'wizard' and 'wizzo'. He
chased the most obviously attractive girls without a great deal of success,
and had to remind himself to pursue someone more serious. When Noel Coward
came to visit the base in Rhodesia where he was stationed, Benn thought the
maestro's best line: 'Grandpa ate a large apple and made a rude noise in the
Methodist Chapel.'
His brother Mike was killed in action. Politics ran in the family. Both his
grandfather and his father were MPs. But there came a problem: the father,
William Wedgwood Benn, was a Labour minister who was sent to the House of
Lords in the days when peerages were only hereditary.
The young Tony (or James or Jiggs, as we now know he was called in his
youth) objected from the start, for it meant that at some stage he would
have to take the title and be ineligible for the House of Commons. In this
he had something in common with Lord Hailsham, who was also from a
long-standing political family and believed that it ought to be possible to
renounce a peerage in order to stay in elective politics.
As Benn tells here, he began working with Hailsham and a few other Tories
for reform in the early 1950s. Some Tories opposed it because they did not
want either Hailsham or Lord Home back in the Commons as rivals. When the
reform was finally achieved in 1963, one of the prime beneficiaries apart
from Benn was Home, who promptly became prime minister.
Benn and Hailsham had other affinities. There is an uncanny resemblance in
mood between these diaries and Hailsham's recent book, Values: Collapse and
Cure. Both are tales of postwar hopes not being realised: their restlessness
simply came out in different ways. It is striking, too, that several of
Benn's early political friends were Tories: Sir Edward Boyle especially, but
also Enoch Powell ('as a working-class Tory he has the social barrier to
overcome') and Edward Heath ('a most amiable and friendly soul').
Benn is sometimes too kind to tyrants. He had a love affair with the third
world, which he never wholly understood. But on the whole he likes rebels.
He writes of Violet Bonham Carter: 'She has a tremendous vitality and an
unparalleled enthusiasm for life. She belongs to the 'couldn't care more'
brigade.' Just like Benn, though there is another hero to the diaries. That
is Ruth Winstone who has edited the lot. She says that Years of Hope was the
most enjoyable task of all, and she may be right. Ms Winstone deserves a
medal.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Arts: The Tempest in Birmingham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is Birmingham our most colourblind and/or multicultural city? No British
ballet company makes more of the differing ethnic origins of its dancers
than the Birmingham Royal Ballet; and now Bill Alexander, artistic director
of the Birmingham Rep, is presenting a new production of The Tempest in
which Prospero, his daughter Miranda, his brother Antonio, and his spirit
Ariel are all played by black actors, and in which two magical masque
sequences are performed by Indian dancers in Indian style. So far so pc; but
colourblind casting is also, in this case, poetry-deaf.
For Alexander and Jeffery Kissoon, who plays Prospero here, this Tempest is
a sequel to last year's Othello, with which Alexander launched his new
regime at the Rep and in which Kissoon played the title role. He is a much
younger and more potent Prospero than we usually see; fine. But in all five
Shakespearian roles I have seen him play he has employed the same barking
delivery, the same avoidance of all legato connectiveness, the same false
stresses, the same blurrings of syllables, the same sudden shouts. I find
this casting insufferable.
There is novelty and some freshness in Rakie Ayola's childish, piping,
blinking, seemingly stupid Ariel, and in Ginny Holder's quiet but eager
Miranda; but neither speaks with any distinction. The best black
verse-speaker in the cast, however, is Tony Armatrading as Antonio; he
brings a nice cunning to the role. Likewise, there is novelty and freshness
in Piali Ray's use of Bharata Natyam style for the spirits' dances; but
there is little real pleasure to be had from watching any Indian dance
either on a sandy floor or to taped, and partly rock-based music (by
Jonathan Goldstein).
All this mars what might otherwise be a first-rate production. In all larger
matters, Alexander shows how well he understands this play. The initial
tempest - an eerie quiet, marked by the huge slow thudding of a heartbeat
and an occasional giant thunderclap and the noise of a colossal tidal wave
or two - is thrilling. Ruari Murchison's single set is marvellous, one vast
circle of sky at the back and another vast circle of white sand in the
centre, the rest being composed of black rock in which we see some of
Prospero's books sculpted. Costumes are Victorian; there is a feeling of a
19th-century Robinson Crusoe to it all that adds poetry and excitement.
Alexander imposes no specious concepts onto the play, and no cerebral
ornamentation; even Ariel's magical appearances are simply achieved. I would
say that this was a Tempest shaped by a deep and loving knowledge of the
text - were it not that the above-mentioned members of the cast too
frequently stop me from hearing the text.
It is a bore to have to say that the white comic actors make the most
successful impression, but it is so. Geoffrey Freshwater as Trinculo and
Andy Hockley as Stephano take complete charge of the play on their every
appearance. I do not care for the stunted way in which Andy Hockley speaks
Caliban's words (proceeding from his line to Prospero 'You taught me
language'), but he nonetheless gives Caliban a crude rage that is at once
funny and disturbing. This Tempest is on the verge of being vivid,
refreshing, and spontaneous. But that phrase 'You taught me language'
reminds me that Alexander knows more about the secrets of Shakespearian
language than he is teaching his actors.
Birmingham Rep until Oct 8.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Arts: A leaky 'Moby Dick' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Huston did it on film with Gregory Peck, Orson Welles on stage with
Joan Plowright, and Manchester achieved a notably blubbery coup de theatre
with it. Cameron Mackintosh came a cropper when he tried it in a girls'
school. Now Gerry Mulgrew has directed Herman Melville's haunting novel of
obsession and destiny, Moby Dick, with the Royal Shakespeare Company.
The production was reviewed in Stratford last November. Rumour has it that
fine-tuning, tweaking and general tinkering has taken place for its transfer
to the Barbican's Pit; perhaps too much since the piece stolidly refuses to
generate much theatrical tension.
Mulgrew was responsible for two of the liveliest offerings I have seen in
Scotland: Mary Queen of Scots Had Her Head Chopped Off and the wonderful
phantasmagoria of Scottish identity real and imagined, Jock Tamson's Bairns.
As with many of his compatriots, the journey south has tamed him.
As a director he may be uncertain how to take Rod Wooden's adaptation. The
writing sets off resonances, echoes and allusions - unwisely, since it fails
to stand the comparison with the sort of poetic prosody it sometimes aims
at. Chief sufferer is David Calder who brings a Shakespearian technique to
some sub-Shakespearian fustian interspersed with creaky metaphors - 'I
didn't stop to plug my leak' - that frequently send the dramatic craft
dipping into the brackish surge of bathos. The style varies between the
clotted poesy of fine writing and deliberate modernity. As the crew remarks
in true 19th-century fashion, 'It gives me the creeps'. As with the fountain
pen with which our story-teller (whose famous opening, 'Call me Ishmael', is
moved back) signs on, the effect is less universal than merely distracting.
The story may be timeless, but this implies freedom from such specific
details, not a constricting emphasis on them.
Writing and direction are at their most ambitious in the choral spoken
passages that go on too long, just as the boy Pip (played with passionate
relish by Lloyd Notice) has at least one Ophelia-like mad scene too much.
Karen Tennent's design dangles ropes from above around which the cast
clusters in sculptural groups. This encourages the cult of the picturesque,
notably in the case of Christopher Colqhoun's African-toned Queequeg, a
designer savage given to posing as if displaying the latest gay leisure
wear. The sacrifice of coherence to imagery is seen during a storm, where
two figures are pulling on one rope - in different directions.
The final use of a billowing white sheet to cover the stage is impressive
though, in the words of Porgy and Bess, it takes a long haul to get there.
Calder's Captain Ahab, a few weevils short of a ship's biscuit, is powerful
enough in a yo-ho-ho sort of way to make one want to see his Long John
Silver; a character a great deal more varied and complex than the stumping
ranter at the centre of this production. Melville's damned existentialism
has leaked, unplugged, away on the voyage from the Avon to the Thames. As
the Scottish crew member remarks, 'So many nice intelligent people doing
nice intelligent things. Look what a mess it's got the world into]' Oh come
on, chaps: this is the man who wrote Billy Budd.

There is a lot of ambulance chasing on television today: 999 Lifesavers at
8.00 on BBC1 is followed by Blues And Twos on ITV at 8.30. And in case you
still feel deprived of material about the emergency services, in Critical
Eye, on Channel 4 (9.00), policewomen speak their minds about 'the gender
war behind the thin blue line' and Inside Story is about a police squad
hunting for stolen cars (10.00 BBC1). Radio 4 offers an enticing evening.
The Document series returns with a programme about 'The Voice Of Britain',
described as 'Goebbels-style broadcasts' to Egypt at the time of the Suez
fiasco (7.20). That is followed by Entente Cordiale in which Sir Charles
Powell, foreign affairs adviser to Margaret Thatcher, examines relations
between the UK and France (8.00). In Classic Storylines PD James, famous for
her own whodunnits, discusses
the book often credited with being the first detective story: The Moonstone
by Wilkie Collins (8.30). A new six-part drama series starring Donald
Pleasence begins at 11.00:
21st Century Blues, was written by Steve Walker, who is best known for the
children's series The Animals Of Farthing Wood.

PEEPING TOM (18) Michael Powell
Clear and Present Danger is Hollywood's third attempt to translate Tom
Clancy's capacious, flag-waving novels to the screen. It is by far the best.
Leaner than The Hunt for Red October and less ludicrous than Patriot Games,
Phillip Noyce's lively adaptation is pure popular entertainment -
unabashedly corny, expertly paced and thoroughly watchable.
This time around, true blue CIA agent Jack Ryan (the ageless Harrison Ford)
finds himself combating Colombian drug lords after they kill a close friend
of the US president. Needless to say, he soon finds himself in the thick of
a tangled plot involving laundered money, covert operations and governmental
corruption. After a series of bloodbaths and double crosses, Ryan is put to
the most critical test of all for a true patriot - he is asked by his
commander-in-chief to tell a lie.
Director Noyce makes none of the mistakes in pacing and credibility that
marred his Patriot Games, concocting instead a film whose strong suit is its
simplicity. There are no grey areas here - one is either dedicated to
stamping out the drug-dealing vermin from south of the border, or one winds
up in bed with them. Aided by an exceptionally lucid script (partially
written by the legendary John Milius), Noyce is able to create a number of
engrossing set pieces, most memorably a shootout on a narrow Bogota street
that should become a standard of the genre. There are also two nifty
sequences in which US government agents and drugs cartel gangsters are shown
to be using the exact same computer technology as they do combat.
Ford is his usual stolid self, managing to keep his dignity while uttering
lines that George Washington might have blanched at. Willem Dafoe,
meanwhile, is just the man to play a cynical CIA operative, while Donald
Moffat is a spineless president for our time. Even Anne Archer, in the
monumentally thankless royal of Ryan's long-suffering surgeon wife, fares
better than before.
If the film has a flaw, it is its refusal to question Clancy's boyish
admiration for the capabilities of the American military. As much as one
wishes that we really did live in a world where the US army could conduct
operations against drug-pushing bad guys that did not result in spectacular
air crashes, civilian atrocities and friendly fire casualties, it is hard to
square Clancy's world-view with that offered on the nightly news.
While Noyce's film relies on an unwavering view of narcotics as the devil's
own candy for its plot dynamics, Richard Linklater peddles a far softer line
in his delightful Dazed and Confused. Set on the last day of high school in
a suburban Texas town in 1976, Linklater's second feature virtually floats
on a cloud of marijuana smoke. Nearly everyone except the local cops and the
fascistic football coach can be seen toking on reefer or bong at some point.
As with his memorable debut Slacker, Linklater largely foregoes plot,
focusing on the development of character and atmosphere through a steady
accretion of humorous and spot-on detail. The film bears a certain
resemblance to American Grafitti in this regard, with its parade of
souped-up cars, not-so-naive girls, hormonally charged boys and a nostalgic
soundtrack. But where George Lucas's film peddled a myth of American youth
as a bunch of basically wholesome kids out for some kicks, Linklater's
subsequent generation are thoroughly alienated from their society. His
accomplishment is to avoid pathos or gloom in portraying them, opting
instead for an anarchic humour that actually makes one pine for those
teenage days of pimply angst and pubescent insecurity.
The combination of French New Wave director and a Scarborough playwright who
specialises in very British comedies of manners might seem an odd coupling,
though Alain Resnais and Alan Ayckbourn have more in common than just a
Christian name. Both have shown a marked tendency to juggle and bend the
flow of time in their work, Resnais through mind-boggling films like Last
Year at Marienbad, Ayckbourn with conundrum plays such as How the Other Half
Lives. It is hardly surprising, then, that the value of their first
collaboration should be primarily as an exercise in style, fascinating in
its technical details but sorely lacking as a human drama. Smoking/No
Smoking, which can either be consumed as two long films or one very long
epic, is surely the only movie to appear this year whose press release
contains a flow chart to aid viewing.
Based upon Ayckbourn's play cycle Intimate Exchanges, the film is set the
small Yorkshire town of Hutton Buscel. Its central characters are a drunken
headmaster at the local school, his lonely wife, his best friend, his
cutaway spouse, a gardener and a housekeeper. The action involves various
dalliances and couplings among them, each of which blossoms into a series of
permutations when time is reversed and characters are allowed to remake key
choices. Hence the binary title, which alludes to the first key decision:
the headmistresses's wife initially indulges her desire for a cigarette and
then decides not to have one, thereby setting in motion two entirely
different chains of events.
What is notable about the film is its labyrinthian overall structure, which
should keep chess enthusiasts and maze wanderers enthralled for the nearly
five hours of viewing. Sabine Azema and Pierre Arditi, who between them play
all the roles, are at times inspired and always resourceful. But the film
suffers from its overall length and its meagre, stage-bound look. And
Resnais never really answers the key question that arises after a few hours
of viewing - so what? A pall of randomness hangs over the whole enterprise.
The resulting malaise makes Smoking/No Smoking a bit of a drag.
Attending this week's London press showing of the reissue of Michael
Powell's Peeping Tom is like revisiting the scene of a lynching carried out
by ones ancestors. It has been 34 years since British critics gave the film
such a mercilessly hysterical drubbing that its maker, doubtlessly one of
the greats of our national cinema, never really worked on these shores
again. Since then, with the famous intervention of Martin Scorsese, who
rescued the print from destruction, this disturbing story about a young
murderer who photographs his victims at the moment of their death has gone
on to be recognised as the masterpiece it always was.
Meanwhile, the 51st Venice Film Festival went out to the sound of frantic
stitchings and compromisings in the jury room, writes Nigel Andrews. The
Golden Lion was shared between two films neither of which was expected to
win - Micho Malchevski's Before The Rain from Macedonia and Tsai
Ming-Liang's Long Live Love from Taiwan - but which spaned audience taste
from the panoramic-political (Malchevski's study of war's reverberations
across a continent) to the intimist-experimental.
Tsai's film, reported on by me last week, is by far the superior work: a
near-abstract chamber drama of crisscrossing lives with a dazzlingly fresh -
and funny - approach to narrative. Oliver Stone's kaleidoscopic Natural Born
Killers was also rewarded for stylistic originality, winning the Special
Jury Prize.
The lower reaches of the trophy list were chaotic, if not sometimes
incomprehensible. Three Silver Lions were shared out between two indifferent
films - Italy's Il Toro (The Bull) and America's Little Odessa - and a
one-time favourite for gold, New Zealand's Heavenly Creatures. Four acting
awards went to performers that few of us had shortlisted, including Vanessa
Redgrave's blink-and-you-miss-it role as a dying Russian-American immigrant
in Little Odessa. And two filmmakers felt to have been in with a shot at the
top prize were fobbed off with Best Director (Italy's Gianni Amelio for
Lamerica) and Best Screenplay (Spain's Bigas Luna for The Tit And The Moon).
The festival itself was as confusing as the prizes. It began badly, rallied
for a week of high quality, then collapsed again. We know that Venice has
money problems, but money alone does not explain a European film spree that
is so inconsistent in its choice of competition movies (high-budget,
low-budget; experimental, conventional); and that can summon and accommodate
more Hollywood stars than you will ever find in the average Cannes festival
 -this year Harrison Ford, Jack Nicholson, Michael Douglas, Al Pacino,
Arnold Schwarzenegger . . . - while behaving like the poor man of
Euro-cinema to all its other guests and participants.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Technology: A question of numbers - The difficulties with
demographic data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If anyone at the Cairo conference on population and development needed to be
reminded that the world's population is growing, a 'clock' in the centre of
the exhibition hall kept ticking, registering more than one birth every
second.
Projections by the United Nations - that the total will nearly double from
5.7bn to 10bn by the middle of the next century - were the only part of the
conference text which was not debated, as 180 countries wrestled to agree on
family planning policy. Yet how reliable are the projections?
It is not just UN initiatives which depend on the figures' accuracy. The
International Development Association, an arm of the World Bank, employs
economic criteria such as per capita income when deciding whether to grant a
country concessional loans.
Joseph Chamie, director of the UN's population division, adds that many
businesses are affected by demographic trends. 'If I were a car manufacturer
I'd be busy now designing cars so that older people could get into them,' he
says, referring to the ageing populations of industrialised countries.
But demographers face formidable obstacles in gathering accurate data on
population size. Governments sometimes distort figures to influence
elections, they say.
Some countries in the Middle East have not always counted births and deaths
among their immigrant worker populations. In some societies 'people don't
know how old they are', says Tom Merrick, senior population adviser for the
World Bank, which runs separate models from those of the UN. In some
regions, age distribution data can be distorted because girls are
categorised according to whether or not they have reached puberty.
However, both Merrick and Chamie argue that the quality of the raw data on
current population size has greatly improved in recent years. According to
Merrick, the estimate of 5.7bn is accurate 'to within tens of millions'.
Past census data from some African countries, in particular Nigeria, have
been unreliable, he says, although Nigeria's 1991 census, which yielded a
lower total than expected, is now regarded by demographers as sound.
Countries with large populations such as China and India have 'pretty good'
censuses, says Merrick.
Because the data are improving, demographers have found the predictive power
of demographic models to be good so far. In 1950 the UN estimated that the
world's population would be 6.3bn in 2000; its latest figures suggest around
6bn. But all acknowledge the difficulties in predicting the future. The
models are sensitive to assumptions about whether family sizes will continue
to fall as they have been doing in most countries for the last 15 years. The
UN projections for 2050 range from 7.8bn to 12.5bn on only tiny variations
in those assumptions.
However, delegates at the conference, which ended this week, advanced many
competing theories about why parents choose to have smaller families. Twenty
years ago, the slogan 'development is the best contraception' was the
favourite theory, but at Cairo demographers emphasised ease of access to
contraception or better education for women.
Moreover, the models cannot take account of future development of new
contraceptive techniques. According to Chamie, 'the Pill made a tremendous
difference on fertility, as did the intra-uterine device and injectible
contraceptives. They separate the act of sex from the decision to use a
contraceptive, unlike condoms for example'.
Demographers' models have spelled out to governments that they have reason
to worry about population growth, and to move fast on improving family
planning services.
The best tribute to the demographers' efforts will be if governments act so
quickly that predictions of the world's population in the next century prove
too high.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Technology: Treating pills like plastic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
German chemicals group BASF is using its plastics manufacturing technologies
to improve the way its pharmaceuticals subsidiary makes medicines. The
company says the change saves time, materials and floor space to the tune of
more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m) a year, the equivalent to having
developed a successful new drug.
It should also improve the effectiveness of the drugs, says BASF, by better
controlling the way the active ingredients leave the tablet and enter the
bloodstream.
Traditionally, pills are made in several stages, the active ingredients
being made successively into granules, pellets and shaped tablets.
BASF replaces that sequence with a single process in which the active
ingredients are melted and extruded as a pliable strand, passed through
rollers and chopped into tablets. The problem is that drugs are usually
crystalline powders, lacking the elasticity of plastics.
BASF's answer was to find a polymer that dissolves the powder when melted.
As the polymer hardens the powder remains in what BASF calls a 'solid
solution' and can be manipulated like a plastic.
By reducing three processes to one, BASF's new pill-making method cuts the
floor space required for manufacturing by three quarters. And by dissolving
the powder into the pill material, the company reduces the need to deal with
the potentially polluting solvents that are used in the traditional
three-stage process.
Finally, the medication can be improved because the polymer is designed to
release the medicine slowly into the body. This controlled-release mechanism
allows for higher doses to be administered and means patients need take
tablets less often.
BASF believes that the process will bring it contract manufacturing
business. The first extruded medicines should reach the market within two or
three years.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Technology: Magnetic attraction - Swiss plans for an
underground rail system will take engineers into unexplored territory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Swiss are not known for wild leaps into the frontiers of technology, so
it came as a surprise last year when the federal government and 80 Swiss
companies put up SFr14m (Pounds 6.8m) to finance a feasibility study for an
underground high-speed magnetic levitation (maglev) train system.
Called Swissmetro, the project, initially proposed in the 1970s by a
Lausanne engineer, proposes the construction of 315km of dual tunnels from
Geneva to St Gallen and from Basle to Bellinzona.
The atmospheric pressure in the 5m-diameter tunnels would be substantially
lowered so that air resistance to the trains' movement would be reduced. The
trains' 200m-long vehicles would then have to be pressurised - they are like
'aeroplanes without wings and tails' according to one engineer - to support
human life.
Theoretically, the maglev trains, driven by linear motors, could reach
speeds of 500kmh, although the planners foresee a constant speed of about
380kmh. At that speed, the trip from Geneva to Zurich could be reduced to 57
minutes, compared with the current three-hour train journey.
This sounds appealing, not least because the entire infrastructure would be
'several tens of metres' underground, minimising environmental impacts.
Swissmetro backers knew there would be no chance of winning approval for
additional surface infrastructure on Switzerland's densely populated
northern plateau.
By having the trains run within tunnels in a partial vacuum, Swissmetro
would substantially avoid the problems of air resistance that bedevil all
very high-speed transport. In Switzerland, these problems would be magnified
because of the need to have frequent tunnels due to the mountainous terrain.
The project plan calls for reducing air pressure in the tunnels to between 1
per cent and 10 per cent of normal atmospheric pressure, the equivalent of
the atmosphere at between 20,000m and 40,000m above the earth. The
consequent reduction in resistance is also expected to bring significant
energy savings.
The plan proposes twin tunnels, not only to eliminate the risk of head-on
collisions, but also to avoid the air pressure effects - pressure change and
vibration - when trains pass each other in a tunnel. Maglev trains hover
only 20mm above the track, so even minor jolting could cause problems.
Maglev technology is fairly well established, with Germany and Japan the
most active developers. In March, the German government approved
construction of the world's first commercial maglev train to run from Berlin
to Hamburg in less than one hour. The project will cost an estimated DM8.9bn
(Pounds 3.67bn).
In Japan, a Japan Railways experimental maglev train achieved a speed of
423kmh on a test track in February, although plans for a prototype line near
Tokyo have been delayed by difficulties in obtaining land.
All projects and experiments so far have been aimed at developing
above-ground, open-air systems. The Swiss project, by going completely
underground, moves into unexplored territory and raises questions in at
least three important areas:
Aerodynamic behaviour at high speed in a tunnel. How much free space must
there be between the train and the walls of the tunnel? How much vibration
will there be?
Air-tightness of a very large tunnel structure. What materials need to be
used to ensure that a partial vacuum can be maintained? Swiss scientists say
it could be achieved with a steel tube, but at a very high price. They are
working on solutions using concrete with various chemical coatings.
What are the thermal effects caused by the activity within the tunnel?
Yves Trottet, co-ordinator of the project at the Federal Institute of
Technology in Lausanne, says there are no answers to these questions at the
moment. No one has ever attempted a project of this scale with these
characteristics.
All these elements also have implications for operational safety, including,
for example, how to deal with a loss of pressurisation in the train and how
to evacuate a train in an emergency. The present thinking is that a train
must be able to advance to the next station under its own power if
necessary.
As part of the feasibility process, the scientists in Lausanne and a sister
institute in Zurich, together with the relevant Swiss industrial companies,
will be studying these issues as well as those related to maglev over the
next three years.
Trottet says computer simulations can provide some answers, but physical
testing will also be necessary. Later this year, the Lausanne institute
intends to build a scale model tunnel for tests. It will probably be 300m in
length with a 25cm diameter.
The economics of the Swissmetro project are contentious. The preliminary
study published last year estimated that the Geneva-St Gallen line would
cost SFr13.1bn and take eight years to build. Feasibility claims were based
in part on assumptions of large numbers of people abandoning conventional
trains and their cars in favour of Swissmetro.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (6): Invisible barriers start to
fall - North/South trade / Trade links are expected to be substantially
improved over the next five years as they are a priority in the Republic's
IRPounds 7bn National Development Plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Trade between Northern Ireland and its nearest neighbour, the Republic of
Ireland, is abnormally low - and skewed heavily in favour of the Republic.
Northern Ireland's exports to the Republic represent just under eight per
cent of the total. Goods and services flowing the other way represent about
six per cent of the Republic's total exports.
The north's main exports to the Republic are live animals and food products,
including beverages, which accounted for around 40 per cent of the Pounds
468m exported in 1992. Other leading exports include fertiliser, textiles
and clothing.
Food products and live animals account for around 46 per cent of Northern
Ireland's imports from the Republic, which were Pounds 825m in 1992.
Manufactured goods, including chemicals, industrial machinery and road
vehicles, accounted for 47 per cent of imports.
The reasons for the low level of trade are both infrastructural and
historical. The antipathy of certain parts of the Northern Irish business
community to trading with the Republic, and the apprehension of companies in
the Republic about trading in Northern Ireland, are widely acknowledged, but
unquantifiable.
Current political developments may go a long way towards breaking down these
invisible trade barriers and complement the efforts made in recent years to
overcome the tangible, infrastructural barriers.
Over the last three years the two leading business organisations in Ireland,
the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland, and the Irish
Business and Employers Confederation (Ibec) in the Republic, have undertaken
a number of joint initiatives aimed at boosting cross border trade.
Between them, Ibec and the CBI represent 4,000 companies and around 90 per
cent of manufacturing jobs in Ireland. The advent of the single market in
1992 is seen by many as the catalyst that led the two organisations to look
at ways of overcoming obstacles to trade.
The single market swept away the biggest of the the physical obstacles:
delays at the border for customs and security checks could at one time add
up to five hours to the three-hour journey between between Belfast and
Dublin.
The CBI and Ibec established a joint council in 1991, which drew up a three
year North-South market development programme.
The programme set out to address what the joint council perceived to be the
four biggest obstacles to trade, according to Mr William Poole, the
Confederation of British Industry's director of business development for
Ireland.
The biggest problem, according to Mr Poole, was the lack of available
information, in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, about opportunities
on the other side of the border.
The second main obstacle was perceived to be the poor state of road and rail
links between the two parts of Ireland.
The two other big problems identified by the joint council were the sort
that would be associated with any export market: the risk of adverse
currency movements and the difficulties of pursuing payment in a different
jurisdiction.
The problem of lack of information was addressed through the collation and
dissemination of as much information as was available, and the organisation
of contact meetings for various industry sectors.
'The core of activity was to bring together companies from North and South,
matching buyers with sellers and identifying and promoting market
opportunities,' explains Mr Poole.
In total, 25 meetings were held, involving 530 companies split more or less
evenly between Northern Ireland and the Republic.
'The key sectors in which we believed cross border trade could be encouraged
were textiles, food, engineering - including software - and selling to the
public sector,' Mr Poole explained.
The programme has been highly successful and highlighted the potential for
increased cross border trade, Mr Poole maintains. Six Northern Irish food
companies won orders worth Pounds 386,000, while four engineering companies
have got Pounds lm worth of business.
More than 60 sales leads and Pounds 390,000 worth of business were generated
by the software companies which took part in the programme, he adds.
The joint council is now completing a second programme, which will run for
five years and look particularly at the possibility of increasing
cross-border trade by small businesses, which are seen as vital creators of
new jobs. Northern Ireland's small business sector represents the province's
best opportunity for job creation and economic expansion.
'In marketing terms, it makes sound business sense to look at developing
export business with a trading partner on our doorstep,' explains Mr Bill
Jeffrey, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses in Northern Ireland.
The joint council also commissioned management consultants to produce a
study on the potential for the development of an economic corridor between
Dublin and Belfast, and this is due for publication shortly.
Such a scheme has been mooted by businessmen for many years, with estimates
of the number of jobs it could create ranging from 7,000 to 70,000. The
report is expected to highlight once again problems in the area of
infrastructural links between Northern Ireland and the Republic.
The links, however, are expected to be substantially improved over the next
five years as they are a priority in the Republic's IRPounds 7bn National
Development Plan for spending the next tranche of European Union structural
funds.
The report is also expected to show that 'what is really lacking is normal
relationships between companies because of a lack of interaction,' explains
Mr Geoff MacEnroe, the director of IBEC's North-South Business Development
Programme.
The development of a corridor would give Northern Ireland companies better
access to the island's largest concentration of consumers, in Dublin and its
surrounding towns. Such a corridor might go some way to to help redress
Northern Ireland's trade deficit, which is a relatively recent development.
In 1981, Northern Ireland actually enjoyed a small, Pounds 2m trade surplus
with the Republic.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (9): Busy highway to Europe - A
thousand cars a day pass through Larne port
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of the elderly visitors to Northern Ireland arriving through Larne
might remember the port from their World War Two days, writes Tim Coone.
The huge logistical task of rapidly embarking hundreds of thousands of
troops and tens of thousands of vehicles for the Normandy invasion in 1944
was tackled by routing part of the invasion force through Larne, making use
of its ramp loading facilities - then almost unique - which allowed vehicles
to be driven directly aboard the ships used for the invasion.
Today, the same technique is allowing a different kind of invasion to take
place: Larne now handles an average of 1,000 cars a day - 85 per cent of
Northern Ireland's tourist traffic. Last year, 1.8m passengers travelled
through the port, slightly more than the population of Northern Ireland
itself. Moreover, Larne is now the principal roll-on-roll-off (ro-ro)
freight port for Ireland handling an average of 550 container vehicles every
day in each direction. In the UK, this makes it is second only to Dover.
For Ireland's food industry and the growing number of companies following
just-in-time manufacturing techniques that have chosen either the province
or the Republic to locate their factories to supply the European market,
Larne port is a vital link between them and their customers, some of which
are located in the heart of Europe.
Mr Denis Galway, the port's director and general manager, said that the
frequency of sailings from the port and the short sea crossings enabled a
road haulier to have a 40-ft trailer load 'in Paris within 24 hours and well
into Germany in 48 hours.'
Four ro-ro routes now operate between Larne and the British mainland,
offering hauliers a choice of 18 sailings each way daily, evenly staggered
throughout the day and night. Four ro-ro jetties, three with double ramps
and the fourth recently having undergone a Pounds 7m improvement, ensure a
rapid turnaround for the ferries and little delay for the hauliers.
Individual loads of up to 180 tonnes can be accommodated.
Half of the cargo handled through the port is perishable, such as meat and
dairy products and fresh vegetables - 'speedy delivery for these is
essential. With the frequency of sailings from here we can ensure that these
products can leave Larne in the evening and be on supermarket shelves in
Britain first thing in the morning,' says Mr Galway.
Fruit of the Loom, the US clothing manufacturer, supplies the European
market from factories located on both sides of the Irish border, using Larne
as its main port to Britain and beyond.
Mr Tony O'Reilly, the chairman of the Heinz food corporation, has cited
Larne port as one of the reasons for locating a new pizza-topping factory
for the UK market in Ireland rather than in England or Wales.
According to Mr Galway, more than 20 per cent of traffic through the port
originates in, or is destined for, the Irish Republic.
The completion of the cross-harbour road and rail link in Belfast in
February next year will finally connect Larne and the north-east of the
province with the rail network throughout Ireland, opening up further
possibilities of attracting new freight and passenger traffic to the port
from the Republic.
A rail freight terminal at the port has been proposed, while the passenger
terminal is already one of the best and newest on the west of the Irish Sea
offering airport-type facilities for passengers. Bus and rail services
operate directly from the terminal. Even the personal hygiene of sweaty
lorry drivers has been catered for - a special rest and shower room has been
provided for them at the passenger terminal.
Adjacent to the port, and owned by it, a 100-acre site is now being offered
in lots of up to 10 acres for development which Mr Galway believes will be
attractive to manufacturers and wholesale distributors looking for a
location from where to supply their markets efficiently.
A new era of competition for Larne began recently, though, with the
appearance of new shipping on the Irish Sea. The Seacat service to Belfast,
with its fast crossing times, has been able to take around 15 per cent of
the tourist traffic into the province in the past two years. In 1993, Stena
Sealink also opened up a new Seacat service from Holyhead to Dun Laoghaire
(near Dublin), with an Irish Sea crossing time of only one and half hours
(compared with two and half hours from Larne to Stranraer).
Mr Galway acknowledges the threat but he says: 'We are not afraid of
competition. We believe we can compete on price, and the evidence shows that
ferry operators here have sustained their market share.'

FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (7): The textile base remains
strong - Ulster companies are leading suppliers to British retail chains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCMANUS

<TEXT>
Pyjamas and tights may not have the glamour of haute couture, but the
manufacture of these staple items of clothing for British retailers, such as
Marks &amp; Spencer, keep more than 16,000 people in work in Northern Ireland.
Garment manufacturing is now the most important sector of Northern Ireland's
textile industry, itself the most significant manufacturing sector in
employment terms, with annual sales exceeding Pounds lbn.
Out of around 100,000 manufacturing jobs in Northern Ireland, around 26,000
are in the textiles industry, of which garment manufacture accounts for
around 16,000. An additional 10,000 people are employed indirectly by the
textile industry.
The strength of Northern Ireland's garment industry is due to a combination
of factors: the historically strong textile industry base; the growth of the
British chain stores; and the high level of government support available
since the start of the troubles 25 years ago. The skilled workforce and
infrastructure developed by the linen industry allowed Northern
Ireland-based garment manufactures to start supplying British retail chains,
and to grow with them as they came to dominate the clothing market in
Britain.
'Chain stores account for 60 per cent of clothing sales in Britain and
provide the volume demand required by manufacturers to achieve economies of
scale,' explains Mr Bruce Robinson, the deputy chief executive of Northern
Ireland's development agency, the Industrial Development Board(IDB).
The generous level of capital grants available in Northern Ireland over the
last two decades - up to 40 per cent more than in the UK - has meant that
local companies have been able to equip themselves with the expensive
machinery needed to supply products of the quality required by chain stores.
Northern Ireland's garment manufacturers would prefer to explain their
success in terms of increased competitiveness.
'Our competitive edge is better design, a very close relationship with the
customer, and a quick response time,' explains Mr Sean O'Dwyer, the managing
director of Desmonds, a supplier to Marks and Spencer, which employs 2,700
people, making nightwear and other clothing. Northern Ireland-based
suppliers, such as Desmonds, offer British retailers the facility to drop
unsuccessful lines in mid-season and increase production of successful ones,
so that they avoid being left with surplus stock at the end of the season.
Although Far Eastern manufacturers might be more competitive on a cost
basis, they are at a severe disadvantage when it comes to response time. The
only way in which they can match Northern Ireland based suppliers is to
air-freight their products, which is prohibitively expensive. It is an
advantage which Desmonds has successfully exploited.
Expansion plans
The family-owned firm started supplying Marks and Spencer 40 years ago, and
now sells the chain store about Pounds 100m worth of clothing a year -
'we're pretty confident that we can increase output. By 1998 we plan to have
increased volume by 40 per cent,' comments Mr O'Dywer. Desmonds plans to
invest about Pounds 5m under the expansion plan creating a further 600 jobs.
The outlook for the garment sector is better now than it was ten years ago,
believes Mr Terry McCartney, the chief executive of Charnos, which has
extensive textiles interest in Northern Ireland through its Adria
subsidiary.
'We have seen the industry being weakened by cheap imports, but I think that
is changing and we are winning back market share through the quality of our
service and design,' he explains. Adria, which produces branded and
own-brand hosiery and lingerie for UK retailers has increased employment by
250 this year, opening a Pounds 5.4m lingerie factory in Derry. The company
plans to open a new hosiery knitting factory in Strabane this year and hopes
to employ over 1,500 people in Northern Ireland by the end of 1996.
The garment industry's strength is not reflected in other parts of the
industry, however - particularly carpet-making. Last month, textile group
Richards announced it was closing its carpet-making subsidiary in Bangor,
Spence Bryson, with the loss of 175 jobs. The closure was blamed on fierce
competition in the UK carpet market.
'The performance of the carpet industry is linked to activity at retail
level and the number of new housing starts,' according to Mr Desmond Morgan
of the Northern Ireland Textile Association - 'these have been very slow to
pick up and matters have not been helped by the entry into the UK market of
the US carpet giant, Shaw International.'
Textile yarns and fabric are a very important sector of the industry in
Northern Ireland and are set to become more so with the decision of
Taiwanese group, Hualon, to set up near Belfast. Although questions have
been raised about the appropriateness of the decision to give Pounds 61m in
grants to Hualon, the 1,800 jobs which the project will create in Belfast
are very welcome.
The fully integrated textile plant will dye, finish, weave and spin nylon,
cotton and polyester-cotton fabrics.
Other textile companies such as cotton spinners and weavers, Fruit of the
Loom and Courtaulds Textiles, form the second largest sector in the textile
industry in employment terms, accounting for the bulk of non-garment
employment.
The linen industry remains a significant employer, although it underwent
rationalisation in the mid-1960s and 1970s. Northern Irish linen
manufacturers, who produce about 20 per cent of Europe's linen, have been
forced to move away from their traditional market, which was household
fabrics. However, the return to fashion of natural fabrics, has given linen
spinners a new lease of life in export markets.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (8): A sombre message -
Shipbuilding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In popular perceptions of Northern Ireland, the two huge gantry cranes at
the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast loom as large as an Ulster fried
breakfast or the booming voice of the Rev Ian Paisley.
But while neither of the latter are likely to diminish in volume or
disappear from the Northern Ireland scene in the coming few years, the same
could not be said with total certainty of the shipyard.
The Harland and Wolff cranes, once the most potent symbol of Northern
Ireland's manufacturing industry, may become redundant by the end of next
year if the shipyard is unable to win new orders in the face of increasingly
stiff international competition.
The hull of the last order on the yard's books - a Capesize bulk carrier -
is taking shape on the floor of the main building dock, one of the largest
building docks in the world, designed to accomodate vessels up to 1.2m tons
dwt, twice the size of the largest ship ever built.
The last ship is a relatively modest 162,000 dwt Capesize bulk carrier, but
is one of a new generation of bulk carriers and tankers featuring enhanced
structural and safety features in which H&amp;W now specialises.
Mr Per Neilsen, chief executive of the Harland and Wolff group, estimates
that as many as 600 'newbuildings' of ships over 100,000 tons dwt will be
required over the next five to six years - the category in which H&amp;W
specialises.
Some 25m tons of bulk carriers and tankers are now on order around the
world. The H&amp;W yard has a capacity to build between four and six such ships
per year, so the Belfast builder would be aiming to win only around 5 per
cent of all orders worldwide, not - it would seem - an impossible task.
Mr Neilsen points out though that world shipyard capacity is growing and
that there have been big productivity increases in existing yards, 'there is
more than enough capacity to meet the demand for renewing the fleet.'
The problem for H&amp;W, which reported an operating loss of Pounds 10.1m for
1993, is that direct and indirect subsidies paid to competing shipbuilders
overseas 'including several countries in the EC' is making it impossible for
the Belfast yard to compete on price, despite large productivity increases
that have been achieved in recent years. 'We can compete on cost with the
best shipbuilders around. We have the cheapest overheads compared to similar
shipyards,' he claims.
Since the yard was privatised in 1989, productivity has doubled. The number
of man-hours required to produce a Capesize ship has been cut in half he
said, and overall workforce numbers in the shipbuilding division have been
cut from 2,850 to 1,400.
'We've done everything that has been asked of us through the privatisation,'
he says.
Restrictive work practices have been eliminated, flexible work hours have
been introduced, labour costs have been sharply reduced, and great emphasis
is laid on quality control - 'the employees have been prepared to take up
the challenge' he says. A technical co-operation programme has been in
operation for several years with Kawasaki Industries in Japan, and the
management style at the yard is now largely modelled on the Japanese system.
At the same time the yard has given wholehearted support to the government's
policy to eliminate all shipbuilding subsidies. But Mr Neilsen now wants the
government to either improve ship financing facilities through the
government-run Ship Finance Mortgage Corporation (SMFC) or to tackle more
effectively those countries that continue to provide direct or indirect
subsidies to their shipyards.
He says the norm for many foreign shipyards is to offer finance guarantees
for up to 80 per cent of the cost of construction, repayable over 12-15
years through government-backed finance schemes. In the US, ship finance is
available for up to 87.5 per cent of cost, repayable over 25 years, if a
shipowner uses a US yard. In the UK, the SMFC offers only 30-60 per cent of
the capital cost payable over 8.5 years.
Mr Neilsen says that using the SMFC scheme, a shipowner would be likely to
face a negative cash flow for the first seven years of operation, making it
uneconomic to build new tonnage in a UK yard - 'it will not matter how good
our productivity is if the builder cannot finance the ship. An owner needs a
lot of cash to build at H&amp;W'
There has been sympathy expressed in Whitehall, he says, but so far this has
not resulted in action: 'If the government isn't prepared to listen to us,
then clearly we will have to go in another direction and rethink our support
for a 'no-subsidy' policy.'
'I used to be an optimist. But I feel it is going to be difficult to compete
commercially if we are not playing on a level field with our competitors. It
is going to be extremely difficult to be in business in the longer term.'
It is a sombre message coming from one of Northern Ireland's oldest and most
famous industries. And hardly one likely to bring cheer to those problem
areas of Belfast where unemployment in some neighbourhoods such as the Lower
Falls Road or Sandy Row is higher than 60 per cent.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (5): Good news for Belfast
planners - Property market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement last week by Hilton International of its plans to build a
Pounds 17m (Dollars 26.35m) 187-room luxury hotel alongside the Lagan river
in Belfast, could not have come at a better moment for the city's
development planners.
Coinciding as it does with the IRA ceasefire and growing hopes that an end
to the 25 years of troubles in the province may have finally arrived, the
property market in Northern Ireland, may soon be facing a boom of the
economic rather than the Semtex variety.
The Belfast Hilton will help anchor a planned Pounds 130m investment scheme
in the Laganbank development site just 500 metres from the City Hall and
main shopping centre. This will include a Pounds 29m 2,250-seat concert hall
and conference centre and some 450,000 sq ft of new office space, as well as
commercial premises for pubs and restaurants.
The Laganbank site itself is part of a much larger redevelopment scheme
taking place alongside the entire tidal reach of the Lagan river, which
divides Belfast in two. The completion in March this year of the Lagan weir,
close to the Hilton site, has turned the Lagan river - formerly a somewhat
ugly and smelly tidal estuary - into an attractive lake amenity to which
waterfowl, windsurfers, and wayfarers have already begun to gravitate.
Mr Mike Smith, the director of development at Laganside Corporation, the
body responsible for developing the various sites along the river, said he
is expecting the announcement of the first phase of the office development
at the Laganbank site to be made shortly.
The Pounds 10m sale earlier this year of the Abercorn Centre, a 65,000 sq ft
office block, to First Trust Bank, has meant that 'there is no longer any
modern office space unlet in Belfast,' he said. Moreover, areas around
Queen's university, hitherto favoured by professional firms of lawyers,
accountants and consultants, are becoming congested and are extremely short
of car parking space. Laganside Corporation is therefore hoping to attract
some of these firms to the Clarendon Dock site which is being refurbished
with Pounds 4m in EU funds.
Mr Barry Gilligan, the chief executive of Ewart plc, the Belfast-based
property development company which is jointly building the new hotel with
the Hilton group, says that office rents are in the region of Pounds 8-9 per
sq ft, equivalent to some provincial cities on the mainland - 'around Pounds
9 is break-even for any new office development, and given that there is now
no new office space in the city, we should be able to see a new development
shortly,' he says.
Figures from the valuation and lands agency show that 1.6m of the 5.6m sq ft
total of office space in Belfast is of top quality and built to modern, high
specifications, but that there is nothing available in units in excess of
50,000 sq ft and very few units from 20,000-50,000 sq ft.
The first phase of the anticipated Laganbank development will involve the
construction of 150,000 sq ft of office space. There is a market take-up of
space of 200,000 sq ft per year, according to Ewart, down considerably from
some 750,000 sq ft per year in the late 1980s when government offices were
taking the bulk of that through relocation schemes. But this should be
sufficient to make the ongoing development of the site feasible - 'with the
concert hall, the hotel and the first phase of the office development the
site will be viable' says Mr Gilligan.
Other key sites along the Lagan are the 26-acre former gasworks, upriver of
the weir, and the even-larger Abercorn basin just below the weir on the east
side of the river and adjoining the docks.
Mr Smith says that the first developments at the gasworks are expected to be
announced later this autumn and will include public space, performance
areas, and business and commercial premises. Adjoining both Catholic and
Protestant housing estates which have been rocked by sectarian atrocities in
recent years, it is hoped that the development will help build a bridge
between the two communities, especially if a new peaceful era lies ahead.
Developments at the Abercorn Basin are to await the completion next year of
the Pounds 65m crossharbour road and rail bridges which skirt the site. When
complete, together with a motorway link-up to the east which is due for
completion in 1998, the Abercorn Basin is to be marketed as a site for light
industrial developments, having first-class access not only to the city
centre, but to the ferry port and the Belfast city airport and to the road
and rail network throughout Ireland.
The only sector of the Belfast property market not likely to see any big
developments for the next three to four years is in retailing. The
Castlecourt shopping complex in the city centre, together with several
developments on the outskirts which are being slowly expanded, has left the
city with a small surplus of retail space.
The valuation and lands agency notes, however, that despite a static market
in rents for the past two years, recent survey data point to only 2 per cent
of retail space being unlet, while in prime pitches 'there remains a
potential shortage of space'. Prime rents in these locations at around
Pounds 140 per sq ft 'stand comparison with almost all good retail locations
outside central London,' the agency says.
Already well-served with modern retail developments and extensive
pedestrianised areas, having first class access by road, rail, sea and air,
and on the verge of seeing a series of new office, commercial and light
industrial developments alongside the river Lagan, Belfast is potentially
one of the fastest developing cities in the UK - and if peace does come, one
of the most attractive destinations for relocation.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (4): Derry's high tech coup -
Manufacturer's profile, Seagate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The quality of the labour force was the reason that US disc drive
manufacturer Seagate chose Derry as the site for a Pounds 45m high-tech
factory last year.
'The area offers a pool of well-educated, well-qualified and hence trainable
labour,' explains Mr Michael Caulfield, the managing director of the plant.
A chance meeting between Derry's nationalist MP, Mr John Hume and Seagate's
Irish-American director and chief technical director, Dr Brendan Hegarty
also 'could not but have helped put Derry on the short-list for possible
sites,' admits Mr Caulfield.
Northern Ireland has the twin distinctions of having among the highest
educational standards in Britain and Ireland, and the worst levels of
unemployment. Of the top 200 schools in the latest round of A-level results,
20 per cent were in Northern Ireland, explains the Belfast-born Mr
Caulfield. Parts of Derry, however, where 13 per cent of the workforce are
without a job. have some of the worst unemployment rates in Northern
Ireland.
Seagate's manufacturing strategy is to take every stage of the process of
making disc drives and 'look at the amount of technology, capital and labour
involved and ask what type of employee and what type of investment is
needed,' explains Mr Caulfield.
The company then decides on the most appropriate location for that stage of
the process. This has resulted in labour-intensive assembly processes being
located in South East Asia and until now, the technology and
capital-intensive stages being located in the US. Derry was a very suitable
choice for the location of the first facility for manufacturing the 'heads'
which read the memory discs in the drives - the equivalent of the needle
that plays the record in a record player - outside the US, explains Mr
Caulfield.
The head manufacturing process is extremely technology- and
capital-intensive, using machines costing between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds
1.5m each. However, the machines require extremely competent and
well-trained operators, as it is only through the use of human operators
that the manufacturing process can be flexible enough to meet the demands of
the computer industry - where product life cycles can be as short as nine
months.
Northern Ireland's development agency, the Industrial Development Board,
offers some of the best capital grants in Europe - up to 50 per cent of
capital expenditure. Just as importantly, in Seagate's case, generous
assistance towards training and technological development are also
available.
'Wherever we set up, there would have been a huge training load,' explains
Mr Caulfield. The first 100 employees of the Derry plant had to spend three
months training in the US, before the start of production in Derry.
Further training will have to be carried out in Derry as new employees are
recruited. The company has received grant assistance for this, on a level
similar to the capital assistance given by the IDB, from the Training and
Employment Agency. There has also been help from the Industrial Research and
Technology Unit towards the establishment of a worldwide research and
development centre in Derry and this 'will take Seagate's recording head
technology into the next century,' explains Mr Caulfield.
The factory, which commenced production in January, will produce 100m heads
a year, half of Seagate's total production, by the end of 1995. This will
give the company the ability to double revenues from the current level of
around Dollars 3bn, explains Mr Caulfield.
The heads, roughly two millimetres square, are manufactured in batches of
around 6,000, neatly spaced out on ceramic squares about the size of a
bathroom tile. The squares are shipped from Derry to Malaysia where they are
sliced up into individual heads before being shipped to Thailand for
mounting on the disc drive arms - the equivalent of record-player arms. The
final assembly process takes place in Singapore, where the disc drives are
assembled before shipment to computer manufactures for inclusion in their
products.
Seagate produces 200 different drives ranging from the small drives used in
desktop PCs to the massive '30 gigabyte' drives used in supercomputers.
Northern Ireland has seen multinationals come and go, resulting in a healthy
scepticism about the real value of such high profile, high tech, highly
mobile investment.
The main and obvious benefit is the jobs that the factory will bring,
believes Mr Caulfield. Seagate employs 200 people at the moment, and will
employ 500 by 1996 and an additional 46 in the research and development
centre. Around 100 employees are graduates, but the ratio of graduates to
non-graduates will fall by the time the factory is fully operative.
The age profile of employees is young, with Michael Caulfield being one of
the oldest at only 44. All employees have at least A-level standard
educations.
Seagate will contribute Pounds 5m a year to the local economy in wages
alone, but the amount of raw materials bought locally is limited. The bulk
of the equipment and raw materials are sourced outside of Northern Ireland,
with notable exceptions including some bulk chemicals and computers.
Seagate is in Derry for the long term, says Mr Caulfield, who points to the
worldwide research and development base as proof. It is an investment in
people and the return period is at least 5 years, he says, adding: 'You
don't invest in a worldwide research and development centre unless you are
here to stay.'

FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (2): A puzzle for the economists
 -Prolonged peace could bring a 'peace dividend' - or, some warn, a 'peace
deficit' / The Northern Irish economy is recovering faster than the British
economy as a whole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is probably not surprising that peace should be as divisive amongst
Northern Ireland's economists as 25 years of violence has been amongst the
population at large. The 'issue' in Northern Irish economic circles at the
moment is the impact on the economy of a prolonged, hopefully indefinite,
period of peace. It is best summed up by the question: 'Is there going to be
a peace dividend or a peace deficit?'
There are some facts about the situation accepted by both sides in the
debate, including the fact that the Northern Irish economy has been buffered
from the worst of the recent recession by a Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn a year
subsidy from the British Exchequer.
It is also accepted that the Northern Irish economy is recovering faster
than the British economy as a whole. This is particularly obvious in key
measures such as Northern Irish production output and manufacturing
industries output, which, on an indexed basis, have been ahead of Britain
since mid-1990.
Although unemployment in Northern Ireland remains the highest in Britain, at
just under 13 per cent, employment has remained stable since 1990, despite a
significant decline in Britain.
In fact, looking back, it is debatable whether Northern Ireland had a
recession at all. If you take a decline in GDP over two successive quarters
as a definition of a recession, then it definitely did not have one.
However, what economists do not agree on is that peace will benefit the
economy and support the recovery.
Dr Graham Gudgin of the Northern Ireland Economic Research Centre is one of
the doubters - 'security-related expenditure accounts for about one third of
the Pounds 4bn annual subvention . . . there is a huge question mark as to
whether the north would be allowed to keep that money if peace broke out.'
The possible benefits to the Northern Irish economy of increased tourism and
other aspects of peace, would not outweigh the effect of losing the subsidy,
he believes.
Up to 20,000 well-paid jobs in the security forces and related areas could
be lost, predicts Dr Gudgin. The type of jobs that are supposed to replace
them, particularly in areas such as tourism, will be relatively low-paid, he
points out.
The government, not surprisingly, is much more positive and the Minister of
State at Northern Ireland's Department of Economic Development, Mr Tim
Smith, has cited unpublished research showing that 'over a number of years'
the net effect of peace will beneficial in job terms.
A similar stance has been taken by the Confederation of British Industry in
Northern Ireland, which estimates that job growth through inward investment
will quadruple from about 500 per year to 2,000 over a two-to-three year
period, while perhaps another 70,000 jobs will be created in the tourism
industry.
One economist who is very positive about the impact of peace is Mr Douglas
Hamilton, who works with the Government policy advisory group, the Northern
Ireland Economic Council.
Mr Hamilton believes there would be a tremendous boost to industry from
operating in an environment not tempered by a political climate of violence
and conflict.
'The troubles did not really lead to companies pulling out, but to a
situation where they do not operate under normal conditions,' he claims.
Mr Hamilton also believes that there would be pressure on the British
government to let the Northern Irish economy down gently, by phasing-out the
payment gradually and creating a reconstruction or redevelopment fund.
Although the British government has not committed itself to such a fund,
there have already been suggestions of increased aid from the United States
and the European Union.
The US is considering donating up to Dollars 150m over two to three years
through the International Fund for Ireland. The fund was established by the
British and Irish governments in 1986 and raises money in North America and
Europe for projects that encourage reconciliation and economic regeneration.
The president of the European Commission, Mr Jacques Delors, has said the
European Union may increase the size of the donation it makes to the
International Fund.
There will be fundamental changes in the Northern Irish economy, which has
many structural weaknesses, if peace becomes permanent, believes Mr
Hamilton.
Paradoxically, it was the structural weakness that led to the admirable
performance of the Northern Irish economy during the recent recession,
according to Mr Hamilton. The under-developed nature of Northern Ireland's
financial services industry and the dynamics of its property market, with no
appreciable shortage of private sector housing, meant that the boom in
personal credit that led to the British recession, bypassed Northern
Ireland. The absence of speculative pressure on house prices meant that
people in Northern Ireland had nothing like the level of personal debt that
people in the South of England had when high interest rates hit at the end
of the 1980s.
The distorted nature of Northern Ireland's employment patterns, with the
government employing roughly 200,000 out of a total workforce of about
800,000, had a strong buffering effect also, explains Mr Hamilton.
In addition, the exceptionally high level of grants that have been available
in Northern Ireland since the start of the troubles - up to 40 per cent of
capital expenditure - meant that Northern Irish companies went into
recessions very well capitalised and with less debt than most British
competitors.
The strong performance of Northern Ireland's manufacturing industry is not
merely accidental, points out Mr Gudgin. As a sector, it is less dependent
on the British market than most companies in the UK.
Sales to Britain only account for one third of output, compared to two
thirds for most British industry. In addition, wage levels in Northern
Ireland have fallen by about 10 per cent below British levels in the last
ten years, due mostly to unemployment and the end of collective wage
bargaining, says Dr Gudgin.
One area in which Dr Gudgin and Mr Hamilton do concur is in their caution
when it comes to predictions for the Northern Irish economy. In the absence
of any appreciable peace dividend, both economists find it hard to accept
that the North will out-perform Britain in the long term.
'Northern Ireland follows the British cycle,' explains Dr Gudgin, but he
adds: 'If wage advantage and other advantages can be maintained, there is

FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (1): The challenge now is winning
the peace - With the prospect of a lasting peace now firmly on the agenda,
serious thoughts are being given to the economic implications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir John Davies, the attorney general for Ireland under the first Queen
Elizabeth, described Ulster in 1606 as 'the most rude and unreformed part of
Ireland, and the seat and nest of the last great rebellion.'
Catholic Irish lords had constantly 'champed at the bit' of British rule,
but it was 315 years after the attorney general wrote those words before the
problem of seemingly perpetual Irish revolt was partially resolved by
partitioning the island in 1921.
A better-known former UK attorney general, and currently the Northern
Ireland secretary of state, Sir Patrick Mayhew, has had the delicate task of
presiding over the ending of another rebellion, that of the Provisional IRA,
which for the past 25 years has created havoc in Ulster and on the British
mainland in its efforts to force a total British withdrawal from the
province.
The IRA's cessation of hostilities, announced two weeks ago, has so far
held, and a growing number of political leaders both domestically and abroad
are coming to believe that this may really be the permanent cessation of
violence demanded by the two governments in last December's Downing Street
declaration, and which will pave the way for the inclusion of Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA, into round-table talks.
Sir Patrick stresses that it is the 'intention' that the ceasefire be
permanent which is important and that this must be matched by deeds and
words before the British government can finally accept the IRA's bona fides
 -'the reason is that this government cannot be seen to sit and down and
talk to people who may be reserving an option of going back to their former
violence if they don't get what they want at the table . . . I have to
maintain the confidence of people in Northern Ireland.'
That confidence is showing signs of growing. In Dublin, the Irish prime
minister met Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president last week, to prepare
the ground for Sinn Fein's inclusion in a Dublin-based Forum for Peace and
Reconciliation, which will bring together the political parties in the
Republic with Sinn Fein, the nationalist Social Democratic Labour Party
(SDLP) and the moderate Alliance party from Northern Ireland. The North's
other unionist parties have so far refused to join the Forum, but some
leaders of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) have indicated that they believe
the ceasefire to be permanent and, once convinced of that, have said that
they will eventually sit at the table with Sinn Fein.
At the international level, the US government has thrown its weight behind
the peace process and held out a promise of economic assistance to Northern
Ireland, as has the European Commission.
Whether the Loyalist paramilitaries will also lay down their weapons - a key
factor in the peace equation - remains to be resolved, and a small bomb
planted at a Dublin railway station last Monday does not look encouraging.
But community workers in Protestant working class areas of Belfast are
convinced that a Loyalist ceasefire will be declared within the next few
weeks. If so, the momentum towards peace would become increasingly
unstoppable.
The next hurdle in the peace process, once a ceasefire is established on
both sides of the community, will be to convince all the political parties
to sit down and negotiate new constitutional arrangements for Northern
Ireland. A focus for these talks is being drafted by the British and Irish
governments in the form of a 'framework document,' which will address such
issues as reform of the Republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland; a
new elected assembly for the province; and cross-border administrative
structures which will encourage greater economic and political co-operation
between the Republic and Northern Ireland.
No-one is under the illusion that these talks will be anything other than
difficult. The UUP and the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) see in
the cross-border structures a potential trap which will lead to eventual
joint sovereignty, and a back-door approach to a united Ireland. Mr Jim
Gibney, who sits on the national executive of Sinn Fein, said his party
would welcome new cross-party structures - 'if they are free-standing and
can freely develop and there is no ceiling built into their development, we
would see them as a process towards national reconciliation.'
Unionist fears can, it is hoped, be dealt with, by having the executive
powers of the new bodies jointly delegated to them by parliaments in both
the Republic and Northern Ireland, rather than by the two governments,
according to Sir Patrick.
Whether nationalists will accept this, remains to be seen. Mr Albert
Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said last week that the next battle to
come 'will be over the framework document.' But both governments are
convinced that with a willingness to compromise by both nationalists and
unionists, facilitated by a climate of peace, then agreement is achievable.
Sir Patrick says 'there has got to be an outcome in which nobody can seek to
have achieved everything at the end.'
So, with the prospect of a lasting peace now firmly on the agenda, if not
yet firmly in place, serious thoughts are now being given to the economic
implications of peace.
Economists are divided on the issue. There are those who say that Northern
Ireland's development agencies such as the Industrial Development Board and
the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, will be able to aggressively market the
province to foreign investors, no longer having to fight against the
negative image created by the troubles.
The announcement last week by Hilton International, that it is to build a
187-bedroom hotel as a centrepiece to the new Laganside development in
Belfast will be an encouragement to others thinking of capitalising on what
is expected to be a tourist boom in the province in the years ahead.
Seagate, the US electronics manufacturer, last year established a high-tech
manufacturing facility in Londonderry, without waiting for a peace
settlement, attracted by the large pool of skilled labour in the province.
The textile industry continues to grow and now provides around a quarter of
all manufacturing employment. First-class infrastructure in road, rail,
telecoms, ports and airports adds to the attraction of the province.
The optimists therefore say that peace will bring foreign investment on a
similar scale to that achieved by Scotland, Wales and the Irish Republic.
Whilst the economic benefit of peace is not in dispute, more cautious
analysts point to the downside. As many as 20,000 people are estimated to be
employed in the security forces and related occupations such as the security
guards seen at the entrance of almost every large store and office block
across the province. Many of these could be expected to lose their jobs. The
short-term effect could be a rise in the unemployment level of 98,000 or
13.1 per cent of the workforce, already the highest in the UK. Sir Patrick
acknowledges the problem - 'there is going to be a need for gradual
adjustments and it is true that a lot of jobs are linked to the emergency.'
He says that up to 80 per cent of the annual Pounds 1bn government spending
on security is related to the emergency.
The potential loss to the economy in security-related spending by both the
public and private sectors could therefore exceed Pounds 1bn in the event of
a lasting peace, equivalent to around 10 per cent of the province's GDP.
Business leaders can thus be expected to exert intense pressure upon both
governments to provide extra resources for Northern Ireland, whether from
their own exchequers, or by enlisting support from Washington and Brussels.
As Michael Smyth, an economist at the University of Ulster, says: 'The
danger is that the government could pull the rug out from under the private
sector, just as they have a chance of taking off.'
After decades, indeed centuries, of conflict and rebellion in Northern
Ireland, the real challenge thus facing Ulster's politicians as the 21st
century approaches is no longer that of winning the war, but rather winning
the peace.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Some like it hot -
Alan Mitchell believes targetted postcodes are vital to direct marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN MITCHELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some FT readers will have recently received a missive from Lloyds Bank
inviting them not to make a move 'until you check with us' about the
company's buildings insurance. They probably never gave a thought to how
closely targeted they were: they were not hot prospects, or even hot, hot
prospects. They were hot, hot, hot prospects.
Targeting, the elimination of the hated 'junk' from 'junk mail', is the holy
grail of direct marketing. The better it is done, the less the exercise
costs, the fewer consumer noses are put out of joint and the higher the
response rates are. Now marketers are combining data from a wider variety of
sources - including the gold mines of information that usually lie
unexploited in their own accounting and other records - to get closer to
that holy grail. Lloyds Bank Insurance Direct's building insurance campaign
is an example.
To isolate its best prospects Lloyds first compared the prices of its panel
of insurers with the competition - postcode district by postcode district.
If one of its panel was 30 per cent cheaper than the average competitor
price in that postcode, the postcode was identified as 'hot'. The rest were
dropped.
Next, Lloyds trawled its own customer records to identify which of these
'hot' postcodes had recorded higher than average conversion rates from
inquiry to purchase and lower claims rates. That produced a refined 'hot,
hot' list.
Then, to maximise the efficiency of leaflet door-drops, it used recent
census data to identify those postcodes where property values were higher
than average, and where there were particularly high concentrations of home
ownership. The resulting 'hot, hot, hot' target areas look like a few tiny
isolated dots in a postcoded map of the country. But they are a sizeable
market.
Further, by using data from a lifestyle survey company, NDL, which generates
detailed information, including brand preferences and house moving dates
from millions of named individuals each year, Lloyds has been writing to
'hot, hot, hot' individuals who moved house 12 or 24 months ago. They are
particularly ripe because their insurance is likely to be due for renewal.
Philip Loney, Lloyds Bank Insurance Direct general manager, says: 'We want
to progressively target our marketing expenditure where we get the maximum
benefit. This is beautifully simple. We have identified the people who we
can offer the best deal to, and now we are talking to them - and the results
are markedly better.'
Technical developments such as this are doing more than generating better
response rates. According to Chris Lovell, managing director of Lovell Vass
Boddey, the marketing consultancy that helped Lloyds in this project, future
media planning could be shaped by this type of 'micromarketing'.
Posters can be sited more accurately on key local roadside sites, for
example. Bus-side ads can be placed on routes travelling through the
postcodes in question. 'Too often,' says Lovell, 'advertising effectiveness
is a matter of post-campaign evaluation rather than pre-campaign planning.'
Others are going further, trying to move their direct marketing beyond its
traditional sales promotion by mail role to become relationship-building
exercises.
Next month, for example, the car park at stately home Packington Hall, near
Birmingham, will fill with Jaguars, Mercedes and other luxury cars. After
refreshments, their owners will be chauffeur-driven to the door of the Motor
Show, a privilege not even granted to big exhibitors. Before going home,
they will be able to play at chauffeurs themselves - driving BMW's new Seven
Series car.
Over the next few years BMW will keep in touch with these carefully selected
prospective customers, sending them glossy magazines, stories about BMW, and
the occasional chance of a freebie such as the Motor Show. By the time they
come to replace their old car, BMW hopes it will have persuaded them to buy
its new car.
The next step is to combine both approaches, using data from a variety of
sources to target individuals for long-term, direct, relationship-building
programmes - as Ford is now attempting. In July it sent out questionnaires
to 1m named individuals - people who it knew from lifestyle surveys
currently drive rival brands.
The Ford Driving Survey asked them details such as car age, replacement
intentions, most important considerations in car purchase, marital status,
occupation, number of children and income.
Existing customer records were then examined, using sophisticated modelling
techniques to identify the key characteristics of who buys which Ford
models, and why. This information was then matched to the 200,000 Driving
Survey replies, so that the people most likely to choose each Ford model
could be selected for the right sort of soft-sell mailing.
Says Anthony Marsella, strategic analysis manager at direct marketing
specialist Wunderman Cato Johnson, which runs Ford's direct marketing
operation: 'With car buying cycles you need to keep in touch with a
potential customer over three years or more. When it gets to the point where
they are going to buy, we will communicate a selling message to them.'
Marsella estimates that Ford, by fine-tuning its technique, has doubled its
direct marketing efficiency over the past five years. But such technical
developments are also having a more profound effect: they are beginning to
change the way some marketers think about marketing.
Says Grant Harrison, loyalty controller at Tesco, which is currently testing
a Club Card with enormous data-gathering potential: 'Marketing is moving
very significantly away from trying to change or twist consumers' behaviour
to understanding them and giving them what they want.'
The ultimate aim, says Mark Patron, managing director of CMT, one of the
main lifestyle survey companies, is to use technology to mimic the days of
the old corner shop. 'The owner would say, 'Hello Mrs Brown, how's Doris? I
know she likes orange sherbets. Now we've got some lemon flavour. Give her
this, and see if she likes it.'
Most marketers are still a long way away from that, but as they get closer
Mrs Brown may find herself investing as much care and attention in choosing
which organisations deserve her trust and information - her 'relationship' -
as she does in choosing which brands deserve her hard-earned cash.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Simply take one
celebrity. . . - Neil Buckley examines Sainsbury's recipe for a successful
TV campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The formula is simple, yet seductive. A celebrity voice you recognise, but
cannot always place, describes a simple recipe, over pictures of beautifully
chopped ingredients sizzling in a pan. Once taste buds and curiosity have
been tantalised, the camera pulls back to reveal the celebrity.
Former UK chancellor Denis Healey's recipe for scrambled eggs and smoked
salmon, and opera singer Dame Kiri Te Kanawa's farfalle pasta with Parma ham
have all featured in what J Sainsbury, the UK's biggest food retailer, says
is its most successful series of advertisements.
Some 55m cards detailing the recipes have been picked up by customers in
Sainsbury's stores. Moreover, the ads have often created markets for new
products.
In May 1992, Sainsbury sold 30,000 cartons of creme fraiche; the following
month, after ads showed actress Catherine Zeta-Jones using the product to
make fresh fruit brulee, it sold 1m cartons.
The ads have also increased sales of more familiar products. The latest  -
former tennis star Sue Barker's turkey and apricot bake, launched last week
 -resulted in sales of 74 tonnes of turkey strips, 22 times the normal
weekly sale. Last year, Sainsbury bought all available supplies of Italian
pesto sauce to meet demand following actress Zoe Wanamaker's recipe for
tagliatelle with bacon and pesto.
Anthony Rees, Sainsbury's marketing director, says increased product sales
were originally a by-product of the adverts, launched in May 1991 as a
'strategic' campaign to enhance Sainsbury's name and reputation.
Trial campaigns explicitly emphasising Sainsbury's perceived strengths of
quality and reliability, heritage and tradition, had produced negative
reactions among viewers.
When David Abbott, chairman of Sainsbury's ad agency Abbott Mead Vickers,
thought up the recipe theme and persuaded a friend, television presenter
Selina Scott, to front the first one, Sainsbury liked the ad but did not
think it met the brief. Customer research proved otherwise.
'We discovered the way to convince people was not to tell them anything,'
says Rees. 'People could pull out of the ad what they wanted to.'
Even more significantly, the ads fulfilled a 'strategic' and 'tactical'
role, enhancing Sainsbury's name while persuading shoppers to buy products
by the trolleyload. Rees says they have more than justified the estimated
Pounds 30m spent on the 17-ad series.
Sainsbury has moved away from advertising in women's magazines for new
product launches, tying these instead to an appropriate TV recipe advert.
That is one reason why recipes are not, whatever viewers may think,
celebrities' own. They are devised by Sainsbury's recipe department, with
help from cookery writer Delia Smith. Dishes must be 'aspirational'
(mozzarella pasta penne is fine; spaghetti bolognese is not); 'achievable',
even for novice cooks; and 'affordable' - less than Pounds 2.50 per person.
They must look appetising at every stage of preparation. Plans for a
Tiramisu recipe evolved into mascarpone and lime torte because Tiramisu
looked a soggy mess in the early stages.
That attention to detail and the finely judged camerawork are reasons for
the ads' success, says Winston Fletcher, chairman of the Advertising
Association. 'Recipe adverts are a bit of a cliche,' he says. 'What
Sainsbury has done, through the style, the esoteric ingredients, the tone of
voice, is to update the formula.'
The food, says Rees, is always the real star of the commercial. The
celebrity adds intrigue and promotes trust among viewers.
Rees adds there is little sign so far, of customers growing bored and
several more ads are planned.

FT  15 SEP 94 / People: Hambro takes over from Hambro
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rupert Hambro, 51, has taken over the chairmanship of JO Hambro &amp; Co
following the death of his father, Jocelyn Hambro, who founded the merchant
banking boutique.
James Hambro, 45, succeeds his brother as managing director of the firm,
which has around Pounds 500m of investment funds under management.
JO Hambro was set up in 1986 by Jocelyn Hambro and his three sons - Rupert,
Richard and James - when they split off from the much bigger Hambros group
to branch out on their own. Jocelyn had chaired Hambros between 1970 and
1983 and Rupert had been chairman between 1983 and 1986.
James Hambro's appointment is another sign that JO Hambro and its associate
company, JO Hambro Magan, which specialises in providing corporate finance
advice, are starting to go their separate ways. Hambro Magan was set up in
February 1988 by George Magan, a corporate finance chief at Morgan Grenfell,
Alton Irby, a former deputy chairman of Sedgwick, and Rupert and James
Hambro.
Rupert (left) was chairman of Hambro Magan until June 1993 and James Hambro
has been a joint managing director. By taking on his new responsibilities at
JO Hambro, James has followed his brother and stepped down from the Hambro
Magan board. Although the two firms remain close, growing City concerns
about potential conflicts of interest between the investment management and
corporate finance sides of merchant banking type businesses are forcing them
to adopt a more independent stance.

FT  15 SEP 94 / People: EBRD's Ljungh leaves for Morgan Stanley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's Anders Ljungh, 52, who has been vice-president of finance since the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development opened for business, is
returning to the private sector as a senior adviser to Morgan Stanley.
Ljungh (right) is the second senior EBRD official to leave within the past
eight months and his departure will lead to a further reshuffle of the
EBRD's relatively new top management team which is still settling down after
the abrupt exit of Jacques Attali, the EBRD's first president in July 1993.
Earlier this year, Mario Sarcinelli, 59, number three in the EBRD, returned
to Italy to take up the chairmanship of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro.
Sarcinelli was not replaced. However, Ljungh's departure cannot be ignored
and the EBRD's board of directors is expected to decide on his successor at
its board meeting on September 20. Bart Le Blanc, a 48-year-old Dutchman who
is the Bank's secretary general, has been tipped to take over from Ljungh.
Meanwhile, a report in Italy's Il Sole newspaper yesterday suggested that
Antonio Costa, who used to work in the European Commission and is currently
employed by Ferrero, had been lined up to fill Le Blanc's job. Although
appointments to the EBRD are supposed to be made on merit there has been a
feeling that Sarcinelli's exit means an Italian is likely to be a front
runner for the next big job which comes up at the EBRD.
Ljungh's combination of commercial banking skills and knowledge of
multinational development institutions will consolidate Morgan Stanley's
presence in the Scandinavian market and help expand its international
business with financial and emerging market institutions. In addition to his
Morgan Stanley post, he will sit on the boards of Telia, the Swedish
telecoms company, Nordbanken, a commercial bank, and will be chairman of KM,
a Swedish engineering company.
Before joining the EBRD, Ljungh spent 15 years with Svenska Handelsbanken in
Stockholm and was head of its international activities between 1985 and
1991. Before becoming a commercial banker he worked at the World Bank in
Washington, serving as a personal assistant to Robert McNamara, the former
president. He also ran the Bank's East Africa programs department for a
time.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Life in the motor trade can be terribly incestuous. No sooner has Rover
chairman George Simpson taken the helm of Lucas Industries, than Bernard
Carey, Lucas's director of corporate communications, announces that he is
off to be Rover's top spin-doctor.
Carey, 39, who started life as an economist with British Gas, moves to Rover
next month to take over from John Pullen, 61, who is retiring. He gets a
seat on the Rover board.
Pullen, who has been at Rover for eight years, was brought over from British
Shipbuilders by Sir Graham Day, a former chief executive of the state-owned
shipbuilding business who was asked by the Government to sort out BL,
Rover's predecessor.
Carey was headhunted for the job but admits that he had a bit of a head
start. Not only is Lucas one of Rover's major suppliers but it is based only
three miles away from Rover's Solihull headquarters.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Hitting target
audience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Direct marketing's ever-closer targeting of individuals is one of the
reasons why junk mail is less of a problem in the eyes of UK consumers than
it used to be: what might be junk to one person could be welcome
correspondence to another.
The industry's improving reputation is also down to the fact that it appears
to be sticking, by and large, to a system of self-regulation, says the
Advertising Standards Authority, the watchdog which monitors the sector. The
rules, which came into force in 1992, require companies to make sure their
information is accurate and up-to-date and consumers know why it is being
collected.
Says the ASA: 'If a company intends to pass on information to anyone else or
use it for a significantly different purpose, consumers should be given an
opportunity to opt out. If a company decides to use information it already
has about someone it must gain permission first. Consumers should also be
able to recognise the associations between companies within the same group.'
Companies regularly have to comb their records for consumers who have
stated, through the Mailing Preference Service, that they do not want to
receive mailings. The rules, which build on the requirements of the Data
Protection Act, also apply to press advertisements featuring response
coupons.
A recent ASA survey found that, out of a sample of 50 press advertisers,
five intended to make their lists available to third parties and one failed
to offer an opt-out to consumers. Three advertisers were passing on
information to other companies within their group but were not making this
sufficiently clear to consumers.
Out of a sample of 50 direct mailers, seven were collecting information to
rent out, but the opt-outs available to consumers were found to be
reasonable. Rules on the Mailing Preference Service were being observed by
both groups, found the ASA.

Mr George Walker, the former chairman and chief executive of the Brent
Walker property and leisure group, yesterday admitted in evidence at his
trial that there was 'something wrong' in the way cash was moved out of his
company.
Mr Walker was being asked about sums of Pounds 750,000 and Pounds 250,000
which allegedly moved from Brent Walker through two bank accounts before
reaching a third, of which Mr Walker was the sole signatory.
He and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director, are
accused of fraudulently inflating Brent Walker profits by devising bogus
film rights transactions. They deny charges of theft, false accounting and
conspiring to falsify accounts.
The trial resumes tomorrow.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Privately financed N-plant suggested
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may be possible to build a nuclear power station in the UK entirely with
private-sector finance, says a report by NM Rothschild, the City merchant
bank, David Lascelles writes.
The report, commissioned by Nuclear Electric, the state-owned utility, will
go to the government's nuclear review which closes at the end of this month.
It will also be made public.
In its submission to the review earlier this summer the utility said a
nuclear power station could not be built without a measure of government
financial backing.
Mr Michael Kirwan, its finance director, told the FT conference on nuclear
power yesterday that Rothschild's conclusions depended on a number of
conditions. One was that a new station would have to be linked with Nuclear
Electric's operations.
The report suggests that a privatised nuclear industry would be more
successful in raising private-sector finance than one backed by government
and liable to political influence.

FT  15 SEP 94 / RTZ rules out bid for mining assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ, the international mining group, formally ruled out a bid for British
Coal mining assets as the deadline for tenders closed yesterday afternoon.
However, Taylor Woodrow, the construction company, was among companies
confirming that it had bid.
The deadline brought hope of revival for at least three mines which are no
longer operated by British Coal and are being offered as stand-alone pits.
English Coal, one of three management buy-out teams, said it was interested
in Ellington in Northumberland, Annesley/Bentinck in Nottinghamshire, and
Thorne in South Yorkshire, and was bidding in conjunction with its tender
for the three English regions.
English Coal said that if successful it would want to re-open Ellington and
Annesley/Bentinck as soon as possible, creating at least 550 jobs.
The other management buy-out bids are Celtic Energy, which is bidding for
South Wales, and Northern Coal, which has planned a tender for the
central-north region.
RJB Mining said it was bidding for all five regions, and Coal Investments,
chaired by Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal commercial director, is
concentrating on central north and central south in partnership with the
Union of Democratic Mineworkers.
Ryan Group is involved in bids for three regions - one with Alcan Aluminium
of Canada for the north-east of England, one with construction company
Miller Group for Scotland, and one alone for the south Wales region.
Other possible bidders for at least some of the five regions include NSM and
CP Holdings.
The government hopes to announce preferred bidders for each region and,
where appropriate, each stand-alone pit, by the middle of next month.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Political Notebook: Mr Jenkins' ghost at the Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So that's it. A large chunk of the Conservative party is living in
'cloud-cuckooland'. Those on the Tory backbenches foolish enough to join
local activists in demanding tax cuts are not engaged in serious politics.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the man who actually decides what comes out of
Gladstone's Budget box at the end of November, has spoken. His party should
stop whining.
The significance of the chancellor's words on taxes and his action on
interest rates runs deeper than his obvious concern to massage pre-Budget
expectations.
Most in the Conservative party do not yet realise it but Mr Clarke quite
deliberately crossed a political Rubicon this week. He has rewritten the
government's electoral strategy.
Viewed from 11 Downing Street the Tories' hopes of clawing back its
unprecedented 34-point deficit in the opinion polls now rest on delivering
year in, year out, precisely what the chancellor has promised: steady growth
and low inflation.
There can be no quick tax fixes, no loosening of the monetary reins.
Everything is staked on an unexciting but durable economic recovery and a
return to sound public finances. Competence and credibility are to be put
before transparently crude electoral bribes.
It must be said that as far as this year goes the chancellor was stating the
obvious. No one with any sense at Westminster expected tax cuts in November.
Nor is there any prospect of a reversal of the increases already in the
pipeline.
Public borrowing should undershoot the official Pounds 36bn forecast but the
Treasury will still spend about Pounds 30bn more than it collects in taxes.
So for all the talk about rifts between neighbours, Mr John Major is as
persuaded as his loquacious chancellor that now is not the moment for tax
handouts.
As for this week's rise in interest rates, Mr Major had no choice. Prime
ministers never like higher borrowing costs. The present one, facing the
deepest electoral chasm since opinion polling began, must really hate them.
But that is to miss the point. Mr Major sold the pass when he agreed to
allow publication of the minutes of Mr Clarke's monthly chats with Mr Eddie
George, the Bank of England governor.
The conventional wisdom is that publication had weakened the Treasury's
position vis-a-vis the Bank of England. That is true, although it is
important to distinguish the official Treasury - which invariably shares the
Bank's judgment - from the chancellor of the day - who may well not.
But the important implication of the change is that it removes the prime
minister's power of veto. Once the chancellor and bank governor are seen to
agree the occupant of Number 10 cannot demur.
So those searching for Downing Street conflicts, real or imagined, should
look to the stance of fiscal policy as the point of tension. Not now, but in
November 1995 or 1996.
Mr Clarke has absorbed the Treasury orthodoxy that serious tax-cutting may
well be impossible before a general election due by the spring of 1997 at
the latest. He has concluded that delay might turn out to be good politics
as well as prudent economics.
After the broken promises of 1992 the voters do not believe this government.
Much better then to go into an election with the public finances in strong
enough shape to allow a credible promise of tax cuts that will stick, than
to try to con the voters with a transparently temporary cut before polling
day.
There is a broader political strategy here. In Mr Clarke's mind the
government must do three things before the election if it is to have a hope
in hell of winning.
Alongside the recovery, the voters need to feel secure that it will last.
Then they must be convinced that next time the government for once will
deliver on its manifesto promises.
It all sounds pretty sensible stuff. But of course there is a catch. What
may sound perfectly logical from a politician with a reputation for keeping
his nerve may not hold quite the same appeal for a party terrified of
electoral defeat.
If Mr Clarke is not careful people will soon be drawing comparisons with the
then Mr Roy Jenkins' stewardship of the Treasury in the late 1960s. He
balanced the budget and lost the Labour government the 1970 election.
The briefest glance at the agenda for the annual Tory conference in
Bournemouth next month reveals the depth of the angst among the party's
footsoldiers.
Local activists still willing to tramp the streets in support of the most
unpopular government in living memory want some good news to sell. They are
fed up telling a disbelieving and disgruntled electorate to bide their time.
Those with a preference for bribery over hair-shirt economics will find
plenty of allies around the cabinet table. When the time comes Mr Major may
be among them.
Mr Clarke, of course, hopes the choice will not be necessary, that public
borrowing will come down fast enough to remove the contradiction between
fiscal prudence and tax cuts.
There is a good chance it will. If not? Well Mr Major could always promote
Mr Clarke to the Foreign Office when Mr Douglas Hurd stands down in a year
or so.

FT  15 SEP 94 / TUC offers Ucatt cash support: Guarantee of Pounds 250,000
underlines determination to save construction union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Trades Union Congress has privately promised a Pounds 250,000 guarantee
to underwrite Ucatt, Britain's biggest construction union, as it prepares a
tough rescue plan aimed at achieving financial viability by the end of next
year.
This unprecedented decision underlines the TUC leadership's determination to
ensure that the union is saved from the threat of financial collapse. It
follows the TUC general council's decision to suspend Ucatt's Pounds 180,000
annual TUC subscription to enable the union to send delegates to last week's
congress.
The union expects to return to financial balance and believes it will not
need to make use of the TUC guarantee to Unity Trust Bank.
Ucatt officials led by Mr George Brumwell, the general secretary, yesterday
met HW Fisher, the union's accountants, and Unity Trust to discuss details
of the rationalisation programme which it is hoped can be finalised and
approved by the middle of next month.
The bank is preparing to provide further financial assistance to Ucatt -
possibly in the form of a loan - on top of the Pounds 1.428m overdraft
facility it has been providing on condition that agreement can be reached on
cuts to bring the union's finances into balance.
The union is using its many properties as collateral to the bank, which in
reality is ultimately responsible for monitoring Ucatt's finances on a
day-to-day basis.
Mr Brumwell said yesterday: 'The bank has continued to support us and it has
kept a tight rein on our current expenditure, but we have managed within the
overdraft facility.'
He emphasised that his executive was giving full backing to the new rescue
plan. 'We are increasingly confident we can get the union back into line,'
he said.
A rescue plan drawn up by the union and its accountants last year was found
to have taken too optimistic a view of membership income. Instead of rising
after two years of decline it has fallen by about Pounds 500,000 this year,
about 10 per cent of annual income.
The union's members are about to be balloted on a proposal that the union
become an autonomous trade group of the TGWU general union from next
January. Delegates at Ucatt's conference this summer voted in support of
joining the TGWU by only 32 to 30, but Mr Brumwell said he was 'very
confident' that the proposal would be approved by members.
He said this would make no difference to Ucatt's need to bring expenditure
into line with income. It has to meet interest and bank charges of about
Pounds 4,000 a week.
The main problem has been to ensure that it can establish financial support
to meet the cost of staff redundancies and other measures involved in the
planned rationalisation.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Construction output shows faster growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK construction output is rising faster than previously forecast but
construction prices are expected to remain relatively low because of
overcapacity in the industry, according to separate forecasts published
today.
A study by Cambridge Econometrics, the private research and forecasting
body, expects the value of UK construction output in constant 1990 prices to
rise 2.8 per cent this year.
Previous industry forecasts have suggested that the increase in output is
likely to be between 1 per cent and 2 per cent. The Cambridge Econometrics
forecast is in line with Department of the Environment figures, published
last week, which revealed that construction output had risen 2.9 per cent in
the first six months of this year compared with the first half of last year.
According to Cambridge Econometrics construction output is expected to rise
another 2.8 per cent next year and 2.9 per cent in 1996.
The forecasters expect output to continue to grow at an average rate of 2.2
per cent a year between 1996 and 2001.
A study published today by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says
that construction prices are likely to increase 5.1 in the next 12 months
and 4.8 per cent in the following 12 months as building material and labour
costs increase.
The institution says that even so, construction prices in 1996 are likely to
be 6 per cent below their 1989 peak in cash terms and 30 per cent below in
real terms.
As a result there is likely to be little improvement in contractors' margins
until 1996.
Mr Christopher Vickers, the institution's construction spokesman, said:
'Although prices are increasing, the industry's reliance on the private
sector for its recovery will keep the lid on spiralling tender levels.
'With construction and land prices currently rising faster than house prices
and industrial and commercial rents, there is a danger that developers'
profits may disappear, forcing them to cancel building schemes, leading to
further pressure on pricing as competition for work again becomes fierce.'

FT  15 SEP 94 / Ashdown plan aims to dull Labour's rising star
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown yesterday unveiled his strategy to take the Liberal
Democrats out of the shadow of Mr Tony Blair's Labour party by staking out a
distinctive political agenda for the next general election.
In a personal political manifesto designed to provide 'signposts' for his
party, Mr Ashdown insisted that Mr Blair's election as Labour leader would
strengthen rather than weaken the Liberal Democrats' electoral appeal.
Welcoming the decision of Mr Blair and his fellow Labour modernisers 'to
copy' many Liberal Democrat themes, Mr Ashdown said that the latest
upheavals in British politics could only benefit a third party committed to
change.
But he refused to drop the official party line - privately dismissed by many
of its senior figures - that the Liberal Democrats might co-operate with the
Conservatives after an inconclusive general election.
Mr Ashdown's policy statement, which will provide the focus for political
debate at next week's annual conference in Brighton, casts the Liberal
Democrats as the party best able to manage change in a rapidly changing
world.
Setting out the central planks of policy, Mr Ashdown said that the party had
to take as its starting point the acceptance of a market-based,
enterprise-driven economy, to enable Britain to compete in the global
economy.
It should also sketch out policies which involved building on, rather than
dismantling, the government's reforms of public services. Above all it
should focus on making the services democratic and accountable.
Mr Ashdown said the party should widen its traditional commitment to
constitutional reform by embracing new forms of democracy, including using
national and local consultative referenda to 'reconnect people with
politics'.
The policy statement, Making Change Our Ally, says that Britain must also
accept a pivotal role in Europe with a clear commitment to build a
democratic federal structure. On the wider international stage Britain
should play a leading role in reform of the United Nations to create the new
world order promised - but not delivered - by the end of the cold war.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Train given wrong signal, says RMT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A passenger train was given the wrong signal yesterday by a Railtrack
manager acting as a trainee signaller, the RMT transport union has claimed.
The 8.03am Glasgow to Kilmarnock train was given a green light and shown the
incorrect route indicator near Busby, the RMT said.
The driver followed procedure and challenged the signal. He received an
apology from Glasgow Signalling Centre, which admitted: 'The trainee was a
bit too fast.'

FT  15 SEP 94 / Ministers warned on mortgage help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was yesterday warned not to cut mortgage-interest subsidies
to people on benefits before the private sector can provide alternative
cover.
Amid signs that ministers plan to reduce mortgage interest relief in the
Budget, the social security advisory committee, which advises the government
on the welfare state, said people with big mortgages were already being
forced to take out insurance to cover interest payments.
It noted that the government had recently lowered the upper limit for a
mortgage on which it would pay interest relief to Pounds 125,000. But it
warned that the availability of insurance cover was 'variable' and that
further cuts would bring hardship to unemployed homeowners.
The committee said that insurance groups could be encouraged to look at
mortgage-interest cover in a number of ways. It said: 'One possible solution
might be for the mortgage lenders to adopt a pooled-risk approach to
unemployment and insure themselves against an individual being unable to pay
them.'
This would spread the risk evenly and ensure that no company was heavily
penalised.
It also called on the government to signal any intention to cut mortgage
relief well in advance. This would encourage homeowners and insurance
companies to make decisions on replacing state provision.

FT  15 SEP 94 / High street prices bounce back up after summer sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Record increases in the prices of clothing and household goods after the end
of the summer sales resulted in a slightly higher-than-expected rise in the
retail prices index for August, the Central Statistical Office said
yesterday.
The index - based on 100 in January 1987 - rose to 144.7 last month, up 0.5
per cent from July. Analysts expected a 0.3 per cent rise.
Underlying retail-price inflation, which excludes mortgage-interest
payments, was running at a year-on-year rate of 2.3 per cent in August, up
from 2.2 per cent in July.
The CSO said the index rose primarily because high-street retailers were
repricing stock after discounting heavily during the summer sales. It noted
there had been a sharper price rise this August than the previous August,
when the index rose 0.4 per cent.
CSO statisticians said Treasury ministers saw August's raw inflation data
last week, before Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, raised base rates on
Monday. They emphasised that the data were incomplete. City analysts said
they did not think one month's statistics motivated Mr Clarke's decision.
According to the CSO, the effect of the bounce-back from summer sales
usually comes in September, when clothing prices have generally risen an
average of 3.5 per cent to 4.0 per cent. Following a record fall in clothing
prices in July, clothing prices last month rose 2.2 per cent, the biggest
August rise since 1918.
Petrol prices also pushed up the overall monthly price change. They rose 6
per cent compared with August last year due to strikes in Nigeria and a fire
at Milford Haven refinery.
Household goods rose 1.6 per cent, the steepest August increase since 1956.
The rise was largely due to re-pricing of furniture and furnishings after
summer discounting, as well as price increases for pet foods, household
equipment and consumables.
Personal goods and services, which includes products such as handbags,
suitcases, watches and spectacles, rose 1.8 per cent, up 4.3 per cent from
August last year.
Food prices rose 0.3 per cent during the month. A rise in the price of
potatoes overshadowed price cuts in fresh vegetables and fruit.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Jobless fall spread through all regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month's fall of 34,200 in seasonally adjusted unemployment was spread
throughout all regions although the fall in the south-east, where the number
of jobless claiming benefit fell 12,600, was faster than elsewhere.
Department of Employment figures for August 11 showed that the adjusted
unemployment rate fell to a provisional 9.2 per cent of the workforce from
9.3 per cent the month before. The unemployment rates of all regions fell
0.1 percentage points except in the south-east, where the fall was 0.2
points to a below-average 8.9 per cent.
Greater London continued to be an unemployment blackspot in the south-east,
with the local jobless rate slipping just 0.1 point to 10.6 per cent.
UK unemployment is now well below the latest European Union average of 10.8
per cent but higher than average unemployment of 6.8 per cent in the Group
of Seven leading industrial nations. It is also higher than the 7.8 per cent
average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the
25-nation group of industrialised countries.
The latest figures continue to show a wide disparity between male and female
unemployment. Male unemployment, which fell 26,700 to 1,979,000 between July
and August, affected 12.4 per cent of the workforce. Female unemployment,
which fell 7,500 to 616,900, was just 5 per cent.
But the overall jobless figures showed a marked improvement. Last month's
fall in unemployment was higher than the most recent three- and six-month
average falls of 21,700 and 26,200 respectively. The seasonally adjusted
unemployment total of 2,595,900 in August was 376,000 lower than its
December 1992 peak and at its lowest level since January 1992.
The employment department reported a fall of 6,300 to 319,500 in the number
of claimants joining the unemployment count last month. The August inflow of
claimants was the lowest since October 1990 and 51,200 fewer than a year
ago. The outflow of claimants increased by 2,100 to 356,400 in August
compared with July, but was 16,100 lower than in August last year.
The stock of unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres increased a seasonally
adjusted 6,600 to 163,900 last month and was 35,200 higher than in August
last year. It was the 11th consecutive monthly rise, bringing the stock of
vacancies to its highest since April 1990. Jobcentres reported their highest
inflow of vacancies - 225,900 - since October 1989. The employment service
placed 171,800 people last month, 14,100 more than in July and the most
since such statistics started in 1980.
But yesterday's official figures suggest that improvements in the labour
market have had little inflationary impact on average earnings and no
adverse effect on labour relations.
The underlying annual growth of average earnings was a provisional 3 3/4 per
cent in July, unchanged from June. Underlying annual earnings growth in the
production industries was 4 per cent, down from 4 1/4 per cent in June and
the lowest rate since these statistics started in 1980.
Average earnings growth in manufacturing fell to 4 per cent from 4 1/4 per
cent in June, while service industry earnings inflation was unchanged at 3
1/2 per cent.
Productivity rose strongly in manufacturing. Output per head was up 5 per
cent in July compared with July last year and 4.8 per cent year-on-year in
the three months to July.
Manufacturing wages and salaries per unit of output fell 0.9 per cent in
July compared with July last year and were 0.5 per cent lower in the three
months to the end of July compared with a year earlier.
Only 27,000 working days were lost to strike action in July in spite of the
high-profile signal workers' dispute.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Boss Group plans US sales drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boss Group, the lift-truck producer acquired in May by Jungheinrich of
Hamburg, yesterday unveiled an investment plan to turn its Bedfordshire
factories into a world-class manufacturing centre.
The company also plans a big assault on the US lift-truck market, which the
former Lancer Boss Group never fully exploited. Jungheinrich acquired the
Boss business, and its former subsidiary Steinbock Boss in Germany, after
their controversial receiverships in April.
The Boss factories in Leighton Buzzard, which are spread over a number of
sites, were a nagging problem for Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw and his brother
Trevor, the former owners who lost control of the company with the
receiverships. Lancer Boss had received planning permission for a
contentious project that encroached on neighbouring green-belt land. But the
company shelved the expansion plan because of its financial difficulties.
Yesterday Mr Bob Bischof, Boss Group chairman, said that there had been a
debate since the receivership over whether the new Boss Group retained this
planning permission. Rather than take the issue to the courts the group will
this month submit to Bedfordshire County Council a new application for a
plan based only on industrial land.
The plan involves rationalising and simplifying manufacturing, creating one
facility for volume production and another for big, more specialised
lift-trucks.
The plan has yet to be approved by the parent company and Mr Bischof would
not say how much it would cost.
Boss could in effect spend Pounds 6m without incurring any extra cost
because it would be saving leasing costs of Pounds 600,000 a year.
Boss has increased its workforce by 45 to about 730 since the takeover. Mr
Bischof said he was convinced that employment would rise further in the long
term, although he would not say whether the in-vestment plan would increase
jobs.
Mr Bischof said Boss was moving quickly to set up a dealer network in the
US, where it saw an excellent opportunity for the company's side-loaders and
big container handlers. This was partly because of the problems faced by
Japanese rivals exporting to the US from Japan when the yen is strong.
Mr Bischof said Boss Group expects sales of Pounds 52m for the eight months
of this year since the receivership, and 'a small profit'.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Analysts on line to CSO gurus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City economists fazed by government figures may soon have help at hand.
The Central Statistical Office is considering setting up a telephone service
to help analysts make sense of figures.
It is the latest step in the CSO's initiative to develop better links with
the City and the public - and cover its costs.
The CSO yesterday said that if the service went ahead 'it will not be
cheap'. It provided a free taster of the service yesterday to supplement the
retail prices index. About 20 analysts took part in a conference call with
CSO statisticians to ask detailed questions about the data.
Other trials of the system, similar to briefings for journalists, have
already been carried out for industry data.
Mr Simon Briscoe, economist with Warburgs, welcomed the system. He added: 'A
lot of people in the City get very annoyed that journalists have been
getting better information than we do.'
Nevertheless the CSO does seem to have succeeded on one point. Analysts'
verdicts on yesterday's figures were unusually unanimous - and similar to
the interpretation offered by the CSO.

<TEXT>
It depends which figures you use. The workforce in employment has either
fallen 9,000 or risen 137,000 in the past year, Peter Norman writes.
The Department of Employment reported yesterday that the number in work fell
a seasonally adjusted 34,000 to 25.23m in the three months to the end of
June - a fall of 9,000 since June last year.
However, its labour force survey showed a rise of 80,000 in employment
between winter and spring and a 137,000 rise to nearly 24.99m compared with
spring last year.
The problem seems to be data collection. The labour force survey gathers
information from households, while yesterday's data is based on returns from
employers. Both cover much the same period.
Perhaps understandably, Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, put his
faith in the labour force survey. Yesterday's figures were 'in contradiction
to just about every other statistic', he said.
Officials said statisticians were working to resolve the differences.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Portillo may change law following rail dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, may introduce industrial
relations legislation to deal with problems arising from the signal workers'
dispute once it is over, it emerged yesterday.
He said: 'I will reflect upon all the lessons of this strike when it comes
to an end.' He did not dismiss the suggestion made by Mr Howard Davies,
director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, that 'refresher'
strike ballots ought to be held after a specified period of industrial
disruption to test whether those striking were still supporting such action.
It is not thought that the employment secretary is keen to try to ban
strikes in essential services, something that Mr Davies said employers did
not want to see.
During yesterday's strike a passenger train was given the wrong signal by a
Railtrack manager acting as a trainee signaller, the RMT transport union
said.
The RMT said that the 8.03am Glasgow to Kilmarnock train was given a green
light and shown the incorrect route indicator near Busby. The driver
followed procedure and challenged the signal. He received an apology from
Glasgow Signalling Centre, which said: 'The trainee was a bit too fast.'
The derailment of a commuter train at Bickley in Kent during the signal
workers' strike last Thursday was due to driver error, a joint internal
inquiry by Railtrack and British Rail's southern train operating unit has
found.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Investigators widen probe on ferry walkway collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Accident investigators will today widen their inquiries into the collapse of
a passenger walkway which killed six people and injured seven others
boarding a ferry at the Kent port of Ramsgate.
The collapse of the walkway happened as passengers were boarding a Belgian
ferry, the Prins Filip, just before 1am yesterday. The end of one section of
the walkway fell 50ft beside a vehicle ramp leading on to the ferry.
The incident occurred less than three weeks after a blaze on a cross-Channel
ferry and raised once again the issue of ferry safety. Port Ramsgate, which
is responsible for quayside equipment at the port, and Sally Line, which
operates the ferry hit by the earlier blaze in which one person was injured,
are both part of Sally UK, a Finnish/Swedish shipping group.
There have been concerns in recent years about the safety of ferries at sea
and regulations were tightened after the capsize of the Herald of Free
Enterprise with the loss of 193 lives in 1987. But there had been no fatal
failure of shore-based equipment in recent memory, ferry industry officials
said.
An initial examination of the structure was completed yesterday by the
Health and Safety Executive, which recovered a large metal pin from the
seabed. A second team of health and safety inspectors will today start
detailed inquiries and a team from the walkway's Swedish manufacturers will
start their own review.
Mr Reg Cooper, managing director of Port Ramsgate, said: 'We had no
indication that anything was wrong.'
The walkway was installed in March by FEAB, part of the Mattsson Foretagen
group, a small, privately owned engineering company based in Uddevalla near
Gothenburg.
Mr Christer Utgren, finance director, said this was the only walkway of this
type to be built by FEAB but the technology was not new. He said: 'We have
never had a failure before.' The company has supplied vehicle ramps to
Ramsgate and three other UK ports.
Stena Sealink, another ferry operator on the cross-Channel route, said it
had ordered an inspection of its walkways and ramps although its equipment
was of a different design.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Virgin launches branded goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You've flown the airline, shopped at the megastores and played the computer
games. Now buy the consumer goods.
Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group is launching a range of fast-moving
consumer goods bearing the Virgin name. Virgin Retail Brands, a new company
to develop the products, will be registered today.
The company aims to have a number of goods in the shops by Christmas. The
first is likely to be Virgin Vodka, and Virgin is already negotiating with
William Grant, the spirits group, about a product launch in the next few
months. Another plan is for mineral water, under the name Virgin Spring.
Virgin said: 'This is a big departure for us. Apart from the Body Shop,
Virgin is the only new international brand to come out of Britain in the
last couple of decades that has recognition in three continents. But we
don't use it in any form of hard products that people can pick up.'
Recent research suggested the Virgin name was sufficiently well-regarded and
recognised to enable it to expand beyond its present niche markets.
Commercial director of Virgin Retail Brands will be Mr Nick Roslin, who
developed in-flight retailing on Virgin Atlantic airlines. Mr James Kydd,
formerly a director of advertising agency Coleman RSCG, will be responsible
for advertising, marketing and brand development. Mr John Jackson, former
managing director of Body Shop, will be a consultant and may later take a
management position.
Virgin plans to develop innovative products that have a leisure connotation,
such as snacks and soft drinks.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Blair will warn of election danger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, will warn the party's national executive
committee today that the party is still at risk of losing the next general
election in spite of its strong lead in the opinion polls.
Highlighting the dangers of complacency, he will point to Labour's declining
lead in the ICM poll published in today's Guardian newspaper which shows
what may be the start of a Conservative recovery.
Labour support has fallen from 55 per cent to 51 per cent since the last
poll early last month while Conservative support has risen from 23 per cent
to 27 per cent. The figures give Labour more than half the vote, and a
massive 24-point lead over the government which would translate into a
substantial Commons majority.
However, ICM's adjusted figures, which take account of special factors, put
Labour only 12 percentage points ahead on 45 per cent of the vote compared
with 33 per cent for the Conservatives.
Mr Blair will tell the committee that the figures support private research
carried out for the party which suggests that much of Labour's support may
not be as solid as some had hoped. He is worried that many activists
underestimate the extent to which the improving economy may increase Tory
support.
The poll puts the Liberal Democrats on 18 per cent, down from 19 per cent.
Yet the party remains steady on 17 per cent on the basis of the adjusted
figures.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Gooda Names to press for damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Solicitors acting for an action group of the biggest loss-making Lloyd's
syndicate will apply soon to the High Court to enforce a writ for damages
against the managing agents of the Gooda Walker agency.
The move has been made possible by the decision of the errors and omissions
insurers, which are liable for any damages being pursued against members'
and managing agents, not to defend the action. However, an action against
the members' agents is being defended and that case is continuing.
The Gooda Walker 387 Action Group issued the writ against the two groups -
the members' agents, and the managing agents they introduced, who in turn
ran the personal stock-loss syndicate - in December 1992.
Annual losses for individual Lloyd's Names in the syndicate between 1983 and
1987 totalled Pounds 96,000 per Pounds 10,000 invested. However, the action
group is forecasting that this figure will reach Pounds 1.25m for 1988 and
1989.
Ms Mary Louise Burrows of the action group said that they intended to press
for a judgment in the undefended action and then seek damages.
Sources close to the insurers said, however, that they intended to claim
that the underwriters were not liable for the insurance. If this were to
occur it would involve the action group returning to court to get the policy
reinstated, which could result in further lengthy litigation.
Judgment is imminent on the action bought by the separate Gooda Walker
Action Group against the same Gooda Walker managing and members' agents.

FT  15 SEP 94 / DSS considers issuing 'smart cards' to claimants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Social Security is considering the introduction of a
'smart card' rather than a less sophisticated 'swipe card' in its pilot
scheme next year for identifying social security claimants.
A smart card contains a microchip capable of storing a range of data, which
could include criminal records and previous social security claims abuse.
The DSS had been thought to favour a simpler swipe card with a magnetic
stripe or watermark which, linked to a pin number, proves identity but
little else. The department now appears to have suspended talks with Thorn
Secure Systems, part of Thorn-EMI, on the introduction of such cards.
A number of government ministers have dismissed the idea of a compulsory
national identity card. The concept is unpopular in Britain, although ID
cards are widely used throughout Europe.
However ministers have not ruled out some form of card for social security
claimants at the 22,000 post offices and benefit offices throughout Britain.
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, has declined to rule out the
introduction of smart cards for claimants.
A smart card could also carry driving licence data. Under current plans a
new driving licence bearing the holder's photograph is to be introduced in
1996.
The prime minister, said in a speech last week: 'Anything that could check
crime and cut fraud must be worth a look.'
The social security budget is put at Pounds 80bn. The cost of fraud is
officially put at Pounds 5bn a year but could be as high as Pounds 10bn.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Fresh law on animal transport planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, yesterday outlined plans for
tough measures to improve the treatment of live animals on long journeys in
the hope of defusing the row between ferry companies and farmers over the
lucrative export trade.
But ferry companies - several of which have already implemented a ban on
transporting live animals after a public outcry - appeared unimpressed,
saying that they would maintain their bans.
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals criticised the
new code, because it is applicable only in the UK and does not cover further
travel in the European Union. It questioned the ability of the UK
authorities to enforce the code and expressed disappointment that it did not
contain a maximum journey time of eight hours for animals bound for
slaughter.
Stena Sealink said its ban on carrying live animals would stay until a code
was drawn up that was acceptable to the RSPCA. Peninsular and Oriental,
which carries the bulk of live animal exports, said it was still committed
to banning the traffic from October 1.
Farmers hope that the ferry companies will rethink their objections to the
new code during the consultation period until October 18. Mr Waldegrave
urged ferry companies to act as if the code was already in place.
He said: 'This is an important initiative. In the absence of agreed and
enforceable EU measures, I shall be amending the law to give teeth to the
enforcement of best practice already required by our national controls.'
The code would introduce a new criminal offence for hauliers falsifying
journey plans. The measures would compel hauliers to fill in a standard
journey plan for all trips over 15 hours. Plans for departure, arrival times
and staging posts would have to be approved by a government vet.
Mr Waldegrave said that he recognised the need to toughen legislation at a
European level, but the measures in the code would give the government far
greater power to stop malpractice in Britain.
Farmers groups have warned that they stand to lose up to Pounds 200m a year
if the ferry companies' bans are maintained.

FT  15 SEP 94 / WH Smith backs net book deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WH Smith, the UK's biggest bookseller, has decided to put its weight behind
the defence of the net book agreement as long as the main publishers do the
same.
The company, which has 23 per cent of the market through its main retail
outlets and the more specialist Waterstone chain, wants to preserve the NBA
in the interests of maintaining an orderly market in the publishing of new
books.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of Fair Trading, has asked the
Restrictive Practices Court to look again at the agreement which allows
publishers to set the retail prices of most books.
The last time the court looked at the issue in 1964 it concluded that
without the agreement fewer titles would be published, a narrower range of
titles would be available in bookshops and some independent bookshops might
go out of business.
The Publishers Association will decide later this month whether it will
defend the agreement in the Restrictive Practices Court - a long process
that could cost pub-lishers and retailers as much as Pounds 1m according to
some estimates.
There are growing signs that a majority of the council of the Publishers
Association will come out in favour of retaining the NBA. The question then
will become whether they are prepared to meet the cost of defending it in
court.
Earlier this month Sir Malcolm Field, managing director of WH Smith, spelt
out the implications of ending the NBA at a meeting of senior publishers in
London.
He said: 'The NBA is, and always has been, a publishers' agreement. If the
publishers want to retain it, then we expect them to defend it. As a group
we will support them. But we will not shoulder the burden ourselves.' If the
NBA went, they would have to 'take an axe to the slower-moving titles'.
Sir Malcolm predicted that the end of the NBA would result in the serious
book buyer subsidising discounts at the popular end of the market.

FT  15 SEP 94 / New consortium sets its sights on Channel 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An international consortium, believed to include three big UK corporations
with no significant broadcasting interests, is to bid for the new Channel 5
television licence.
The group is led by CanWest Global Communications, a Canadian broadcasting
group with interests in New Zealand, Australia and Chile. It declined to
name its partners for the Channel 5 bid.
At the same time Virgin Communications, part of Mr Richard Branson's Virgin
Group, has appointed Mr Jeremy Fox, president of Channel 9 Australia, to
develop Virgin's broadcast interests, including a possible bid for Channel
5.
Mr Fox will stay as president of Channel 9, the international arm of Mr
Kerry Packer's television interests. He said: 'The plan is to put the Virgin
style on television to appeal to an audience that knows the Virgin brand.'
The growing interest in Channel 5 comes as the Independent Television
Commission meets today to decide whether to advertise a licence for the
channel. All the signs are that it will approved the new channel, and could
advertise the franchise by early November.
The channel would require the retuning of existing video recorders and new
aerials in some areas but is seen as one of the last broadcasting
opportunities with existing technology in a big European market.
Others who have expressed interest include NBC, the US network broadcaster,
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, the ITV company, and a consortium of Time Warner,
Pearson - which owns the Financial Times - and MAI, the company that
controls Meridian Broadcasting.
Mr Stephen Castell, a communications consultant, intends to bid to use the
channel capacity for digital television services.
The big issue is the range the channel will have. The original frequency
plan envisaged that Channel 5 could reach about 75 per cent of the
population. The government, heavily influenced by Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade and industry secretary, decided to set some of the frequencies aside
for the future development of digital terrestrial television.
As a result little more than 53 per cent of the country would be sure of
receiving Channel 5, although the ITC is already seeking international
permission to use new frequencies. A final reach of more than 60 per cent is
likely and there is a theoretical possibility that 70 per cent could
eventually receive the new channel.
The CanWest bid for the channel is being co-ordinated by Media Ventures
International, which bid successfully for the UK's third national commercial
radio licence with UK Talk Radio. CanWest is an investor in the station.
Media Ventures also bid successfully with Associated Newspapers for the ITV
teletext licence.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Private funds could build nuclear plant says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may be possible to build a nuclear power station in the UK entirely with
private-sector finance, according to a report by NM Rothschild, the City
merchant bank.
The report, commissioned by Nuclear Electric, the state-owned utility, will
be submitted to the government's nuclear review which closes at the end of
this month. It will also be made public.
In its submission to the review earlier this summer NE said that a new
nuclear power station could not be built without a measure of government
financial backing.
Mr Michael Kirwan, NE's finance director, told the FT conference on nuclear
power yesterday that Rothschild's conclusions depended on a number of
conditions. One was that a station could not be built as a stand-alone
project, but would have to be linked with Nuclear Electric's operations.
The report suggests that a privatised nuclear industry would be more
successful in raising private-sector finance than one backed by government
and liable to political influence.
Nuclear Electric, which wants to be privatised, hopes that the review will
result in approval for a third Sizewell nuclear plant costing Pounds 3.5bn.
Mr Roger Hayes, director-general of the British Nuclear Industry Forum, the
nuclear trade group, said that the government would have to 'shake up' the
way the capital markets work if they did not have the vision to invest in a
long-term nuclear industry.

FT  15 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Accords may hurt poorer countries -
Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round represents a victory for
multilateralism and diminishes the threat of mutually antagonistic trading
blocs, the latest United Nations Trade and Development Report says.
But poorer developing world countries may be disadvantaged by some aspects
of the accords which will erode the value of preferential tariffs and could
raise the costs of technology and foodstuffs imports. Enabling developing
countries to benefit from trade liberalisation is 'a key challenge to the
international community'.
It suggests that help is needed in areas such as services, infrastructure,
improved investment conditions, and access to international financing. It
also highlights the need to help developing countries with marketing
techniques.
Average tariff levels on industrial products in developed nations will be
cut by 38 per cent to an average of 3.9 per cent. But high tariffs remain
for 'sensitive' items subject to competition from low-cost countries such as
leather goods in Japan and textiles and clothing in the US.
In agriculture, the industrialised countries have converted import
restrictions into equivalent tariffs which will be cut by 36 per cent over
six years.
According to Unctad's analysis, this has produced duty levels as high as
1,000 per cent for some items. Even at the end of the six-year period both
EU and Japan will be have tariffs on non-tropical farm products averaging
over 20 per cent.

The Indian government said yesterday it plans to liberalise import of
consumer goods, and warned industries to prepare for stiff foreign
competition, AP reports from New Delhi.
High import tariffs on consumer items such as television sets,
refrigerators, music equipment, soaps and cosmetics have shielded Indian
producers over the years.
'The time has come to tell industry that the government cannot afford to
provide a high level of protection to Indian industry, particularly in the
consumer goods sector, for an indefinite period,' the finance minister, Mr
Manmohan Singh, told businessmen.

China has begun what is expected to be long and intensive negotiations with
its main trading partners in a final push to become a founder member of the
World Trade Organisation, due to succeed Gatt next January, writes Frances
Williams in Geneva.
An initial three-day round of tariff negotiations with the US ends today.
They were aimed at resolving outstanding problems before calling another
meeting of Gatt's working party on Chinese membership to draft the terms of
entry.
There seems to be growing optimism that the eight-year-old negotiations can
be successfully completed by the end of the year, although officials warn
many pitfalls remain.

FT  15 SEP 94 / World Trade News: EU power struggle makes Gatt approval
another cliffhanger - Uruguay Round ratification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just as prospects of swift congressional approval of the Uruguay Round are
starting to brighten in Washington, the fate of the world trade deal faces
another cliffhanger in Brussels.
EU efforts to endorse the round in time to bring it into effect on schedule
at the start of next year are threatened by a internal power struggle.
Unless the row can be defused in the next three weeks, EU ratification could
face indefinite delays, even deadlock.
'Time is very short. Any slippage means things risk going completely off the
rails,' says one European trade policy expert. Prolonged uncertainty could
not only prevent the EU from acting in time to implement the deal and set up
the new World Trade Organisation. It could also reduce the impetus for swift
ratification in other member countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt, is sufficiently worried to
have visited Brussels this week to urge the EU to set aside its internal
differences and make approving the round its top priority.
In contrast to the US, where some in Congress oppose the deal, there is
widespread support for it in the EU Council of Ministers, the European
parliament and national legislatures, all of which will be involved in
ratification.
The problem arises from a dispute between the European Commission and the
Council over the legal basis on which the deal should be approved. Because
of the wrangle, the Commission has yet to submit a legislative text to the
Council. The Commission argues it should be ratified under those articles of
the Rome and Maastricht treaties that give it exclusive authority to
negotiate on trade. That is disputed by most member governments, led by
France - increasingly suspicious of the Commission and resentful of farm
trade concessions made by Brussels in Gatt negotiations last year.
They object that the Commission's existing authority does not extend to the
Uruguay Round's ground-breaking agreements in areas such as services and
intellectual property rights, and that these require another legal basis.
Last spring, the Commission asked the European Court to clarify the legal
situation. It is particularly worried that continuing confusion could
undermine EU participation in the Gatt and the WTO, the more powerful body
due to succeed it at the start of next year.
Some senior Commission officials now say involving the court was a tactical
error. However, a spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, the trade commissioner,
said: 'We are not trying to take away sovereignty from member states. We
just want an amicable, workable arrangement.'
In search of a compromise, the German presidency of the council has
suggested a 'code of conduct', designed to enable the EU to continue to act
as one in external trade negotiations. The code, in the process of being
drafted, is expected to argue for 'mixed competence' in trade policy between
Commission and member states, supported by mechanisms for resolving rows
between them.
The Commission says it is willing to consider the code as an alternative to
a court opinion. However, Belgium and Spain, for different reasons, have
expressed strong reservations about the code, which Germany is due to submit
to a foreign ministers' council on October 4.
That may be the last opportunity for a deal which would enable the
Commission to withdraw its legal case before the court starts oral hearings
on it a week later. Once in train, the court proceedings cannot be halted.
If the court failed to reach a quick decision which also endorsed the
Commission's position, EU ratification could drag on until after the end of
the year and the legal dispute could be made still more difficult.
In theory, the Council could force the issue by amending provisions in the
Commission's Uruguay Round legislation with which it disagreed. However, it
would have to vote unanimously and would be unlikely to win the support of
Belgium, the only member state openly to support the Commission's position.
It is also uncertain how such tactics would be received in the European
Parliament, which must be consulted on ratification of the round.
But it is unclear that even adoption of the proposed code and withdrawal of
the Commission's court case would be enough to clear away the problems, in
the absence of a wider agreement on the legal basis for ratification.
The EU's smaller member states have been particularly adamant about the need
for firm legal underpinnings, though there is still no clear consensus in
the Council on what form they should take.
One way in which delays could be avoided would be for all 12 national
parliaments to ratify the Uruguay Round deal - as they will eventually have
to do - before the end of the year. This was the solution urged in Brussels
this week by Mr Sutherland, who argued that the unanimous support for the
trade agreement in EU capitals meant that parliaments had every reason to
endorse it swiftly.
So far, however, only the British, German and Greek parliaments have
ratified the deal. In several other countries, legislatures have been
holding back until the rights and wrongs of the EU legal dispute are
clarified.

FT  15 SEP 94 / World Trade News: US anti-dumping battle predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US multinational companies and subsidiaries of foreign companies in the US
have mounted a lobbying effort against an obscure provision in the Uruguay
Round aimed at implementing legislation which they said would lead to the
levying of punitive anti-dumping duties on imported products.
The European-American Chamber of Commerce, one of the industry groups
mobilised for the fight, said the proposed export sales price (ESP)
amendment in the Senate version of the implementing legislation
discriminates against multinational companies that have operations on both
sides of the Atlantic.
The provision is in a final version of the Uruguay Round legislation still
being hammered out in a House-Senate committee. The committee is expected to
send it to the White House in the next two weeks. The president will then
almost immediately submit the legislation to Congress under fast-track
authority, which means Congress must vote yes or no but cannot amend it.
The ESP provision would amend current US dumping law and change the way
prices are calculated to determine whether foreign goods are being 'dumped'
in the US market. The proposal is supported by Senator Ernest Hollings, an
unabashed protectionist, as well as Senator Max Baucus, usually a free
trader who chairs the trade subcommittee.
Domestic US companies in favour of the provision, include steel and ball
bearing makers which mostly supply the US market, are calling for a
strengthening of US trade laws to protect US companies from 'predatory'
practices.
Clinton administration officials have expressed concern but hesitate to
weigh in while they are rounding up votes for final passage of the Uruguay
Round package.

FT  15 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Foreign chips take 21.9% of Japan's market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The foreign share of Japan's semiconductor market rose to a record 21.9 per
cent in the second quarter of 1994. This surpassed the 20 per cent target
set in the second US-Japan semiconductor trade agreement, signed in 1991,
for the third consecutive quarter.
The increase in market share is 'a very welcome development,' said Mr Mickey
Kantor, US trade representative. 'Both the Japanese and US industries are to
be commended.' However, neither the Japanese nor US industries 'can afford
to be complacent,' he warned.
'This is a trade agreement that works,' said the Semiconductor Industry
Association, a trade group representing US chip makers. Japanese industry
officials, however, reiterated their position that market share is only one
of several measures of market access.
The controversial chip pact has become a model for US bilateral agreements
with Japan. It was the first such agreement to incorporate 'numerical
indicators' of market access, specifically a 20 per cent foreign market
share target, to be achieved by the end of 1992 and 'continued, steady
progress' throughout the rest of the deal's five-year period which expires
in 1996.
Japan attempted in July to terminate the semiconductor agreement, the SIA
said. During a mid-term review of the agreement that took place in
Washington in July, the Japanese government called for the semiconductor
agreement to be set aside. US trade officials flatly rejected the call.
'We hope that Japan's effort to terminate prematurely the agreement is not
an indication of a lack of commitment to continue to improve market access,'
the SIA said.
The US wants quantitative measures of market access to be incorporated in
agreements that it is attempting to negotiate with Japan on insurance, cars
and government procurement. Japan has so far rejected the US demands and
negotiations continue under a US threat of trade sanctions.

This is close to levels last seen in the mid-1980s.
Imports are likely to grow about 6 per cent in real terms over the same

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nintendo of America, the US arm of the Japanese video game manufacturer, has
filed a suit in California against Taiwan's largest semiconductor
manufacturer, alleging counterfeiting of proprietary video game chips.
The suit against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) of
Hsin-Chu, Taiwan and its US subsidiary seeks damages and an injunction to
prevent future US sales. An estimated 61 per cent of TSMC's worldwide sales
are in the US, according to Nintendo. 'Our investigation discovered
counterfeit chips manufactured by TSMC contained in illegal Nintendo video
game products in at least nine countries across three continents,' said Ms
Lynn Hvalsoe, Nintendo's general counsel.
'The discovery of these counterfeit chips clearly demonstrates that Taiwan
remains a worldwide centre for video game counterfeiting, despite its
government's repeated pledges to halt the manufacture and sale of these
illegal products.'
Mr Donald Brooks, TSMC's president, said the company was 'shocked and
disappointed' at the allegations. 'We're a foundry, which means we
manufacture integrated circuits for other companies based on designs which
they provide us,' he said last night. 'If there's been an infringement of
intellectual property rights, we're not aware of it.' TSMC had not been
contacted by Nintendo, he said.
Nintendo said it had discovered counterfeit semiconductor chips in illegal
copies of its Super Nintendo and Super Famicom home video game machines
being sold in Colombia, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong. In addition,
counterfeit video game software and security chips allegedly manufactured by
TSMC were found in games being sold in Europe, Latin America, and Asia.
Nintendo said it had asked the US government to request Taiwan closely to
scrutinise TSMC's exports to prevent the export of semiconductor chips that
infringe on Nintendo's intellectual property rights.

FT  15 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Unctad criticises restrictive economic
policies of west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leading industrialised nations are running restrictive economic policies
which are suppressing global demand and contributing to high unemployment
and international trade frictions, according to the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development.
The organisation's latest Trade and Development Report also unabashedly
favours demand management and the efficacy, at least in some circumstances,
of government intervention to hasten economic development.
The report forecasts world economic growth of only 2.5 per cent this year,
far slower than normal in a recovery and below the sustainable long-term
growth rate.
The current policy consensus among western governments and the main
multilateral agencies such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank
neglects the importance of effective demand and invariably treats inflation
as a more serious threat than unemployment, the report says.
The result has been a persistent deficiency of global demand which has
promoted 'the mistaken - and mercantilist - notion that countries should
seek growth by improving their overall competitiveness vis-a-vis other
countries'.
The report points out it is impossible for all countries to improve their
relative competitiveness.
If demand is insufficient, higher productivity will raise unemployment
rather than output, it says. 'Global demand deficiency is a recipe for
wasting the world's productive potential and an invitation to conflict among
nations.'
It says financial deregulation has increased the need for demand management.
Deregulation has encouraged 'waves of private debt and credit creation and
contraction which have spawned disturbing speculation' and produced large
current account imbalances, which have put strains on foreign exchange
markets and the trading system.
The report, deliberately released before the forthcoming annual IMF-World
Bank meeting, urges the world's three leading economic powers, and
particularly their monetary authorities, to act to boost growth:
The US 'needs to be cautious in applying monetary brakes', so as not to
stifle the recovery of investment and employment;
Western Europe needs to cut interest rates 'substantially for a prolonged
period' and to postpone tackling inflated budget deficits until recovery is
well under way. The European Union should delay plans for monetary union in
1996 or relax restrictive conditions agreed at Maastricht;
Japan should loosen monetary policy and expand domestic demand and
consumption. Otherwise, the report warns, it could soon have unemployment
levels matching those in the US.
Unctad extends its thesis to the developing world where, it says, the
pendulum has swung too far in favour of leaving private enterprise to get on
with the job. The report points to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan as cases
where government intervention proved highly effective in forcing the pace of
development. The 'economic miracle' in these countries 'was not entirely a
miracle of the market', the report says.
While admitting that these examples cannot necessarily be replicated, Unctad
argues policymakers need to accept there may be different models of
development that work.
The report also points out that the Uruguay Round global trade agreements
will in time prevent many developing countries from using some measures
employed successfully in east Asia such as export incentives, import
controls and restrictions on foreign investment.
Developing countries' growth should average about 4 per cent this year,
Unctad says, though there is a widening gap between rapid growth in east and
south-east Asia and Africa's dismal performance. It argues that many of
Africa's problems reflect weak prices and lack of external finance, the
report argues.
It also has doubts about recent improvement in Latin American growth rates,
which it sees as excessively dependent on consumption and inflow of foreign
funds, mainly in the form of high risk 'junk' bonds and one-off investments
related to privatisation.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Baseball season brought to an end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last night Americans, or at least those who care about what really matters,
were glumly facing the fact that next month will be like no peacetime
October in 90 years. The rest of the baseball season, including the
climactic World Series championship, was cancelled.
After 34 days of a strike by the players, the inevitably curtain was finally
rung down by Mr Bud Selig, who is both acting commissioner of baseball and
owner of the Milwaukee Brewers team. 'This is a sad day,' he said.
Mr Mario Cuomo, the governor of New York and once a promising young
professional himself, probably expressed national emotions more accurately,
if neutrally. 'It was a wicked thing to do; a really wicked thing,' he
lamented over the loss of what had promised to be a record-breaking season
for several players (and possibly a championship one for the New York
Yankees).
Mr Selig naturally blamed the players, who walked out on August 12 after
complex, protracted negotiations over a new contract broke down. The strike,
he said, 'leaves us with no choice'. Actually, the owners of two clubs, the
Baltimore Orioles and the Cincinnati Reds, voted against turning off the
lights, but there was no sign they would barnstorm the nation and play each
other exclusively for the next month.
This was baseball's eighth industrial dispute in the last 22 years.
The technical sticking point was the players' refusal to accept the owners'
proposal of a cap on team salaries, designed to distribute revenues more
evenly among the rich and poor clubs.
But it would be wrong to ascribe the breakdown to the greed of the players
(minimum salary Dollars 109,000 - Pounds 70,000 - a year, maximum individual
contract Dollars 31,500 a game). The owners themselves have failed to
address revenue-sharing for years and have consistently refused to open
their books to the public or the players' union.
Since the walk-out, it has been the players who have made all the
negotiating proposals and who contended last night that the owners' action
was premature.
It is far from clear that there will be a next season. Spring training
normally resumes late in February. Both sides have some hard thinking to do
over the winter.

FT  15 SEP 94 / N-fuel imports blocked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US federal judge has blocked shipments of spent nuclear fuel from European
research reactors, throwing into chaos the US's policy of reducing the
volume of bomb-type highly enriched uranium in use around the world. The
move also jeopardises US credibility in talks under way in Geneva on
renewing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Judge Matthew Perry granted an injunction to the state of South Carolina
barring the Department of Energy from storing 409 fuel rods from Europe at
the Savannah River nuclear plant.
The department is expected to appeal against the decision, which has thrown
a spanner into the US's 30-year-old off-site fuel programme, under which the
US agreed to accept spent fuel in exchange for participating foreign
reactors' commitment to switch to less dangerous low enriched fuel.
The trust of the European reactors which signed up for the off-site fuel
programme was stretched to breaking point when the US broke its side of the
bargain for five years, following a lawsuit brought by environmentalists.
Some developing countries point to the US's failure to live up to its
commitments as a good reason why they should not agree to an indefinite
extension of the NPT.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Marion Barry's comeback gets primary boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Marion Barry's resounding victory in Tuesday's Democratic primary ballot
puts him just one step away from reclaiming the office of mayor of
Washington, which he lost four years ago when the Federal Bureau of
Investigation arrested him on cocaine charges.
Mr Barry's campaign has seemed at times to be less a political comeback than
a personal resurrection, but he won 47 per cent of the primary votes, seeing
off Councilman John Ray, his principal rival, and crushing Mrs Sharon Pratt
Kelly, the incumbent mayor.
In overwhelmingly Democratic Washington, Mr Barry's primary victory is
expected to guarantee him victory in the November election, even though his
Republican and independent opponents are expected to reap an unusually large
number of 'anyone but Barry' votes.
Barry promised that God's power, which had redeemed him from sin, would
'lift the city of Washington off its knees'. But his comeback seems likely
to place Washington, which as the US capital remains under Congress
supervision and has enjoyed limited self-rule for the last 20 years, under
tighter scrutiny.
The congressional committees overseeing Washington's spending forced Ms
Kelly to cut her budget this year, and they are expected to keep Mr Barry,
who spent freely in his 12 year tenure as mayor, on a very short financial
rein.
In other closely fought primaries on Tuesday, Governor Arne Carlson of
Minnesota won the Republican nomination, fending off a challenge from a
candidate backed by the evangelical Christian right.
Three other incumbent governors - Republicans Fife Symington of Arizona and
Steve Merrill of New Hampshire and Democrat Mario Cuomo of New York - also
won primaries. But Democratic Governor Bruce Sundlun of Rhode Island was
defeated by state senator Myrth York.

FT  15 SEP 94 / New look for banking industry: Banks have already found ways
round laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will scrapping the remaining barriers to nationwide banking hasten the
reshaping of the US banking industry? The question has been debated in bank
boardrooms for years. Now, with the final passage of the interstate banking
law on Tuesday, it is time for the reckoning.
In some ways, the adoption of full interstate banking should make little
practical difference. Thanks to changes to state laws in recent years and
the growth of finance company subsidiaries, many banks have already extended
their reach around the country.
The legislation that prevented interstate banking came in two parts. First,
in 1927, the McFadden Act effectively prohibited banks from running branches
in other states. The Douglas Amendment to the 1956 Bank Holding Company Act
prohibited the takeover of banking companies in other states, unless those
states' laws allowed it. At the time, none did.
These laws have less force than they once did. In 1975, Maine became the
first state to allow out-of-state institutions to buy local banks. Sixteen
others have followed suit, while 26 more allow ownership by holding
companies based in states which give reciprocal rights.
States have also relaxed bank takeover laws in times of financial distress
to let outsiders rescue troubled local institutions. In Texas, the three
biggest banks succumbed to the real estate collapse of the 1980s. Chemical
Banking of New York, NationsBank of North Carolina and BancOne of Ohio now
control nearly 40 per cent of Texas's banking deposits, equivalent to
Dollars 55bn (Pounds 35.4bn) at the end of 1992.
This encroachment of banks across state lines through acquisition has taken
hold rapidly in a few years. At the end of 1992, more than a fifth of all
bank assets in the US were in the hands of out-of-state institutions,
compared with just 6 per cent in 1987.
Where they have not expanded through acquisition, banks have found ways
around the legal barriers. One approach has been to hive off their
fastest-growing consumer businesses, such as credit cards, into non-bank
companies which can operate outside the scope of banking legislation.
Chase Manhattan, the New York money-centre bank, owns a string of finance
companies. 'We couldn't expand in the traditional way, we were prohibited,'
says Mr Arthur Ryan, bank president. 'But in hindsight, we found that it was
a very effective way of doing it.'
Despite these inroads, considerable obstacles to interstate banking remain.
One is the 'South-Eastern Compact', a loose arrangement between states in
the region. Designed to protect local institutions from takeover by powerful
New York banks, the compact has of late had the effect of hindering banks
based in the region which want to expand elsewhere in the country. One by
one, states in the south-east have already started to pass local laws to
drop their restrictions.
A second obstacle is the inability of banks to set up branches in other
states. Only 43 of the US's 56,000 bank branches in 1992 were operated by
banks from another state. For bank customers who regularly cross state
lines, this causes great inconvenience. A customer of Citibank in New York,
for instance, cannot deposit money in a branch of Citibank in Connecticut:
it is a legally separate bank.
The growth of automated teller machine networks has alleviated some of the
inconvenience, but lifting the ban on setting up branches will make life
easier for millions of Americans.
A third obstacle to running an interstate banking group has been cost.
NationsBank puts the extra administrative costs (of running a series of
separate boards and meeting federal and state reporting requirements) at
Dollars 50m a year, while BankAmerica puts its own extra costs at Dollars
75m. 'That Dollars 75m adds zero to the safety and soundness of the banking
system,' says Mr Richard Rosenberg, chairman of BankAmerica.
For the banking industry, though, perhaps the most significant question is
whether the new legislation will give added impetus to the takeover and
merger wave that has been under way since the late 1980s.
Some banks which are already active acquirers play down the significance of
the law.
Others, though, argue that the legislation could provide the spark which
ignites another flurry of big acquisitions. Mr Robert Gillespie, president
and chief operating officer of KeyCorp, which itself vaulted into the top 10
with a merger this year, says of the legislation: 'It doesn't change the
economics of the industry, but it gives everybody an excuse (to make
acquisitions.) No-one wants to get left without a chair when the music
stops.'
Some mergers are already being justified on the grounds that interstate
banking will make local banking markets more competitive. Last month two
North Carolina banks, BB&amp;T Financial and Southern National, merged to form
an institution with assets of Dollars 18bn.
These are issues being debated by bank boards around the country. Mr Leo
Mullen, president of First Chicago, says: 'There is no essential reason why
we have to merge, or be acquired. But having said that, there's no question
that certainly (our) businesses benefit from scale. . . If we could hook up
with the right situation, there's no doubt it would be useful.'
And, although the pace of bank mergers has slowed in recent months, most
senior executives in the industry expect the consolidation to continue. 'We
will see a continuing acceleration of transactions, and the transactions
will get bigger,' Mr John McCoy, chairman of BancOne, said recently. It is a
view widely shared by his counterparts in other banks. The only thing they
are not agreed on is, who will be next?
KEY POINTS OF US REFORM INCLUDE:
Bank holding companies may acquire a bank in any state, starting in one
year.
Banks in separate states may merge, from June 1 1997, unless either state
has 'opted out' by passing a law to ban such interstate mergers.
Banks could open new branches outside their home states only if states 'opt
in' by passing a law to allow it.
Foreign banks would have the same right to open new branches as US banks,
whether they operate in the US through a separate subsidiary or through a
direct branch from their home country. But foreign banks could be required
to establish a subsidiary if US bank regulators deem it necessary to verify
their capital adequacy.
A separate measure would extend the statute of limitations to allow the
federal regulators to revive claims against officials of failed savings and
loans or banks in cases of egregious fraud or intentional misconduct, but
not of simple negligence.

FT  15 SEP 94 / US 'committed to occupation of Haiti': Clinton assails junta
as 'most brutal, most violent' in the hemisphere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US is committed to leading a temporary multinational occupation of Haiti
even if the military junta in Port-au-Prince agrees to leave the island
immediately, according to a senior administration official yesterday.
Ahead of President Bill Clinton's pivotal televised address to the nation
tonight, Mr Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary of state, said the presence of
such a force would be required to establish 'basic civic order' before the
restoration of the ousted government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Mr Clinton himself accused the junta of rampant human rights abuses and
vowed to oust them by force if necessary but said they still had a chance to
leave voluntarily.
'We have literally exhausted every available alternative and the time has
come for those people to get out. They can still leave. They do not have to
push this to a confrontation,' he told wire service reporters.
He said Haiti's dictators were the 'most brutal, most violent regime
anywhere in our hemisphere', responsible for 3,000 political murders since
they took power in 1991. Sifting through pictures of blood-spattered
victims, he blamed the military for the deaths of orphans, church people and
others and accused them of using rape as a political weapon.
Earlier, Mr Talbott was asked if anything could now prevent the invasion of
Haiti, and replied that even if 'belatedly the three principal dictators get
the message and leave, it will still be necessary for an international force
to be deployed anyway'.
Mr Clinton's challenge tonight is severe, given the extent of political and
public doubts about the wisdom of US involvement in a country whose
intrinsic importance to the US is doubted.
Other officials, including Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, and Mr
Leon Panetta, White House chief of staff, have given interviews preparing
the ground for Mr Clinton. But there is no substitute for the president, as
commander-in-chief, to make the case for despatching US forces into danger,
even when, as in Haiti, the strength of military opposition is probably
nugatory.
Mr Talbott was intent on minimising the longer-term US exposure and
maximising international support for the operation. He repeated that, after
the initial invasion, the multinational force from 20 or more countries
would comprise about 6,000 personnel, less than half of them American.
But the prevailing mood in Washington, reinforced by Mr Talbott's comments,
was that a decision to invade, spearheaded by a 20,000-strong US amphibian
force, had been made and that only the question of timing remained in doubt.
Yesterday another US aircraft carrier, the Eisenhower, left for Haitian
waters to join the America, which sailed on Tuesday.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Beige Book points to uneven growth

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US economic activity continued to expand over the summer, though unevenly,
according to two government reports released yesterday.
The Beige Book, the survey by Federal Reserve Districts of regional economic
activity, said: 'Regions that have been lagging are generally said to be
doing better, while most of the stronger areas saw growth plateau.' US
Commerce Department advance monthly retail sales figures showing a 0.8 per
cent rise in August, up 7 per cent on August 1993.
The Beige Book, prepared for use at the Federal Open Market Committee
meeting on September 27, follows the August 3 report which showed economic
activity growing at a solid pace in most parts of the country. The FOMC
meeting of August 16 raised interest rates by half a percentage point.
The expansion in consumer spending is seen as 'healthy albeit decelerating',
the report said yesterday.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Welcome for US banking bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank industry lobbyists in Washington breathed a sigh of relief yesterday
after the Senate finally passed a bill to allow banks to set up branches
more freely outside their home states.
Sweeping aside last-minute objections to some of the miscellaneous
provisions attached to the bill, the Senate voted 94-4 on Tuesday in favour
of a measure that some of its backers had feared might once again get bogged
down in the legislative process and expire without a vote before Congress
breaks up next month to campaign for the November 8 elections.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, said the bill was 'a major step
forward for the American banking system' that had been sought by the last
four administrations.
'Interstate banking and branching will be beneficial to banks and their
customers as well as the nation's economy as a whole. This bill will allow
banks to reduce expenses by structuring themselves more efficiently,' Mr
Bentsen said.
Key points of the banking bill include:
Bank holding companies may acquire a bank in any state, starting in one
year. Banks in separate states may merge, from June 1 1997, unless either
state has 'opted out' by passing a law to ban such interstate mergers.
Banks could open new branches outside their home states only if states 'opt
in' by passing a law to allow it.
Foreign banks would have the same right to open new branches as US banks,
whether they operate in the US through a separate subsidiary or through a
direct branch from their home country. But foreign banks could be required
to establish a subsidiary if US bank regulators deem it necessary to verify
their capital adequacy.
A separate measure would extend the statute of limitations to allow the
federal regulators to revive claims against officials of failed savings and
loans or banks in cases of egregious fraud or intentional misconduct, but
not of simple negligence.
Over the past 15 years, the state-by-state compartmentalisation of the US
banking system has gradually broken down. Only a handful of states still
forbid any acquisition of their banks by out-of-state bank holding
companies.
At the same time, the inconveniences for customers have diminished as
nationwide cash machine networks allow consumers to withdraw cash when they
leave their home state.
But much of the consolidation has been regional, and banks currently do not
accept deposits across state lines - even from customers of their own
affiliates.
For example, someone who works in Washington DC but lives in the Maryland
suburbs is not allowed to deposit a pay cheque in a Washington branch of
Riggs Bank, even though he or she has an account at Riggs in Maryland.

FT  15 SEP 94 / US researchers isolate breast cancer gene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An American research team has won the race for the most sought-after prize
in science this year - isolating the gene that causes an inherited form of
breast cancer.
Dr Mark Scolnick and colleagues at the University of Utah have found the
gene called BRCA1, responsible for an estimated 3 to 5 per cent of breast
cancers, ahead of a dozen other research groups in the US and Europe.
The discovery was announced last night by the US research journal Science,
which will publish details next month.
At the same time, Science said an international team led by Dr Douglas Eaton
of the Institute of Cancer Research in the UK was well down the road to
isolating a second gene, BRCA2, which probably causes another 3 to 5 per
cent of breast cancers.
Finding the two genes will enable scientists to develop tests that women
with a family history of breast cancer can take, to discover whether they
are individually at risk of developing an inherited form of the disease.
Prototype tests for BRCA1 may be available within two years.
Women who know they carry the genes will be able better to monitor
themselves for early signs of cancer - or even have a mastectomy as a
precaution. Those whose tests are negative, in spite of a family history,
will be reassured.
But scientists say the discoveries will eventually also help the 90 per cent
of breast cancer patients whose disease is not inherited. Random mutations
in the same genes are probably involved there too - and understanding the
chemical processes by which BRCA1 and BRCA2 trigger cancer will help
researchers develop drugs to treat the disease.
'These are very exciting stepping stones on the path to more effective
treatment and diagnosis of breast cancer,' said Dr Bruce Ponder, a UK Cancer
Research Campaign scientist working at Cambridge University on cancer genes.
'But it's important for people to realise that there are no immediate
practical consequences.'
The search for breast cancer genes - described last year by Dr James Watson,
a founder of modern genetics, as the most exciting story in medical science
 -has caught the scientific and popular imagination. The National Cancer
Institute and the US Army have responded to health lobbyists by devoting
many millions of dollars to the quest.

FT  15 SEP 94 / High anxiety for Hurd in Hong Kong: UK foreign secretary
flies in as China attacks Jardine group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's attack on the Jardine group has ensured that the visit to Hong Kong
by Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, which starts today will be
conducted in an atmosphere of high anxiety.
Beijing's decision to turn up the heat on Hong Kong's British administrators
is consistent with the gloomy foreign office assessment of the outlook for
Sino-British co-operation on the colony's transfer to China.
With less than three years before Hong Kong is handed back to China, British
officials have told Mr Hurd they expect another period of hard slog with
little progress being made on a growing agenda needed to ensure a smooth
transfer of power in 1997.
There is also a growing view in the colony that China's latest moves have
exposed the contradiction at the heart of British policy towards its last
great colonial possession.
This policy seeks both an honourable withdrawal from Hong Kong, and a smooth
transition to Chinese sovereignty for the colony. Yet, the more Britain
pursues honour the more it seems likely that Hong Kong's transition to
Chinese rule will be a bumpy one.
The optimism engendered by an apparent thaw in relations - the high-water
mark of which was an agreement on the distribution of military land in June
 -has swiftly given way to pessimism in the face of a discernible hardening
in Beijing's attitude toward the UK and Hong Kong.
Two months ago a comprehensive settlement to two of the most important
outstanding commercial issues - the financing of Hong Kong's new airport,
and approval for the extension of the colony's container port - seemed
within grasp. Today they appear as remote as ever.
Beijing has already made it known that it expects little from a meeting
between Mr Hurd and Mr Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, in New York at
the end of the month. The best guess by the British foreign office for the
abrupt change in China's position is that Beijing reassessed its position in
light of the events of June this year.
First there was the Legislative Council's vote at the end of June on
Governor Chris Patten's plans to liberalise the colony's 1995 elections.
During this vote Beijing attempted to persuade LegCo members to vote against
the governor, but failed. Beijing concluded from its defeat that that it
should have stayed out of the process.
Second, the proximity of the defence lands deal to the vote - it came the
morning after LegCo voted for Mr Patten - and the optimism over an early
airport agreement allowed the governor to claim his policy of standing tough
with China on democracy had worked. With conspicuous foreign policy
successes elsewhere Beijing could not allow Mr Patten's claim of victory to
stand.
Indeed over the past months Britain's isolation from the rest of the world
in its policy towards China has deepened. The UK is the only permanent
member of the United Nations security council in conflict with China. Over
the past six months the US, France and German have all moved to repair
relations with Beijing by downplaying human rights and emphasising trade and
economic development.
British officials say they still remain optimistic that at the end of day
China will agree terms on airport finance. They are more concerned about the
port because Beijing appears to have made its approval contingent on the
ejection of the Jardine group from a consortium extending the facility.
One senior British official said it would not improve Hong Kong's position
as a place to invest if business people had to look over their shoulder to
the political master.
What concerns the UK more, however, is China's attitude to the work of the
Joint Liaison Group (JLG), a bilateral commission established by the 1984
Joint Declaration to enable a smooth transfer of sovereignty in 1997. The
JLG shows every sign of being moribund. Since 1989 it has transacted only
two significant pieces of business - the 1991 agreement on Hong Kong's court
of final appeal, and the military lands agreement of this June.
Mr Patten warned last October, when opening the 1993/94 session on the
LegCo, of a legal vacuum in Hong Kong after the resumption of Chinese
sovereignty if the JLG did not get moving on 'localising' Hong Kong's law.
Progress has been glacial.
There is a raft of air service agreements between Hong Kong and the rest of
the world awaiting Beijing's approval. Also awaiting the nod from Beijing is
the ratification of many international agreements to which Hong Kong is
currently bound because of its link with Britain and which will lapse unless
China gives its approval.
Optimists among the foreign secretary's advisers point to the continuous ebb
and flow of Sino-British relations, of which the current period is just
another ebb. They foresee a situation where the two agree the main
commercial matters outstanding - the airport, port development, big business
franchises which need Beijing blessing - later than would be optimal, but
nevertheless in time. JLG matters, such as localising Hong Kong's law, may
well be left right up until the last months of British rule.

FT  15 SEP 94 / South African unions embrace pragmatism: But the new
approach is not necessarily permanent, writes Mark Suzman from the Cosatu
congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the surface things have never looked better for South Africa's labour
movement. After years of an apartheid regime overtly hostile to unions, an
openly sympathetic government is now in power.
Furthermore, trade union membership has started to rise again after
contracting over the past few years, and, at 37.2 per cent of the workforce,
is the highest in the developing world.
But rather than the celebrations that were expected, the national congress
last week of the 1.3m-strong Congress of South African Trade Unions, the
country's most powerful labour federation, proved to be an occasion for
heated discussion and soul-searching as the movement sought to redefine its
role.
To respectful but unenthusiastic applause, in the opening address President
Nelson Mandela praised Cosatu's role in the anti-apartheid struggle, but
called on workers to think of the country's 5m unemployed rather than
looking just to their own relatively privileged position.
'Without us tightening our belts it will be difficult to get our economy to
grow,' he warned.
The speech served as a reminder of the challenges faced by the labour
movement in the new era.
Despite the fact that Cosatu's formal political allies, the African National
Congress and South African Communist party, dominate the ruling government
of national unity, tensions between the labour movement and administration
have risen considerably over a wave of strikes by Cosatu affiliates.
Although the ANC remains broadly supportive of labour's demands, its
greatest concern is fostering economic growth and job creation. To that end
it wants to dampen labour militancy to encourage foreign investment.
However continued labour militancy combined with the country's relatively
high wages for a developing country - South African workers earn comparable
salaries to workers in successful Asian economies such as South Korea and
Taiwan, almost double the pay-rate in Brazil and nearly four times that in
India - serve as a continued deterrent to prospective investors.
The ANC has also clashed with Cosatu on industrial restructuring, and union
members reacted with anger to an announcement some two weeks ago that the
government was cutting tariffs on car imports by an effective 20 per cent.
They charged that the decision undermined workers' bargaining position in
negotiations in the strike in the motor industry, forcing them into a
premature settlement.
Underlying these disputes is Cosatu's fear that the new regime may start to
adopt an anti-union attitude. Mr Enoch Godongwana, secretary general of the
National Union of Motorworkers of South Africa, argues that in Africa
political leaders have a 'history of betrayal' towards organised labour
after taking power, and Cosatu is determined that the same thing should not
happen in South Africa.
Part of the movement's difficulties stem from the very closeness of its ties
to the new government.
According to a report commissioned by the National Labour and Economic
Development Institute, 80 top union officials have left the movement in the
past year, most of them to join the administration.
So much of the leadership is unproven and lacks the authority to control
more radical shopfloor leaders. Several of the recent strikes continued well
after union negotiators were willing to settle when they proved unable to
rein in their activist membership.
In implicit acknowledgement of this, the main outcome of the conference was
a decision to concentrate on what Mr John Gomomo, Cosatu president, calls a
'back to basics' policy, focusing on new recruitment, consolidating local
affiliates and addressing work-related grievances.
But on the all-important political issue, the congress overwhelmingly voted
down a proposal to end its partnership with the ANC and form a
left-of-centre Workers party, instead electing 'to strengthen the tripartite
alliance'.
However, the federation was careful to link these resolutions to a strong
appeal for the institutionalisation of collective bargaining at a national
level via the soon-to-be-established National Economic Development and
Labour Council.
This is a tripartite body that will contain representatives from business,
government and labour.
So far, therefore, Cosatu seems to be indicating its support for
consolidating and expanding the 'golden triangle' of business, government
and labour that has beennurtured over the past two years by outgoing finance
minister Mr Derek Keys.
'The thread that goes through the congress is that workers must be involved
in all strategic decision-making, on the shop floor, in management and in
government,' said Mr Sam Shilowa, Cosatu general secretary who was
re-elected unopposed.
But, the organisation warned, the tripartite alliance was 'not permanent and
shall from time to time be reviewed as conditions dictate.'

FT  15 SEP 94 / Indonesia accused of rights abuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A human rights group yesterday accused Indonesia of human rights abuses
including torture and the arbitrary use of power, in a wide-ranging report,
Reuter reports from Jakarta.
The 83-page report, 'The Limits of Openness', focused mainly on Indonesia's
ban on three magazines in June, the troubled territory of East Timor, worker
rights and a crackdown on members of a Christian church in Sumatra.
'All these cases involve major violations of internationally recognised
human rights,' the report by Human Rights Watch/Asia, formerly Asia Watch,
said.
'But more to the point, these cases illustrate the pervasiveness of the
harassment that ordinary Indonesians suffer on a daily basis. Torture is
used routinely to punish and intimidate as well as obtain information.
'If there is a constant in Indonesian politics today, it is the
arbitrariness inherent in periods of tolerance or crackdown.'
The detailed report comes two months before Indonesia hosts an informal
summit of the 17-member Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) group. It
called for a public statement explicitly outlawing torture at all times,
while welcoming Jakarta's move to invite UN officials to visit East Timor
and some reforms on worker rights.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Japan's trade surplus showsfall of 18.8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's summer heatwave produced an unexpectedly large 18.8 per cent fall in
the August trade surplus, the first year on year drop for three months.
A nearly 24 per cent rise in oil imports, caused by a surge in electricity
demand as the country turned up its air-conditioners, was the main feature
in a narrowing in the trade gap to Dollars 6.08bn (Pounds 4.05bn) last
month, from Dollars 7.49bn in August last year. This was a surprise for the
market, where forecasts had ranged from a slight decline to a moderate rise
in the trade gap.
Overall imports rose by 23.6 per cent to Dollars 25.18bn, also helped by a
gentle rise in underlying demand, while exports climbed less steeply, by
12.2 per cent to Dollars 31.26bn, the finance ministry reported yesterday.
The latest trade balance provides further evidence that the gap is near or
past its peak, ministry officials said. When measured in yen, the surplus
fell by 22.4 per cent.
However, the figures are unlikely to assuage US frustration as it struggles
to make a framework trade agreement with Japan before the end-of-the-month
deadline, after which Washington has threatened to open sanctions
proceedings.
Japan's surplus with the US actually widened in August, for the sixth month
running, up by 2 per cent to Dollars 3.49bn, more than half the total. The
yen accordingly strengthened in Tokyo yesterday, closing up Y0.14 to Y98.53
to the dollar.
However, the trade gap with other Asian countries was even wider than that
with the US, at Dollars 4.01bn, a 3 per cent rise on August last year. The
increase, for the third month running, shows strong exports of plant and
equipment to the growing number of Japanese production sites migrating to
south-east Asia to escape high Japanese costs.
Japan's trade surplus with the European Union continued to fall, for the
eighth month in a row, to Dollars 1.07bn, down 23.9 per cent on the same
month in 1993.
Evidence that corporate Japan is still struggling with problems left by the
recession emerged yesterday in the shape of a 13.6 per cent rise to
Y485.83bn in bankrupt companies' debts last month.
The number of bankruptcies fell by 4.1 per cent in August, to 1,143, said
Teikoku Databank, a credit research agency. It forecast that bankruptcies
would run at more than 1,000 per month for the rest of the year, because of
competition from cheap imports and a shortage of funds.

FT  15 SEP 94 / France welcomes FIS 'release'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France yesterday welcomed the transfer of two opposition Islamic Salvation
Front (FIS) leaders, Mr Abassi Madani and Ali Benhadj, from jail to house
arrest and the freeing of three others, as an important step towards ending
the violence which has claimed 10,000 victims in the past 21 months.
Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, told a cabinet meeting yesterday that the
decision by General Liamine Zeroual, the Algerian head of state, was 'an
important step, showing that dialogue between the Algerian authorities and
the FIS is a reality.'
The minister cautioned, however, against undue optimism, noting: 'It is no
secret that the Islamic movement and no doubt the authorities remain
divided.'
Mr Juppe insisted that France had never 'given unconditional support to the
Algerian government. While understanding the concern of every government to
ensure order and security in its country, we have said that a policy focused
entirely on security would not produce a lasting solution.'
Gen Zeroual's decision was also welcomed by Mr Rabah Kebir, spokesman for
the exiled FIS, who said that his party 'was happy about the liberation of
our leaders. We consider it a positive step but not a sufficient one. All
FIS leaders must be set free, notably Mr Andelkader Hachani, the head of the
party executive at the time of the elections of December 1991.'
Meanwhile, 17 international commercial banks held a meeting with the Banque
d'Algerie, the central bank of Algeria, in Paris on Tuesday to discuss the
restructuring of Dollars 3.1bn (Pounds 2.06bn)-worth of the country's
Dollars 4.7bn commercial debt.
The banks decided to set up a steering committee which will include two
Japanese banks, two Arab banks, one French and one US bank and a Japanese
leasing company.
The next meeting between Algeria and its commercial banks creditors will
take place in the week after the annual meeting of the International
Monetary Fund, due in Madrid in the first week of October.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Naira falls as Nigeria forex fears grow: Businesses turn to
other sources on worries that supply may run out by end of the year

Fears that Nigeria's official supply of foreign exchange will not last until
the end of the year have sent the naira tumbling on the black market since
late August as businesses turn to other sources of foreign currency for
imports.
The street value of the naira to the dollar has fallen from N55 to N68 in
the past fortnight, while the government continues to allocate scarce
dollars at N22, or one-third of the black market value.
The Central Bank of Nigeria's allocation of Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.6m) for
this month met only 3 per cent of demand and takes the total allocated this
year to Dollars 1.4bn.
The government has cut its budget for allocations of foreign exchange to the
private sector from Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 1.9bn.
Many bankers and importers expect another cut in this target by the end of
the year, which would leave manufacturers short of goods and materials and
further depress the unofficial value of the naira.
In January, General Sani Abacha's regime banned the parallel foreign
exchange market and centralised all currency transactions through the
Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) at an official exchange rate of N22 to the
dollar.
The US embassy in Lagos recently exchanged dollars at a rate of N62, almost
three times the official rate, through authorised banks.
An embassy spokesman said the rate was approved by the Nigerian government.
This privilege is denied to private-sector exporters wishing to bring back
their export proceeds.
In May, a committee under Mr Samuel Ogbemudia, labour minister, took control
of currency allocations, including 15 per cent of the official supply which
went to 'priority users'.
These often went through middle men who demanded a premium of about N18 a
dollar for an allocation at the official rate. The committee has been
disbanded from this month.
The black market devaluation also reflects recent political instability and
fears that government spending will push up inflation.
Western economists say the government deficit is heading towards last year's
level of 17 per cent of gross domestic product, despite a budget forecast of
zero deficit.
Sharp increases in transport and food costs during the recent oil strike and
a flood of freshly-minted bank notes are other signs that inflation, which
is already running at 60 per cent a year, could rise even further.

<TEXT>
For the first time in its modern-day history, Singapore has had to admit it
has a pollution problem.
The island republic's environment ministry said this week that air pollution
had reached an unhealthy level. Those with serious heart and lung ailments
should stay indoors; some healthy people might experience skin and eye
irritations.
The pollution has been front page news in a city which has prided itself on
its clean and green image.
The authorities say a thick haze which has enveloped the city over recent
weeks has been caused by forest fires raging in nearby Indonesia.
Many thousands of hectares of tropical rainforest are reported to be ablaze
on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. More forest fires are reported in East
Kalimantan, on the island of Borneo.
Singapore's leaders go to considerable lengths to ensure that the city state
is kept squeaky-clean. Those who drop rubbish are liable not only to heavy
fines but also to being dressed in luminous litterbug jackets and paraded in
front of television cameras.
Singapore has some of the world's toughest anti-smoking laws. The sale of
chewing gum is prohibited in order to combat any unsightly mess in public
places.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Setback for shop discounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sales division of Shiseido, Japan's largest cosmetics producer,
yesterday won court clearance to refuse to supply its goods to Fujikiya, a
discount retailer.
The Tokyo high court decision, on an appeal by Shiseido, is an unexpected
legal setback to the growth of discounting in Japan's high-priced retailing
industry and conflicts with a three-year-old fair trade commission ruling,
in favour of cut-price cosmetics.
The FTC, which is independent from the courts, is expected this year to pass
judgment on a similar row between Kawachiya, another cosmetics discounter,
and Shiseido.
Shiseido was told by a district court a year ago that it had contravened
anti-monopoly laws by stopping sales to Fujikiya, which was offering 20 per
cent discounts on Shiseido goods.
The cosmetics group had ended its contract with the discounter on the
grounds that it objected to Fujikiya's practice of piling Shiseido goods
onto shelves, rather than using Shiseido-trained sales staff to present the
products to customers.
Known as the 'face to face' system, the use of sales staff trained by
manufacturers is standard practice in department stores, and a factor in
their high prices.
The FTC had earlier investigated the dispute and ruled in 1991 that
Fujikiya's sales practices were legal. Mr Kinichi Takahashi, the high court
judge, yesterday argued that Shiseido had a legal right to demand 'face to
face' sales contracts, even if this led to higher prices.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Dutch study hits at Unilever detergent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever's new laundry detergent was criticised yesterday by the Dutch
consumers' association, which concluded after tests that 'the damage' the
detergent did to some clothes was 'too great'.
Unilever rejected the report, which is likely to intensify the 'Soap War'
raging between the Anglo-Dutch group and Procter and Gamble since Unilever
launched the power detergents this summer. P&amp;G is highly critical of the
detergents' alleged effect on clothes.
Omo Power, sold as Persil Power in the UK, was as effective at washing
clothes 'as any other good washing powder and bleach,' the Dutch association
said. But some fabrics, particularly coloured cotton, had been 'damaged' in
the test.
'The data is partial and being used in a very emotive way,' Unilever said.
It criticised the association for making 'sweeping statements' comparing Omo
Power to other detergents when, it said, it had run tests against only one
other unnamed detergent.
It said the association had also failed to judge the effect on clothes and
the alleged lessening of tensile strength, which enables a garment to resume
its shape after being stretched, against textile industry standards.
It is understood Unilever has seen the full data from the Dutch
association's tests and found them comparable to data from six independent
test institutes it commissioned to study the detergent. The six institutes
found the effect the detergent had on clothes was acceptable and fell within
textile industry standards.
In the UK, the Consumers' Association is conducting its own tests on Persil
Power but results will not be ready before mid-December. Marks &amp; Spencer,
also conducting tests, said it did not know when they would be completed.
'We continue to monitor the level of returned clothes but there's nothing
that causes immediate concern.'
Unilever said the impact of the Dutch report would be limited; sales of all
products in the Omo brand had not been harmed. Albert Heijn, the Dutch
supermarket chain, said: 'We see no reason to take it out of our shops. We
will wait to see what consumers do.' P&amp;G welcomed the report. 'This cannot
come as any surprise in light of the evidence that had already emerged,'
said Mr David Veitch, P&amp;G's European vice-president of communications.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Swedish Elections: Swedes offered few promises on jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Some Swedish companies used to employ 30 per cent more staff than they
needed - just to cover for those who did not turn up to work on a particular
day. During the three-year recession, absenteeism declined dramatically and
a shake-out in companies helped to speed up the increase in unemployment.
In the run-up to Sweden's election on Sunday, even the optimists have
accepted that the country will never return to the halcyon days of the late
1980s when unemployment was below 2 per cent. Although much of the election
campaign has centred on the state of the public finances, unemployment has
been a recurrent theme in public meetings and in the valstugas - the street
corner huts erected in their thousands by political parties at election
time.
Sweden's unemployment has soared to 14 per cent (including those on training
schemes) from below 5 per cent in just three years. This has played havoc
with state finances because of lower tax revenues and heavy funding costs.
It is also an unprecedented trauma in a country with little experience of
unemployment. The country's current plight represents one of the biggest
failures of the Swedish model which was supposed to deliver job security in
return for labour market restraint.
The multinationals laid off as many as 20 per cent of their employees
between 1991 and 1993 to improve productivity and regain competitiveness.
With the economy recovering, there is clear evidence that unemployment is
past its peak. But 600,000 people are still out of work, including those on
training schemes. Last year the problem cost Sweden SKr82bn (Pounds 6.8bn),
or 5.7 per cent of GDP, a level only exceeded by Finland and Denmark in the
OECD area, and accounted for nearly half the entire budget deficit.
None of the parties is offering dramatic or easy solutions. The Social
Democrats, who look likely to return to power, have detailed a specific
programme for creating 90,000 new jobs in their first year of office,
emphasising infrastructure programmes and favourable tax treatment for
investments. The ruling centre-right coalition wants to improve the overall
business climate, saying it can create 500,000 new private sector jobs by
the end of the century.
What unites the parties is a common acceptance that the new jobs will have
to be found in the private sector. This in itself is a breakthrough in a
country which saw all of its employment growth between 1960 and 1993 derive
from the public sector.
What distinguishes the programmes is emphasis. The Social Democrats believe
active government policies can have an impact, even in the short term. But
they differentiate companies from their owners, giving the former much more
favourable tax treatment.
Government policies are more long-term, and there is more stress on
providing incentives for the start-up of new business.
One reason for urgency is that Sweden wants to tackle long-term unemployment
before it becomes entrenched. This is why the Social Democrats reject the
type of tough fiscal and monetary strategy pursued by Denmark in the 1980s
because they say it has led to a permanently high level of long-term
unemployment. If they act now, they believe, they can stop labour market
bottlenecks stimulating inflation when unemployment falls to a certain
level, the so-called non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment.
Ms Mona Sahlin, the Social Democrats' party secretary, says: 'Everyone knows
that the longer people are doing nothing the harder it is to get them back
into the workforce. We must avoid long-term structural unemployment.'
Backing up this emphasis, her party aims to ensure that young people are not
out of work for more than 100 days.
There is a belief that the upturn in the economic cycle will at least get
the unemployment figure down to half its current level. But will it?
US experience suggests that most job creation in a modern western economy
comes from services. And it is here that Sweden clearly has further to go,
partly because there is a cultural resistance to the creation of a low-wage
service sector. Opponents say pejoratively that they don't want to turn the
country into a 1920s-style 'maid' society.
There is also resistance to any further lowering of unemployment benefits,
which have already been cut from 90 per cent to 80 per cent of former
salary. Mr Lars Jagren, an economist with the Federation of Swedish
Industries, believes Sweden will have to look again at both wage
differentials and unemployment benefits if it wants to make real progress on
unemployment.
'We have still not solved the crisis,' he believes, 'because we have still
not accepted the changes needed to avoid long-term unemployment.'

FT  15 SEP 94 / Energy crisis deepens for ex-Soviet states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An energy crisis more severe than any since the collapse of the Soviet Union
now threatens Russia and its neighbouring states - as oil output and
inter-enterprise debts in Russia continue to worsen and the other members of
the Commonwealth of Independent States sink deeper into debt to Russia for
energy supplies.
Mr Yuri Shafrannik, the oil minister, said that the payments crisis in the
industry meant that preparations for the autumn and winter surge in energy
use were 'strained'. At the same times, increasing debts to Russia in
Ukraine and Belarus now threaten the provision of oil and gas to these
hard-hit states.
Mr Shafrannik told a meeting of a government committee on the day-to-day
running of the economy that oil output in the first seven months of the year
was down by an average of 62,000 tonnes a day on the same period last year,
and 4.72m down on the planned level for that period. The minister expects
the outturn of the year to be 291.9m tonnes of oil and gas condensate - 6.8m
tonnes less than the forecast level and just over 60m tonnes down on last
year's estimated production level of 353m tonnes.
In the refineries, worst hit by the debt crisis, only 104.9m tonnes were
refined with a planned level of 128.9m tonnes. Mr Shafrannik said that 26.4
per cent of the oil wells in Russia were standing idle.
With Russia's oil and gas supplies increasingly directed towards western
hard currency markets, the drop in output seems certain to mean a further
cut in the already relatively meagre energy exports to the CIS countries -
reduced last year to 57.5m tonnes from a 1991 level of 136m tonnes. Gasprom,
the state gas monoply, warned yesterday wed that it would further cut gas
supplies to regions of Ukraine because of non-payment of back debts.
Gasprom last week cut supplies to Mariupol in the Donetsk region by more
than half to 100,000 cubic metres of gas a day, and yesterday warned it
would immediately cut supplies to the Kharkov region by 40m cubic metres a
day. According to the Interfax news agency, Ukraine agreed to pay Dollars
340m in August and September for gas supplies, but paid only 30 per cent of
the amount.
In Belarus, Mr Stanislav Bogdankevich, chairman of the central bank, told
the Tass news agency that the state owed Russia Rbs1,000bn (Pounds 309.6m)
for energy supplies and that the debt was rising.
He said that Russia had proposed the debt be paid by goods and industrial
production, and by shares in Belarussian enterprises - but said that a
schedule of payments by this kind of barter had not been agreed.
The position in the other republics is generally worse - with the two
Caucasian republics of Georgia and Armenia unable to pay for the supplies
they presently receive and which are constantly under threat.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Polish central bank in row over rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Polish government has called on the country's central bank to lower
interest rates and attacked the bank's recent decision to lower the
adjustable monthly devaluation rate - which devalues the zloty in order to
keep exports competitive - from 1.6 per cent to 1.5 per cent.
A government statement issued on Tuesday night deepens a row over how best
to deal with growing foreign currency inflows which are inflating the money
supply and increasing inflationary pressures.
It came as senior western commercial bankers gathered in Warsaw to sign
formally a deal reducing Poland's Dollars 14bn (Pounds 9bn) commercial debt
by 49.5 per cent which could
produce capital inflows worth more than Dollars 1bn a year. Poland's net
foreign debt stood at Dollars 44bn at the end of last April.
At the same time, Poland's foreign reserves have grown to around Dollars
11bn, largely because of a rise in exports to Germany. Capital inflows from
cross-border trading, including hard currency from citizens of the former
Soviet Union who come to Poland to purchase consumer goods, have also
swelled reserves. The resulting growth in money supply has led the central
bank to refuse to make the 1 per cent interest rate cut which the government
is now openly demanding.
'High real interest rates are putting a brake on the country's economic
development,' the government said after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.
The bank says, however, that inflationary pressures leave it no room to cut
rates. It also maintains that the lower rate of zloty devaluation is
necessary to encourage domestic currency savings by slowing the rate of
dollar appreciation.
The rate of inflation for this year is expected to reach 27 per cent, or 4
percentage points more than forecast by the government in its budget for
1994. The government is also accusing the central bank of having infringed
the law by not discussing the change in devaluation policy with the finance
or the foreign trade ministries. The bank has denied the charge.
The row is accompanied by government proposals that the central bank's
supervisory functions be transferred to an advisory council appointed by
politicians. This suggestion has led Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz Waltz, the central
bank chief, to warn that the bank's independence is under threat.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Bundesbank 'shifts into neutral': A likely halt in Frankfurt
to cuts in interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank has decided to stand firm against further cuts in its key
interest rates for the time being, with the next move, which may well be
delayed until next year, as likely to be up as down. The fortnightly meeting
of the German central bank's policy-making council today is not expected to
make any changes to monetary policy.
Remarks by Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, the Bundesbank's deputy president, give
the strong impression that the discount and Lombard rates - 4.5 per cent and
6 per cent respectively - are set to stay put for some months. The same may
also apply to the repurchase (or 'repo') rate, which has been fixed at 4.85
per cent since late July.
Making clear that the central bank still holds fast to its money supply
target, although its M3 goal has little chance of being reached this year,
he said it was important to allay concern in bond markets about German
inflation. The D-Mark strengthened on his comments.
'We have no reason to swerve from our stability-oriented policy,' he said in
Frankfurt on Tuesday night. The latest strengthening of the economy had
occurred amid interest rate conditions previously thought to be too
stringent, but 'this shows that they were not too stringent', he said.
Thus, he added, 'There is no reason in such a situation to take steps that
could raise fears that the Bundesbank is setting the rudder in a direction
that would be understood as expansionary.'
He also dismissed any suggestion that the Bundesbank could try to pacify
markets by setting its next securities repurchase rate - the bank
refinancing transactions through which it steers money markets - at 4.80 per
cent instead of 4.85 per cent, the level at which it yesterday announced a
further tender.
'This would provoke the question - 'why 4.80 instead of 4.85 per cent?' This
would be difficult as it would have to be justified and it could not be on
the basis of developments in the money supply.'
The last cut in rates was in May, when the discount and Lombard rates came
down by half a percentage point. That cut was made to help move the
liabilities of banks away from short-term deposits (included in M3, the
broad monetary aggregate) into longer-term funds.
This reason no longer applied, said Mr Gaddum. The latest M3 data showed a
slowdown in growth, though the rate of increase was still 9.8 per cent in
August, well above the target range of between 4 and 6 per cent for 1994.
Thus, said Mr Gaddum, the M3 trend was 'still not satisfactory'.
Some economists in Frankfurt charge the Bundesbank with having strayed too
far from its traditional adherence to money supply objectives. They say any
future moves in interest rates should be upwards.
The Bundesbank would probably choose the first quarter of next year to
decide when to tighten, said Mr Thomas Mayer, Goldman Sachs' Frankfurt-based
economist. 'A further cut cannot be ruled out, but it is very unlikely.'
Mr Gaddum's comment showed, he added, that 'the Bundesbank has shifted its
gears into neutral'.
Other members of the Bundesbank's seven-man directorate - the core of its
policy-making council - also feel there is no need for further rate cuts
after those in May helped decrease the annualised rate of M3 growth from an
alarming 15.4 per cent in March.
At the same time, there should be no need to raise interest rates to curb
credit growth either, they argue. Loans to finance housing and construction,
previously stimulated by the impending removal of tax breaks, are growing
more slowly. Industry demand for credits will rise as the economy recovers,
but the effect on credit expansion should be moderated by companies'
improved cash flow.
Some economists also argue, on the basis of revisions to economic statistics
for the previous two years, that economic overheating after the
post-unification surge in growth was greater than thought. So last year's
downturn merely brought the economy back on to its longer-term trend.
Correspondingly, there is no significant economic slack, particularly after
the unexpectedly large jump of 1 per cent in gross domestic product during
the second quarter of 1994.
These economists expect that the Bundesbank - with some dissenting voices
from the regional governors on the council - will regard this as another
reason not to lower interest rates further. They expect it to incline
towards trying to bring inflation down from the August rate of 3 per cent
towards its goal of 2 per cent, particularly in view of the 0.2 per cent
rise in wholesale prices in August over July, announced yesterday.
Mr Gaddum spoke sternly and robustly about the Bundesbank's commitment to
curbing prices and pursuing money supply goals. 'M3 is still the most
important indicator - not the only one, but the most important one,' he
said.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Brussels switches tack on industrial policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday unveiled a new-look industrial policy
which abandons once-cherished notions such as national champions and
sectoral protection in favour of life-long vocational training, global
strategic alliances, and an aggressive competition policy.
The recommendations are spelt out in a report on industrial competitiveness
which offers evidence of new thinking in Europe in response to mounting
competition from the US and East Asia.
Mr Martin Bangemann, the EU industry commissioner, added spice to the report
with a call for a shake-up in EU and national bureaucracies to end excessive
bureaucracy and unnecessary delays for businesses seeking licences for new
products.
'Some of the delays are unbelievable. Take biotechnology. Two years to wait
for administrative procedures is too long. Even if you get the right
decision, you miss the market opportunity,' he told a news conference in
Brussels.
The Commission report is striking for its advocacy of a tough competition
and regulatory policy to complement its call for greater liberalisation and
deregulation in Europe.
Mr Bangemann cited the Commission's recent approval of the BT-MCI alliance
to provide global telecom services to multinational companies as an example.
While the deal could be interpreted as restricting competition in a narrow
sense, it was vital to view the deal in the context of the global market, he
said.
Other officials said the Commission was pressing for an agreement with the
US and Japan on how to vet the unfolding strategic alliances in
telecommunications and ensure a level playing field. The hope is that a
common position can be reached within the World Trade Organisation.
The Commission report also calls for a fresh look at state aid criteria. One
idea is to apply general rather than sectoral rules, but Mr Bangemann
conceded yesterday that this idea was too radical for most fellow
commissioners and member states.
The report calls for a more 'rigorous and neutral' approach to state aid,
with tougher application of the rules in richer member states. However, the
recent approval of a Dollars 3.7bn (Pounds 2.38bn) restructuring plan for
Air France, the ailing national flag carrier, underlines that this is easier
said than done.
In the area of international trade, the paper said the EU should establish
an 'industrial assessment mechanism' to analyse why the EU is performing
badly in markets where it should be strong.

Germany can continue its ban on pentachlorophenol (PCP), the disinfectant
used for wood preservation and textile treatment, the European Commission
said yesterday. The ruling will appeal to ecology-conscious Sweden, which is
about to hold a referendum on EU membership. It means countries can apply
higher environmental standards than their EU partners in selective areas,
despite the general requirement for harmonisation in the internal market.
Last May, the European Court of Justice declared void the original
Commission decision to uphold Germany's PCP ban. Yesterday, the Commission
justified its second decision by referring to unusually high PCP levels in
Germany.

<TEXT>
Ambassadors of the 25 members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development met yesterday and again failed to resolve the
Franco-Canadian rivalry for the secretary-generalship, increasing the
prospect of no decision before the term of the French incumbent, Mr
Jean-Claude Paye, ends on September 30. The only new development this week
came with the withdrawal of Mr Lorenz Schomerus, the German candidate. This
probably gives one further vote to Mr Paye, who is running for a third
five-year term and who may now have a majority of OECD governments behind
him. However, the OECD takes decisions by consensus, and the US has so far
given no indication of withdrawing its strong support for the Canadian
candidate, Mr Donald Johnston. Washington argues it is time for the
organisation to be run by a non-European.

<TEXT>
Mr Felipe Gonzalez yesterday took a leaf out of the British parliament's
book when he inaugurated a prime minister's question time, but his answers
dealt a blow to his government's efforts to engineer a restrictive budget.
In his first appearance in what will be a weekly 15-minute interrogation by
the lower house in Spain's Cortes, Mr Gonzalez in effect promised pensions
would be indexed to inflation. The commitment will place a considerable
burden on the government's economic team as it tries to craft a budget that
will reduce the public deficit next year to 5.9 per cent of GDP, from 6.9
per cent this year. The question time is part of an effort by Mr Gonzalez to
regain the initiative following strong gains by the opposition conservative
party in June's European elections. Since he gained power in 1982, the prime
minister has only attended major parliamentary debates.

<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund could face ruin unless it starts to apply
its normal credit conditions for loans to former east bloc communist
countries, Swiss National Bank president Markus Lusser said yesterday. The
ratio of debt to exports in the so-called transition countries was already
higher than that in the developing nations, except for sub-Saharan African
states, he said. The IMF must insist the transition countries quickly meet
the normal conditions set for its loans, as further protracted waiving of
its so-called 'conditionality' would be too risky. 'The currency reserves of
IMF member countries would be endangered. Their credibility would suffer
damage. The catalytic effect would be lost,' he said in remarks prepared for
a Swiss Christian Democratic People's Party meeting in Zug. 'The transition
would run the risk of ending in the financial and moral ruin of the IMF.' Mr
Lusser said the IMF's financial aid, particularly to former communist
countries, would increase massively in the next few years.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Flexibility 'no easy solution on jobs': Conventional view on
labour mobility not borne out by Commission report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Increased labour flexibility and higher job turnover provide no simple
solution to Europe's unemployment problem, the European Commission declared
yesterday in its sixth report on Employment in Europe.
The report challenges the conventional view that ease of movement into and
out of jobs is a necessary condition of low unemployment.
About 17 per cent of people in work in European Union countries changed jobs
in the last year. But countries which have above average labour turnover,
including Spain - where 28 per cent employed people changed jobs in the last
year - Denmark, the UK and the Netherlands, range across the unemployment
spectrum.
Spain, for example, has the highest level of unemployment in the EU and both
the UK and the Netherlands are now below the average.
At the other end of the mobility scale, the rate of turnover was under 13
per cent in Greece as well as in Italy, and only around 15 per cent in
Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg, which also represent wide variations in
unemployment rates.
The report, which picks up many of the themes first discussed in the Delors
white paper on employment published last year, concludes that countries with
a low level of external labour market flexibility may compensate with higher
flexibility within companies.
The report also reflects the white paper's concern with high non-wage labour
costs in Europe and the relatively poor employment creation record compared
with the US and Japan. Social contributions in the EU averaged 22 per cent
of labour costs in 1991, only slightly above the US figure of 21 per cent.
The Japanese figure was 15 per cent.
However, if employer and employee contributions, plus taxes on wages are
added together, the average 'wedge' - between the cost of employing labour
to companies and the net earnings which workers receive - is 45 per cent in
the EU, 40 per cent in the US and 30 per cent in Japan.
The report says that in nine out of 12 EU countries the non-wage labour
costs imposed by government bear proportionately more on workers at the
lower end of the earnings scale than on those at the higher end. But the UK
is a notable exception.
'The only country where differential contributions provide any incentive for
employers to take on lower paid workers is the UK,' states the report.
The UK government may also draw some comfort from the fact that incentives
to work are in good order. Unlike most EU countries low pay is a relatively
minor source of poverty in the UK.
'Overall in the EU, there are more households which fall below the poverty
level of expenditure because of low pay than because of unemployment or
disability. Only in four member states - Belgium, the Netherlands, and most
especially, Ireland and the UK, where being out of work was the major source
of poverty - was this not the case.'
Another finding of the report helps to explain the UK's strong resistance to
the European working time directive. Nearly half of the EU's 7m male
employees working 48 hours a week or more are employed in the UK, helping to
put the UK on top of the union's longer-hours league.
Between 1985 and 1992 business services made the largest contribution to
employment growth across the EU, accounting for almost one in five of the
net addition to jobs. But high job losses between 1990 and 1992 occurred in
many of the former high growth areas including estate and travel agents and
research and development institutes.
The areas of job growth in the EU over the past 20 years have been much the
same as in the US and Japan. 'The most striking difference is not in the
areas where employment has risen, but in terms of the scale of jobs losses
which have occurred in declining sectors (particularly agriculture). This
seems largely responsible for the lower overall rate of employment growth in
the EU than elsewhere.'
Professional and technical jobs, which accounted for only 15 per cent of the
total in 1983, were responsible for 40 per cent of the rise in employment
between 1987 and 1992.
But there are still marked variations between countries in employment
structure. In Germany, for example, 50 per cent more of the workforce are
employed in engineering and motor vehicles than elsewhere.
Germany also continues to have a relatively small proportion of its
workforce in services. It is sometimes suggested that this is a statistical
illusion and that much the same jobs are performed in Germany as elsewhere
but they are located in industrial companies rather than specialised
services companies. The report maintains otherwise.
'Fewer service activities are performed in Germany than in other comparable
European countries - or, at least, fewer people are employed which might
possibly be the result of higher productivity in services in Germany than

FT  15 SEP 94 / Major puts UK view to Santer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Santer, the federalist president-designate of the European
Commission, got his first formal lecture on the importance of the nation
state yesterday from Mr John Major, the British prime minister.
Mr Santer, who takes over from Mr Jacques Delors in the New Year, spent a
couple of hours absorbing the British view in the third of a series of
meetings with EU heads of government.
The meeting was described as 'friendly,' but the tone was markedly different
to that during Mr Santer's earlier stopovers in Ireland and France.
Mr Major emerged from the meeting at his country retreat to stress Britain's
long objection to moves towards a single currency at the next
inter-governmental conference in 1996.
'I don't think the IGC in 1996 has anything to do with a single currency,'
Mr Major said, confirming the British view that the issue of monetary union
was settled in the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Major won some support from Mr Santer for his objection, forcefully
expressed in a speech in The Netherlands last week, to proposals floated by
the German CDU party for a core union of five or six member states,
excluding Britain.
Mr Santer said it was important for all 12 member states to move forward
together. However, he also said that all 12 should achieve the objectives
set out by the Maastricht treaty, which include economic and monetary union.
This would conflict with Britain's preference for a union of 'variable
geometry', in which the member states would be free to reject developments
outside core areas such as the single market.
British officials said that Mr Major had made clear Britain's view that the
union should concentrate on subsidiarity, deregulation, free trade and
enlargement rather than the destruction of the nation state.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Economic Watch: EU unemployment falls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Seasonally adjusted unemployment in July in the European Union fell 0.1
percentage points from June to 10.8 per cent. The fall was particularly
apparent among women of all ages, and men below 25. Total female
unemployment fell by 0.4 of a percentage point to 12.4 per cent, compared to
the male rate of 9.6 per cent. Male youth unemployment fell to 18.6 per
cent, down 0.4 of a percentage point, while total youth unemployment fell
from 19.9 per cent to 19.6 per cent. The only countries which recorded a
rise in unemployment were Denmark (from 10.4 to 10.6 per cent) and the
Netherlands (9.7 per cent to 9.8) The most marked falls in youth
unemployment were recorded in Belgium and Spain.
West German wholesale prices rose 0.2 per cent in August from July, up 2.2
per cent from a year earlier, the Federal Statistics Office reported.
Spain's central bank announced that monetary growth was on target during the
first eight months of 1994. M4 grew by 5.8 per cent during the year until
September.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Fiat row hits new car sales data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disagreement between Fiat, the Italian car producer, and rival European
carmakers importing cars into Italy, has created confusion over the
publication of new car sales figures in Italy.
The conflict, exacerbated by the inability of the Italian government to
provide prompt information on new vehicle registrations, is undermining the
disclosure of west European new cars sales data.
The traditional arrangement between the two Italian motor industry trade
associations - Anfia for the domestic industry and Unrae for the importers -
for the exchange and joint publication of sales figures has broken down.
The Anfia/Unrae figures, which report wholesale deliveries to dealers rather
than domestic registrations, have become increasingly unreliable, as they
are distorted by the high volume of cars being re-exported from Italy to
neighbouring countries.
Fiat has insisted that the task of reporting new car sales should be handed
over to the Italian government, but the Transport Ministry is still
struggling to provide quick and accurate registration data.
Traditionally the government has required 3-4 months to produce the data,
but the Italian motor industry is hopeful that this can soon be reduced to
less than 10 days.
According to estimates released by Acea, the European Automobile
Manufacturers Association - using a combination of registration and
wholesale figures for Italy - overall west European new car registrations
rose by only 0.6 per cent year-on-year in July to 915,000, while
registrations in August rose by 4.7 per cent year-on-year to 1.081m.

Lukoil, Russia's biggest oil producer, plans to float shares on western
stock exchanges once domestic privatisation is completed next year, the
company vice-president, Mr Vladislav Bazhenov, said yesterday. The company
has discussed prospects for floating shares in New York or London with
exchange officials and Mr Bazhenov said foreign investors had shown
interest. However, foreign listings might be a long way off as the company's
books would probably have to be examined by an international auditing firm.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Czech coffee 'cartel' fines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Czech economic competition ministry has imposed 'significant' fines on
two local coffee market leaders for using what it calls cartel-style tactics
to raise domestic coffee prices. The ministry has started legal action
against the Czech Coffee Union (CKS), an industry lobby group, and two of
its members, Tchibo Praha and Balirny Douwe Egberts, accusing them of
co-ordinating a policy of gradually increasing prices. In July, the CKS
asked domestic producers to raise coffee prices by 10 per cent monthly to
fall into line with the general surge in world prices caused by two severe
frosts which ravaged plantations in Brazil. Local packager Balirny Douwe
Egberts, a subsidiary of Dutch-American firm Douwe Egberts, increased its
prices by 10 per cent at the start of July, as did the local market leader,
German retailer Tchibo Praha. According to the ministry, domestic coffee
prices have now increased by more than 50 per cent since the CKS issued its
request. Between them, Balirny Douwe Egberts and Tchibo Praha are reported
to hold 75 per cent of the Czech coffee market.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Phone ruling promises savings on US-UK calls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of transatlantic phone calls is set to fall sharply with a ruling
by US regulators, expected next week, opening the way to greater competition
on the UK-US route.
The ruling will allow a new form of competition, called international simple
resale. It will have far-reaching implications for the cartel involving
international phone companies, which keeps cross-border prices artificially
high.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the US regulatory authority, is
expected to rule that the UK's telecoms market is sufficiently open to US
operators to justify the new form of competition. The UK will make a
reciprocal declaration, after which the regime can operate.
Telecoms companies will then be able to resell to their customers capacity
leased from the main transatlantic carriers at a discount to present
tariffs, and connect the calls into the public networks in both countries.
Until now, the telecoms companies have not been allowed to utilise the
public networks on both sides of the Atlantic, restricting their market
mainly to the large corporate sector. The operators will now be able to
reach smaller businesses and residential customers.
The US and the UK have competitive telecoms regimes, with well-established
domestic rivals to British Telecommunications, the former UK monopoly
operator, and to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which had a near monopoly
in the US market until its break-up in 1984. Several large US phone
companies have gained licences to operate in the UK since the abolition of
the BT/Mercury duopoly in 1991, with AT&amp;T itself granted a draft licence in
July. UK operators are also active in the US.
AT&amp;T fought strongly against the latest ruling by the FCC. Yesterday it
claimed that BT was keeping prices artificially high by refusing to agree to
its plan for a cut of nearly two-thirds in the rate which BT and AT&amp;T pay
each other for connecting international calls.
Transatlantic phone prices have already fallen sharply, with BT's UK-US
prices down more than a third in three years.
However, analysts believe there is large scope for further cuts. Industry
estimates suggest that it costs resale operators little more than 7p a
minute in direct network charges to deliver a US-UK call, yet the daytime
prices charged by BT and AT&amp;T average nearly 45p a minute.
The US accounts for about a fifth of BT's international traffic, while the
UK is the third-largest destination for outgoing calls from the US.
BT conceded yesterday that there was 'some room' for splitting the
difference between leased-line rates and existing prices, but said that if,
as expected, it gained the necessary regulatory consents, it would join the
resale market through its joint venture with MCI, the second-largest US
carrier.
Mr Thomas Luciano, AT&amp;T's director of international settlements, said: 'The
industry is beginning to pull apart from a system of co-operation between
carriers, which will open things up in a new way.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Workmen at Ramsgate port in Kent look down on the section of ferry walkway
which collapsed in the early hours of yesterday morning, catapulting six
people to their deaths and injuring seven others.
The walkway - the highest in use at an English Channel ferry port - crashed
down from its mounting on the central pillar on to a vehicle ramp about 50
feet below. The accident happened as the last foot passengers were boarding
a Belgian ferry, the Prins Filip, for an overnight crossing to Ostend.
Accident investigators will today step up their inquiries into the reason
for the collapse. The walkway was installed in March by a Swedish company,
Feab. Designers from the company arrived yesterday to examine the structure.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Government may lift broadcast ban on Sinn Fein
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, JIMMY BURNS and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The abolition of Britain's six-year-old broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein may
come closer today amid signs that the government is edging nearer to
accepting the IRA ceasefire as permanent.
With London under pressure to respond more positively to last month's IRA
announcement, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, is
expected to use today's first full cabinet meeting for two months to argue
that the ban no longer serves any useful purpose.
Conservative rightwingers, however, remain convinced that an early lifting
of the ban would be unwise, and any move may be delayed until after next
month's Conservative party conference in Bournemouth. The sixth anniversary
of the ban's imposition will fall on October 19.
Meanwhile, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, appears ready to conduct
a major US propaganda tour, given that his visa is almost certain to be
granted.
He is pushing ahead with plans to visit at least 10 US cities, including
Washington and New York, though he has not yet submitted a visa application.
A draft programme of the trip is understood to include meetings with Senator
Edward Kennedy, Mr Tom Foley, speaker of the House of Representatives, and
officials of the National Security Council who advise President Bill Clinton
on Northern Ireland policy.
There are also plans for Mr Adams to address high profile forums such as the
National Press Club and the Council for Foreign Affairs. Although resigned
to the visit, London would be dismayed if Mr Adams succeeded in meeting
administration officials. Senior Conservatives are anxious the trip should
not coincide with the Tory conference, beginning on October 11.
US, UK and Irish officials are thought to be in agreement that Mr Adams'
visit should not precede that of other senior political figures who are due
in Washington in the next two weeks.
This suggests the visit could coincide with the Labour conference, beginning
on October 3. Mr Adams is anxious to have his US trip well under way before
congressional elections on October 7.
As Dublin yesterday welcomed a statement supporting the peace process from
IRA prisoners in Belfast's Maze prison, Mr Major indicated the IRA had still
not done enough to convince the government that its cessation of violence
was for good. At Chequers, he said he hoped the IRA had given up its
'intolerable outrages' of over 25 years.
Last night, the Ulster Freedom Fighters group threatened police officers and
their families, saying it would take 'affirmative action' if recent violence
in loyalist areas and harassment by the RUC did not stop.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Inflation fuels fear of fresh rate rise: Retail prices and
jobless figures unsettle markets - FT-SE loses 41 and bonds fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A slight rise in UK retail price inflation and a bigger-than-expected drop
in unemployment last month provoked fears of further base rate rises and
unsettled financial markets yesterday.
The Central Statistical Office reported that the retail prices index jumped
0.5 per cent between July and August and was 2.4 per cent higher than in
August last year. Underlying inflation, defined by the government as the RPI
excluding mortgage interest payments, rose 2.3 per cent in the 12 months to
August.
Both annual rates of inflation were 0.1 percentage points higher than in
July and above the average expectations of City analysts, who had forecast a
slight drop.
The news prompted a sharp decline in share and bond prices. The FT-SE 100
index lost 41.6 points to close at 3,079.8 and the 10-year benchmark
government gilt-edged stock fell 1 5/32 points. Sterling wobbled, losing a
pfennig against the D-Mark on the news, but later closed broadly unchanged
with losses against the D-Mark offset by gains against the dollar.
Yesterday's financial market jitters were compounded by news of a sharp
34,200 fall in seasonally adjusted unemployment last month to just under
2.6m, apparently providing further evidence of fast growth in the economy.
Lord Lawson, chancellor from 1983 to 1989, added to base rate anxiety by
writing in yesterday's London Evening Standard that 'this week's half-point
hike is most unlikely to be the last'.
Markets were unsettled further by a CSO official's disclosure that Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, had been given a preliminary estimate of the
RPI data last Wednesday before he decided on Friday to raise bank base rates
to 5.75 per cent from 5.25 per cent.
That appeared to take some of the lustre away from Monday's base rate
increase. Some City commentators suggested that the rate rise might have
been a reflex action to current needs and not, as the chancellor said, a
pre-emptive action to nip incipient inflationary pressures in the bud.
However, speaking on BBC radio's Today programme yesterday, the chancellor
insisted that the latest inflation and jobless figures were 'not relevant to
last week's decision'. Instead, he was looking to possible events 18 months
to two years ahead.
The CSO said the rise in inflation reflected sharp increases in prices for
clothing and household goods after heavy discounting in July's summer sales.
Looking at the trend, 'prices have been broadly stable since May', officials
added.
However, the jump in inflation last month fuelled fears of further price
rises in September. 'We are at a turning point in inflation,' said Mr
Geoffrey Dicks, chief UK economist at Natwest Markets.
Yesterday's retail prices report overshadowed the positive labour market
news. Seasonally adjusted unemployment fell in all UK regions and reached
its lowest rate since January 1992. The unadjusted 'headline' jobless total,
which normally rises in August, fell last month by nearly 5,000 to
2,638,267.
Wage inflation stayed subdued, with average earnings growing an annual,
underlying 3 3/4 per cent in July, unchanged from June.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Forte buys Meridien hotels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Forte, the UK hotels and restaurants group, defeated Accor, its French
rival, yesterday to win control of Meridien, the luxury hotel chain owned by
Air France.
The British group offered FFr1.09bn (Pounds 130m) for the French airline's
57 per cent stake in Meridien, valuing the chain at FFr1.9bn. Accor's offer
valued Meridien at FFr1.7bn.
Forte is now required to make an offer to minority shareholders.
The sale follows Forte's failure this week to fulfil its ambition to win
control of Savoy, the UK luxury hotel group. This year it also failed to
acquire Ciga, the Italian luxury chain, which was bought by ITT Sheraton of
the US.
Mr Rocco Forte, Forte chairman said the Meridien purchase gave Forte its
first entry into Asia and increased its presence in Europe, the Middle East
and North America.
Air France's decision follows months of competition between the British and
French rivals. Accor strongly lobbied the centre-right French government,
arguing that its offer would keep Meridien in French hands.
Its pressure prompted a delay in the sale process, which was launched in
April when the two companies tabled bids. Both companies increased their
original valuations of Meridien by about FFr100m.
Mr Christian Blanc, chairman of Air France, said Forte's offer was accepted
because of financial considerations. The European Commission ordered the
airline to dispose of Meridien by the end of the year as a condition for a
FFr20bn capital injection from the French government.
According to Air France, Forte has committed itself to maintaining the
standard of the hotels in the Meridien chain, to assuring its development
and to keeping its headquarters in Paris.
Accor had wanted to add Meridien's 58 four-star hotels to its existing
operations.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Sumitomo Bank chief murdered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A 54-year-old executive of one of Japan's largest banks was shot dead
yesterday outside his home. Mr Kazufumi Hatanaka was the director of
Sumitomo Bank's Nagoya branch.
The murder was the latest in a series of attacks on employees of the bank
and its related companies. Between February and May last year 22 incidents
were reported, including firebomb attacks on the home of a bank
vice-president and shootings at branches in Tokyo and Yokohama.
The president of the bank, Mr Sotoo Tatsumi, received three threatening
letters containing razor blades at his home in Kobe during the same period.
Police said yesterday there was no immediate suspect or motive, but they are
understood to be investigating possible links between the attacks and
problems the bank has been having with alleged organised crime members.
Sumitomo is trying to collect bad debts from customers to whom it extended
large numbers of property-related loans in the late 1980s.
Other companies have reported a sharp increase in attacks on their employees
in the last year. A vice-president of Hanwa Bank was shot dead in August
last year, and in February this year, an executive of Fuji Film Co was
stabbed to death in front of his Tokyo home.
Companies have paid large sums to gangs to prevent them from disrupting
shareholders' meetings. Yesterday, Kirin Brewing Company was ordered to pay
more than Y90m (Pounds 582,000) in penalty tax for concealing income of
Y180m in an extortion scandal, understood to be related to gangster
activity.

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pilots at Air France are to strike tomorrow and Saturday after talks on
productivity broke down. The strike is a setback for Mr Christian Blanc, Air
France's chairman, who wants to raise productivity by 30 per cent by 1997 as
part of a rescue package. Last year, the ailing state-owned carrier suffered
losses of FFr8.48bn (Pounds 1.02bn). The SNPL pilots' union opposes plans to
cut flight bonuses while Mr Blanc claims the pilots' counter-proposals on
productivity would increase average pay by about 10 per cent. 'No company,
even the most flourishing can allow that today, and Air France is not
flourishing,' he said in a letter to the union. Air France said it could
guarantee about a third of medium-range international flights tomorrow and
Saturday and hopes to run more long-range flights.

Ms Villalpando, who was treasurer from 1989 to 1992, and one of the
highest-ranking Hispanics in President George Bush's administration,
admitted that she had under-reported her taxable income in 1989 by about
Dollars 167,000, cheating the US government out of more than Dollars 47,000.
Judge Thomas Hogan rejected her pleas that she be spared prison. He said the
sentence would 'remind all those who serve in high office' that they are
'not beyond the law'.
He also placed Ms Villalpando, 54, on three years' probation. During that
time, she must spend the first four months in detention at home and perform
200 hours of community service.
The judge added that Ms Villalpando, who had also worked in the Reagan White
House, in liaison to the Hispanic community in the US, had a 'special burden
to obey the law' because of her high government office.
As part of her duties at the Treasury Department, Ms Villalpando ran the
mint, the bureau of engraving and printing, and the savings bonds division.
She took leave of absence from her post after the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, in October 1992, had raided her home and an Atlanta
telecommunications firm, Communications International, where she had
previously worked.
Ms Villalpando has admitted filing false statements to the Treasury
department, the office of government ethics and the Senate finance committee
to conceal substantial funds she received from her former firm in 1989 and
1990.
Ms Villalpando, who campaigned for Mr Bush among Hispanics, could have
received a maximum jail sentence of 15 years and a Dollars 750,000 fine.
Ms Villalpando caused controversy at the Republican party convention in 1992
by calling Mr Bill Clinton, then Democratic presidential candidate, and Mr
Henry Cisneros, now housing secretary, 'skirt chasers'. Bush staffers forced
her to apologise.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Crimean president ends MP lock-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The president of Crimea, a breakaway region of Ukraine, yesterday ended a
lock-out of the contested region's parliament but the local power struggle
remained unresolved.
The tug-of-war between Crimea's parliament and president, a re-run on a
smaller scale of the dramatic battle in Russia last autumn, escalated over
the week-end when Mr Yuri Meshkov, the Crimean president, locked members of
parliament out of their parliament building. Yesterday, after deputies and
their supporters seized control of the local television station, Mr Meshkov
relented.
However, deputies rejected the 'zero option' compromise - whereby Mr Meshkov
would cancel decrees shutting the parliament and deputies would rescind laws
restricting the president's authority - offered to them by Mr Meshkov.
'I appeal to deputies to start talks tomorrow,' Mr Meshkov said in a terse
address to the parliament. 'I am prepared to meet with you to work out a
solution to the constitutional crisis.'
Mr Sergei Tsekov, chairman of the parliament, turned down Mr Meshkov's offer
and accused the president of seeking a scapegoat for his own failure to
deliver the reunion with Russia and economic prosperity he promised Crimeans
in presidential elections in January.
The political stalemate in Crimea is the most serious political challenge
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma has faced since his election in July and
could jeopardise the rapprochement in the often tense relations between
Ukraine and Russia. However, Russia, which sees Mr Kuchma as a welcome
alternative to more nationalist Ukrainian leaders, has helped the Ukrainian
government to contain the Crimean conflict by refusing to intervene.
Transferred from Russia to Ukraine only in 1954, the largely Russian
inhabitants of Crimea have always been at best lukewarm supporters of
Ukrainian independence and both Mr Meshkov and his parliamentary opponents
were elected earlier this year on separatist platforms.
But the continuing power struggle in Crimea underscores the difficulties,
apparent in break-away regions throughout the former Soviet Union, in
translating a popular desire for secession into reality.
Mr Meshkov, described as a 'bandit' by parliamentarians, is being attacked
for the seemingly contradictory offences of appointing too many politicians
from Moscow to his government and being too soft in his bid to break-away
from Ukraine and join Russia.
'We voted for him with a dream,' Mr Alexander Kurlov, a deputy. 'But all he
has done is to put Crimean clocks on Moscow time.'

FT  14 SEP 94 / Toyota to double car production in N America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Toyota, Japan's largest car manufacturer, said yesterday it would raise
vehicle production in North America by nearly 50 per cent, more than double
engine production there and increase vehicle exports from the US to markets,
including Japan, by 60 per cent by 1996.
The announcement came as US and Japanese trade officials continued their
last-minute negotiations over how to increase foreign penetration of Japan's
vehicle market and reduce the country's huge trade surplus with the US.
The US is poised to take steps towards imposing sanctions against Japan at
the end of this month unless an agreement can be reached on several trade
issues.
US carmakers reacted coolly to the announcement. Ford said: 'The important
thing is whether they're doing anything to improve the trade deficit. What
would interest us is whether they can increase the amount of US-sourced
material in the vehicles. Up to now, we feel they probably have less than 50
per cent North American content.'
Toyota's announcement is also the most dramatic indication yet by a Japanese
vehicle maker of the pressures the Japanese industry faces from a sharply
appreciated yen, trade friction with the US and growing competition from US
vehicle manufacturers in the world's biggest car market.
In July, Honda, Japan's third largest carmaker, announced that it would
spend Dollars 310m on expanding its North American operations to bolster car
and engine manufacturing capacity as well as strengthening its research and
development and sales facilities.
Toyota said yesterday it would raise total North American vehicle production
to 790,000 units in 1996, up from 533,000 last year. Eight years ago,
production in North America was only 14,000 units. The boost in production
will mean that more than 60 per cent of the company's US sales will consist
of North American-built vehicles, compared with 46 per cent in 1993.
The increase will come from its manufacturing facility in Kentucky, Toyota
Motor Manufacturing USA (TMM), from New United Motor Manufacturing, its
joint venture with General Motors, and from Toyota Motor Manufacturing
Canada.
The company will not increase existing capacity in North America but will
achieve its target by using a second line at TMM, which came on stream in
March this year, and by raising productivity. Annual production at TMM will
increase from 234,000 last year to 400,000 in 1996.
Toyota's overall engine production in North America will more than double to
440,000 units from 207,000 last year. Engine production at TMM will increase
from 207,000 units to 350,000 units in 1996, including V6 engines, while
production at TMMC will increase with the addition of a new engine plant, to
almost 90,000 units annually.
Increased local production will lift exports from North America by 60 per
cent from 50,000 units in 1993 to about 80,000 units. Exports from Japan to
the US will fall by nearly 28 per cent in 1996 to about 400,000 units
against 554,000 last year.
Toyota emphasised that it would not cut employment in Japan to cope with the
decline but expected a recovery in the Japanese market to keep its domestic
factories occupied.
The effects of the shift to North America will at least be felt among the
hundreds of Japanese car and car parts subcontractors that depend on Toyota
for their survival. In the past year and a half, 127 subcontractors have
closed under the pressures of a high yen and declining production in Japan,
according to Teikoku Data Bank, a private research company.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Canadian markets rise after Quebec election: PQ may face
uphill battle gaining a majority in a promised referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's financial markets rose sharply yesterday as investors took heart
from the separatist Parti Quebecois' unexpectedly narrow victory in Monday's
elections in Quebec.
Although the PQ won 77 of the 125 seats in the National Assembly, it gained
only 44.7 per cent of the popular vote, compared with 44.3 per cent for the
outgoing Liberals.
Bond and currency markets were buoyed by pointers that many Quebeckers voted
on Monday for a change in government rather than for independence, and that
the PQ may have an uphill battle gaining a majority in a promised referendum
to decide whether the predominantly French-speaking province should remain
part of Canada. Recent opinion polls show that nearly 60 per cent of
Quebeckers oppose outright independence.
However, the PQ's leader, Mr Jacques Parizeau, reiterated his determination
to press ahead with a referendum in 1995.
Political observers and economic analysts cautioned that the referendum was
likely to be preceded by a divisive campaign in which the new separatist
government in Quebec City will be well placed to push its case for
independence.
The PQ has pledged to push a formal declaration through the Quebec
legislature expressing a desire to begin sovereignty negotiations with
Ottawa. It will also set up a commission to draw up an independence
constitution.
In English-speaking Canada, Mr Bob Rae, premier of Ontario, urged Mr
Parizeau to hold the referendum as soon as possible. 'A climate of
uncertainty will not in any way contribute to economic growth and recovery.'
The PQ, which previously held office from 1976 to 1985, failed to gain a
mandate in a referendum 14 years ago to negotiate a loose form of
sovereignty for Quebec.
It has indicated that it plans to pursue its goal more vigorously and
unambiguously in the coming referendum, although there are divisions in the
party on the strategy to be followed.
Mr Parizeau, a former economics professor who obtained his doctorate from
the London School of Economics, told a victory rally in Quebec City that:
'in 1995, we will go before Quebeckers and ask them the question that will
make a people into a country. We have begun a new chapter in our history.'
But he also sounded a conciliatory note, pledging to work on improving the
province's economy.
By contrast, Mr Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister, expressed confidence
that 'Quebeckers will once again demonstrate their profound attachment to
being a full part of Canada.'
The Bank of Canada intervened to slow the rising Canadian dollar, trading at
73.84 US cents at noon. The gap between the yield on long-term Quebec
provincial bonds and government of Canada issues narrowed. Canada's
commercial banks responded to improvements by cutting their prime lending
rate from 7.25 per cent to 7 per cent.

FT  14 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JEFFREY BROWN, STEVE THOMPSON and RAMRAJ GOGNA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stores group Kingfisher failed to impress with first-half figures at the
bottom end of expectations but the shares held firm on the 'Only Way Is Up'
theory.
Forecasts for the full year were lowered, although some of the more positive
analysts argued that all the problems were now in the share price. UBS, for
example, reduced its estimate by Pounds 12m to Pounds 333m but remained a
buyer on the basis that 'the massive derating seen since Christmas is
probably now at an end'. Hoare Govett lowered its forecast by Pounds 15m to
Pounds 325m and appeared to be maintaining a hold on the stock.
BZW, which has taken a consistently bearish stance, came down by only Pounds
5m to Pounds 335m. However, analyst Mr Tony Shiret remained a strong seller
and pinpointed the threat to Kingfisher's B&amp;Q chain from Home Depot, of the
US.
Some analysts maintained the belief that at least one senior management
change was imminent in spite of a firm denial by the company yesterday. The
shares fell 23 at the start of trading but rallied to close only 3 down at
487p.
A buy recommendation from BZW, plus talk of aggressive switching from other
composite insurance stocks, drove Royal Insurance sharply better. There was
also talk around the market that a big US buyer had been operating, although
some dealers thought this unlikely because of Royal's exposure to
environmental claims in the US. At the close, Royal stock was 9 higher at
290p after good turnover of 3.6m shares.
Talk of a sell recommendation from one of the market's leading brokers and a
revival of rights issue stories unsettled Forte, 3 lower at 228p.
Speculation was that Forte may pay in excess of Pounds 200m for Meridian,
the hotels group owned by Air France, and also take advantage of the
acquisition to launch a big rights issue to reduce its debt.
Granada was also affected by rumours that the group could be contemplating a
sizeable acquisition and had been taking soundings from its shareholders.
Granada shares declined 8 to 487p.
Norweb was one of the better performers in the utilities sectors, the stock
edging up 2 to 794p after the company sent its broker, Smith New Court, into
the market to buy its own shares. Norweb purchased 5m shares, or 2.9 per
cent of its issued capital, at 795p.
South Western also moved in to acquire more of its own stock, buying 500,000
shares at 766p.
Smith New Court was responsible for keeping the Scottish generators on an
even keel. The broker's utilities team said the Scots 'should have prospects
as good as the 'recs' after their distribution review; Hydro-Electric will
be able to pay 10 per cent real dividend growth until 2,000 and Power should
be able to match this. Hydro slipped 3 to 372p and Power held at 382p.
At least two of the market's most influential broking houses, Kleinwort
Benson and Credit Lyonnais Laing, were said to be recommending a big switch
from National Westminster to Barclays. The latter held at 595p on 6.6m
traded and the former dropped 17 to 494p on 6.3m dealt.
The building sectors had a rough ride again as dealers focused on the
implications of higher domestic interest rates. NatWest Securities' building
team said: 'With September a key selling month for housebuilders, the rise
in base rates could not have been timed more badly.'
Taylor Woodrow failed to hold an early gain inspired by better than expected
interim profits, which were around Pounds 2m higher than best estimates. The
share price settled 2 easier at 135p, after 142p.
Caradon, the building products group, was one of the FT-SE 100's best
performers, racing up 11 to 298p after top-of-the-range interim figures.
The latest newspaper circulation figures knocked Daily Express parent United
Newspapers, which fell 17 to 511p.

FT  14 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: P&amp;O pleases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JEFFREY BROWN, STEVE THOMPSON and RAMRAJ GOGNA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
P&amp;O was outstanding in the transport sector, jumping 21 to 674p on the back
of significantly better than expected half-year results. The shares moved to
675p in heavy early morning volume but eased back on modest profit-taking.
The six-month performance was above the top end of most brokers' estimates,
rising strongly to Pounds 126.4m before tax on the back of rapid expansion
on the shipping side.
The results, together with an upbeat management statement, led analysts to
rapidly revise upwards their projections for full-year profits. To take one
example, UBS is now pitching for Pounds 360m pre-tax for 1994, up from
earlier projections of Pounds 320m.
A surprised stock market described the buying as 'serious' and trading
volume topped 2.9m shares. According to traders, it begins to look as though
P&amp;O's heavy capital spending of recent years is finally bearing fruit.
Elsewhere, airports group BAA moved ahead 10 to 493p following the
announcement of a 6.4 per cent advance in passenger volume for August.

FT  14 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Fisons suffers afresh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JEFFREY BROWN, STEVE THOMPSON and RAMRAJ GOGNA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The troubles of Fisons, the hard hit pharmaceuticals and scientific
instruments group, took another twist yesterday as the interim results
statement appeared to offer enduring gloom.
The company has been seen as a long-time bid target by market optimists. But
the possibility that, however cheap, it might not actually have much to
offer, has led some analysts to question just how much bid value there is in
the share price and thus how much it would fall if bid hopes evap-orated.
Mr Paul Woodhouse of Smith New Court argued that the stock was on a highly
demanding prospective multiple of 23 times earnings. If it were to return to
a sector rating, its share price would have to tumble to 90p, while if it
was on the same rating as Glaxo its share price would be virtually halved.
As it was, analysts responded to first-half profits of Pounds 30.4m, a
halved dividend, and a very cautious statement on prospects for the second
half by lowering forecasts. Smith New Court came down to Pounds 45m from
Pounds 80m for the full year, while UBS reduced its estimate to Pounds 60m
from Pounds 90m.
Fisons, which stood above 500p a share three years ago, crumbled a further
10 per cent yesterday to end at 135p, with heavy volume of 7.7m going
through the electronic ticker.

FT  14 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures were volatile in thin trading, opening with renewed
weakness but rebounding sharply once the latest US inflation indicator had
been released.
The September contract on the FT-SE 100 index moved down through 3,100 at
the opening but clawed back to close at 3,118, marginally below the 3,120
best of the day. The closing discount to the cash market narrowed to 4 with
the fair value premium standing at around 3 points.
Marketmakers said business was mostly thin and nervous with the September
contract expiring on Friday. Trading volume totalled just over 22,000 but
almost half of that figure was said to have been determined by roll-overs
into the December contract.
Trading was again dominated by locals - independent traders - with
institutions for the most part keeping firmly to the sidelines. 'What we
badly need is an injection of hedge-fund and institutional activity', said
one dealer yesterday.
In traded options, volume moved ahead strongly to 56,282 contracts from
42,477 on Monday. The main drive came from FT-SE volume which was some
10,000 contracts higher at 22,824. Between them FT-SE and Euro FT-SE options
accounted for more than two-thirds of total turnover. The most active
individual stock options were Glaxo and Tomkins.

FT  14 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Losses recouped following US consumer
data - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confidence in the near-term outlook for UK equities appeared to recover
yesterday afternoon when share and bond prices rallied after the latest US
consumer price index came out in line with forecasts. Earlier, equities had
dropped by nearly 43 points on the FT-SE 100 Index as nervousness ahead of
the US data combined with fears in some quarters that further rises might
follow Monday's increase in UK base rates.
The recovery in the second half of the session, which was fuelled by a swing
from losses to gains in long-dated UK government bonds, reduced the day's
loss on the FT-SE 100 to 7.4 at a final reading of 3,121.4. Sentiment was
also helped by an early rise of 20 points in New York's Dow Industrial
Average.
Although the mood remained nervous, market analysts regarded the revival of
confidence in the UK bond market as very significant for equities. 'Monday's
move on rates should reassure gilts,' commented Mr Richard Jeffrey of
Charterhouse Tilney.
But in early trading, when bonds weakened across Europe on fears that the US
data might provoke a fresh move by the Federal Reserve, equities were weak
in London. Two leading financial newspapers suggested that UK base rates
would have to be raised again soon. However, NatWest Securities took a firm
stance against such fears. 'Base rates at 5.75 per cent; enough for this
year,' it told clients, adding that it saw only one more move - 'to 6.25 per
cent' - in the next 12 months.
The equity market appeared unconvinced, however, and yesterday morning
brought a round of losses among the retail stocks which had managed to avoid
selling pressure in the previous session. Sentiment in these sectors was
also hurt by disappointing results from Kingfisher, whose shares fell
sharply at first but rallied later. A poor trading statement from Fisons
also hit market confidence.
The Footsie 3,100 mark was quickly lost and the slide continued until share
prices steadied to put the index at a low for the day of 3,086.1.
Against this background, the recovery in the second half of the session was
all the more convincing. By the close, Marks and Spencer, the most prominent
name in the retail sector, was a shade firmer on the day and losses
elsewhere in the stores area were modest. Across the broad range of the
market there were many firm spots, with P&amp;O standing out strongly on good
first-half figures.
Stock market traders were favourably impressed by the recovery of the 3,100
mark on the Footsie, and said that there had been ready support when the
index moved below this level. The day's performance by equities showed that
bond markets still hold the key to UK share prices and that a convincing
recovery in bond prices is still the necessary base for a further advance in
the stock market.
The futures markets played their usual role in leading the blue chip stocks
as they first fell and then recovered. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, less closely
linked to the futures market, finished the day down 34.2 at 3,679.1.
Stock Exchange statistics indicate that on Monday, when shares reacted to
the unexpected timing of the first rise in Bank of England lending rate for
five years, retail, or genuine customer, business in equities remained
steady at Pounds 1.28bn. Volatility in share prices during that session
suggested that investors were both selling and buying stock.
Trading volume of 567.2m shares through the Seaq electronic system yesterday
compared with only 484.6m on Monday, and showed a return to more normal
daily average equity business levels. Further nervousness is likely ahead of
tomorrow's policy meeting at the Bundesbank.

FT  14 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Tame CPI rise gives Dow
renewed heart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks improved yesterday as a tame reading on consumer price inflation
brought some encouragement to a depressed bond market, writes Frank McGurty
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 19.52 firmer at 3,879.86, while
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.30 at 467.51.
Advancing issues outpaced declines on the Big Board by a slim margin
following volume of 295.7m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 1.75 better at
456.81 and the Nasdaq composite forged 5.82 ahead to 765.83.
A two-session bout of selling, triggered by news of a sharp increase in
producer prices, came to an end yesterday morning. Before the market opened,
the Labor Department had revealed a 0.3 per cent rise in the August consumer
price index, a figure that compared favourably with the consensus forecast.
Amid the relief, investors largely ignored contradictory evidence in a
regional manufacturing survey. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta said the
prices-paid component of its monthly survey of business conditions showed a
moderate upturn.
In spite of that unfavourable news, analysts said the more benign reading on
inflation in the consumer sector would allow the Federal Reserve to wait
until November before lifting short-term interest rates again.
That scenario had seemed less credible in the aftermath of last week's
report on producer prices.
The more positive outlook yesterday enabled bonds to finish with decent
gains, but only after the market reversed direction several times. By
comparison, equities were steadfast. The early gains eroded a bit near
midday, but the market regained its stride later.
Among the Dow industrials, raw material suppliers - which benefit from the
accelerating trend in producer prices - led the way. Alcoa closed Dollars 1
3/8 stronger at Dollars 84 and International Paper climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 74 1/2 .
Elsewhere in the robust paper and pulp sector, Georgia Pacific gained
Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 73 and Champion International added Dollars 1 1/4
at Dollars 36 5/8 .
Market bellwether stock IBM set the positive tone among technology issues,
moving forward Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 69 1/4 .
Semiconductor issues showed some sparkle following the release of the August
book-to-bill ratio, a keenly watched indicator of the industry's future
performance. A surpris-
ingly strong reading sent Micron Technology Dollars  7/8 higher to Dollars
39 7/8 and Texas Instruments up Dollars 1 to Dollars 75 1/2 .
The session propelled two relative unknowns into the New York SE's most
active list. Western Company of North America, an oil services concern,
jumped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 16 3/4 after BJ Services announced its
interest in acquiring the company. BJ said it was appealing directly to
Western's shareholders after the rejection of its unsolicited Dollars 450m
offer, worth Dollars 18.50 a share.
Meanwhile, EMC appreciated Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 18 1/2 in unusually
brisk trading of 3.1m shares. The activity reflected a positive reaction by
analysts to the company's announcement that it was developing storage
applications for 'video on demand' services.
Mexico
Equity prices ended just slightly higher after losing their earlier Wall
Street generated steam.
The IPC index of the 37 most traded stocks was 4.55 points up on balance at
2,713.34 after touching 2,725.25.
Analysts said the Mexican market was basically in a period of consolidation
while awaiting news of earnings reports, the annual anti-inflation pact
between government, business and labour - due to be renewed shortly - and
incoming President Ernesto Zedillo's new cabinet.

FT  14 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): US data provide support to
late closing bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT, MICHAEL MORGAN and JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Markets took a waiting brief during the morning ahead of the release of the
US CPI data, which encouraged their performance in the afternoon.
FRANKFURT reacted to the US data with a modest gain in the post-bourse after
falling back nearly 1 per cent during the session. However, brokers
commented that investors remained nervous, illustrated by the low trading
volume.
The Dax index retreated 18.52 to 2,136.09.
In the post-bourse, the Ibis indicated index moved to 2,144.56. Turnover
totalled DM5.4bn.
Aside from the economic news there was little else to stimulate activity.
Bayerische Hypo Bank, which announced the price for its one-for-10 capital
increase at DM350, lost DM6.30 at DM403.20.
Bayer was down a further DM3.20 at DM365.30 following news on Monday of its
purchase of Sterling Drug's North American over-the-counter pharmaceuticals
business.
AMSTERDAM moved slightly higher, the AEX index finishing at 412.69, a gain
on the session of 0.88.
Gist-Brocades, the consumer goods group, which had been downgraded to hold
by James Capel on Monday, added 90 cents at Fl 45.10, in line with the
market trend. Capel explained that after three years of strong profits
growth - 23 per cent on average - the 9.9 per cent first-half figures
disappointed investors. Capel lowered its net profits growth forecast from
15 per cent to 10 per cent annually which, due to stock option dividends,
would translate as an annual increase in earnings per share of 6.5 per cent.
PARIS was another market to turn from a weak morning to strength in the
afternoon. The CAC-40 index finished 2.57 up at 1,969.36, having been off
nearly 1.5 per cent during the early part of the day. Turnover was some
FFr3bn.
Legrand was one of the most popular stocks, gaining FFr240 at FFr6,670 after
forecasting a 30 per cent rise in profits for the full year.
MILAN picked up late in the day, helped by the US data and the outcome of
talks between Mr Silvio Berlusconi and union representatives on reform of
the pension system.
The Comit index was flat, finishing 0.64 lower at 648.19, while the real
time Mibtel index picked up from a day's low of 10,312 to finish 28 ahead at
10,429.
Olivetti reversed recent falls with a L36, or 1.8 per cent, advance to
L1,986 and Credito Italiano picked up L95, or 4.6 per cent, to L2,140,
although dealers said there was no news to explain the rise.
Ferruzzi fell L50, or 3.1 per cent, to L1,565 in the wake of moves by the
Ferruzzi family to contest decisions made at the August 1993 shareholders'
meeting on the accounts, and speculation about a capital increase.
In the telecommunications sector, Telecom Italia rose L40 to L4,330, but the
holding company Stet eased L15 to L4,625 after Mr Michele Tedeschi, chairman
of state industrial holding company IRI, said that a first tranche of the
state-owned telecommunications sector should be sold by the end of the year.
ZURICH rebounded after early weakness, the SMI index picking up from a low
of 2,624.3 to finish 15.8 higher at 2,658.8, with the strengthening dollar
providing additional support.
Banks led the market higher. CS Holding rose SFr12 to SFr567, still
benefiting from its decision to withdraw its offer for Austria's
Creditanstalt-Bankverein. UBS bearers rose SFr15 to SFr1,220, and among the
insurers, Zurich added SFr16 at SFr1,279.
Nestle rose SFr19 to SFr1,236 ahead of tomorrow's results: analysts are
expecting a modest increase in first-half profits but forecast that
second-half earnings should surge due to the capital gain from selling its
L'Oreal distributorships to L'Oreal.
The pharmaceuticals sector was mixed, Roche certificates rising SFr40 to
SFr6,225 but Sandoz losing SFr6 at SFr700.
STOCKHOLM was supported by a stronger crown, a more stable debt market and
the US CPI figures. The Affarsvarlden index put on 3.9 at 1,454.2.
The banking and insurance sector climbed almost 3 per cent. S-E-Banken's 'A'
shares advanced SKr1.70 to SKr46.20, while Handelsbanken 'A' rose SKr2 to
SKr101.
NCC 'B' was up SKr3.50 at SKr63 after the construction group said it had
sold its entire stake of 25.7m shares in the British-Swedish stainless
steelmaker Avesta Sheffield to BZW, giving it a capital gain of about
SKr1.2bn.
MADRID reacted wildly first to higher than expected inflation figures in
Spain which triggered early losses, and then to the US's CPI data which
caused a rebound.
At the end of the day, the general index was ahead 3.10, or 1 per cent, at
301.82 on a turnover of Pta31.16bn. Dealers said stocks with ADRs performed
well in the afternoon session and there was also strong buying in the banks.
Among the banks, Santander added Pta60 at Pta5,180 and Argentaria put on
Pta240 at Pta5,450.

FT  14 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: TSE closes higher after election
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of a bad day for gold stocks, the TSE 300 closed higher as
investors shrugged off the election of a separatist government in Quebec and
sought solace in a stronger Canadian dollar, a rally in the bond market and
perceived good news on the US inflation front. But falls led rises by 377 to
350 after volume of 57.2m shares. The TSE 300 gained 14.35 at 4,344.22. The
dollar was sent to a seven-month high by the stronger than expected showing
of the defeated Liberal party in the Quebec elections, indicating that
popular support for separation was not overwhelming.

FT  14 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei regains 20,000
level for first time in four days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Buying by public funds and investment trusts supported share prices, and the
Nikkei 225 average closed above the technically important 20,000 level for
the first time in four trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index was finally up 128.83 at 20,046.11 after a low for the day of
19,826.37 in the morning session and a high of 20,097.02 in the afternoon.
Volume picked up to 339m shares from Monday's 192m, but most overseas
investors and domestic institutions remained on the sidelines due to the
lack of fresh incentives. However, corporate fund managers stepped up
profit-taking to boost their earnings ahead of the September book closing,
while buying by public funds and arbitrageurs countered the rise in stock
sales.
The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 6.34 at 1,592.51 and the
Nikkei 300 added 1.72 at 290.76, but declines led rises by 531 to 440, with
201 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.19 to
1,300.56.
In spite of the rise in share prices, traders said underlying investor
confidence remained sluggish.
Japan Telecom, regarded as the recent benchmark for market sentiment,
declined Y70,000 to a new low of Y4.2m. The company has been a casualty of
oversupply fears since its listing on the second section last week.
DDI, another telecommunications stock on the second section, fell Y14,000 to
Y884,000, while East Japan Railway, a leading shareholder of Japan Telecom,
lost Y3,000 at Y500,000. But Nippon Telegraph and Telephone finished Y4,000
ahead at Y888,000 on buying by public funds after sliding to a low of
Y879,000 during the day.
Mitsui Trust and Banking advanced Y30 to Y1,080 on reports that it had
started to clear its balance sheet. Other trust banks were also higher,
Mitsubishi Trust adding Y40 at Y1,430 and Sumitomo Trust Y50 at Y1,380.
Tsumura, a pharmaceutical company, retreated by its daily limit of Y200 to
Y1,170 on selling by individual investors. Reports of in-house squabbling
among executives discouraged investors.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 22.47 to 22,250.59 in volume of 109.6m
shares. Rohm, the semiconductor device maker, gained Y60 at Y4,320 for the
second consecutive day.
Roundup
Trading in some of the Pacific Rim markets was restrained ahead of
yesterday's key US inflation data.
SEOUL turned back from an intraday high for the year as active selling of an
estimated Won40bn of shares by a state-run fund wiped out most of the early
gains. The composite index ended 0.32 easier on balance at 995.38, after
touching a year's peak of 1,006.21.
Brokers said the government wanted the index to remain below the 1,000 mark
ahead of the Chusok full-moon holidays next week amid worries that a sharp
rise in stock prices could provoke discontent among farmers, who have
criticised government policies favouring city dwellers.
Primary blue chips remained strong in spite of selling by the stock
stabilisation fund. Volume totalled 41.1m shares, compared with Monday's
36.2m.
HONG KONG picked itself up after the previous day's steep fall but the mood
was cautious ahead of yesterday's US inflation data on worries that higher
short-term US interest rates would feed through to local rates.
The Hang Seng index ended 46.64 higher at 9,937.01, pushed up largely by
selected blue chips, in turnover that shrank to HKDollars 3.7bn from
Monday's HKDollars 5.19bn.
H shares, which were sold off sharply on Monday, bounced back on Japanese
buying. The H-share index of China-incorporated issues rose 40.47, or 2.8
per cent, to 1,471.89.
Tianjin Bohai was the most active H share, up 12 cents at HKDollars 1.50,
followed by Yizheng Chemical Fibre, 19 cents ahead at HKDollars 3.13.
BOMBAY edged back from Monday's record peak, the BSE 30 index giving up
29.15 at 4,599.42 after testing a new high during the day of 4,628.93.
Among the day's gains, Raymond Woollen Mills rose Rs37.50 to Rs400 on
expectations of better half-yearly results.
SINGAPORE saw a technical rebound as Malaysian speculative shares traded
over the counter ignored Wall Street's weak overnight performance.
The Straits Times Industrial index closed 19.27 higher at 2,299.66 after a
day's peak of 2,310.30.
KUALA LUMPUR traded in a tight range, the composite index finishing just
0.06 firmer at 1,169.11 in volume of 401m shares.
Sateras Resources moved forward 20 cents to MDollars 3.40 on rumours that a
politically linked group was buying a stake in the company.
BANGKOK saw a rally in blue chips during the afternoon which brokers said
was a technical rebound. The SET index added 17.32, or 1.16 per cent, at
1,507.73 in Bt7.1bn turnover.
Siam City Bank topped the actives list and moved ahead Bt1 to Bt31.
TAIPEI retreated as investors were seen moving out of industrial stocks,
particularly in the plastics and petrochemicals sectors. The weighted index
shed 12.46 to 6,955.02 in thin turnover of TDollars 56.87bn.
Tung Ho Steel saw heavy profit-taking, ending 7 per cent down at TDollars
42.80 in spite of announcing a successful issue of global depositary
receipts.
Elsewhere, Hwa Nan Bank rose TDollars 4 to TDollars 215, First Commercial
advanced TDollars 3 to TDollars 182 and Chang Hwa Bank gained TDollars 1 at
TDollars 193 in late trade.
MANILA recovered from Monday's fall on late buying and the composite index
finished 33.9 higher at 2,953.24. Turnover came to 2.3bn pesos in volume of
3.2bn shares.
Oil refiner Petron was the day's most active stock, although it closed
unchanged at 23.50 pesos.
PLDT again led the advances, rising 2.2 per cent to 1,580 pesos, while
Meralco 'A' moved ahead 2.50 pesos to 285 pesos and the 'B' stock climbed
1.4 per cent to 367.50 pesos.
SYDNEY was helped higher by Commonwealth Bank announcing an increase in
profits. The All Ordinaries index closed 10.7 ahead at 2,043.6 after
touching 2,051.7.
Commonwealth Bank ended a net 19 cents up at ADollars 7.69 after jumping 4
per cent within minutes of the profits announcement. Other banks mostly rose
in sympathy: ANZ appreciated 8 cents to ADollars 3.93 in turnover of 5.74m
shares and Westpac 4 cents to ADollars 4.35 but NAB slipped 6 cents to
ADollars 10.
Coles Myer, the retailer, improved 9 cents to ADollars 4.03 on the back of
strong earnings.
WELLINGTON was depressed by a fall in forest sector stocks, although Telecom
was a steadying influence.
The NZSE-40 capital index shed 17.28 to 2,093.80 after a 2.2 per cent
decline on Monday. Fletcher Challenge dropped 11 cents to NZDollars 4.14.

FT  14 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa drifts lower, golds steady
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg drifted lower in dull trade as the market waited for further
direction amid concern about prospects for bullion and world equities. The
overall index slipped 19 to 5,863 and industrials dropped 39 to 6,547.
Dealers said traders were cautious about a weak industrial sector and fears
of inflation. New figures showed that the producer price index rose sharply
in July to its highest annual rate in two years, heralding a possible return
to double-digit inflation by the end of the year, and exceeding market
expectations. The all-commodities index rose 1.7 per cent for the month to
show a 9 per cent gain year-on-year, the highest since August 1992 when the
rate was 9.5 per cent. The engineering conglomerate Barlows receded 50 cents
to R31.75.
Gold shares, meanwhile, managed to hold steady in spite of the softer metal
price in largely technical trade. Golds edged up 7 to 2,417 and the
bullion's afternoon fix was down below the Dollars 390 an ounce level to
Dollars 389.60. Mr Emin Eyi from Baring Securities described the small gain,
however, as 'the start of an underlying rise in gold shares'. He cited a
weakening commercial rand, helping exporters, and prospects of a rise in
interest rates as reasons why the market should pick up. Dries added 75
cents at R68.50.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Canadian dollar firmer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The failure of Quebec separatists to win a convincing mandate in weekend
elections helped the Canadian dollar to its highest level in eight months
yesterday, writes Philip Gawith.
Although the pro-sovereignty Parti Quebecois (PQ) scored a solid victory in
the provincial elections, the smaller than expected margin of victory was
seen as diminishing the prospect of Quebec seceding.
The Canadian dollar closed in London at CDollars 1.3534 against the US
dollar, from CDollars 1.3653 on Monday. Currency dealers said the Bank of
Canada had intervened and sold Canadian dollars for US dollars when the
currency had broken through the CDollars 1.35 level.
The US dollar, meanwhile, benefited from firmer bond prices, following a
fairly benign consumer prices report. It finished in London at DM1.5493 from
DM1.5435 and against the yen at Y99.045 from Y98.985. But it slipped in New
York to DM1.5433 and Y98.835.
The D-Mark was generally weaker in Europe, with the market realising that
the political risk in the October elections is higher than previously
anticipated. It finished at FFr3.421 against the franc, from FFr3.425, and
L1,013, from L1,017, against the Italian lira.
Sterling traded firmly after Monday's 50 basis-point rise in interest rates,
although it lost ground in the afternoon against the improved dollar. It
ended at Dollars 1.5613 after briefly trading above Dollars 1.57, and at
DM2.4189 after moving above DM2.42.
Analysts said the strengthening of the Canadian dollar - which looks to be
breaking a three-year downtrend against the US dollar - was partly a
knee-jerk response to the election result, and partly a case of making up
lost ground.
Other 'commodity' currencies, such as the Australian and New Zealand
dollars, have risen this year on the back of the improved outlook for
commodity prices. The Canadian dollar was held back by political
uncertainty.
Mr Tim Stewart, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley in London, said that
with the Quebec issue partially resolved - at least in the mind of the
market - the currency had made up some of the lost ground. He predicted that
it would probably establish a CDollars 1.3450 to CDollars 1.3650 trading
range to the US dollar, compared to CDollars 1.3750 to CDollars 1.3950 seen
so far this year.
Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS in London, said the
election result was good for the currency in the short term, but he remained
cautious over the longer term. 'Now that you have the PQ in negotiations at
the federal level, it may be that much more difficult for the government to
achieve the budget cuts it seeks.'
Wood Gundy Economics, part of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce group,
commented: 'While today's victory for the PQ will provide them with a base
from which to build support for sovereignty, we believe that markets will
judge referendum prospects as sufficiently distant and uncertain as to not
preclude a return to fundamentally driven markets, with narrower Canada-US
interest rate spreads and a firming Canadian dollar.' It predicts CDollars
1.3420 at the end of the year.
Sterling appeared to be the beneficiary of Monday's rate rise being seen by
the market as 'pre-emptive'. Mr Brian Durrant, economist at broker GNI, said
it had been 'a rare UK occurrence, a rate hike not provoked by turbulence in
the foreign exchanges; the UK authorities appear to have pulled off
something the Fed has been trying all year to achieve - namely a pre-emptive
rate hike'.
One pundit cautioned against the market getting carried away, noting that
'sterling/D-Mark has been trending lower since I was born'.
But Mr Chris Turner, currency analyst at BZW, said there were various
reasons why sterling should do better than the dollar did, when US rates
were first raised in February. These included UK real rates having less to
rise before 'neutrality' is achieved; the UK output gap being larger,
reducing the chance of the Bank being seen to be 'behind the game' in
combatting inflation; and the market also being much less bullish about the
pound in the first place.
Mr Stewart of Morgan Stanley said he thought sterling could reach
DM2.45/2.50 in the next few months, especially if the D-Mark weakened ahead
of next month's elections.
Short sterling staged a recovery after a bout of pessimism in the immediate
aftermath of the rate rise. The September contract rose by seven basis
points to 94.14, while the December contract was up by a similar margin to
93.37.
The market clearly believes that Monday's increase in rates was only the
first of many. It is still discounting short-term rates above 6.6 per cent
at the end of the year, and at 8.7 per cent in December 1995.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 329m assistance,
at the new established rate of 5 5/8 per cent, after forecasting a Pounds
300m shortage. Overnight money traded between 3 and 5 3/8 per cent.
In the cash markets, three-month money LIBOR traded at 5 13/16 per cent,
from 5 7/8 per cent.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Winter crops hit by Australian
drought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A severe drought in Australia's eastern states has caused the country's
Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics to cut its forecast for winter
crop production to 16.6m tonnes, down from an estimated 28.2m tonnes in
1993-94.
Wheat production alone is forecast to fall by 38 per cent to 10.4m tonnes.
The bulk of this production will come from Western Australia, 'the third
successive year that wheat production in WA will be around 6m tonnes, which
is near-record production,' the bureau said.
By contrast, the area sown to wheat in New South Wales is expected to be
about half that planted in 1993-94.
Total production in NSW is expected to be about 1m tonnes - less than 20 per
cent of the 1993-94 figure.
Queensland, where the drought is into its fourth year, is forecast to
produce only 230,000 tonnes. In a 'normal' year, Queensland's wheat
production is around 1.5m tonnes.
The bureau acknowledged that the drought was likely to have 'an important
impact on wheat exports', but said that the drop in production would not be
reflected in the fall in exports because of stocks carried over from
1993-94.
Wheat is not the only crop seriously affected by drought. In its latest
quarterly crop forecast, the bureau predicts that barley production will
halve from last year's record levels to 3.4m tonnes.
Cotton production is also likely to be hit for the third year in a row.
Plantings take place between September and December, but given
meteorologists' forecasts, ABARE says it expects only 223,000 hectares to be
planted to cotton, 42,000 hectares less than the area harvested in 1993-94.
The bureau says yields will probably be down too because of a shortage of
irrigation water.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jamaica acts to contain spread
of livestock pest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hundreds of thousands of infertile screw-worm - a type of fly which has been
devastating cattle and other livestock in the Caribbean - are to be released
from aircraft over Jamaica.
The project is being supported by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation
(FAO) in an effort to contain the spread of the pest through the region.
The flies being released are the sterile version of the New World
screw-worm, which is attacking cattle in Jamaica and has also been detected
in other parts of the Caribbean - mainly Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic
and Trinidad and Tobago.
About 86 per cent of the Caribbean region has been found to be infested with
the screw-worm, according to the FAO.
The project involves the continuous release of infertile insects which will
mate but produce no offspring, leading to the progressive reduction and
eventual total collapse of the screw-worm population, the FAO said.
The Caribbean project, to be funded by regional governments as well as the
FAO, is expected to cost about Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.9m). The Caribbean
islands are hoping for success similar to that achieved in Libya four years
ago, when the introduction of sterile screw-worms eradicated the fly in two
years before it could spread and devastate livestock throughout the
continent.
Sterile flies will be released over all but 10 per cent of Jamaica's 11,424
sq km. The flies are produced in a laboratory on the border between Mexico
and the United States and have been tested in parts of the US, Puerto Rico,
Curacao and the Virgin Islands.
In 1960, the cost of the screw-worm infestation in the United States was
estimated at Dollars 100m a year. Clearing Mexico and the southern United
States of the pest took more than 20 years and cost nearly Dollars 700m.
Regional scientists say that one problem in dealing with the New World
screw-worm is the ease with which it can be spread by animals as well as by
humans. A country can be infested by the presence of the fly in one animal
or human.
Although quarantine regulations reduce the chances of infestation by animals
crossing borders, no such arrangements have been made for humans crossing
from infested areas.
There have been hundreds of documented cases of human infestation by
screw-worm in South America, including some deaths. Caribbean governments
have been advised that a strengthening of quarantine regulations will be
necessary to prevent the spread of the fly, although scientists say it is
also likely that the pest could be spread by wind.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lac loses fight for zinc-lead
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A court battle between three big mining companies for control of the Lisheen
project in County Tipperary, Ireland, the second-largest zinc-lead deposit
in Europe, ended yesterday with defeat for the Canadian group Lac Minerals.
This leaves the way clear for Ivernia West, a 'junior' Irish exploration
company, to take control of the project. Ivernia's two biggest shareholders,
each with 24.5 per cent, are Minorco, the offshore arm of the Anglo
American-De Beers group of South Africa, and Outokumpu, the state-owned
Finnish group.
Mr David Hough, Ivernia's managing director, said last night that he hoped
his company could now turn away from the courts and concentrate on getting a
mine into operation. It might be possible to start production towards the
end of 1997, eventually achieving an annual output of about 200,000 tonnes
of zinc and 30,000 tonnes of lead in concentrate.
The dispute arose because Chevron, like many other international oil
companies, is divesting itself of its mining interests and wants to dispose
of its stake in the Lisheen venture. It agreed in September 1992 to sell to
Lac, one of Canada's biggest gold producers, which also had ambitions to
become established in base metals mining. But Ivernia West, which owns the
minority interest in Lisheen, claimed to have pre-emptive rights over
Chevron's 52.5 per cent.
This claim was tested in the Irish High Court and Lac said yesterday that
the court had ruled against it and said that Ivernia West did have
pre-emptive rights.
Lac said it would study the High Court judgment before deciding on any
further action. An appeal is possibile, but Lac was recently taken over by
American Barrick Resources, North America's biggest gold producer, and
analysts said Barrick was unlikely to be interested in pursuing a zinc-lead
venture.
Minorco some time ago agreed to provide Ivernia with Dollars 72m (Pounds
46.4m) to buy Chevron's share of Lisheen and for Ivernia to sell 50 per cent
of the ore body to Minorco in return for cancellation of the loan.

Copper and aluminium looked set to sail through technical resistance levels
and on to their next price targets in early trading on the London Metal
Exchange yesterday, but they failed to follow through this early show of
strength. Copper broke above resistance near Dollars 2,520 a tonne and then
burst up to Dollars 2,533 - a move which traders thought would carry it up
to this year's high of Dollars 2,557. But caution set in and the last kerb
(after hours) business was at Dollars 2,512, the day's low and Dollars 4
down from Monday. Aluminium, despite an 11,800-tonne fall in LME stocks,
failed to test Dollars 1,600 a tonne. Business was seen down to Dollars
1,583 before last trading at Dollars 1,586, down Dollars 6.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Healthy growth ahead for rice
trade - The opening of Japanese and Korean markets has raised forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growth in world rice trade is likely to be 'significantly higher' than
expected as a result of the successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round world
trade talks, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) predicts.
Before the outcome of the Gatt Uruguay Round, the FAO predicted a growth in
world rice trade of 3 per cent a year to 17.1m tonnes by 2000.
But as a result of the talks, Japan will allow rice imports from next year,
beginning with an import volume equivalent to 4 per cent of domestic
consumption, rising to 8 per cent by 2000. South Korea will allow imports of
1 per cent of domestic consumption, rising to 4 per cent in 10 years.
The FAO predicts 'some significant structural changes' in the export market
by 2000, especially in the Far East.
Thailand, the world's largest rice exporter, is expected to maintain its
position, but Vietnam is forecast to replace the United States as the
world's second-largest exporter by 2000. Bangladesh, which is now
self-sufficient in rice, is expected to be among the top 10 rice exporting
countries by 2000.
China and India are expected to continue to be major rice exporters and
importers, although India may emerge as the larger net exporter.
The FAO also predicts considerable variations in prices over the next six
years, with international prices 'moderately higher' in real terms.
At its 18th session in Rome last week, the International Rice Commission was
told that lower GDP growth in the Middle East would result in increased
imports of medium quality at the expense of higher quality rice. Africa is
likely to import more medium quality and contribute to strengthening demand
and possibly higher prices.
In Europe and North America the increase in demand will be mainly for higher
quality rice. Imports into the US and Canada of fragrant rice from Asia have
escalated 'and this trend is expected to continue,' Chan Ling Yap, FAO rice
specialist, told the commission.
Rice imports into the US had grown to about 10 times the level of the early
1980s, she said, but the US remained the world's second largest rice
exporter.
Demand for lower quality rice may fall in the next few years, although in
many exporting countries, more of this rice type is being used for feed,
leaving less for the export market.
World output of rice is predicted to grow at 2 per cent a year to 409m
tonnes by 2000, and demand for milled rice at about the same rate. About 90
per cent would be for food and the remainder for feed, seed and industrial
use.
'New technologies of milling, sorting and packaging will have to be put into
place' to meet the projected increase in demand for higher quality rice,
said Chan Ling Yap. 'The increased sophistication of the rice market opens
up new investment opportunities.'
But the FAO warns that although the growth in world rice supply and demand
seems likely to be balanced in 2000, 'the problem of hunger' will remain.
Higher prices could lead to some countries, especially in Africa, cutting
back on rice imports. This, together with cuts in food subsidies planned by
some countries, 'could worsen access to rice by the poor'.
However, higher world rice prices would re-emphasise 'the importance of
raising domestic production,' the FAO says, while international financial
institutions that have previously considered investment in rice uneconomic
could find the commodity more attractive.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Car industry issues aluminium
warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The use of aluminium in European car manufacturing should only grow slightly
in coming years because of price volatility and competition from steel, said
Mr Patrice Natier, general manager of Sogedac, the purchasing arm of the
Peugeot Citroen group, Reuter reports from Paris.
'Aluminium's share of the European car market is likely to remain relatively
close to current levels, at least for the next four or five years,' Mr
Natier told a Metal Bulletin conference.
Mr Natier cited 'erratic fluctuations in aluminium prices' as one of the
main obstacles to an increased use of aluminium in the European car
industry. 'Everyone in the car industry is looking for more stable aluminium
prices to be able to make the right long-term decisions,' he said.
'If aluminium prices return to Dollars 1,800-2,000 per tonne, this is likely
to put a strong hold on aluminium use in the car industry,' he added.
He called for co-operation between the car industry and aluminium producers
for 'fixing purchasing contracts unconnected to short-term developments in
market prices'.
Mr Natier predicted that over the next 10 years, aluminium's share of total
vehicle weight would increase from 6 per cent to around 10 per cent, or from
60kg to 100-110kg.
Only government regulations limiting fuel consumption could boost the use of
aluminium in the European car industry, he said.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries improve on benign inflation
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY, ANTONIA SHARPE and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US bonds finished with modest gains yesterday in a tentative response to a
benign reading on consumer price inflation.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/8 higher
at 97 27/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.678 per cent. At the short end,
the two-year note was  1/16 better at 99 27/32 , to yield 6.317 per cent.
In spite of the positive ending, the session revealed the depth of the
market's pessimism in the wake of Friday's news that producer prices are
rising at a much faster pace than previously supposed.
With traders braced for more bad news yesterday morning, the Labor
Department announced that the August consumer price index had risen 0.3 per
cent from the previous month, a little less than the consensus forecast of a
0.4 per cent increase. The 'core' rate, which excludes the more volatile
energy and food sectors, showed a 0.3 per cent gain, matching expectations.
The lower than expected result lent credence to a scenario which sees the
Federal Reserve waiting until November before lifting short-term interest
rates again.
That development was enough to allow bonds across the board make an early
move forward. Dealers rushed in to cover positions which had been set up on
the expectation of a more unsettling reading and a subsequent sell-off.
But despite the favourable outlook on rates, traders were not completely
convinced that inflationary pressures in the economy were contained. Many
were having second thoughts, especially after the Federal Reserve Bank of
Atlanta revealed a moderate increase in the prices-paid component of its
monthly survey on business conditions.
As a result, bonds zig-zagged several times during the session. In the end,
prices were up across the board, though the gains may prove short-lived. The
market has to face several important economic reports, including retail
sales and industrial production, due out later in the week.
UK gilts edged higher yesterday as favourable figures for US inflation
lifted European markets. The long end was also supported by hopes that
today's spate of UK data, which includes inflation figures for August, would
be favourable for the market.
Meanwhile, analysts were digesting the implications of Monday's rise in UK
base rates.
Mr Michael Pratten at Kidder Peabody said the UK rate rise had increased
credibility in the government's anti-inflationary stance.
'But the market is still worried as to whether the government will take any
more necessary action on interest rates,' he said.
Mr Michael Saunders at Salomon Brothers said there may be a narrowing of the
yield spread over bunds: 'The UK's inflationary outlook is good and the
policymakers are doing the right thing.'
The yield spread between gilts and bunds widened from about 135 basis points
on Monday to around 138 yesterday. On Liffe, the December long gilt future
fell to 99 9/32 before rallying to 100 5/32 , up  3/16 points on the day.
German bunds built on Monday's gains but analysts said the market remained
concerned about supply and the outcome of next month's federal elections.
The Bundesbank is believed to want to raise between DM8bn and DM10bn when it
holds an auction of 10-year paper next week.
The poor showing by the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the governing
coalition, in last weekend's elections in two east German states revived
investors' awareness that a victory for Chancellor Helmut Kohl was not a
foregone conclusion.
Analysts said that hopes in some quarters of the market that the Bundesbank
could announce a marginal cut of around five basis points in the repo rate
after its meeting on Thursday were unlikely to be realised.
On Liffe, the December bund future rose 0.20 points to 89.20 in moderate
trading.
Better supply and receding fears about an early presidential election
supported French government bonds. On the Matif, the notional bond future
rose 0.14 to 112.30. Some analysts expect the spread between bunds and OATs
to break below the current level of around 50 basis points in the run-up to
the German election.
Canadian bonds rose on the back of the stronger than expected showing by the
Liberal party in a provincial election, which calmed fears that Quebec would
separate from Canada. 'The market thinks there is no mandate for a

basis points to 7.70 per cent in early trading, and 10-year bond yields fell
15 basis points to 9.03 per cent.

FT  14 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Hungarian bank raises Dollars
300m

<TEXT>
The Hungarian National Bank has signed a Dollars 300m syndicated loan with a
five-year maturity, completing its Dollars 2.5bn international borrowing
requirements for this year.
Around Dollars 475m has come from bank loans, representing Hungary's first
moves into the syndicated loan market for some years, officials said.
Interest on the loan, which is syndicated to 35 banks, is Libor plus 175
basis points. It was lead-managed by Central- European International Bank,
which is owned by Japanese and European banks and the Hungarian state. Agent
bank was National Westminster.
The loan will be used to cover Hungary's expected current account deficit of
between Dollars 2.5bn and Dollars 3bn this year. Although central bank
reserves stand at around Dollars 6.7bn, the country is due to pay a further
Dollars 2.7bn in repayment and servicing of its Dollars 26bn gross foreign
debt this year.

FT  14 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Swaps volume up by 58.5% in
1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The total amount of swap transactions outstanding rose 58.5 per cent last
year to Dollars 8,475bn, according to the latest survey by the International
Swaps and Derivatives Association.
The volume of new swaps written in the second half of 1993 rose 11.8 per
cent to Dollars 2,912bn from Dollars 2,605bn in the first half. According to
ISDA, the continued growth resulted from an increase in hedging by
end-users. However, the pace of growth appears to be slowing as the plain
vanilla swaps market reaches maturity.
Activity in more complex swap-related transactions, such as caps, floors,
collars and swaptions, rose most sharply, by 88.5 per cent for the whole
year from Dollars 592bn in 1992. New activity amounted to Dollars 607bn in
the second half of 1993.
ISDA said the continued growth in the over-the-counter swaps market does not
necessarily represent a substantial increase in risk, as the figures
represent the notional principal amount used to calculate the cash flows
involved in swap transactions.
'Notional principal amounts reported by survey respondents are the base
against which cashflows are calculated and do not measure market value or
credit risk,' according to Ms Gay Evans, ISDA chairman and a managing
director of Bankers Trust. 'Derivatives credit risk . . . typically varies
from 1.2 per cent to 2.2 per cent of the notional amount for many dealers.'
The survey, conducted by Arthur Andersen, gathered data from 66 firms
representing the majority of ISDA member swap dealers.

FT  14 SEP 94 / International Bonds: European Investment Bank launches
L500bn offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Offerings in a variety of currencies on the eurobond market yesterday drew
support from the improved tone in government bond markets.
The European Investment Bank launched L500bn of three-year bonds yielding
11.45 per cent. Joint lead manager Deutsche Bank reported strong demand from
fund managers in Italy, Germany and the Benelux countries.
'The lira market has been very volatile but there is now a feeling that the
worst is behind us for a time,' said a dealer.
Joint lead manager IMI Luxembourg said L300bn of the proceeds were swapped
into floating-rate lire.
Commerzbank launched a CDollars 150m offering of five-year bonds priced to
yield 20 basis points over Canadian government bonds.
The bonds were mainly sold to retail accounts in Benelux and Germany, joint
lead manager Merrill Lynch said.
'We have seen continued demand in the Canadian dollar market with large
amounts of loan redemption at the moment and investors are looking to come
back into the market,' said one trader.
Some syndicate managers were surprised there was not more issuance in the
Canadian market following the rally in Canadian government bonds.
However, others questioned the timing of the launch. 'The Canadian market
has outperformed the US market in recent months and banking on a further
correction may be overly optimistic,' said one manager.
Reed Elsevier tapped the dollar market with a Dollars 200m offering of
five-year bonds, priced to yield 40 basis points over US Treasuries.
'The pricing was aggressive in what has been an anaemic market,' said one
dealer.
'There seems to be continued buying in the dollar sector, which is
surprising given its recent turbulence. The US and Canadian dollar markets
are the markets of choice at the moment, it seems,' said one syndicate
manager
ABN Amro launched a Fl 350m issue of 10-year bonds, increased from an
initial offering of Fl 250m.
The bonds were priced to yield 65 basis points over underlying government
bonds and were sold to Dutch pension funds and investors in Switzerland and
the UK, ABN Amro said.

John Labatt, the Canadian-based international brewer, says the North
American major-league baseball strike, which began on August 12, could cost
its sports and entertainment subsidiary up to CDollars 16m (USDollars 11.5m)
after tax in fiscal 1995, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Labatt's estimate of the cost was made on the assumption that the whole
season will be lost. The sports and entertainment unit, Labatt
Communications, posted a first-quarter sale gain to CDollars 97m.
Overall, Labatt's net profit for the first quarter ended July was CDollars
62m, or 63 cents a share, up nearly 9 per cent from CDollars 57m, or 58
cents, last time, on revenues of CDollars 924m against CDollars 682m.

FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Hong Kong SFC selects lawyer as
chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Anthony Neoh, QC, is to succeed Mr Robert Nottle as chairman of the Hong
Kong Securities and Futures Commission when Mr Nottle retires at the end of
this year, the Hong Kong government said yesterday.
Mr Neoh is a member of the governing council of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
and well acquainted with securities markets in both Hong Kong and China. He
was unobtainable for comment yesterday.
He was one of the advisers to China on how to list mainland state companies
on the Hong Kong exchange. In spite of teething problems, the listing of
these companies has been an acknowledged success.
Through this listing process Mr Neoh, 48, came into contact with senior
officials in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen and he has established good
relations with them. He is a respected authority on securities law and has
advised China's central government on the drafting of China's securities and
company law. He is also an adviser to the Shenzhen municipal government.
Sir Hamish Macleod, Hong Kong's financial secretary, said Mr Neoh had made
significant contributions to the development of Hong Kong's stock market
over the past few years. 'I am confident that he will bring in invaluable
expertise and give new impetus to the SFC in the years ahead,' he said.
Mr Neoh will take up his position at the beginning of February next year.
His contract expires on June 30 1997 - the day before Hong Kong reverts to
Chinese rule - but, if he wishes to continue, the high regard with which he
is held in China ought to secure him another term.
Mr Michael Cartland, secretary for financial services, said there had been
66 applications for the SFC chairmanship in addition to candidates
head-hunted by a search firm. Mr Neoh was the selection committee's
unanimous choice, he said.

FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Staying upright in a collapsing
market - Bernard Simon explains why Canadian property group Cadillac
Fairview outlived O&amp;Y
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cadillac Fairview and Olympia &amp; York Developments once had a lot in common.
Both were big, privately-owned property developers based in Toronto whose
portfolios included some of North America's most impressive buildings. Both
borrowed heavily in the late 1980s, and found themselves in trouble when the
bottom fell out of the property market.
The big difference now is that O&amp;Y no longer exists as a going concern,
while Cadillac continues to manage a stable of 70 prestige office buildings
and shopping malls, unencumbered by bankruptcy court orders and on tolerably
good terms with its creditors.
Not that Cadillac, with debts totalling CDollars 3.2bn (USDollars 2.3bn), is
out of the woods. About a dozen of its buildings have halted debt-service
payments. It is in the throes of tough restructuring negotiations likely to
take at least another nine months to finalise. Many of its creditors and
shareholders are unpredictable US 'vulture funds' which specialise in
trading distressed companies' securities.
However, Cadillac has learned several lessons from the O&amp;Y debacle. Unlike
O&amp;Y, it approached creditors early on for help. In return for them signing
confidentiality agreements, it supplied the information they asked for.
Instead of the entire company defaulting on its loans, as O&amp;Y did, Cadillac
moved quickly to segregate the cash flows and debt-service payments of its
various properties.
'They worked with the lenders prior to everyone getting angry,' says one
large creditor. 'Nobody has pushed them to seek court protection, so they
must be doing something right.'
Cadillac's holding company does not publish financial statements. It refuses
to disclose how much of its debt is in default.
The restructuring was interrupted last week by the replacement of more than
half the previous nine-member board of directors. The chairman, a Toronto
lawyer, was replaced by Mr Charles Masson, formerly head of financial
restructurings at Salomon Brothers, the New York investment bank.
The board upheaval reflects dramatic changes in the make-up of Cadillac's
shareholders and creditors.
Cadillac was taken private in 1987 by a group of 41 North American
institutional investors led by JMB Realty, a Chicago-based property
developer. One of those investors, the California Public Employees
Retirement System (Calpers), remains the biggest shareholder with a 15 per
cent stake. At about the same time, Cadillac raised CDollars 1bn in loans
from two syndicates comprising 42 North American, European and Japanese
banks.
Cadillac's troubles have prompted many of the original shareholders and
creditors to bail out. They have sold their securities at varying discounts,
mostly to US vulture funds but also to a number of European investors.
Cadillac officials estimate that about 90 per cent of its common shares and
subordinated debentures, which comprise its equity, and 75 per cent of the
syndicated bank loans have changed hands.
'They recognise that there's good value here and good upside,' says Mr
Graeme Eadie, Cadillac's chief executive.
The problem is largely on the liabilities side. According to Mr Walter
Schroeder, president of Dominion Bond Rating Service in Toronto, Cadillac
needs about CDollars 1bn in fresh capital, mainly to ease the burden of the
syndicated bank loans.
Mr Schroeder concurs that 'even with the fall in (property values), it's a
very viable company if they can get the bank loan away'. Cadillac's
portfolio includes Toronto's landmark Eaton Centre, and office buildings and
shopping malls in such cities as Vancouver, Atlanta and New Orleans.
The drive to solve Cadillac's problems is proceeding on several fronts.
Securities holders have been divided into three groups, representing
shareholders and subordinated debenture holders, senior creditors (that is,
holders of the syndicated bank loans) and lenders with loans secured by
specific properties. 'We're trying to establish the size of the pie, and
then we'll decide how to slice it up,' says Mr Geoffrey Godard,
vice-president of Quebec's Caisse Centrale Desjardins, who chairs the
syndicated debt committee.
Cadillac has sold its interest in a handful of properties, but Mr Masson
says 'we don't plan to dispose of any other assets'. The goal is to keep the
company together as a going concern.
Cadillac's management is seeking an outside investor, or group of investors,
to provide fresh capital.
According to Mr Masson, several candidates are at the due diligence stage.
'There is a high level of interest,' he says. Cambridge Shopping Centres of
Toronto disclosed earlier this year that it had submitted a bid for most of
Cadillac's assets.
The restructuring is complicated, however, by arrangements under which
Cadillac's partners in some of its choice properties have a right of first
refusal on its stake and other negotiating privileges.
On the other hand, the recent reshuffle of shareholders, creditors and
directors is expected to help rather than hinder the process. One creditor
complains that members of the former banking syndicates 'were so
dysfunctional they couldn't even agree when to meet'. Mr Godard adds that he
is 'cautiously optimistic' that the changes will speed things up.
Mr Masson is moving from New York to Toronto to oversee the restructuring.
He says he plans to stay for no more than 'single-digit months'. However, he
also acknowledges that big corporate restructurings have a habit of taking
longer than expected.

FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Disposals continue as Adsteam
reduces loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Adsteam, the troubled South Australian group formerly run by Mr John
Spalvins, yesterday reported a reduced loss after tax and abnormals of
ADollars 164.4m (USDollars 122.4m) for the year to end-June. This compares
with a ADollars 440.5m deficit for the previous 12 months.
Adsteam took the profit on various asset sales as an extraordinary item,
amounting to an aggregate ADollars 893.5m gain against ADollars 108.6m
previously. This left net profits for the year at ADollars 333m, compared
with last time's ADollars 222.6m loss.
The David Jones retail business made an operating profit of ADollars 84.8m,
up 13.7 per cent over the previous year. Sales rose 7.3 per cent to ADollars
1.41bn.
However, Adsteam acknowledged that its operating businesses could not
generate sufficient earnings to service the group's existing debt.
'Recognising this, the group is proceeding with the policy of attempting to
dispose of operating businesses and investments at a price and time that
will maximise the sale value,' it said.
No decisions had been made on the disposal of businesses, but Adsteam's
directors indicated that trade sales were unlikely to leave any surplus for
shareholders. 'However, there remains the possibility of offers to
shareholders of entitlements to subscribe for shares in any business which
is subsequently floated,' they said.

General Motors' GM Hughes Electronics unit says the consolidation of its

the closure of its facilities in Fullerton, California, writes Louise Kehoe
in San Francisco.
GM Hughes, which announced in March it would combine its electronics and
defence operations in a newly-formed Hughes Aerospace and Electronics
subsidiary, said the cuts were essential. 'Today, the Department of Defense
and our foreign customers are even more cost-driven and Hughes must change
to meet those new priorities,' said Mr Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief

230m fund-raising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Village Roadshow, the Australian cinema and theme parks operator in which
Anglia TV of the UK holds a minority stake, is raising up to ADollars 230m
(USDollars 171.3m) through a three-part preference share issue.
Part of the issue - ADollars 80m - will only go ahead if acquisition plans
for 'strategic investment' are successful. However, the shares have been
underwritten by McIntosh, the stockbroking firm, guaranteeing that the money
will be available.
Yesterday, Village declined to comment on what acquisition it had in mind.
It ruled out any interest in the Wesgo radio station business, currently the
subject of a recommended bid from Mr Tony O'Reilly's Australian Provincial
Newspapers. Market speculation had suggested that Village might have been
the buyer of a 5 per cent block of shares.
The first tranche of new money will be raised via the placement of 52.17m
preference shares, at ADollars 2.30 each, yielding around ADollars 120m.
This will provide additional working capital for the group, and help fund
its joint venture with Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network, and expansion of its
cinema interests in Asia.
The second tranche involves another 34.79m shares, also to be placed at
ADollars 2.30, to raise ADollars 80m. These are the shares that will only be
issued if the planned acquisition goes ahead.

FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Coles Myer edges up 3% to
ADollars 424m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coles Myer, one of Australia's biggest retailers, yesterday announced a rise
of 3 per cent in full-year profits to July 31. The company made ADollars
424.2m (USDollars 315.7m) after tax, compared with ADollars 411.8m in the
previous year.
Total sales for the year were up by 5 per cent to ADollars 15.9bn, while
fully-diluted earnings per share edged up to 30.7 cents from 30.1 cents.
There is a 0.5 cent a share increase in the final dividend, to 9 cents,
making a total of 20 cents for the year, up 2.6 per cent.
Coles, which operates around 1,725 retail outlets and is in the process of
buying out a 21.45 per cent stake in itself held by the US stores group
Kmart, blamed the small rise on the Myer Grace Bros department store
business, where operating profits (before interest and tax) fell by ADollars
29.5m to ADollars 94.8m.
During the year, old stock and merchandise ranges were cleared and a
restructuring got under way, with four smaller stores in rural New South
Wales closing.
The specialty stores group saw profits drop, from ADollars 55.8m to ADollars
20.2m, due to start-up costs at the new World 4 Kids and Officeworks chains.
The supermarkets business pushed profits up to ADollars 200.1m from ADollars
172.7m, while the Kmart discount stores made ADollars 128.1m against
ADollars 120.4m, and the Target stores ADollars 129.2m compared with
ADollars 121.7m.
Coles plans to open 130 new and replacement stores next year, and refurbish
274.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia, one of Australia's 'big four' banks and now
partially privatised by the federal government, yesterday announced a profit
after tax of ADollars 682.1m (USDollars 507.9m) in the year to end-June.
This compares with ADollars 443.1m in 1992-93.
Earnings per share rose to 76.9 cents from 51.7 cent, while the final
dividend goes up to 36 cents from 22 cents. The 1992-93 figure was reached
after a net abnormal charge of ADollars 136.7m. There were no abnormals in
the latest year.
During the 12-month period, CBA's total operating income fell by around 2.5
per cent to ADollars 4.26bn. However, this was offset by a substantial
reduction in provisions for bad and doubtful debts. The charge for bad and
doubtful debts fell by almost a third, to ADollars 320.7m.
CBA's operating expenses were also 2.4 per cent lower at ADollars 2.84bn.
The company said this reflected an internal reorganisation programme, which
had already reduced staff numbers to 37,269, compared with 42,329 a year
ago. Further 'orderly reductions' are expected as the branch restructuring
continues into 1995.
The contribution of the core banking operations to group profit rose to
ADollars 536.8m from ADollars 502.5m, while the financial services division
saw a much sharper jump, to ADollars 46.5m compared with ADollars 18.6m
previously. The Commonwealth Development Bank business turned in a profit of
ADollars 39.5m, compared with a loss last time of ADollars 11.7m, blamed on
bad debt expenses. Meanwhile, ASB Bank in New Zealand saw an 18.1 per cent
increase in profits to NZDollars 45.5m (USDollars 27.4m).
CBA said it was looking for further earnings growth in 1994-95, as lending
volumes picked up on the back of increased domestic economic activity.
However, it claimed that the 'intensely competitive nature of the industry'
could hamper progress.

FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Heinz raises payout and plans to
buy back shares

Shares in HJ Heinz, the US food group headed by Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish
businessman, rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 37 1/2 yesterday after the
company lifted its quarterly dividend by 9 per cent to 36 cents and
announced that it would buy back a further 10m of its shares.
Heinz's stock price has been under a cloud following the company's poor
financial performance in the year ending April 1994. But yesterday Mr
O'Reilly told the company's annual meeting that Heinz was 'back on track to
deliver double-digit growth in annual earnings in the 1990s'.
Mr O'Reilly said one significant area of growth would be baby foods.
According to a Reuters news agency report, he told journalists after the
meeting that Heinz's board had approved the acquisition of another baby food
company in Europe.
Earlier this year Heinz bought the Farley's baby food line from Boots, the
UK retailing and pharmaceutical group. This came shortly after it had agreed
with Glaxo, the UK pharmaceuticals group, to buy Glaxo's baby food line in
India.
However, Mr O'Reilly said Heinz's future growth would result from a
combination of higher volume, cost reduction, price increases, stock
repurchases, acquisitions and global expansion.

FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Bankers Trust sued over US
derivatives contracts

<TEXT>
Bankers Trust is being sued in the US over contracts that allegedly led to
losses of Dollars 20m.
The action is believed to be the first lawsuit brought against a derivatives
dealer by one of its corporate customers.
Gibson Greetings, a Cincinnati-based company, has filed a suit in the
federal court alleging the US bank misled it about the risks of complicated
interest rate swaps that it bought from 1992 onwards.
Bankers Trust continued to maintain that the contracts were 'legal, proper
and appropriate'. The bank is expected to defend itself by claiming that it
had advised senior Gibson executives, including the finance director, about
the risks of the transactions, both in meetings and in written
communications.
Gibson's contention that it had been misled by Bankers Trust first emerged
in April, when it announced losses in the wake of rising US interest rates.
It came after Procter &amp; Gamble had also publicly attacked the bank, though
P&amp;G has yet to take any formal legal action over its allegations.
In its suit, Gibson said that Bankers Trust 'did not reveal the material
risks and misrepresented the nature of the transactions and thereby deceived
and defrauded' the company.

FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Three-card trick from American
Express - Financial services group is entering a new phase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will investors ever again come to look on American Express as a high-growth
company?
After 18 months of reorganisation, rationalisation and disposals, that
question has come to the fore in recent days. The benefits from cutting
costs and shedding unwanted businesses have largely been realised: earnings
per share, which sagged at the start of the decade, have rebounded.
Mr Harvey Golub, the tough-talking Brooklyn native who has headed the US
financial group for the past 18 months, knows it is now time to deliver on
his promise to make the company grow again.
Two events in the past week suggest American Express has entered a new
phase. First, the US financial services group relaunched itself in the
revolving credit card business (most of its business comes through charge
cards, on which the full outstanding balance must be paid at the end of each
month).
This week it has also bolstered its presence in the travel business with the
acquisition of parts of the Thomas Cook operations for Dollars 375m.
Both events provide pointers as to how Mr Golub hopes to restore the
fortunes of the US financial services group, which was badly dented by a
failed attempt to convert itself into a 'financial supermarket' in the
1980s.
Mr Golub's plan rests on three elements:
extending the company's customer base;
finding ways to sell new products to existing customers; and
using the information the company has about its customers to make it more
nimble than the bank-owned payment systems that are its main competitors.
American Express's position in the plastic card market has slipped during a
period of explosive growth. While spending on plastic cards around the world
leapt from less than Dollars 250bn in 1985 to around Dollars 1,000bn last
year, American Express's share of the market fell from 22 per cent to 12 per
cent.
It was overtaken first by bank issuers of credit cards and, more recently,
by non-bank companies ranging from AT&amp;T to Dean Witter Discover.
These organisations made headway by offering new incentives to people to use
their cards - for instance by giving frequent-flyer miles, discounts on
telephone calls or (in the case of the Discover card) cash rebates - or by
dropping their fees and reducing interest rates.
American Express stuck with its 'one-size-fits-all' charge card, continuing
to charge all its customers a fee while applying a higher discount to
merchants who accepted its cards than those charged by the credit card
companies.
This higher discount discouraged merchants outside the travel and
entertainment industries - where American Express is almost universally used
 -from agreeing to accept the card, thus slowing growth.
Three things suggest Mr Golub has at least stopped the rot.
First, and most important, the attrition in the company's core card business
has largely been halted. While it lost 1.5m cardholders in the US during
1992 and 1993, the number of cards in use has fallen only very slightly, to
11.3m, this year (outside the US the figure has hardly budged from 8m).
The company has also cut the charges to its merchants in order to gain wider
acceptance for its cards. Last year, the average fee was 2.92 per cent, down
from 3.11 per cent in 1992. That, too, has largely stabilised - though Mr
Golub has made clear that he will, if necessary, keep cutting the discount
rate to build the merchant network.
Second, the group has just completed the disposal of a variety of businesses
acquired in its disastrous attempt at diversification in the early 1980s.
The list includes the sale of the Shearson stockbroking firm and the Boston
Company, along with the spin-off of First Data, a data processing company,
in 1992 and of Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, in recent months.
The third big advance has been in profitability. From a low point in 1992,
after-tax profits rebounded last year to equal the previous earnings record
set in 1989. This was due in equal measure to cost-cutting and a sharp
reduction in credit losses (many of them from the company's first, troubled
entry into the credit card market).
'They've had a lot of corporate issues to solve, and they've done a
world-class job,' says Mr Eugene Lockhart, the recently-appointed head of
rival card group MasterCard International. 'But the world card market has
moved on apace.'
Like many others, Mr Lockhart questions whether American Express can hope to
regain lost ground - particularly since the next wave of growth in the card
business will come from persuading consumers to use plastic rather than cash
for small-value purchases. American Express's traditional customers have
been business people using its cards for travel or entertainment.
Mr Golub's plans revolve in part around extending the company's range of
cards. Last week, American Express relaunched itself in the credit card
business, announcing the first in a series of products it plans to launch in
the coming months.
Rather than the old one-size-fits-all approach, each card will offer a
different range of incentives (the first provides a longer interest-free
grace period than is usual).
At present, American Express maintains revolving credit balances of around
Dollars 8bn: by the end of the decade, that figure will grow to Dollars
30bn, Mr Golub predicts. He bases the estimate partly on the company's
ability to persuade its charge-card holders to shift their credit-card
spending to American Express. These customers already owe around Dollars
40bn on cards issued by other companies, says Mr Golub.
Growth is also coming from the corporate card, a charge card used by
companies to make small purchases. Other card companies agree this remains
one of the big untapped markets in the payments industry, and could provide
solid double-digit growth for some time.
The Thomas Cook acquisitions announced on Monday are likely to bolster the
corporate card business: around two-thirds of American Express' existing
travel customers also use the corporate card.
Beyond this, Mr Golub has expounded two ideas for growth.
The first involves greater use of information about its customers' spending
habits. Unlike bank card issuers, who use the Visa and MasterCard payment
systems, American Express runs its own system, and claims this gives it more
detailed information about how its cards are used - and makes it possible to
target marketing campaigns precisely.
Making this information available to retailers could make it easier for
American Express to justify the higher discounts it charges them.
The second growth area involves taking American Express into new areas of
the consumer finance business. Mr Golub has yet to expound on what this may
entail, though he suggested at an investors' conference last month that the
company's customer base and distribution mechanism could provide a platform
for selling other companies' consumer finance products.
In a different way, this echoes the financial supermarket vision of the
1980s - though this time it would not involve large acquisitions.
Ironically, American Express has itself been talked of as an acquisition
target in recent days.
Perhaps this is not surprisingly, given the super-charged atmosphere in the
US takeover market and the doldrums in which its share price has languished
after a brief spurt in the middle of last year.
On a multiple of around 11 times forecast 1994 earnings, American Express is
trading on a par with regional US banks and behind higher-growth financial
services companies.
General Electric is rumoured to be interested in making another big
acquisition in the financial services sector, and this has helped to push up
American Express's share price by 10 per cent since the end of last month.
At a current market value of Dollars 15bn, though, it would be a big target
to hit, even for GE.

FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Goldman Sachs lead partner to
retire early
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stephen Friedman, senior partner and chairman of the management committee
at Goldman Sachs and arguably the world's most powerful investment banker,
is to retire early at the age of 57.
He will be replaced in November by Mr Jon Corzine, 47, joint head of the
firm's fixed income division. Mr Henry Paulson, 48, joint head of investment
banking, will become vice-chairman and chief operating officer.
Mr Friedman said he made his decision a year ago and had fixed the date of
the announcement in March.
Working at the head of Goldman could be 'more than a little tiring', he
said. 'I guess people might be surprised by the timing. But I've always made
clear to my colleagues that I had no intention of working full-time till I'm
60.'
Mr Friedman, 56, will assume the title of senior chairman and concentrate on
Goldman's main investment business, whereby the firm buys stakes in
companies on its own behalf.
The change in command comes at a delicate time for Goldman. After record
profits last year, it is believed to have been caught out, like other Wall
Street firms, by upheavals in financial markets.
As a private partnership, Goldman does not disclose results, but it is
estimated to have made a pre-tax profit last year of Dollars 2.7bn.
Mr Friedman said 1994 had been frustrating. 'While almost all our businesses
have done well this year, the firm's profits have been disappointing,
particularly as a result of trading results in some of the same businesses
which performed extraordinarily well in the last few years.'
Mr Corzine said yesterday: 'We're in no way backing away from our commitment
to global markets, but you have to adjust your risk profiles in different
market environments. Maybe we were a bit slow in recognising changed
conditions.'

<TEXT>
Gambro, the new Swedish recruit to the Wallenberg domain, said yesterday it
was expanding its US operations through the purchase of Dial Medical, a
Florida-based company which produces and markets dialysis concentrates.
The move increases Gambro's share of the US market for dialysis
concentrates, which are used in dialysis machines for kidney treatment, to
around one-third from 7 per cent.
The purchase will also lift annual sales of Gambro's COBE US subsidiary by
Dollars 30m from last year's Dollars 500m level.
COBE Renal Care said the purchase, on undisclosed terms, would broaden its
product range and provide a production capacity it had lacked. It said Dial
Medical had an extensive distribution system for its products.

FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Mediobanca rises 8% to L216bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mediobanca, the powerful Milan-based merchant bank, increased net profits to
L215.9bn (Dollars 138.39m) in the year ended June 30, up 7.8 per cent on the
L200.1bn profit recorded in the previous year.
The bank's directors agreed yesterday to retain the option to relaunch an
issue of new shares and warrants when appropriate.
Adverse market conditions forced Mediobanca to postpone the original
operation - which would have raised more than L1,500bn - in June.
A new resolution on the share issue will be put to shareholders at the end
of next month. No date has been set for a new offer, but this time no
minimum price will be fixed, giving the bank more flexibility.
'(The resolution) now incorporates a mechanism that will enable the share
price to be fixed more closely in line with market quotations and the
underlying net asset value of the bank's shares at the time of the issue,'
Mediobanca said.
When Mediobanca first announced its intention to issue new shares and
warrants at the end of April, it fixed a minimum issue price of L15,000,
compared with a market price of more than L18,500.
However, the shares were hit by a general decline in Italian equities, and
by news that four top executives of the bank, including Mr Enrico Cuccia,
honorary chairman, were under investigation by Ravenna magistrates for
alleged involvement in false corporate reporting by the Ferruzzi and
Montedison industrial groups.
Mediobanca angrily denied there was any substance to the allegations, which
are still being investigated, but the share price slipped below L15,000 on
the eve of the pricing of the issue and the bank decided it would be safer
to postpone the operation.
Yesterday, Mediobanca's shares closed at L13,706, before the results
announcement, against an opening price of L13,603.
Mediobanca has no urgent need to raise cash, as yesterday's results
indicated. The bank's net worth rose to L4,416bn, up 37.5 per cent, and
liquid assets rose 7.8 per cent to L6,481bn. The market value of its share
portfolio was L2,902bn more than its book value, after deducting L89bn of
unrealised losses.
The issue was partly intended to dilute the 50 per cent holding of its
traditional long-term shareholders - three banks, Banca Commerciale
Italiana, Banca di Roma, Credito Italiano, and a group of corporate
investors - to just over 40 per cent.
The bank approved its first set of consolidated accounts, which showed a net
profit of L301.1bn, and shareholders' equity of L4,605bn, after transfers to
reserves.
As in previous years, the board is recommending a dividend of L200 per
share, and has asked shareholders' permission to increase the maximum number
of directors from 19 to 21.

FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: KKR offer displays its passion
for complexity - The Borden bid has left observers scratching their heads on
who stands to gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For connoisseurs of 1980s financial engineering, Monday's Dollars 2bn bid by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for Borden, the US food group, brings a nostalgic
tear to the eye.
It evokes the high-water mark of 1980s deal-making - KKR's Dollars 26bn
purchase of RJR Nabisco, the large food and tobacco group.
Five years on, KKR - still the most formidable of the Wall Street buy-out
firms - proposes to pay for Borden not with ready money, but with RJR
shares.
It is a reminder of KKR's passion for complexity. In a deal described by one
Wall Street analyst - not without admiration - as 'pure smoke and mirrors',
observers are left scratching their heads on who stands to gain. KKR
evidently thinks it does. But what about Borden's shareholders, or RJR's?
For the average Borden shareholder, KKR's Dollars 14.25 a share offer is
nothing to shout about.
A year ago the stock stood at more than Dollars 19; two years ago it was
double that. And Dollars 2bn is a pitiful price for a leading US food
company with sales of Dollars 5.5bn. Campbell Soup, a decently profitable
food company which until recently had sales smaller than Borden's, has a
market value of about Dollars 10bn.
However, no one is betting on a better offer coming along. Borden is in a
mess. Its sales have dropped every year in the past five. In the past two
years, it has incurred large losses, mostly because of costly restructuring
plans which the company admits have proved ineffectual. A year ago it halved
its dividend, then halved it again. In spite of sharp cuts in capital
spending and inventories, cash flow has continued to dwindle. Until KKR came
along, Borden seemed to be heading for the rocks.
The mistakes which brought the company to this situation are sadly familiar.
In the second half of the 1980s, Borden embarked on an ambitious and
badly-managed series of acquisitions. As a result, it neglected its basic
business. For example, Borden has been in the dairy business for 140 years,
and is America's biggest dairy company. Last year its dairy division lost
about Dollars 35m on turnover of about Dollars 1.5bn.
The obvious question is what the financial jugglers of KKR can do to set
this right.
There are some simple answers. If the dairy business, for example, cannot be
sold, KKR can afford to close it down, whereas Borden could not.
A large part of Borden has nothing to do with food. It is the world's
biggest maker of wallpaper and owns Crown in the UK. The non-food businesses
made Dollars 172m of operating profit on sales of Dollars 1.8bn last year,
while food made only Dollars 23m on sales of Dollars 3.7bn.
Since those businesses generate high levels of cash, Borden could ill afford
to sell them. But KKR has deeper pockets, and could doubtless make a profit
on disposals.
The rest of KKR's calculations are murkier. KKR is apparently paying Dollars
2bn for the whole of Borden, payment being in the form of about half KKR's
remaining stake in RJR shares. But as soon as the deal is complete, RJR has
undertaken to buy 20 per cent of Borden from KKR, at a cost of Dollars 500m
 -again, payment being in RJR shares.
KKR's net payment for control of Borden is therefore Dollars 1.5bn. More
fundamentally, KKR is in effect liquidating half its remaining equity stake
in RJR - which has proved a rather dubious investment - so that it can back
another horse in the form of Borden. In the process, analysts reckon, it may
crystallise a useful tax loss.
More important, RJR as a recovery story may be played out. Its food profits
have risen sharply in the past three years, and may not have much further to
go. Tobacco, meanwhile, is under fire from US legislators and litigants as
never before.
Borden, by contrast, is a pure recovery play. If things came right, the
results could be spectacular.
Meanwhile, what about RJR's shareholders?
KKR, it must be recalled, does not technically control RJR: its equity
holding is only 35 per cent, and is due to fall to half that. But the
suspicion must be that KKR calls the shots.
It is slightly worrying that the deal envisages the sale of assets by Borden
to RJR. Even at the outset, RJR shareholders suffer dilution through the
issue of Dollars 500m of new RJR stock to buy 20 per cent of Borden, and RJR
has the option to buy a further 10 per cent.
On the other hand, there is plainly some scope for putting bits of the two
companies together.
For example, Borden owns the second biggest snack food business in the US.
Like the dairy business, it loses money. But this is a business RJR
understands. It owns Planters peanuts, and its Nabisco subsidiary is
America's biggest biscuit maker, with the distribution muscle to go with it.
In the end, one simple consideration may outweigh all that.
KKR has owned and controlled RJR for five years. It knows and understands
the business like no one else. For outside shareholders, this raises one
simple question. If KKR wants out, why would anyone else want to stay
behind?

FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Royal Oak raises CDollars 100m
for purchases

Royal Oak Mines, the Vancouver-based gold producer which this summer
launched a bold but unsuccessful bid for Lac Minerals, is raising CDollars
100m (USDollars 72.4m) in equity to finance other potential acquisitions.
Royal Oak said yesterday it had agreed to sell 17.4m shares to a group of
Canadian securities firms at CDollars 5.75 a share. The shares will then be
sold to the public.
The funds were required, the company said, to enable it to 'react promptly
in the event that a desirable acquisition opportunity should emerge'.
Royal Oak's CDollars 2.4bn bid for Lac would have been partly financed by a
share issue. It eventually lost the struggle to American Barrick, but
analysts predicted that Royal Oak's tenacious president Ms Peggy Witte would
seek other opportunities.
Among the possibilities are one or more of Lac's mines in North America,
which are expected to be put up for sale by American Barrick.
The underwriting group for the Royal Oak issue includes ScotiaMcLeod,
Salomon Brothers Canada, First Marathon Securities and Midland Walwyn
Capital.

FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: BfG Bank up 8.9% at DM50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BfG Bank, in which Credit Lyonnais of France has a majority stake, raised
its bad debt provisions sharply in the first half of this year as a result
of the collapse of Balsam, a sports flooring manufacturer, but still turned
in an 8.9 per cent rise in operating profits to DM50m (Dollars 32m).
The bank yesterday said that its provisions rose from DM106m to DM133m,
mostly reflecting the problems of Balsam which filed for bankruptcy in June.
BfG is owed DM33m by Balsam and DM80m by Procedo, a factoring company which
is Balsam's largest creditor.
BfG Bank, the biggest creditor of the two companies, has filed a suit
against Procedo which claims that Procedo was not a victim but an active
party to the alleged fraud surrounding Balsam. Procedo's chief executive has
been arrested, as has the four-man board of Balsam.
As Balsam's factoring agent, Procedo bought up most of the company's claims
on customers. But the invoices have mostly turned out to be worthless. The
contracts had been inflated or fabricated, it was alleged. Procedo owes more
than DM1.7bn to 50 banks.
BfG Bank - formerly controlled by Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs, the
German insurance group, with the BGAG trade union company also holding a
stake - also announced a 46.5 per cent rise to DM143m in its partial
operating profits, which exclude trading on its own account. All first-half
figures are compared with six-twelfths of last year's full result.
Interest earnings were 5.2 per cent higher at DM550m and commission earnings
on securities, credit and other business were up by 21.3 per cent to DM129m.
The bank's administrative and other costs, however, were held back to a rise
of only 0.9 per cent to DM536m.

<TEXT>
Swalec, electricity distributor in south Wales, told institutional investors
it expected to cut up to Pounds 30m from its Pounds 120m a year distribution
costs by 1999/2000 compared with this year.
It also said it planned for non-core activities to provide nearly a fifth of
group profit before interest and tax by 2000.
Celtic Contracting was trading profitably following a small loss and
restructuring charges in 1993-4.
Swalec was one of three companies which suffered the biggest cut in
allowable income as a result of the distribution review, with 17 per cent
required from next April.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions bolster Trinity International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First profits from recent acquisitions and gradually rising advertising
revenues helped Trinity International, the newspaper publishing group, to a
pre-tax outcome of Pounds 10.9m for the six months to June 25.
This represented an increase of 15.9 per cent on the Pounds 9.44m reported
for the 1993 first half, although the company conceded that UK margins fell
slightly as a result of the acquisitions in November of Huddersfield
Newspapers and the Argus weekly titles in the south-east of England.
Turnover grew by 24 per cent from Pounds 64.7m to Pounds 80.2m, bolstered by
a Pounds 14.6m contribution from the acquisitions. Earnings per share were
up 18.5 per cent to 10.9p (9.2p).
Mr Philip Graf, Trinity's chief executive, said there had been a strong
performance by the company's UK and Canadian businesses, but the US results
had been adversely affected by the worst weather in the north-east for four
years.
The vast majority of Trinity's titles in the UK had been unaffected by the
national newspaper price war, he said. The Daily Post in Liverpool had,
however, lost about 5 per cent of its circulation, taking sales back to
75,000 for the January to June period - levels last reached in 1990.
There were early signs, however, that the 5 per cent loss was a one-off, and
that circulation on the Liverpool daily was beginning to rise again.
'Although we anticipate a continuation of the national newspapers' cover
price war throughout the second half of the year, we believe the overall
effect will be small,' Mr Graf said.
Trinity has set an interim dividend of 3.3p, an increase of 10 per cent, and
said yesterday gearing had dropped from 50 per cent at the end of December
to 44.3 per cent.
Mr Graf said that advertising volumes were growing, but there were clear
differences by category and by area of the company, although job
advertisements were strong.
'The second half of the year has begun satisfactorily. Our full-year
performance should reflect further good progress in many areas,' Mr Graf
added.
Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson, said
yesterday he expected full year pre-tax profits of Pounds 23.5m.
The Trinity share price rose 1p to 415p.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: London and M'chester raises pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London and Manchester Group, the life assurance and financial services
group, yesterday increased its interim dividend by 9.4 per cent from 5.12p
to 5.6p for the first half of 1994.
A sharp fall in in new managed fund investments left premium income down
from Pounds 220.6m to Pounds 171.0m. In other respects, premium income was
generally flat.
Mr Martin Jackson, group finance director, said that the dividend level was
not directly related to premium income on a year-by-year basis.
He said that new business was at least in line with industry trends, and on
a longer-term basis the group was able to show that it could afford the
transfer to the shareholders out of the life fund.
L&amp;M is the only insurer which the Department of Trade and Industry allows to
distribute part of the long-term investment return on the shareholders'
interest in the life fund.
New managed fund business fell to Pounds 35.2m (Pounds 84.7m) after the
company's investment performance had slipped from the high levels achieved
in 1992 and 1993.
There was a slight fall to Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 3.7m) in annual premiums
collected through the industrial branch business, where premiums are
collected weekly from customers' homes, but this was less than the sharper
fall in this area experienced by the life insurance industry as a whole.
L&amp;M said there were signs that the volume of business could be built up from
these levels.
Within the consumer finance arm, levels of new unsecured lending were
significantly ahead of the first half of 1993 and hire purchase lending had
been buoyant.
The estate agency, including four firms and 85 offices, increased its number
of house sales by 3 per cent and was the most productive appointed
representative of the life company.
Mortgage arrears showed continuing improvement, with a significant reduction
in the proportion of serious arrears.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Claremont 18% ahead at Pounds
5.22m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Claremont Garments (Holdings), the clothing manufacturer which took over
Magellan Industries in April, lifted pre-tax profits by 18 per cent from
Pounds 4.42m in the 26 weeks to June 26 1993 to Pounds 5.22m in the 27 weeks
to July 2 this year.
The Pounds 43.3m all-paper takeover brought together two of Marks and
Spencer's leading suppliers and added lingerie and swimwear to Claremont's
other womenswear activities.
More than 90 per cent of Claremont's production is derived from the UK, and
the group supplies about 11 per cent of M&amp;S' clothing stock.
Group turnover grew 34 per cent to Pounds 62.8m (Pounds 47.1m), including
Pounds 12m from Magellan and Bellrise Fashions, the Next supplier bought for
Pounds 1.9m cash.
Operating profits rose to Pounds 5.51m (Pounds 4.6m), including a Pounds
577,000 (nil) contribution from the acquisitions.
Mr Peter Wiegand, chairman, stressed there was no slippage in margins in the
'old' Claremont, and there would be margin improvement in the second half.
Mr David McGarvey, managing director, said that due to problems of
production planning at Magellan, there had previously been 25 per cent of
capacity lost.
But now Claremont management and systems had been introduced - prior to the
autumn selling season - production slippage was down to 10 per cent and
like-for-like turnover had risen 25 per cent. In 1993, Magellan incurred
pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.26m (Pounds 511,000) on turnover flat at Pounds
36.9m.
Mr Wiegand reckoned there would be overhead savings of about Pounds 800,000
in the second half from the integration of Magellan, 'with more to come'.
Earnings rose to 7.8p (7.3p) basic and to 7.5p (7.1p) fully diluted. The
interim dividend is lifted to 4p (3.6p).
The shares closed down 10p at 305p.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Building a platform for growth - James
Buxton on the driving force behind the rise of Stagecoach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stagecoach, the biggest company to emerge from the privatisation of the UK
bus industry, moved up a gear last week. It acquired two of the 10 companies
which run London's red buses, boosting its turnover by a fifth.
With the Pounds 25.3m purchase of East London Bus and Coach, and South East
London and Kent (Selkent), it now controls 11.5 per cent of the UK bus
market and has a springboard to bid for more London routes.
However its ambitions do not stop there. It expects the next 12 months to
produce opportunities for expansion that may never be repeated. As the
reshaping of the bus industry continues, more investors in bus company
management buy-outs and employee share ownership plans are likely to seek a
way out.
To cope with expansion Mr Brian Souter, who founded Stagecoach in 1980 with
his sister Mrs Ann Gloag, now concentrates on acquisitions, as does Mr Derek
Scott, the finance director.
Last Friday Mr Souter told shareholders at Stagecoach's AGM in Perth that it
was targeting 'a mix of companies, some of which are underperforming and
less expensive to purchase, but with great potential for profit
improvement.'
Stagecoach, which came to the market last year, is the product of the Tory
government's bus policies. It exploited the deregulation of routes, and then
the break up and privatisation of the National Bus Group and the Scottish
Bus Group. It also has companies in Kenya, Malawi and New Zealand.
It now owns 20 provincial bus units throughout the country. Turnover last
year was Pounds 191m, including acquisitions, and pre-tax profits rose 46
per cent to Pounds 18.9m.
It has successfully combined buying and absorbing a stream of companies with
running a far-flung empire. According to Mr Peter Huntley, a transport
consultant with the TAS Partnership, it has 'developed a strategy for
running bus companies that is head and shoulders above those of the other
private groups'.
This is because Stagecoach was never a traditional bus company and 'never
inherited any cultural baggage' from the state sector, he says. 'You only
have to compare its head office (employing 30 people in a small house in
Perth) with the marble halls of some of the other companies.'
When Stagecoach makes an acquisition, it has bought seven bus companies in
the 17 months since its flotation, the new subsidiary is put under the
control of one of three main board executive directors, including Mr Souter.
They carry out a standard reorganisation procedure which focuses on four
areas.
Overheads: 'Most of the companies we take over have extra tiers of
management left over from when they were publicly owned,' says Mr Souter.
Stagecoach cuts them down to four levels above the bus driver or fitter: the
main board, the board of the subsidiary (one for each region), the
four-person team running the business, and the depot manager.
The new management make up the acronym TEAM: a traffic manager, an
engineering director, an accountant and the managing director.
The acquired company is likely to be streamlined. At Western Travel, the
Pounds 33m turnover group bought last year which operates in
Gloucestershire, Warwickshire and South Wales, 12 separate companies were
merged into three.
Purchasing: Stagecoach achieves immediate cost savings of 1.5 per cent
because of its superior purchasing power on spare parts, tyres and engine
components.
The fleet may be renewed. Stagecoach has bought 650 new buses since 1992 and
ordered another 680. New buses, built by Walter Alexander in Falkirk using
chassis from Volvo and Trinity, yield big savings being more reliable and
requiring fewer spare parts.
The average age of a Stagecoach fleet is 7.6 years compared with the
industry average of 11.
Productivity: If labour relations are unsatisfactory the company seeks a
consolidated agreement with the unions. What Mr Souter calls 'Spanish
customs' are eliminated or bought out.
Improving the networks: 'It can take two years to put a network right if the
previous management has messed it up,' says Mr Souter. 'That can happen if
they continually responded to what the competition was doing and eroded the
loyalty of existing passengers.'
Once the network has been sorted out, new services can be developed. Fife
Scottish introduced a hub and spoke system on its links between Fife and
Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee, and has achieved 40 per cent revenue growth.
'Stagecoach is achieving genuine organic growth, which is rare among the new
companies in what is, overall, a declining industry,' says Mr Huntley.
Mr Souter says there was organic growth in nine subsidiaries last year.
Stagecoach is now lifting its target operating margin for its original
subsidiaries from 15 to 18 per cent.
The company wants existing managers to implement changes so that they 'own'
them. Though some senior executives in a subsidiary may leave on takeover,
Stagecoach has consistently unlocked the potential of people in lesser
positions after it moves in. Once the new subsidiaries have been
restructured they are treated as autonomous provided they conform to
standardised budgetary controls.
Its opportunities for expansion in the UK will tail off when the bus
industry settles down, though it aims to achieve UK turnover of Pounds 500m.
With the London purchases it will exceed Pounds 360m on an annualised basis.
And the Office of Fair Trading is unlikely to tolerate Stagecoach having
more than a quarter of the UK bus market. But that would still allow it to
double its present UK turnover. Mr Souter talks of Stagecoach having a
global turnover of Pounds 1bn by 2000.
Stagecoach's subsidiaries are already the frequent subject of OFT
investigations, mainly over alleged unfair competition on routes. But Mr
Souter says the investigations generally concern very small parts of the
group's business. and receive disproportionate publicity because the OFT
announces them to the Stock Exchange.
When UK growth slows Stagecoach will turn more attention to expansion
overseas. The overseas subsidiaries, managed by Mrs Gloag, only make a small
contribution to profits but Mr Souter points out that they were mostly
acquired very cheaply and sees immense opportunities for expansion as
privatisation spreads.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Kingfisher offshoots turn in mixed
performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 82m to Pounds 88.1m at
Kingfisher masked a mixed performance from the retailing group's chains.
The biggest surprise was Woolworths' fall from a Pounds 2.1m profit to a
Pounds 6.9m loss, after suffering from the downturn in computer games sales,
which left it with excess stock which had to be heavily marked down to
clear. There was also a new Pounds 3.5m depreciation charge on checkout
scanning equipment, and Pounds 1.7m redundancy costs following
restructuring.
Comet also fell from a Pounds 0.7m profit into a Pounds 1.7m loss, hit by
higher expansion costs, and increased rents on out-of-town sites. New
opening costs in Kingfisher's smaller chains, including Music and Video
Club, and the office superstore chain Staples, resulted in a Pounds 2.2m
loss (Pounds 0.3m profit).
Other chains performed better. Darty, the French electrical retailer which
made a full first-half contribution for the first time, made operating
profits of Pounds 35.7m, and held margins and increased sales in a shrinking
French market.
The B&amp;Q DIY chain lifted operating profits to Pounds 44.5m (Pounds 41.6m),
although sales growth was slower than last year. Superdrug, the chemists
chain, also lifted operating profits from Pounds 12.8m to Pounds 14m.
Chartwell Land, the property division, increased investment income from
Pounds 19.5m to Pounds 23.1m.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: IBC surges to Pounds 4.94m in first half
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Communications, the publishing, conference, and data
services group, announced interim pre-tax profits ahead at Pounds 4.94m
against Pounds 1.37m.
Most of the improvement came from conference operations, but the pre-tax
figure for the six months to June 30 was also helped by a reduction in
interest charges to Pounds 485,000 (Pounds 1.09m) following a capital
reconstruction last June; the comparable period also carried a
non-continuing debenture interest charge of Pounds 1.16m.
Turnover rose from Pounds 29.1m to Pounds 38.4m.
'The performance has undoubtedly been enhanced by better trading
conditions,' said Lord Rees-Mogg, chairman. 'Additionally, the release from
the shackles imposed by the previous debt structure has allowed more freedom
to progress.'
Earnings per share were 10.1p (7.1p). There is an interim dividend of 1.5p
(nil).

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Increased customer spending lifts Wyevale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wyevale Garden Centres, the UK's largest garden centre company, saw a fall
in the number of customers to its 41 garden centres during the first half of
1994, but increased customer spending helped boost profits.
Pre-tax profits rose 82 per cent from Pounds 3.71m to Pounds 6.75m, but the
figure was distorted by the Pounds 2.9m profit from the sale of Homelands
Retail Park.
There was a Pounds 340,000 exceptional charge, for payments to the chairman
and a director, who retired during the first half.
Wyevale has maintained pressure on its suppliers, and it improved its
operating profit margins from 17.6 per cent to 18.4 per cent, in spite of a
competitive retail pricing environment.
Operating profit before interest and exceptional items rose by 5 per cent to
Pounds 4.34m (Pounds 4.12m), on a 3 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds
22.7m (Pounds 22m).
The average spend per customer increased by more than 4 per cent to Pounds
10.50, and while customer numbers fell about 1 per cent during the period,
the company said there were already signs of recovery.
Following the November rights issue, Wyevale will have net cash of about
Pounds 5.5m, in spite of Pounds 2.92m invested in the purchases of centres
in York, Bristol and Middlesex, and the cost of redeveloping its centre at
Marple, Greater Manchester.
The Bristol and Middlesex centres will make a maiden contribution in the
second half of the year.
Mr John Rudgard, chairman, said: 'our strategy ofbroadening our retailing
base will provide a framework for sustained future growth so despite the
continued economic uncertainty, we remain confident of our future
prospects.'
The company is paying an interim dividend of 2.93p (2.75p). Earnings per
share, adjusted for exceptional items, fell from 8p to 7.5p, due to the
rights issue.

Perkins Foods, which has been restructuring its business, reported static
pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.1m for the six months to June 30, while
turnover edged ahead from Pounds 199m to Pounds 201m.
However, sales from continuing businesses were 9 per cent higher at Pounds
194m (Pounds 177m), yielding operating profits up 3 per cent at Pounds 11.8m
(Pounds 11.4m).
Mr Howard Phillips, chief executive, said the results had benefited from a
strong performance by the fresh produce division, and by increasing volumes.
The group makes 80 per cent of its sales in Europe.
During the half the group closed its lossmaking UK frozen vegetables
business and reorganised its canned mushrooms arm. In July it completed the
restructuring into three divisions with the disposal of the UK catering
meats business.
The fresh produce side, which supplies Dutch supermarkets with off-season
imported fruit and vegetables, saw volume growth of 12 per cent. Operating
profits rose from Pounds 4.07m to Pounds 4.9m, and turnover increased from
Pounds 79.9m to Pounds 89.2m.
The frozen foods division, which now accounts for half of group business,
lifted sales from Pounds 76.5m to Pounds 81.4m, yielding operating profits
of Pounds 7.14m (Pounds 7.11m). Operating margins were under pressure,
dipping from 9.3 per cent to 8.8 per cent - still good margins for the
sector, Mr Phillips said.
Operating profits in the chilled foods division fell from Pounds 2.29m to
Pounds 2.03m as margins declined from 11 to 8.9 per cent. However, sales
were ahead at Pounds 22.9m (Pounds 20.8m). The fall reflected a 10 per cent
rise in turkey prices, which had proved difficult to recover, said Mr
Phillips. But there was strong demand for chilled foods in Holland, which
accounts for 65 per cent of the division's sales.
Net interest payable was slightly lower at Pounds 1.32m (Pounds 1.33m).
Earnings per share eased from 4p to 3.9p, or from 4.3p to 4.2p fully
diluted. The interim dividend is unchanged at 1.75p.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Chubb Security sells French lossmaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chubb Security, the electronic alarm and locks group, has sold its
lossmaking French alarm business, Chubb Securite, to its French rival, Ecco
Securite, for FrF26m (Pounds 3.2m), writes Richard Wolffe.
The sale is part of a long-term strategy to shed unprofitable companies and
target markets in east Asia and Australia.
Chubb Securite, which had an annual turnover of about FrF60m last year, is
understood to have incurred in the region of FrF3m for the year to
end-March.
Chubb is halfway through a four-year plan to raise its share of the Pounds
7bn world security market from 9.5 to 11.5 per cent.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Watmoughs ahead to Pounds 7.91m - New
contracts in UK and progress at Hungarian arm fuel the advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contracts to print the Daily Telegraph's TV &amp; Radio Guide and The News of
the World's colour supplement helped Watmoughs (Holdings), the Bradford
based printer, to lift interim pre-tax profits by 24 per cent.
They increased from Pounds 6.37m to Pounds 7.91m in the six months to
end-June on sales 26 per cent ahead at Pounds 82.7m (Pounds 65.5m).
Mr Patrick Walker, chairman and chief executive, said the UK had performed
better than expected, with overall demand improving in addition to the new
contract work.
The Hungarian subsidiary had progressed in line with expectations, while the
Spanish arm, which came on stream last year, had performed slightly worse
than expected.
Profits in the UK were 23 per cent ahead at Pounds 7.19m (Pounds 5.83m) on
turnover of Pounds 67.8m (Pounds 59.2m). Mr Walker said turnover in gravure
printing had risen from Pounds 33.9m to Pounds 44.6m, and in web offset
printing from Pounds 21m to Pounds 27.2m.
The company started printing the Telegraph TV guide in January and the News
of the World supplement in April. It had also won more business printing
retail and travel brochures and inserts.
Last month the group delivered the first Sky TV Guide, which had a print run
of 2.7m copies. The guide is expected to increase circulation by 50,000
copies an issue, giving it the biggest circulation of any UK magazine.
In Spain recession held back the level of business outside the printing of
]Hola] and Hello magazine. Profits were Pounds 415,000, compared with Pounds
326,000 from the start of the operation in the second quarter last year.
Profits in Hungary grew from Pounds 215,000 to Pounds 305,000 on turnover up
from Pounds 2.63m to Pounds 4.69m. The Budapest-based subsidiary now prints
36 periodicals and exports to Russia, Romania and Poland.
Net interest payable was Pounds 1.61m, against Pounds 76,000 in the first
half last year, when about Pounds 1.75m of interest was capitalised. For the
whole of 1993, interest payable was Pounds 1.97m.
The tax charge of 27 per cent (23 per cent last time) reflected a fall in
capital expenditure, which is expected to be Pounds 28m this year, falling
to Pounds 10m in 1995 before rising again.
Earnings per share rose to 7.82p (6.69p). The interim dividend has been
increased to 1.7p (1.5p).
COMMENT
Watmoughs looks well placed - demand is rising and customers are seeking the
group out because of its market position. Results are already weighted
towards the second half, and will benefit from a full contribution from the
two new contracts. It is confident of passing on price increases; in any
case most of its paper consumption is paid for by its customers in the first
place. There is plenty of room for growth in Hungary and Spain. Earnings of
22p are expected for the full year despite the increasing tax charge. This
puts the company on a prospective multiple of 18.5 - fully valued, but a
strong hold.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: DRS Data shares drop 58% on fall in sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in DRS Data &amp; Research Services, the scanning equipment manufacturer
which came to the market in May, fell by 58 per cent yesterday after the
company warned that uncertainty in education, the group's biggest market,
had led to lower than expected sales.
Shares in the Milton Keynes-based company closed 56p lower at 40p. The
shares were placed in May at 110p, valuing the company at Pounds 40m.
Mr John MacArthur, chairman, said that in the first months of the year sales
into schools, which accounted for 70 per cent of turnover, were 6 per cent
above the same period last year. However, by the end of the 28-week period
sales into schools were down by 14 per cent. Turnover for the 28 weeks to
July 15 fell from Pounds 6.87m to Pounds 5.76m.
Mr MacArthur said he expected sales to schools to represent a 'smaller
proportion of our growth in the future.'
DRS was seeking to broaden its product base as well as expanding into other
areas, including the health sector.
DRS supplies scanners which can capture hand-written data, such as ticks on
multiple-choice forms, for processing by computers.
Pre-tax profits stood at Pounds 1.48m (Pounds 1.54m). Earnings per share
were 3.19p (3.82p) and a 1p dividend is being paid.

FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Not a cloudless sky for Irish
Permanent - Alison Smith charts the society's road to conversion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish Permanent Building Society, Ireland's largest mortgage lender with
about 27 per cent of the Pounds 7.3bn Irish mortgage market, is not living
up to its name.
It is still Irish, but its status as a building society is increasingly
impermanent, as it is well on the way to becoming a publicly quoted company
floated on the London and Dublin stock exchanges.
The process is set to move a further step forward today as the pathfinder
prospectus is due to be published when the society announces its interim
results.
The society's road to conversion illustrates some of the differences between
the processes and regulatory regimes in Ireland and in the UK - highlighted
also by the agreed cash bid of Pounds 1.8bn by Lloyds Bank for Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester Building Society.
For example, Irish Permanent appears to have benefited from some flexibility
in enabling its customers to benefit from free shares.
After savers and borrowers qualified to vote had approved a single
resolution to convert from mutual status in March, savers were able to vote
to make borrowers no longer members of the society: as members no longer,
they became eligible for free shares.
No disgruntled borrower has yet suggested that changing C&amp;G's rules to make
borrowers no longer members, might enable them to qualify for the cash
handout from which the law currently bars them.
But even if the idea were mooted, it is by no means certain that the
Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, would
approve.
The reasons for Irish Permanent's decision to convert are also different
from what they might be for a UK society. Alongside the 80m-plus free shares
to about 227,000 members, the flotation aims to raise up to IPounds 50m
(Pounds 49.25m) in new capital through the issue of more than 30m shares.
Mr Roy Douglas, chief executive, has made it clear that it was not
regulatory constraints that inclined the society to become a public company
 -in Ireland unlike the UK the central bank regulates both banks and
building societies - but the desire to be able to raise equity capital, in
order to compete more effectively with banks.
He has emphasised that Irish Permanent will not actively be seeking
acquisitions after conversion, however. Instead it will be looking for a
period of consolidation.
Alongside the plans for flotation, it has recently bought Prudential Life of
Ireland from Prudential Corporation - the UK's largest life insurer - for
just over IPounds 30m cash, and acquired Guinness &amp; Mahon, where the main
activity is private banking, for IPounds 6.7m.
Irish Permanent has a strong position in the Irish mortgage market, but the
picture is not entirely cloudless.
For example, its cost/income ratio, though declining, is still the highest
in the industry in Ireland at just over 60 per cent.
And though it benefits from the fact that it is quite hard to win access to
the Irish mortgage market, there are signs that growth in this area is
expected to be steady, rather than spectacular in the next few years.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: CrestaCare healthy at Pounds 2.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CrestaCare, the UK's third largest nursing home operator, turned round
losses of Pounds 1.39m to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.46m for the six
months to June 30.
The group has been re-focused on the core healthcare business by a new
management team over the past 18 months. It reported a modest rise in total
turnover from Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 15.7m; turnover from property and other
activities fell from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 227,000.
Turnover in the long term healthcare operations rose 50 per cent from Pounds
10.4m to Pounds 15.5m and operating profits from these activities increased
from Pounds 2.51m to Pounds 3.43m.
At the operating level a Pounds 157,000 loss was turned into a Pounds 3.43m
profit in the latest period, partly reflecting the absence of property
losses and exceptional costs. Finance costs fell to Pounds 961,000 from
Pounds 1.23m.
CrestaCare's Pounds 12.5m acquisition of the Scottish nursing home group
ScotCare in July helped to increase the number of beds in operation by 32
per cent to more than 2,800. A further 90 bed facility is under development
in Scotland, to be completed by the end of this year.
Mr Andrew Taee, chief executive, said the Scottish acquisition was the
beginning of a slow growth outside the company's traditional bases in the
North of England, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man.
'Our future growth will be focused upon strengthening our business within
our existing regions, now including Scotland, and the gradual expansion into
new geographic regions, particularly the South of England,' he said.
He added that the company's future strategy would concentrate on specialist
care, such as brain injury and stroke injury, which command higher weekly
fees.
Weekly fee rates rose to an average of Pounds 297, compared to Pounds 295
last year. Average bed occupancy for the first half of the year was 93.3 per
cent.
There were earnings per share of 1.1p, after losses of 2p last year. The
interim dividend was lifted from 0.25p to 0.26p.
Gearing stood at 22 per cent, including Pounds 21.2m of fixed rate debt
paying 9.46 per cent.

Eyecare Products, the consumer goods maker formerly known as Kitty Little,
reported reduced pre-tax profits of Pounds 6,000 in the first half of 1994,
against Pounds 54,000.
The figures do not include any contribution from L'Amy, the French
sunglasses and spectacles concern, acquired for FFr75.2m (Pounds 8.9m) last
month. L'Amy made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 65,000) in the
period, although these figures have not been adjusted for UK accounting
standards.
The company intends to focus resources on its core eyewear business and have
therefore decided to divest its fragrance and beauty bags operations, which
made a net loss of Pounds 154,000 (Pounds 77,000 profit) in the period.
Group turnover grew from Pounds 2.48m to Pounds 2.79m. Earnings per share
were 0.03p (0.53p) and an unchanged interim dividend of 0.5p has been
declared.

Bloomsbury Publishing, the book publishing company floated in June, cut its
seasonal pre-tax losses from Pounds 563,000 to Pounds 478,000 for the first
half of 1994.
The company typically trades at a loss in the first half because of its
orientation towards the Christmas book market. Turnover for the period grew
30 per cent to Pounds 3.13m and losses per share were 1p lower at 6.02p.

In its first interim statement as a public company, Parkdean Leisure, which
operates holiday parks in Scotland and East Anglia, announced a reduced
pre-tax loss and is paying a 1.9p interim dividend.
The loss for the six months to June 1 - normally a lossmaking period as it
reflects winter trading - was Pounds 537,000 (Pounds 812,000), helped by a
reduction in interest payments to Pounds 86,000 (Pounds 373,000) as a result
of the placing in October 1993.
Turnover was ahead at Pounds 2.73m (Pounds 2.52m). Losses per share were
3.6p (18.7p).

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Blagden 74% down at Pounds 780,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blagden Industries, the steel drum maker, yesterday announced a
restructuring programme as well as pre-tax profits down 74 per cent at the
interim stage.
In the 25 weeks to June 26, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 3.04m to Pounds
780,000. Last year's figure included Pounds 617,000 from a property sale.
Group restructuring and re-organisation costs rose from Pounds 330,000 to
Pounds 1.5m
Mr Richard Searle, chief executive, said the changes underway as well as the
latest results showed the company 'had halted the slide'.
Mr David Kendall, chairman, said 'a modest improvement' was evident this
year compared with the second six months of 1993 when the group incurred a
loss of Pounds 106,000 after interest. But underlying demand for steel drums
remained weak, while profit margins had been eroded due to pressure on
selling prices and rises in raw material costs.
Demand for speciality chemicals remained at a 'reasonable level'. However,
it had not been possible to recoup raw material cost rises in the UK
manufactured resins division.
Turnover dipped from Pounds 116.9m to Pounds 113.6m, which included a Pounds
5.8m (Pounds 8.5m) contribution from discontinued operations. The chemicals
division contributed Pounds 26.2m (Pounds 25.2m) while the UK packaging
operations contributed Pounds 16m (Pounds 17m).
As part of its 'strategic review,' Blagden sold its main plastics packaging
operations for Pounds 6.9m in July. A loss of about Pounds 3.8m, provided
for in the 1993 accounts, will fall in the second half.
Changes to management include the appointment of Mr David Roache, previously
finance director of Massey Ferguson, as finance director to replace Mr Lance
Levine. As announced earlier, Mr Dick Searle has taken over from Mr Kendall
as chief executive.
The chemicals business was split into two divisions, manufacturing and
trading, to 'provide more focus,' Mr Kendall said.
Following the rights issue in June which raised Pounds 26m and the sale of
the plastics packaging businesses, gearing stands at 20 per cent compared
with 82 per cent last time.
Earnings per share were nil against 2.7p last time.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Domestic &amp; General 24% ahead
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Domestic &amp; General, the domestic appliance insurer, yesterday announced a 24
per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.68m to Pounds 9.56m for the
year to the end of June.
However, the results came towards the lower end of analysts' expectations,
and this, together with a warning of increased expenditure on its German
operations and new product development sent the shares retreating 92p - or 5
per cent - to Pounds 16.93.
Turnover increased to Pounds 66m (Pounds 56.3m), while earnings per share
advanced to 93.47p (75.63p). The dividend is raised to 27.75p (22.5p) with a
proposed final of 18.5p.
Mr Martin Copley, chairman, said that although the rate of growth had slowed
over the year, particularly in the second half, trading was still
satisfactory.
He added that the company was focusing its attentions on the uninsured
market - less than 30 per cent of domestic appliances in the UK are
currently insured - and the largely unexploited European market. However,
those objectives would necessitate additional expenditure 'which will
continue to impact in the coming year.'
Another cloud on the horizon was the on-going DTI inquiry into extended
warranties, the outcome of which was being awaited by the company before it
introduced some new products to the market.
Total contribution (underwriting profits before expenses) amounted to Pounds
16.66m (Pounds 13.29m) and investment income increased slightly to Pounds
6.38m (Pounds 6.14m).
The company also announced that it was applying for a full listing on the
London Stock Exchange, but added that it had decided against having a share
split.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Emess ahead as 'markets emerge from
recession'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Emess, the UK's largest lighting company, rose 45 per
cent from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 1.6m in the first half of 1994, as the
consumer and commercial lighting markets 'emerged from recession'.
Turnover grew organically by 8 per cent to Pounds 64.5m (Pounds 59.5m) and
Mr Michael Meyer, chairman, ascribed the margin improvement to 'stringent
cost control'. Also, productivity rose with sales per employee up 15 per
cent. Trading profits rose by 24 per cent to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 2.1m).
The shares eased 2 1/2p to 34p yesterday.
Trading profits from consumer lighting were up at Pounds 600,000 (Pounds
200,000) on turnover at Pounds 38.6m (Pounds 34.8m). Profit and turnover
advances were less dramatic on the commercial side at Pounds 2m (Pounds
1.9m) and Pounds 25.9m (Pounds 24.7m) respectively.
The overseas companies lifted their proportion of turnover by 1 percentage
point to 57 per cent.
Profits from the UK were unchanged at Pounds 3.4m, but this time there were
no losses from Germany, against Pounds 600,000 last time. Losses from the US
deepened to Pounds 400,000 (Pounds 300,000).
Fully diluted earnings increased to 0.8p (0.5p) per share and again, 'in
line with recent practice', there is no interim dividend.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Delta shares fall despite 5% advance to
Pounds 30.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Delta fell by 31p to 468p after the cables and engineering group
said increased activity in the UK construction market had not yet been fully
reflected in demand for its plumbing products and electrical circuits.
Delta's pre-tax profits rose 5 per cent from Pounds 29.1m to Pounds 30.6m in
the six months to July 2; turnover grew by 3 per cent to Pounds 440m.
Sir Martin Jacomb, chairman, said: 'Despite continuing encouraging signals,
overall patterns of trading have remained inconsistent.'
Mr Robert Easton, chief executive, said the 'light end' of the building
materials market in the UK was still flat, but the European construction
market had rebounded sharply.
Delta's cable businesses continue to suffer from intense price competition.
Mr Easton said the group had pushed through price increases of about 20 per
cent in general cables and wiring, but this had been fully absorbed by
higher prices for raw materials such as copper and pvc.
The engineering division increased operating profits by 27 per cent, mainly
because of a recovery in demand for plumbing products in Continental Europe.
Industrial services also increased profits, reflecting growth in the
Australian businesses. Circuit protection, however, was affected by a sharp
downturn in demand for its products in the Middle East and by restructuring
costs.
Gearing fell from 28 to 23 per cent. Mr Eaton said the group would continue
to develop through organic growth and appropriate acquisitions. The success
of a Malaysian protective coatings plant had reinforced the group's
commitment to further expansion in south-east Asia.
Earnings per share increased by 4.8 per cent to 13.1p (12.5p), but the
interim dividend was lifted by only by 2.4 per cent from 4.2p to 4.3p.
COMMENT
A 6 per cent drop in the share price seemed a little harsh for results which
were in line with forecasts, even if the dividend was stingier than
expected. Delta's trouble is that, having cut costs so much, it is seen as a
prime beneficiary of a recovery in volume - and the cautious trading
statement was enough to unsettle a twitchy market. The operational gearing
argument still stacks up, however - a 2 per cent increase in engineering
sales translated into a 27 per cent rise in operating profit. Even the
troubled cables market could be lucrative when it turns - as BICC's results
in the US recently demonstrated. Yesterday's share price fall was on low
turnover of a tightly-held stock. Unchanged full-year forecasts put the
shares on a prospective multiple of about 18. That 15 per cent premium to
the market looks justified, on medium-term view.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Remixed Caradon pleases City - Underlying
growth of almost a fifth after purchase of Pillar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The share price of Caradon, one of Europe's biggest building materials
groups rose by almost 4 per cent yesterday after the company announced an
increase in underlying profits of almost a fifth in the first half of 1994.
Operating profits of Caradon's new mix of businesses, following last year's
Pounds 809m purchase of the Pillar building products business from RTZ, rose
from Pounds 79.8m to Pounds 94.2m. The comparable figures have been restated
to include Pillar's results.
Mr Peter Jansen, Caradon's chief executive said that operating margins at
Pillar, which had significantly increased the group's exposure to the
sharply recovering US construction market, had risen from 5 per cent to 8
per cent since it was acquired.
The improvement was due mainly to increased sales volume and cost
reductions. Prices also had risen but mostly in line with raw material
costs, said Mr Jansen. Turnover rose from a restated Pounds 926.9m to Pounds
981.7m, including Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 3.9m) from discontinued activities.
Caradon manufactures a wide range of building materials including windows,
doors, central heating boilers and electronic control systems for buildings
in the UK, US and continental European markets.
It also has interests in automotive and aircraft components as well as a
cheque printing business in the US.
The shares rose 11p to 298p in spite of a 41 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 90.8m, against Pounds 152.8m which included an exceptional
Pounds 100.3m profit from the sale of its CarnaudMetalbox interests.
Earnings per share fell from 26.4p to 8.9p reflecting last year's Pounds
334m rights to help fund the Pillar acquisition. Excluding exceptional items
earnings rose from 6.8p to 8.9p. The interim dividend is increased from
2.83p to 2.9p.
Profits rose fastest in the US increasing by 30 per cent from Pounds 27.3m
to Pounds 35.7m in spite of a 20 per cent cent fall in operating profits to
Pounds 20.4m from cheque printing.
Mr Jansen said that US building materials sales had been strong in the first
half in spite of bad weather disrupting construction activity.
UK profits rose by 22 per cent from Pounds 38.6m to Pounds 47.3m. Building
materials sales, however, were mixed due to the failure of repair,
maintenance and DIY work to recover in line with the increase in new house
building.
Profits in continental Europe, where recovery in construction demand has
occurred later than in the US and UK, fell from Pounds 13.9m to Pounds
11.2m.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Baynes back on acquisition trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles Baynes, the fast-growing specialist engineering group, yesterday
returned to the acquisition trail, paying a total of Pounds 14.4m for five
companies.
It also reported interim pre-tax profits 71 per cent ahead at Pounds 5.6m
(Pounds 3.27m), boosted largely by other recent acquisitions. Turnover
increased by a similar amount at Pounds 67.04m (Pounds 39.34m), while
earnings per share grew 19 per cent to 1.97p (1.65p). The interim dividend
was raised 22 per cent to 0.7p (0.575p).
Mr John Perkins, finance director, said that first half trading for existing
businesses had been slightly ahead of the same time last year. The valve
division had shown the most improvement, with operating profits increasing
64 per cent to Pounds 1.95m on turnover 25 per cent ahead at Pounds 14.2m
(Pounds 11.34m). He said that overseas demand from the petrochemical
industry was a significant factor in the improvement.
However, the aerospace business continued to struggle. Operating profits
slipped from Pounds 516,000 to Pounds 73,000 on turnover 9 per cent down at
Pounds 8.35m (Pounds 9.2m).
Buck &amp; Hickman, a tool distributor which Baynes acquired last year,
contributed to its first full half year with Pounds 24.97m in sales and
Pounds 1.85m in operating profits. The subsidiary was also behind the boost
to cash reserves which jumped from Pounds 1.47m to Pounds 14.47m
year-on-year.
Mr Perkins said the cash was being used to fund yesterday's acquisitions, a
move which would leave the company cash neutral. Pillar Engineering Supplies
was the most costly of these at Pounds 5.95m. It will link up with its
former competitor B&amp;H, greatly enhancing Baynes' distribution network.
The company is also paying Pounds 4.25m for French valve group Industrie
Mecanique Pour Les Fluids, Pounds 2m for Maxseal, a Bristol-based solenoid
valve manufacturer, Pounds 1.1m for Orseal Valves, a manufacturer of ball
valves for ships, and Pounds 1.1m for Andrews Fasteners, a distributor of
corrosion-resistant fasteners.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: United Friendly ahead sharply to Pounds
13.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A turnround in the general insurance business underpinned a sharp rise at
United Friendly, where pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 6.1m to
Pounds 13.6m for the first six months of the year.
Premium income increased to Pounds 170m (Pounds 166m), while earnings per
share advanced to 11.8p (7p). The interim dividend is raised to 6.1p (5.5p).
Mr George Mack, assistant managing director and finance director, said the
general insurance business, which at the last interims showed a loss of
Pounds 7m, had benefited from changes to the underwriting and a general
improvement in the trading environment.
However, life assurance profits fell from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 2.7m,
largely as a result of losses incurred by Acuma, which United purchased from
American Express last year. Mr Mack said the court action being pursued
against the US group over the purchase price of Acuma was now likely to be
settled out of court.
Life fund investments fell to Pounds 2.41bn (Pounds 2.6bn), reflecting weak
bond and equity markets.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Cost of restructuring Queens Moat debt
jumps to Pounds 42m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Queens Moat Houses, the struggling hotels group, yesterday added fuel to the
controversy over hefty charges paid to banks and advisers by announcing that
the costs of restructuring its Pounds 1.3bn borrowings would be Pounds 42m.
Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive, said delays in concluding the refinancing
talks had forced the group to increase its provisions for charges, including
facility fees to banks, by Pounds 10m to Pounds 42m.
The delays have further hit the group by leaving it with a Pounds 19.3m
charge (Pounds 10.6m gain) for currency movements. Because of restricted
banking arrangements in place while the discussions are under way Queens
Moat is unable to hedge against its foreign debt.
These factors helped to increase the pre-tax loss for the first half to July
3 by 56 per cent to Pounds 59m (Pounds 37.8m).
Excluding exceptionals, the pre-tax loss fell from Pounds 48.4m to Pounds
31.6m.
The company is believed to be frustrated by the scale of fees paid to banks
and advisers, both its own and those of the lenders. Mr Coppel said he had
little choice, however. 'My first priority must be to restore value to
shareholders and get this company restructured.'
Queens Moat has been in restructuring talks for the last 18 months. While
most of the company's 74 lenders have agreed restructuring proposals - which
include a substantial debt-for-equity swap - a minority are objecting to the
terms. Those resisting the proposals are believed to include lenders who
came into Queens Moat through the secondary debt market.
Mr Coppel said he was confident the group 'would get there in the end'. The
provisions were made on the assumption that the lenders would all agree a
refinancing by the end of the year.
The long delays in completing a restructuring, which was originally expected
by June, are not believed to be causing the lenders any great concern. One
adviser has said that the improved trading position made an early resolution
of the disagreements between lenders less urgent.
Yesterday Queens Moat reported a 97 per cent increase in operating profits
to Pounds 17.9m on sales 12 per cent ahead to Pounds 207m.
The improvement in profits was partly because of a strong recovery in the UK
hotels division, with operating profits up 54 per cent to Pounds 14.6m.
Occupancy rates increased from 51 to 57 per cent, although room rates fell
by more than 3 per cent. This was in line with QMH's strategy initially to
chase volume and, when possible, push up rates.
Continental Europe remained difficult, in spite of a turnround in Germany.
Queens Moat raised Pounds 22m from disposals in the first half. About 14
more hotels are targeted for disposal.
Net debt was Pounds 1.3bn (Pounds 1.2bn). Losses per share deepened to 7.2p
(5p). There is no dividend.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Fall in gambling profits leaves Crockfords
at Pounds 8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crockfords, the casino company that was reversed into TV-am last year,
reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 15m to Pounds 8.12m for the 28
weeks to July 17.
However, the previous half included Pounds 1.93m in movements in provisions
for discontinued activities - a hangover from TV-am.
Operating profits from its gambling business fell by 40 per cent from Pounds
13.2m to Pounds 7.9m.
The shares closed down 5p at 146p after recovering from a low of 132p.
Crockfords opened London's first legal casino in Curzon Street in 1961.
The turnover, or the casino's win from gamblers playing there, fell from
Pounds 27.2m to Pounds 24.9m. Mr Garry Nesbitt, chairman, said that just as
many players were coming through the doors as last year, but the casino had
won a smaller proportion of the money staked.
Operating costs rose from Pounds 5.82m to Pounds 9.63m.
Fully diluted earnings per share fell from 11.71p to 5.89p. An interim
dividend of 2p is being paid. Mr Nesbitt said the company expected to pay a
final of 6p.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Taylor Woodrow doubled to Pounds 22m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Taylor Woodrow more than doubled from Pounds 10.1m to
Pounds 22m during the first six months of this year, led by a sharp rise in
house sales.
Earnings per share increased from 1.3p to 3.5p, and the construction and
property group is raising its interim dividend by 50 per cent from 0.5p to
0.75p.
Its share price, however, fell 2p to 135p as construction and building
material stocks continued to be depressed by Monday's UK interest rate rise.
Mr Colin Parsons, chairman, said the increase would make it more difficult
for housebuilders, but could help the economy as a whole if it encouraged
low inflation.
The rise in profits had been achieved in spite of a 17 per cent decline in
turnover to Pounds 514m (Pounds 623m). The reduction reflected the group's
refusal to take on construction contracts at unacceptable margins.
Even so, UK contracting only just managed to break even in the first half,
although construction world-wide moved from a Pounds 3.4m loss to a Pounds
1.8m profit, thanks to the Pounds 3.2m settlement of a claim for work on the
Storebaelt link in Denmark.
The profits improvement was led by housebuilding, which more than doubled
from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 9m, with Taywood Homes in the UK increasing its
first half contribution by 50 per cent to Pounds 3m (Pounds 2m).
UK housing profits overall remained unchanged at Pounds 3m because of the
absence of apartment sales by the commercial property division, which
contributed Pounds 1m in the first six months of 1993.
Housing profits from the US, Canada and Australia also rose from Pounds 4m
to Pounds 6m, after allowing for a Pounds 3.2m write-down last year in
southern California.
Property profits rose from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 7.4m due to lower interest
charges and in spite of a reduction in net rental resulting from previous
disposals.
Net borrowings fell by Pounds 25.3m to Pounds 90.8m reducing gearing to
Pounds 16.9m. Interest payments as a result halved in the first half to
Pounds 5.1m (Pounds 10.5).
COMMENT
Colin Parsons has done a good job in steadying the ship after Taylor Woodrow
lost its way in the early 1990s. The balance sheet is in fine fettle while
the group's conservative approach to contracting and housebuilding should
stand it in good stead with interest rates starting climb again.
Contracting, however, remains an unattractive business, particularly in the
UK, where margins are likely to remain depressed in the short term.
Housebuilding profits should recover further, but group profits of Pounds
48m this year and Pounds 60m next would put the shares on multiples of 18
and 14 respectively, which is dear enough given that the shares already have
outperformed the market by about a 10th in the past 12 months.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Everest Foods suffers pressure on margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Everest Foods, the West Midlands-based potato chip producer, blamed low-cost
economy products for a 47 per cent decline in pre-tax profits in the year to
May 31.
The group, which also owns Ashfords, the lossmaking food distributor, saw
pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 2.09m to Pounds 1.1m, despite a 14 per cent
rise in turnover from Pounds 31.9m to Pounds 36.3m.
Mr Bob Gilbert, chairman, said that supermarket demand for economy goods put
severe pressure on margins. The group has revised its contracts to lend more
flexibility to potato pur-chases.
However, the group argues that its contracts place it in a strong position
to survive the current potato crop fears, which have pushed prices high.
Everest cut its final dividend to 1.3p (2.5p), leaving a total of 2.5p
(3.7p). Earnings per share declined from 5.46p to 3.23p.
Ashfords, which made losses of about Pounds 250,000 this year, suffered as
Sunday trading by supermarkets reduced demand from the smaller convenience
stores which the distributor supplies.
In July, Everest sold the majority of its stake in Arnold Davies, the egg
production company, to concentrate on its core business of potato products.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clyde Petroleum, the UK exploration and production company, has celebrated a
return to the black with its first dividend payment in three years.
The independent oil group announced interim net profits of Pounds 2.2m,
against losses of Pounds 16.2m, and a first half payout of 0.35p.
The performance was achieved in spite of a 19 per cent drop in the average
oil price.
Turnover rose by 25 per cent to Pounds 49.1m.
Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chairman, said the group had tried to pitch the dividend
at a sustainable level. Clyde expects to pay a further 0.65p at the end of
the year, for a 1p total.
The company increased production by 46 per cent to 30,843 barrels of oil
equivalent per day. About 80 per cent of Clyde's reserves are producing.
Gearing was expected to be about 100 per cent at the year-end.
First half earnings were 0.6p, against a loss of 4.6p.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Kenya shilling boosts James Finlay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strength of the Kenya shilling lay behind a 30 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits at James Finlay, the overseas trading and financial services group,
in the first half of 1994.
Profits rose to Pounds 4.94m (Pounds 3.8m) after an exchange gain this time
of Pounds 646,000, against losses last of Pounds 1.32m. Turnover advanced to
Pounds 82m (Pounds 76.3m).
Mr Richard Capper, deputy chairman, expected the Kenyan tea crop to be about
20m kg, some 2m kg down on the previous first half. This led to operating
profits from plantations (excluding Bangladesh, where the tea is not picked
until late in the first half) falling to Pounds 2.46m (Pounds 2.57m).
Lower tea trading was offset by reduced losses at Finlay Industries in the
US, which makes tractors and lawn mowers and the trading, manufacturing and
merchanting division saw lower profits of Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 1.55m).
A bright spot was the confectionery and beverage manufacturing side, where
profits advanced to Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 1.12m) on the back of greater
volumes at Paynes and a lower interest bill.
Losses on the oil and gas side fell to Pounds 157,000 (Pounds 418,000) and
the group took a provision of Pounds 2.9m against the discontinuance of
these operations by the end of the year. Mr Capper said it was 'such a small
part of the Finlay empire' and had not been a very good investment.
The provision was offset by a profit of Pounds 3.2m from the disposal of the
18 per cent stake in Rockall Scotia Resources.
Mr Capper said that the 31 per cent tax charge was likely to rise between 40
and 45 per cent for the year, against 71 per cent last time.
Earnings increased to 3.3p (1p) per share and the interim dividend is held
at 2p.

FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Boyd leaves Goal Petrol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Goal Petroleum, the oil and gas explorer, is likely to look beyond the North
Sea for growth now that Mr David Boyd is retiring after 20 years as managing
director.
Mr Boyd's retirement was announced yesterday, along with interim results
showing a 36 per cent fall in net profits from Pounds 2.77m to Pounds 1.76m
for the six months to June 30.
The profits were hit by the sharp fall in oil prices over the last 12
months. Turnover was down from Pounds 20.9m to Pounds 20.1m although
production rose by 23 per cent to 12,300 barrels of oil equivalent a day.
Mr Boyd, 59, is closely identified with Goal, where he has worked since
shortly after its flotation in 1973. He will be replaced by Mr Duncan
Ritchie, the commercial director.
Earnings per share fell by 37 per cent from 2.07p to 1.31p.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Fisons serves up another bitter pill with 27% slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fisons, the drugs and scientific equipment company, disappointed the market
yet again yesterday with interim profits down 27 per cent from Pounds 41.5m
to Pounds 30.4m. The dividend was cut almost in half from 3.3p to 1.7p, and
the shares fell 15p to 135p.
Mr Patrick Egan, chairman, could provide little cheer for the immediate
future, warning that 'the trading environment is expected to remain
challenging on all fronts and it is unlikely that, for the group as a whole,
any marked improvement in profitability levels can occur during the
remainder of this year.'
Mr Robin Gilbert, analyst at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said: 'It is
disappointing to see yet another set of figures that falls short of
expectations'.
Since 1991, Fisons has seen the departure of two chief executives and had to
issue three profits warnings.
Fisons' troubled scientific instruments division saw trading losses increase
more than five-fold from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 11.8m on sales barely changed
at Pounds 114m (Pounds 115.5m). Mr Egan said the previous year's loss should
have been higher but costs 'had been pushed into the second half.'
The company's pharmaceuticals division saw sales rise from Pounds 209.8m to
Pounds 240.7m. Trading profits rose from Pounds 28.8m to Pounds 36.3m, an
increase exaggerated by the decision taken last December to discontinue
'trade loading' - the oversupply of distributors at relatively low profit
margins.
On a like-for-like basis, pharmaceuticals sales growth was about 4 per cent.
Sales of Fisons' long-established asthma drug Intal rose from Pounds 83m to
Pounds 104m. Intal faces a more difficult second half in the US where
competition from generic (unbranded) rivals began in earnest in May. The new
asthma drug Tilade saw sales jump 41 per cent to Pounds 21m, although Fisons
said this had not matched its expectations in the important US market.
Trading profits at the laboratory supplies division fell from Pounds 15.3m
to Pounds 10.1m on sales up from Pounds 238.6m to Pounds 251.9m. Mr Egan
called the result 'a great shame' because the division had performed
relatively well during the previous two years.
Group turnover fell from Pounds 651.4m to Pounds 640.3m. There was a net
cash outflow of Pounds 71.1m, compared with an inflow of Pounds 144.5m,
leading to a rise in gearing to 57 per cent from 40 per cent at the end of
1993. Earnings per share fell from 4.1p to 3p.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Kingfisher disappoints with 7.4% interim rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kingfisher, the UK retailing group which includes B&amp;Q, Comet, Superdrug,
Woolworths, and France's Darty, yesterday disappointed the market in spite
of announcing a 7.4 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds
82m to Pounds 88.1m.
The increase - at the bottom end of forecasts - was more than accounted for
by a rise from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 35.7m in profits contribution from
Darty, acquired by Kingfisher only two months before the end of the first
half last year. Excluding Darty from both years, retail operating profits
fell from Pounds 57.5m to Pounds 47.7m.
Kingfisher held the interim dividend at 4.4p, and the share price fell 3p to
487p.
'These results are less than satisfactory for Kingfisher', admitted Sir
Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman. 'However, each company is making significant
progress in establishing a platform of real value for its customers.'
He remained 'cautious' about UK retail markets, and said there were signs of
recovery in France.
Mr Alan Smith, chief executive, said Kingfisher's priorities were to improve
ranges, value for money, and customer service. Cost-cutting would continue,
and some job losses would result.
He added it would take time to implement 'everyday low pricing' (EDLP) -
that is, permanently lower prices - throughout the group. It could be
introduced by each chain only 'when the total cost base of the business
allows'. He said Darty already operated EDLP, and Comet and B&amp;Q were making
progress in that direction. Woolworths and Superdrug needed to improve their
supply chains before moving fully to an EDLP strategy.
Group turnover increased 18.4 per cent to Pounds 2.17bn, including Pounds
441.6m from Darty. UK retail turnover rose 2.6 per cent to Pounds 1.70bn.
The underlying profits fall resulted partly from an unexpectedly large loss
of Pounds 6.9m at Woolworths (Pounds 2.1m profit). Comet dropped from a
Pounds 0.7m profit to a Pounds 1.7m loss because of increased expansion and
rental costs.
The group interest charge increased from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 11.1m,
including a Pounds 4m loss on Kingfisher's bond portfolio. There were
brighter spots elsewhere. B&amp;Q, Superdrug and the Chartwell Land property
division all increased their contribution.
Earnings per share fell from 10.2p to 10p.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Equities struggle to escape from bondage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After decoupling, might recoupling prove rather a painful process? This is
traditionally a tricky time of year for financial markets, a period of
foreign exchange crisis and securities market instability. Perhaps it is the
shock of returning to work after the summer, when finance ministers, for
instance, decide they should resume unfinished business and raise interest
rates.
In the securities markets the instability may be the consequence of
portfolio rebalancing and temporarily reduced cashflows. Stock markets tend
to reserve their seasonal strength for the period between November and
February, in anticipation of large cash receipts.
At any rate, words such as 'correction' and even 'crash' are beginning to
crop up in brokers' literature, which is normally so bullish. The reason is
that the August rally in equities was not paralleled in bonds and therefore
has pushed valuation ratios to awkward levels. For example, the Dow Jones
Average is still within 3 per cent of its all-time peak at the end of
January, while the US Treasury long bond yield has risen 150 basis points.
By and large, the key bond-equity ratios in the main national markets are
still some way short of the extremes reached before the crash of October
1987, but they are well above normal levels.
We are in that awkward period of the securities market cycle when bond
prices have topped out but equities are still trying to chase corporate
profits higher. In jargon, equities are trying to decouple from bonds. This
is a dangerous game.
The low level of dividend yields is the problem. In the US the stock market
has never been worth buying on its present yield of well below 3 per cent,
and the ratio of bond to equity yields at some 2.8 has risen to the highest
since 1987. The same is true in the UK, where the ratio is 2.3. Such ratios
can only be justified by exceptionally buoyant dividend growth. But with
short-term interest rates going up almost everywhere, rosier expectations
about corporate prosperity may need to be trimmed.
Of course, it can be argued that the interest rate hikes reflect strong
economic growth rather than threaten it. But there is a lack of sensitivity.
Wall Street in particular has come to seem almost immune to changes in the
financial environment over the past couple of years.
US blue chips have continued their run of amazingly low volatility, so that
the Standard and Poor's 500 index has fluctuated only 5 per cent either side
of the 460 level so far in 1994, continuing the pattern of 1993. When this
period of unusual stability comes to an end, might it do so spectacularly?
One explanation for the lack of movement in prices is that the US market is
regarded as a core investment by American institutions while the volatility
and speculation has been exported into derivatives contracts and overseas
markets. To take two markets in which US investors are active, Hong Kong has
swung between 12,200 and 8,300 this year, Mexico between 2,900 and 1,950.
Moreover the US bond market has been more volatile than blue-chip equities
this year (and European bonds more erratic still).
A pre-crash scenario can develop when the asset allocation mechanisms break
down. This can happen because of institutional rigidities, such as the bias
of UK pension funds towards equities. This is another way of looking at the
'decoupling' which the equity market salesmen are so enthusiastic about.
Some investors are also subject to irrational behaviour. US mutual fund
investors have stopped putting money into bond funds, even though the
returns have gone up. They are still buying equity funds, albeit at reduced
levels, although the value has not similarly improved.
Of course, a surge of economic growth could yet legitimise the stretching of
the bond-equity relationships. This is believable if you swallow the
rhetoric of the US and UK governments and accept that the recent short-term
interest rate rises have represented pre-emptive strikes against future
inflation.
A less encouraging interpretation is that persistent and excessive
government deficits around the world are crowding out the private sector's
recovery. The attempt by equities to break free could end in sullen
recapture.

FT  14 SEP 94 / The ships come in at last for P&amp;O: Ferries and cruise lines
repay heavy investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A buoyant performance by Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company's
cruise and cross-channel ferry operations helped yesterday to propel its
share price 21p higher to 674p.
P&amp;O's pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 291.6m to Pounds 126.4m for the six
months to June 30, but the 1993 figure included Pounds 200m profits from
disposals, primarily of contract caterer Sutcliffe Services. The 1994 figure
included a Pounds 4.4m exceptional profit.
Profit before exceptional items, however, rose 52 per cent from Pounds 80.1m
to Pounds 122m, pushed by P&amp;O's shipping businesses, which are finally
justifying the substantial investment made over the past five years.
Turnover rose 1.6 per cent from to Pounds 2.69bn to Pounds 2.73bn, but P&amp;O
benefited from the operational gearing of its shipping businesses, which
have a high level of fixed costs.
The ferries division, for which about 70 per cent of profits come from the
Dover-Calais route, more than doubled profits from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds
26.6m in spite of continuing competition on fares.
P&amp;O now has about 60 per cent share of the cross-channel passenger market,
and it carried 37 per cent more passengers during the period. Freight units
increased slightly more, helped by the oft-postponed start-up of the Channel
Tunnel.
Consensus forecasts for the full year increased by about Pounds 20m to
Pounds 320m (before exceptional items), but analysts warned that the tunnel
threat was merely deferred, and could knock Pounds 50m off operating profits
next year. However, Lord Sterling, chairman, said heavy promotion by
Eurotunnel would help to expand the overall market.
P&amp;O's cruise liners also thrived on the economic recovery in its primary
markets of the US and UK, with profits up 25 per cent from Pounds 34m to
Pounds 42.4m.
Lord Sterling said cruise bookings for 1995 were 'nicely up on this year',
and the company should benefit from the launching of two new ships next
year.
The containers division increased profits from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 25.7m,
as volumes increased and rates gradually recovered.
P&amp;O Australia, which has been the focus for the group's rapid expansion into
the Asia Pacific region, also performed strongly, contributing Pounds 16.5m
(Pounds 10.8m).
Lord Sterling said: 'At the start of the year, prospects were looking strong
in most of our businesses. This is still generally true, although the
recovery in the UK is still rather patchy, and land transport, housebuilding
and construction remain flat.'
Bovis Homes improved from a loss of Pounds 0.3m to a profit of Pounds 0.1m,
while property development reduced losses from Pounds 7.9 to Pounds 0.7m
Interest costs fell from Pounds 63.5m to Pounds 59.2m, despite a rise in net
borrowings to Pounds 1.61bn, as P&amp;O has invested Pounds 297.6m in fixed
assets, primarily ships, and a further Pounds 27.6m on acquisitions during
the period.
Lord Sterling said P&amp;O was comfortable with gearing of 61 per cent, but he
indicated that further property disposals were likely in 1995.
The interim dividend is maintained at 13.5p, but it is covered by recurrent
earnings for the first time since 1990. Earnings per share were 13.8p
(39.3p).

FT  14 SEP 94 / British Steel raises Avesta stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel yesterday announced its biggest investment since before the
recession by paying Pounds 85m to raise its stake in Avesta Sheffield, the
big Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer, from 40 to 49.9 per cent.
The purchase follows the sale by NCC, the big Swedish construction company,
of its 22.5 per cent stake in Avesta Sheffield, announced in Stockholm
earlier in the day. Barclays de Zoete Wedd paid about SKr2.2bn (Pounds 188m)
for NCC's 35.66m shares. It sold 15.64m on to British Steel and organised a
worldwide placing of the remainder.
The cash deal, financed by British Steel's resources, underlines its bolder
approach to investment since the end of the recession, during which it
restricted itself to small projects or those with short payback times.
A decision is also pending on a Dollars 150m (Pounds 97m) investment by the
UK company in Tuscaloosa Steel, its Alabama subsidiary, to create a steel
plate mini-mill. Observers believe the scheme will almost certainly go
ahead.
Avesta Sheffield was formed in November 1992 through the merger of Sweden's
Avesta with British Steel's stainless steel activities. Until the
termination of a shareholders' agreement last month, British Steel would
have been obliged to make a general offer for the remaining Avesta Sheffield
shares if its stake had risen above 45 per cent.
British Steel said it welcomed the opportunity to increase its shareholding.
Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive, said the merger had gone
'extremely well.'
But the UK company stressed it had no intention of making an offer for the
rest of Avesta Sheffield, which last month reported first half profits of
SKr431m after financial items, compared with a SKr21m loss a year earlier.
The sale of NCC's stake significantly tips the balance of ownership in
Avesta Sheffield away from Sweden. BZW, assisted by Cazenove and Svenska
Handelsbanken, placed the shares not bought by British Steel with
institutions mainly in the UK, Scandinavia and Europe.
Foreign interests now hold over half the company, with the biggest single
Swedish shareholder, the gas group Aga, holds just 7.2 per cent.
Mr Per Molin, the Swedish chief executive of Avesta Sheffield, said he did
not anticipate any change in the company's present set-up as it is
registered and headquartered in Sweden.
British Steel and the other investors paid SKr64 for each share, a small
discount on Monday's SKr66 closing price. The UK company's own share price
fell 3 1/2p to 148 1/2p yesterday.
NCC said it was selling its stake as part of a strategy to concentrate on
its core operations in building, building materials and property. NCC has
been struggling against a collapse in the Swedish construction market which
began in 1991, the SKr1.2bn capital gain from the sale will lift its balance
sheet.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Toyota to boost vehicle output in N America

<TEXT>
Toyota, Japan's largest car manufacturer, is to raise vehicle production in
North America by nearly 50 per cent.
The increase, announced yesterday, is the most dramatic indication yet by a
Japanese vehicle maker of the pressures the Japanese motor industry faces
from a sharply appreciated yen, trade friction with the US and growing
competition from US vehicle manufacturers in the world's biggest car market.
US and Japanese trade officials are holding last-minute negotiations over
how to increase foreign penetration of Japan's vehicle market. The US is
poised to take steps towards imposing sanctions against Japan at the end of
this month unless an agreement can be reached on several trade issues.
US carmakers reacted coolly to Toyota's announcement. Ford said: 'The
important thing is whether they're doing anything to improve the trade
deficit. What would interest us is whether they can increase the amount of
US-sourced material in the vehicles. Up to now, we feel they probably have
less than 50 per cent North American content.'
Toyota also intends to more than double US engine production and increase
vehicle exports from the US by 60 per cent by 1996.
In July, Honda, Japan's third-largest carmaker, announced that it would
spend Dollars 310m (Pounds 198m) on expanding its North American operations
to bolster car and engine manufacturing capacity as well as strengthening
its research and development and sales facilities.
Toyota said yesterday it would raise total North American vehicle production
to 790,000 in 1996, up from 533,000 last year. Eight years ago, production
in North America was only 14,000 vehicles. The boost in production will mean
that more than 60 per cent of the company's US sales will consist of North
American-built vehicles, compared with 46 per cent in 1993.
The increase will come from its manufacturing facility in Kentucky, Toyota
Motor Manufacturing USA (TMM), from New United Motor Manufacturing, its
joint venture with General Motors, and from Toyota Motor Manufacturing
Canada.
The company will not increase existing capacity in North America but will
achieve its target by using a second line at TMM, which came on stream in
March this year, and by raising productivity.
Annual production at TMM will increase from 234,000 last year to 400,000 in
1996.
Toyota's overall engine production in North America will more than double to
440,000 units from 207,000 last year.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Plan to base mortgage benefit on 'standard' interest rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers are considering a new way of cutting the amount the government
spends on helping people on income support to pay their mortgages.
Under the plan, mortgage benefit would no longer be based on the interest
rates charged by the mortgage lender to the benefit claimant, but would be
calculated on a fixed, 'standard' interest rate. The standard rate would
probably be set below the point at which the benefit would cover all the
mortgage interest owed by the claimant.
Previous efforts by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, to rein
back the Pounds 1.1bn spent annually on mortgage benefit have concentrated
on lowering the top limit at which a home loan is eligible for the state
payments. While introducing a ceiling of Pounds 150,000 last year and
dropping it to Pounds 125,000 this year affected only a few thousand
claimants, a standard rate of interest would affect all the half-million or
so people who claim mortgage benefit.
Such a move might prove an incentive to people to take out private
insurance, which covers payments if the mortgage holders lose their jobs, a
course the government is keen to encourage.
The Department of Social Security estimates that the majority of claimants
are paying mortgage interest at rates within a narrow range around 7.5 per
cent.
Setting a standard rate below that - at say 5 per cent or 6 per cent - would
deliver two streams of savings: not only would lower amounts be paid to
claimants, but administrative costs would be reduced, with less prospect of
the DSS overpaying.
A report last October by the National Audit Office said the Benefits Agency
had overpaid by Pounds 134m on mortgage interest in 1993-94.
Setting a standard rate below that being charged would also signal the
government's intention to withdraw gradually from mortgage benefit, again
increasing the incentive to people to take out their own insurance.
Changes in mortgage rates - such as those already occurring in the wake of
Monday's 0.5 percentage point rise in the base rate - are a particular
problem in terms of re-calculating payments.
Other ideas considered for curtailing spending include reducing the ceiling
to Pounds 100,000 or less; making the benefit a loan rather than an outright
payment; and extending the 16-week period for which only half the interest
due is paid.

FT  14 SEP 94 / US Senate paves way for banks to operate nationwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Senate cleared away the last obstacle to nationwide banking yesterday
when it voted to allow banks to set up branches outside their home states.
The move is expected to prompt a number of bank mergers and acquisitions as
institutions expand across state lines. Supporters of the legislation say it
will produce a more efficient banking system that will be able to better
serve consumers.
Although the measure had seemed certain to be approved, its supporters had
begun to fear that the vote would get held up in the logjam of legislation
awaiting action before Congress breaks up next month to prepare for the
November elections.
Once it has been signed by President Bill Clinton, the bill will allow big
bank holding companies to merge the separate subsidiaries they must now
maintain in each state into a single bank. It will also allow banks to open
new branches and acquire other banks outside their home states.
The bill passed the House of Representatives last month, but a vote had been
held up in the Senate because of objections by Senator Phil Gramm, who
opposed a measure relating to home equity lending in Texas, and by Senator
Howard Metzenbaum. When the senators dropped their objections, the bill
passed by 94 votes to 4.
Big US banks have been waiting for years for legislation to allow interstate
banking, which was backed by the Bush administration as well as the Clinton
administration.
But many smaller local banks have lobbied against the measure, which has
also been tied up for years by a related dispute between the banking and
insurance industries over bankers' use of a loophole allowing them to sell
insurance policies.
The bill will allow banks to convert their subsidiaries into branches from
1997 onwards, though states will be entitled to opt in and allow interstate
branching earlier.
Although yesterday senators agreed to drop a measure that would have
required foreign banks to set up US subsidiaries if they wanted to take
advantage of the new branch freedom, the bill will lower the limit on the
amount of retail deposits that a foreign bank may accept.
Along with a bill passed earlier this year to encourage the establishment of
community development banks, the interstate branch bill is the main piece of
banking legislation attempted by the Clinton administration.
Treasury officials expect, however, to try again next year to consolidate
federal banking regulations, an attempt they dropped in the face of
opposition from the Federal Reserve.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rocco Forte may not have won the Savoy Hotel for his own group but the
effort has not been as in vain as it seems. The Savoy is never likely to
earn more than a few million pounds and the bid for Meridien is
strategically much more important. Yet Forte needed to generate real value
out of its Savoy holding, something which should become easier with the
change in management. Perhaps that will eventually give Forte the chance to
sell out at a reasonable price.

FT  14 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Fisons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fisons, stricken by repeated self-inflicted wounds, seems incapable of
curing itself. For three years, the group has attempted to clean its stables
of questionable trade and accounting practices. Each time cleanliness was
claimed, more mire was uncovered. Yesterday was no exception. Nor was it
exceptional that yet another division reported an unexpected profits
collapse. The prospects painted by management for all three divisions were
grim.
The problem is finding a company willing to put Fisons out of its misery.
All the groups with asthma franchises have looked and rejected it. Some
Japanese groups have also sniffed, and walked away. Even though Fisons'
market capitalisation has plummeted from Pounds 3.4bn at its peak in 1991 to
barely Pounds 900m, the company looks expensive. Valuing the group on a
similar multiple to Glaxo - and that is being generous given Glaxo's better
quality earnings - Fisons' underlying worth is about 70p a share.
Yesterday's close was 135p. An elegant exit would be for Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer, with which Fisons now has a series of alliances, to buy the company.
Unfortunately, RPR has its own difficulties and probably cannot afford the
price. With a management which still insists the group has an independent
future, Fisons must limp on alone.

FT  14 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Caradon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The enthusiastic response to Caradon's interim figures risks being
misinterpreted. The company has under-performed the market by some 25 per
cent this year and yesterday's 4 per cent bounce in its shares reflects the
lack of unpleasant surprises rather than any particular piece of good news.
Certainly Caradon has pushed up the margins at the Pillar businesses
acquired from RTZ last year, without drawing heavily on provisions. But
there must be some uncertainty over its ability to halt the decline in
margins in US security printing. The rise in UK base rates also raises
doubts about whether housing market turnover will be sufficient to generate
much increase in spending on the building materials in which it specialises.
If it does not, Caradon will still have the prospect of further enhancement
of margins at Pillar. That might justify a slightly higher rating than
comparable companies with which it is now level-pegging. Extra investment on
efficiency and restructuring is unlikely to prevent a further drop in
gearing, though, and that leads on to another uncertainty. At this rate,
Caradon could become ungeared in about 18 months. If organic growth is weak,
the temptation then will be to go for another large acquisition. The market
will not necessarily look kindly on that, despite the evident skill with
which Pillar is being absorbed.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
P&amp;O is showing the first fruits of maintaining its heavy investment
programme through the recession. Shareholders worried that the management
had unwisely splashed out on new cruisers and container ships will have been
pleasantly surprised by yesterday's 52 per cent increase in underlying
profits. Group return on capital, which should reach 16 per cent this year,
is still nothing to crow about. But returns will rise as the economic
recovery continues. Most P&amp;O businesses have high fixed costs, so
profitability is strongly geared to the level of demand.
P&amp;O is not merely a recovery story. The cruiser and container operations are
well-positioned in growing global markets. Not only are there more rich old
people in the world, looking to take cruises; younger families are
increasingly taking holidays by sea too. Equally, the container division
should benefit if international trade is boosted by the recent Gatt
agreement. The main concern is still the impact that Eurotunnel will have on
P&amp;O's cross-channel ferry business. But even here, prospects look less
worrying. If the cross-channel passenger market continues to grow by
anything like the 17 per cent seen so far this year, Eurotunnel's capacity
could be accommodated without a full-scale price war.

FT  14 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher's flight
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kingfisher spent a long time convincing the City of the merits of its Every
Day Low Pricing philosophy, only to find itself the victim of a backlash in
sentiment when earnings failed to match the rhetoric. Reflecting that, the
shares have dropped 37 per cent in the year to date, beaching them on a
substantial discount to the price-earnings ratio of the market as a whole.
At a time when the retail sector stands at a premium to the market, the
question now is whether Kingfisher is ripe for a re-assessment.
Although yesterday's interim profits were at the bottom end of scaled-back
expectations, and like-for-like sales in the core UK businesses stagnated or
fell, there were still some positive indications. Darty, the French
electricals retailer bought last spring, performed better than some had
feared when the deal was done - indeed without the contribution from this
source, retail profits for the group would have been down sharply. B &amp; Q did
well to improve profits in dire market conditions, and Superdrug showed a
welcome, if small improvement in margins. It was also encouraging to hear
the management lay new emphasis on the nuts and bolts nature of the
challenges ahead - an acknowledgment that crude price cutting is not the
panacea it was once portrayed to be.
Given the weaknesses inherent in Kingfisher's mix of businesses, the points
of light in yesterday's figures were hardly enough to swing sentiment
immediately back into its favour. Had Kingfisher really wanted to reinforce
the positive aspect of its message, it should have increased the interim
dividend in line with its cautious optimism.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Company cash levels highest for 10 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Large British companies have become increasingly cash rich as a result of
rising profits and a series of bond and share issues.
In large non-manufacturing companies, liquid assets reached their highest
level for over 15 years in June, according to official figures released
yesterday. For large companies overall, liquidity was at a 10-year high.
The findings are likely to boost City hopes that investment, which has
lagged well behind the rest of the economic recovery, may pick up later this
year. However, the Confederation of British Industry warned that concerns
about demand may still be depressing investment, in spite of the increasing
availability of internal company finance.
The Central Statistical Office said the liquidity ratio (current assets
maturing in less than a year as a share of liabilities that must be repaid
in less than a year)of large non-manufacturing companies at the end of June
rose to a seasonally adjusted 178 per cent, sharply up from the 134 per cent
of the previous June.
In manufacturing, the level was slightly lower, at 127 per cent. This was
fractionally down on three months before but well above the 97 per cent
recorded at the end of June 1993.
Overall, the liquidity ratio of the UK's largest companies was 147 per cent,
unchanged on the previous quarter and the highest recorded in the series'
10-year history. The survey covers about three quarters of the total net
assets of the industrial and commercial sector.
The CSO said yesterday that the key reason for the rise in liquidity was
that companies had made a series of bond and share issues in recent months
against a background of rising profits and repayments of their bank debts.
Mr Leo Doyle, economist with brokers Kleinwort Benson, said: 'These figures
show a strong build up in liquid assets - it shows that companies can invest
now without going into debt.'
However, Ms Kate Barker, economist at the CBI, said that although investment
was expected to pick up later this year, recent CBI surveys had indicated
that many large companies remained cautious about investment and employment
intentions.
'It is not just whether companies have the money but whether they believe
the demand will be there that drives investment,' she said.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Canadian markets rise after separatists' narrow win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's financial markets rose sharply yesterday as investors took heart
from the separatist Parti Quebecois' unexpectedly narrow victory in Monday's
elections in Quebec.
Although the PQ won 77 of the 125 seats in the National Assembly, it gained
only 44.7 per cent of the popular vote, against 44.3 per cent for the
outgoing Liberals.
Bond and currency markets were buoyed by pointers that many Quebeckers voted
on Monday for a change in government rather than for independence, and that
the PQ may have an uphill battle gaining a majority in a referendum to
decide whether the predominantly French-speaking province should remain part
of Canada.
Recent opinion polls show that close to 60 per cent of Quebeckers oppose
outright independence but the PQ's leader, Mr Jacques Parizeau, reiterated
his determination to press ahead with a referendum in 1995.
Political observers and economic analysts cautioned that the referendum was
likely to be preceded by a divisive campaign in which the new separatist
government in Quebec City will be well placed to push its case for
independence.
The PQ has pledged to push a formal declaration through the Quebec
legislature expressing a desire to begin sovereignty negotiations with
Ottawa. It will also set up a commission to draw up an independence
constitution.
The PQ, which previously held office from 1976 to 1985, failed to gain a
mandate in a referendum 14 years ago to negotiate a loose form of
sovereignty for Quebec. It has indicated that it will pursue its goal more
vigorously and unambiguously in the coming referendum.
The Bank of Canada yesterday intervened to slow the rise of the Canadian
dollar, which was trading at 73.84 US cents at noon yesterday, about
three-quarters of a cent above Monday's close.
The gap between the yield on long-term Quebec provincial bonds and
government of Canada issues narrowed slightly.
Canada's commercial banks responded to the improved markets by cutting their
prime lending rate from 7.25 per cent to 7 per cent.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Politics of population
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After 10 days in the Cairo heat, the United Nations conference on population
and development has produced a remarkable document. More than 150 countries
of widely differing cultures and religions have given their support to a
20-year plan aimed at curbing the world's population growth.
The programme, which urges countries to give universal access to family
planning and reproductive healthcare, may cost an estimated Dollars 17bn a
year by the end of the decade. But the more ambitious element of the
document is its statement that individuals, particularly women, have the
right to control the number and timing of their children. It urges that
women's status worldwide should be enhanced to give them the education and
freedom to make those choices. In a radical departure from previous UN
conferences, it sees a broad agenda of social development, of which
contraception is just one part, as the best way to tackle population growth.
Watching governments wrestle to agree on some of the most tortuous language
in the UN lexicon, there is reason to ask whether the exercise was
worthwhile. The policy statement is not binding, and critics have asked
whether the 'reproductive rights' it bestows on every person have any
meaning, given that there is no arena in which they can be enforced.
Moreover, in many countries which gave their support to the text, people
enjoy only limited political and legal rights.
However, there is cause for hope that governments will embrace much of the
Cairo text. As the population 'clock' in the conference hall's centre
reminded them, by registering more than one birth a second, it is in their
own interest to help people limit the size of their families.
There are also strong arguments that Cairo was right to persist with the
more ambitious parts of its agenda. The final document is, like the UN's
statement of human rights, an attempt to draw a common thread of agreement
between states of widely differing cultures. Mrs Nafis Sadik, director of
the UN population fund, who chaired the conference, deserves credit for her
determination to spin that thread through one of the most sensitive areas of
politics and human relationships.
The price of such agreements is hypocrisy: governments may well have signed
something they have no intention of enforcing. One delegate from western
Europe commented that, in ignoring the reality of countries' records on
family planning, 'it's been like ignoring an elephant in your bedroom'. But
the Cairo agreement at least provides a standard against which their actions
can be judged.
That agreement might have been still broader, or reached more quickly,
without the Vatican. In focusing on abortion - although the text mentions
the issue only as a threat to women's health - it stalled days of debate,
and may also have damaged public support for the Cairo policies. The Vatican
attended Cairo because of its status as permanent observer at the UN. But
its role appeared anomalous, as the only religion represented, and as the
only state with a birth rate of zero.
In the forthcoming UN conferences on social development and on women,
governments should consider how far they want to accommodate Rome in the
formidable but worthwhile task of reaching consensus on these highly
contentious questions.

Can't get your ganja in downtown Washington DC? Blame the European Union.
Together with the Jamaican government, the EU is now claiming success in an
eight-year struggle to persuade Jamaica's ganja - marijuana - farmers in the
north of the island to produce other, less lucrative, but perhaps more
stable crops.
The EU has been subsidising some 5,000 farmers with seeds, chemicals and
equipment, turning them off dope and on to carrots and other assorted veg.
Jamaica traditionally has been the third-largest supplier of marijuana to
the US, after domestic US supplies and Mexican imports.
'I'm not making as much money as I did from growing the other stuff,'
confessed one convert. 'But what I am earning now comes in every week
instead of twice a year. And I can sleep at nights knowing that the police
will not be coming to burn my crop and arrest me, or that a drug trafficker
will try to shoot me.'
'Pssst] Wanna score on some carrot juice?' Just doesn't have the same ring,
somehow.

Six weeks is obviously a long time in Swiss industry. As recently as July,
Fritz Gerber, the 65-year-old chairman of both the drugs group Roche and of
Zurich Insurance, let it be known he had no intention of retiring.
Fast movers, these Swiss. Gerber has now decided he will cede the Zurich
chair at the next agm to his chief executive Rolf Huppi. 'Things have their
time,' is how he puts it these days. Perhaps he has decided to set an
example to the rest of the grey beards cluttering the country's boardrooms?
'I am not a school teacher.'
Gerber still claims to be staying put at Roche. But for how long? 'The gods
decide how fit you are. But I would be the last one to hang on if my
colleagues did not want me.' Roughly what he said in July.

Apart from being relatively costly exercises, corporate identity overhauls
are not for the faint-hearted. There's always that niggling little worry
that the new moniker translates into some obscenity in Swahili, for
instance.
At least Mount Charlotte Thistle Hotels, which yesterday unveiled its four
star establishments as a separate entity called simply Thistle Hotels, had
only a new logo to worry about. But how to differentiate itself from Jardine
Matheson, Encyclopaedia Britannica, The Scotsman and countless other outfits
that also employ the prickly plant in their livery?
A stickler for detail, chief executive Robert Peel spent part of the million
odd pounds the affair cost on getting his minions to consult botanical
drawings.
The red and green design that finally emerged was derived from the Cotton
Thistle, proudly pictured in yesterday's bumf (with its Latin name spelt
wrongly). Apparently it's a particularly hardy member of the family and
grows to a considerable height. It is also better known as the Scotch
Thistle.
But you can see why London's largest hotel operator chose not to mention
that little detail . . .

Forget the high-tech surveillance gadgetry; clearly, what national leaders
need to equip themselves with are solidly-rooted trees. The magnolia that
blocked the kamikaze aircraft attack on the White House is not the first
example of handy arborial defences. John Major and his cabinet perhaps owe
their lives to the cherry-tree that deflected an IRA mortar aimed at 10
Downing Street three years ago. What more proof do we need that George
Washington did himself a considerable disservice?

Traders on the foreign exchange markets are clearly hurting more and more.
After calling a turn in the dollar recently, the publisher of a reputable
daily market report was contacted by a client who, apparently in all
seriousness, threatened to unleash a fatwa upon him. It is not entirely
clear which currency the irate caller/ friend or enemy is long or short of,
but so far the dollar has failed to turn, and police protection has not been

<TEXT>
Goldman Sachs' recent performance may have been hit by poor results on its
trading activities, but the choice of Jon Corzine, 47, as the firm's new
senior partner is a reminder of where the real power in the firm lies.
Corzine has been with Goldman for 20 years and has come up through the ranks
as the partner in charge of trading governments, mortgage-backed securities
and money market instruments. His new number two, Hank Paulson, 47, is the
investment banking man.
In the past, Goldman has tended to split the top job by appointing two
co-chairmen. Robert Rubin shared the job with Stephen Friedman before he
joined the Clinton administration as chairman of the National Economic
Council, and before that the firm was dominated by John Whitehead and John
Weinberg. Doubling up at the top of an investment bank has always looked a
bit of a fudge, although it has worked well in Goldman's case. Given his
age, Corzine will have longer than many of his predecessors to prove that
the new regime can work equally well.

FT  14 SEP 94 / The limits of tax and spend: If Sweden's Social Democrats
win Sunday's elections, they will struggle to maintain current welfare
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mona Sahlin, the popular young party secretary of Sweden's Social Democrats,
had a disarmingly frank message for her audience of first-time voters and
teachers in a school hall in Stockholm last week.
'If you are a Social Democrat,' she declared, 'you think it is terrific to
pay taxes. For me, taxes are the finest expression of what politics is
about.'
She was answered by a burst of spontaneous applause.
Out of place as it might sound in almost any other western nation, Ms
Sahlin's statement appears to capture the popular mood in Sweden as the
country prepares for a general election next Sunday. Three years after the
youthful Mr Carl Bildt came to power at the head of a centre-right coalition
declaring the 'Swedish model' to be dead, the appetite for radical reform of
the country's famously generous state welfare system has waned.
Instead, the Social Democrats - natural party of government in Sweden for
most of this century - seem poised to return, promising to defend the
welfare state and to raise taxes if necessary to pay for it.
Opinion polls show a swing to the left. Most predict Mr Ingvar Carlsson's
Social Democrats will lead the next government, either as a minority
administration or in alliance with one or more smaller parties of the centre
or left.
Not surprisingly, the financial markets and Swedish business leaders are
worried. This week, the chiefs of Volvo, Ericsson, Stora and ABB's Swedish
division - the country's four biggest exporters - joined forces to warn that
investment in Sweden was under threat if a new government raised taxes.
What preoccupies the financial markets is the size of Sweden's budget
deficit - now running at 11 per cent of annual gross domestic product - and
its spiralling public sector debt, equivalent to almost 100 per cent of GDP.
The fear is that a left-leaning government will be unwilling or unable to
force through the tough fiscal policies required to reduce the deficit and
bring the debt under control.
Such worries have already pushed up interest rates sharply in recent months
to levels well above those of Sweden's main European competitors. This in
turn has begun to cramp the economic recovery that began late last year: the
official forecast for gross national product growth in 1995 has recently
been reduced from 3 per cent to about 2 per cent.
'A vicious circle has arisen where interest rates rise further and the
domestic economy is hit by a double-dip,' wrote Nordbanken's economists in a
report this month warning of further market convulsions if the new
government did not quickly get to grips with the deficit.
The scale of the problem is enormous - underscored by the fact that after
three years of government under a prime minister committed to radical
economic reform, the economy is now more dominated by the state than it was
when Mr Bildt's four-party coalition took over. Small wonder that many
observers question whether a Social Democrat-led government will be able to
summon the political will to tackle Sweden's deep structural problems in the
public sector.
Public expenditure now eats up by far the highest proportion of gross
domestic product of any country in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD). It has risen to 73 per cent in 1993
from 60 per cent in 1990, compared to an OECD European average of around 50
per cent.
Tax revenues as a proportion of GDP are second only to Denmark's at just
under 50 per cent. Social benefits account for some 40 per cent of
disposable income. More than 30 per cent of the workforce is employed in the
public sector, a share some 50 per cent above the level of other smaller
European countries.
These figures defy the impression promoted by Mr Bildt's government that
Sweden has forsaken the egalitarian, statist path relentlessly pursued by
the Social Democrats during most of the 53 years they held power between
1932 and 1991.
In some respects, however, the figures do Mr Bildt an injustice. One reason
for the ballooning budget deficit was the recession he inherited from the
previous Social Democrat-led government - Sweden's longest and deepest slump
since the 1930s.
Unemployment has shot up from less than five per cent of the workforce to
around 14 per cent, including those on government-financed training schemes.
This has cost the state the equivalent of more than half the budget deficit
of SKr180bn (Pounds 15.4bn) in the last budget year. The government was also
forced to pledge some Skr90bn in direct aid and guarantees to rescue the
banks from a loan-loss crisis that engulfed them in 1992.
What is more, Mr Bildt can claim some notable achievements in his bid to
redress the structural imbalance in the economy between the public and
private sectors.
A privatisation programme has raised more than SKr20bn. Deregulation has
increased competition in telecommunications and broadcasting - Sweden's
telecoms and broadcasting markets are among the most competitive in the
world - and is on its way in the energy sector. Capital gains taxes have
been reduced and taxes on dividends scrapped. Industry, enjoying an export
boom spurred by devaluation and productivity gains, has been unanimous in
praising the government for creating a favourable business climate.
Even the welfare system has undergone some reforms. A reduction in sickness
benefits, for example, has helped slash absenteeism rates - once as high as
25 per cent. The basic rate of unemployment benefit has been brought down
from 90 per cent to 80 per cent of previous salary.
Perhaps most importantly of all, the Bildt government has negotiated terms
for Sweden's entry to the European Union which, if approved in a referendum
in November, will shift the country irrevocably away from its traditional
isolationist stance and reinforce the pressure on any government in
Stockholm to keep the public finances in order.
Nor is the Social Democratic party immune to change. It is easy to forget
now that during his time in office up to 1991, Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the party
leader, presided over a number of significant reforms which stemmed from the
realisation that 'the Swedish model' was becoming unsustainable.
It was the Social Democrats who instigated financial and currency
deregulation, who introduced a landmark reform of the income tax system in
1990, began to introduce contracting out of public services and who, in a
radical change of party policy, lodged Sweden's application to join the EU.
Ms Sahlin, widely regarded as a likely successor to Mr Carlsson, says the
economic crisis that exploded at the turn of the decade awoke the party from
'a fairy tale where we were sleeping without realising what was really going
on'.
She adds: 'We have tried to stop pretending that everything we had can be
kept. We are trying to see what is the essence of the Swedish model, to see
which parts we can keep. We will cut down what you get from benefits in
order to sustain the schools, the welfare and the child care systems.'
An example of the path Sweden might follow lies in Denmark, which was
confronted with a similar crisis in the early 1980s. In 1982, a new
government dominated by the Conservative party of Mr Poul Schluter and the
right-wing Liberals of Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen embraced a tough fiscal and
monetary programme which eventually brought the public finances into
balance.
But that coalition was in power for an uninterrupted 10 years. State
spending is still above 60 per cent of Denmark's GDP - and the welfare state
is still at the centre of political controversy, with Denmark facing its own
election three days after Sweden's.
The Danish achievement now looks beyond the grasp of Mr Bildt, whose
Moderate party, with a support base of no more than 22 per cent of the
Swedish electorate, is the only mainstream Swedish party fully committed to
radical structural change.
Ms Birgitta Swedenborg, deputy director of the Swedish Centre for Business
and Policy Studies, says the reforms enacted by the Bildt government have
been limited in part because the Liberal and Centre party coalition partners
never shared the enthusiasm for a radical change of direction shown by the
Moderates.
'The realisation that the Swedish model didn't work never did run very deep
in Sweden,' she says. 'People are still accustomed to thinking that the
Swedish model is something other countries seek to emulate. They don't
realise that the Swedish model is something most countries are warned
against these days.'
The Social Democrats readily accept that current levels of public
expenditure are unsustainable. Mr Goran Persson, the shadow finance
minister, is regarded as a tough pragmatist who is determined to cut the
budget deficit.
He has proposed a package of tax increases and spending cuts which would
narrow the budget gap by SKr61bn over four years, and stop the public debt
growing by 1998. He has also said that if this does not prove sufficient he
will come back for more.
At the same time, the Social Democrats want to stimulate growth to reduce
unemployment. They are promising investment incentives and even corporate
tax cuts. Ms Sahlin, a former labour minister, talks of the need for
flexibility and reform in a labour market still marked by low wage
differentials and rigidities in hire-and-fire rules.
What the Social Democrats have been careful not to do is set a target for
reducing the public sector. Their approach is essentially defensive, seeking
to preserve as much of the old system as possible.
This commitment is extremely attractive in a country where up to two-thirds
of the electorate depends on the public sector for the bulk of personal
income - either through direct employment or welfare benefits. The regiment
of state-dependent families forms a formidable constituency against radical
reform of the system.
'People have seen some changes over the past three years and they didn't
like them very much,' says Mr Olle Westberg, editor of Expressen, the
country's biggest-selling newspaper and until last year chief aide to Mrs
Anne Wibble, the current finance minister.
'What we are seeing now is a kind of nostalgia - a longing for what we had
before. This is the problem for the Social Democratic election campaign.
They warn of hard times still to come, but they somehow transmit the feeling
that it is possible to go back to where we were before.'
The Social Democrats' proposals on the budget deficit were cautiously
welcomed in the financial markets and helped stem the recent rise in
interest rates. But their plan falls well short of the spending cuts
proposed by Mr Bildt's government, and the emphasis on tax rises has brought
strong criticism from industry that the package was likely to deter
investment rather than encourage it.
Behind criticism of proposals made by Mr Persson, the shadow finance
minister, lies a lingering fear that the Social Democrats, faced with a
choice between deep cuts in the welfare system and printing money to finance
its preservation, will choose the inflationary route as they did
consistently in the 1980s.
There is, however, an important difference with the past. Assuming that
voters approve EU membership in their November referendum - and the Social
Democratic party leadership will campaign strongly for a Yes vote - the
government in Stockholm will no longer have the freedom to inflate its way
out of trouble. It will find itself obliged to meet the demanding criteria
for budgetary and economic convergence set by the Maastricht treaty.
In its report on the Swedish economy early this year, the OECD warned that
at some stage Swedes would have to choose either to shift emphatically away
from universal welfare provision to a more selective system, or dramatically
reduce the generosity of provisions.
'The current situation is one where changes of the system are urgently
needed. Given that the limits to sound financing of welfare expenditure have
already been surpassed, the country simply cannot continue as if nothing has
happened,' the OECD said. 'It must be made clear that there is no way
without sacrifice to stem the rising tide of unemployment and budget
deficits and to improve allocative efficiency.'
Mr Bildt's government has made a start in tough circumstances. It is
doubtful, however, that a new government after Sunday will have much of a
mandate to continue the task. And the economic and political circumstances
are, if anything, getting more difficult.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Canada crumbles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Canadian dollar soared to a seven-month high yesterday after the
separatist Parti Quebecois won a comfortable majority in the Quebec
legislature. This was not just another instance of markets believing that
bad news is good and vice versa. Nor does it reflect a belief that Canada
would be better off without Quebec - though that belief is held by an
increasing number of English-speaking Canadians, particularly in the west of
the country. In fact the markets had discounted the PQ's victory well in
advance. What they were reacting to was the narrow margin of that victory in
actual votes, which confirmed opinion poll evidence that most Quebeckers do
not want independence. Only 30 per cent (against 56) say they would vote yes
if a referendum were held now.
The new government is pledged to hold such a referendum in 1995. Quebeckers,
unlike the Czechs and Slovaks two years ago, will not be swept into divorce
by their elected leaders without a chance to say whether that is what they
really want. Yet the markets may be too hasty in assuming that the PQ will
be unable, after a year in office, to drum up a majority for independence.
Unaided, no doubt it would be. But it may get decisive help from disgruntled
English-speaking Canadians; and from the federal prime minister, Jean
Chretien, whose interest and duty alike are to hold Canada together, but who
commands little respect in his native Quebec. What drove Czechs and Slovaks
apart was not so much the ambition of their leaders as each side's
irritation at the other's unwillingness to accept or even understand its
priorities. Between Quebec and the rest of Canada a similar deadlock has
developed, as the failure of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown agreements
showed.
Both sides may feel, after another year of acrimonious negotiations, that
separation has a lot to be said for it. There is no risk of a Yugoslav-style
conflict. North America would not be so different with four states from what
it is with three. This indeed has been a big part of the PQ's argument,
similar to the 'Scotland in Europe' slogan of the Scottish National party.
Yet it cuts both ways. If Quebeckers wish to retain the same passports,
currency and trading arrangements they now have, will the pain and confusion
involved in even the most 'velvet' of divorce proceedings - the wrangles
over natural resources and public debt, the me-tooism of the indigenous
peoples, the orphaning of the Atlantic provinces, including New Brunswick
with its substantial French-speaking minority - really be worthwhile? Once
they had done it, many Canadians - and many Quebeckers - might have
difficulty in remembering why.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Who regulates?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is almost 10 years since British Telecommunications was privatised under
the watchful eye of an independent regulator. Since then, gas, electricity
and water have followed the same path. Regulators will also oversee the
privatisation of British Rail and postal services. Regulation is here to
stay.
This is despite some discontent over the regulators' record. The recent
water and electricity price reviews are widely judged to have let the
companies off too lightly. Until recently, the regulators were charged with
over-zealousness (largely by the companies they regulate). Now they stand
accused of treating their industries too generously, with
higher-than-necessary prices, growing dividends and fat salaries for top
executives.
In practice, regulators are always likely to disappoint the consumer. There
is every incentive for regulated companies to underplay the scope for
efficiency savings. And regulators cannot precisely calculate the efficiency
gains that are possible. If the regulator is over-ambitious, the consequence
could be failures in vital services that would also draw public opprobrium.
In the absence of Solomon's judgement, regulatory decisions will tend to
tilt towards the shareholder.
A small tilt need not fatally wound the system if it is demonstrably
outweighed by the benefits of privatisation. These include lower prices in
some industries, better service in most and new investment after decades of
Treasury parsimony. But if the tilt is to be minimised, regulators must
maintain an aggressive approach to their industries and a sceptical eye on
corporate pleading.
There are therefore few attractions in yesterday's proposals from the
left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research to do away with individual
regulators and give the government a stronger role in regulation. The IPPR
wants to set up regulatory commissions representing 'stakeholders' such as
suppliers and employees, with a requirement to operate under industrial
policy objectives set by the government. This would seriously weaken
regulation by opening it up to lobbying by special interest groups, many
with little commitment to efficiency or low prices. It would also
reintroduce the short-term political pressures that were so disastrous for
the old nationalised industries.
Some of the regulated industries could be set more demanding targets.
Regulators' decisions might win greater public support if they were reached
in a more open fashion. And parliament should encourage them to account for
their decisions by appearances in front of select committees. But the
individual accountability and independence of the present system has
delivered benefits that should not be thrown away lightly.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Variable geometry challenge for EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STANLEY CROSSICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Unlike the Maastricht process, we are already seeing a serious debate
developing well ahead of the 1996 intergovernmental conference; this is
healthy and democratic. Lionel Barber rightly points out ('Fresh meat from
Europe's stable', September 8) that the challenge is how to apply variable
geometry in a Union expanded to the east. The recent German CDU/CSU paper
proposes a combination of variable geometry and a hard core.
Variable geometry, without a hard core of member states agreeing in advance
to opt in to core policies, would unleash a centrifugal force. The existence
of the hard core creates a centripetal force.
John Major, at Leyden on September 7, said the vision of the founding
fathers 'was proved right for its age. But it is outdated. It will not do
now'. He is wrong. The vision remains right for today's age; it is the
institutional and organisational structure of the Union that is outdated.
The original imperatives for creating the Union remain valid today. The
central concern of the CDU/CSU paper is Germany's position in Europe and the
need to guard against future German hegemony: 'If Europe were to drift
apart, Germany would once again find itself caught in the middle between
east and west . . . If (west) European integration were not to progress,
Germany might be called upon, or be tempted by its own security constraints,
to try to effect the stabilisation of eastern Europe on its own and in the
traditional way.'
The UK government is right that we must not force member states to integrate
more quickly than they wish. Conversely, member states which want to
integrate more quickly must be permitted to do so. The most important
requirement is to place the real issues and choices before the public in

FT  14 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Competition will help European arms
producers improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof HARVEY M SAPOLSKY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'European defence' (September 9), ignores some basic
facts. As the Gulf war demonstrated, but most European militaries already
knew, American weapons are not only cheaper than their European counterparts
but also much better.
They are better because they were designed for combat use, not for
industrial policy purposes. The American military gained much combat
experience during the cold war and was equipped to fight the Soviets.
European militaries sat mostly in garrison during the cold war. Their
weapons were acquired to keep local arms industries busy. Neither cost nor
quality was much of an issue. But now Americans are likely to turn
isolationist. Job needs will guide American weapons production.
In contrast, Europeans must deal with chaos on their doorsteps. European
militaries will need the best equipment, which they should be allowed to
find wherever it is produced. With competitive pressure, European producers
will gain in quality and efficiency.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Facile yardstick for hospital chiefs'
salaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHARLES MCGILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Alan Pike compared the salaries of private-sector executives handling
budgets of Pounds 110m with that of chief executives of hospitals with
similar budgets ('Managers' top pay in hospitals is Pounds 95,000',
September 10) . The inference was hospital heads were doing badly.
There is a world of difference between (a) being responsible for an
enterprise which must bring in its own turnover by selling a service or
product and, in addition, controlling the expenditure necessary to create
that turnover through a number of functions, and (b) responsibility for
controlling a spending budget of Pounds 110m which is extorted from tax
payers and handed to you.
A commensurate salary would be about half the figure mentioned and much less
than that currently paid to hospital chief executives. Many local authority
department heads are also grossly overpaid.
Interestingly, this facile yardstick should provide John Major with a salary
of Pounds 279m a year. After all he handles a budget of Pounds 250bn a year.

FT  14 SEP 94 / 'Hard core' dissent: The chasm dividing the UK and its EU
partners is getting deeper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European for-eign minis-ters have den-ounced the controversial report by the
German Christian Democrat party (CDU), which argued that there should be a
minority 'hard core' at the centre of the European Union. Their show of
disapproval may give temporary reassurance to the British, Italian and
Spanish governments, which have expressed alarm at the thought that Germany
might try to relegate them to the slow lane of Europe. But public
denunciation cannot dispose of the thinking behind the CDU paper, because it
has been shaped by the geopolitics of the new map of Europe.
Unfortunately, geopolitics is the chasm which has long divided the British
from most of their partners on the continent, and it now seems to be getting
deeper. The six founders of the European Economic Community saw it from the
start as an essentially geopolitical undertaking, of which the economic
rules were just the practical expression; and for the Germans this
imperative has been even stronger than for the other five. But even after 20
years of membership the British still do not understand this. They
instinctively think that the 'common market' is just a trading arrangement,
and believe it ought to become more like a loose free-trade area; whereas if
the problem is geopolitics, the solution is Nato and the Americans.
The authors of the CDU paper inevitably see the geopolitics of Europe in
German-centric terms, and invoke the EU as a guarantee against historic
German-driven instability on the continent. They argue that the
institutional and law-based framework provided by the Treaty of Rome was
essential after the second world war to stabilise West Germany inside
western Europe, and they claim it is just as necessary today.
The British pay lip-service to this peace-making function of the EU, but
they discount 90 per cent of what the Germans are saying; they do not
understand the German problem, because it is not a British problem. As a
result, the British and the Germans draw opposite conclusions from the fall
of the Iron Curtain.
The British government is now trying to sweep away the original geopolitical
underpinning for the EU, by pretending that that purpose has now been served
and can be dispensed with. Here is what Mr John Major said last week in his
William and Mary Lecture in Leyden.
'The European Community was born to end divisions in western Europe. It has
succeeded. With Nato, it has given us peace and prosperity in our part of
the continent, and made war unthinkable. The determination of the founding
fathers has succeeded far beyond the estimations of most people in their
time. Their vision was proved right for its age. But it is outdated. It will
not do now.'
The obvious inference is that the EU model is no longer needed. But if so,
what then? Should the Treaty of Rome and all its institutional trimmings now
be scrapped? Or does Mr Major merely mean that we do not need any additional
political integration of that kind, because now we have peace in our time?
If the old vision is in some unspecified way out-dated, what is the nature
of the new vision? He does not say; the only thing he is firm about is that
we must have lots of flexibility all round.
The authors of the CDU paper take the opposite point of view. They argue
that the opening up of Europe may reawaken all the historical dangers in
central-eastern Europe, with Germany once more at the pivot of instability
between east and west; and therefore Europe needs a politically integrated
union even more than it did before.
'The only solution which will prevent a return to the unstable prewar
system, with Germany once again caught in the middle between east and west,
is to integrate Germany's central and eastern European neighbours into the
(west) European postwar system, and to establish a wide-ranging partnership
between this system and Russia . . . Hence, Germany has a fundamental
interest both in widening the union to the east and in strengthening it
through further deepening. Indeed, deepening is a pre-condition for widening
. . . ' the report says.
The central question, according to the CDU paper, is whether the EU 'is able
and willing to become the main pillar of a continental order, alongside a
democratised and once-again stable Russia, and in alliance with the US'.
This will only be possible, it says, if we strengthen the political
integration of the union; and one component of this strengthening will be a
tight inner core of those countries which are most able and willing to go
for integration.
The merit of the CDU paper is that it sets out a broad-based strategy for
tackling the enlargement of the EU to the east, in which the geostrategic
starting-point is brought together with a mainstream integrationist approach
to Europe. It is obviously not the only possible strategy for Europe, but it
is clear and coherent, and it will be at least a stimulating starting point
for the debate now erupting on the future of Europe.
Mr Major's speech was evidently intended as a British counterblast.
Unfortunately, its main characteristic was its evasiveness. He says we
should rebuild 'cohesion and confidence' in the EU; but he does not say how.
He says enlargement of the union to the east 'must extend to security
arrangements'; but he does not say how, except, of course, that 'we must be
flexible'.
In fact this speech is largely waffle, from which it is impossible to deduce
any operational strategy. And if the government does not have a strategy, it
is mainly because it cannot or will not think in geopolitical terms.

FT  14 SEP 94 / More hands on the steering wheel: John Ridding assesses
Renault's prospects as the government prepares to sell some of its shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renault's formula one racing team cruised to victory in last Sunday's Grand
Prix at Monza. Yesterday, the French state-owned automobile group recorded a
more significant achievement, edging ahead of rivals to be the next issue in
the government's sale of public sector assets.
Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, said yesterday that France's
centre-right government planned to float about 28 per cent of the shares in
the company, one of the stars of the state sector. The sale, which could
raise about FFr10bn (Pounds 1.2bn) for the government, marks a significant
step in its policy of expanding public share ownership.
But as Prime Minister Edouard Balladur emphasised, the majority of the
company's equity would remain parked in the public sector for the time
being.
The decision to leave Renault under state control clarifies the scale and
timing of its privatisation after several months of speculation. But it
raises several important questions concerning the government's strategy and
the implications of that for the company's long-term future.
Mr Balladur said the government had decided to limit the sale to a partial
privatisation because of the lack of a powerful industrial partner for
Renault in the wake of the collapse of merger plans with Volvo of Sweden in
December last year. 'I have always said that I thought Renault could not be
privatised if at the same time an industrial alliance was not being created
to ensure Renault's future,' said the prime minister.
What is odd about this argument is that Renault's public sector status was
one of the principal reasons behind the revolt by Volvo shareholders which
scuppered the merger.
At least as important a consideration for the French premier, it seems, was
the political sensitivity of Renault.
A powerful symbol of union power in postwar France, Renault has become the
rallying point of the country's political left and of unions in their
campaign against privatisation. 'We will fight with all the means at our
disposal to prevent the sale of Renault,' declared Mr Robert Hue, general
secretary of the French Communist party, outside the now-disused site in
western Paris where the first Renaults were built almost 100 years ago.
Union membership at Renault has dwindled since the 1970s to little more than
10 per cent of the workforce. But with presidential elections due next
spring, the ever-cautious Mr Balladur - who has the candidacy of the
Gaullist RPR party in his sights - is anxious to avoid a potentially
damaging labour dispute.
The risk of labour unrest has not been eliminated by the decision to
maintain majority state control. The communist-led Confederation Generale du
Travail said yesterday it would oppose even a partial privatisation. But for
the workforce as a whole, the limited nature of the share issue and Mr
Balladur's pledges to 'Francify' the company through extending public and
employee share ownership should make a mobilisation more difficult.
Apart from the risk of union disruption, the issue of Renault shares should
be relatively smooth. It will involve several steps, including a FFr2bn
capital increase for the automobile group, the sale by Volvo of about half
of its 20 per cent stake in the French company, and the formation of a core
of long-term stable investors. This means that individual and institutional
investors couldbe offered more than 30 per cent of the company's shares.
In most of these areas the details are already falling into place.
Negotiations with Volvo have been finalised, and members of the noyau dur,
or core, of stable investors have been lined up. Mr Philippe Jaffre chairman
of Elf Aquitaine, for example, has said he is prepared to invest FFr1bn in
Renault, which he describes as a close industrial partner. Banque Nationale
de Paris and Groupe Lagardere, the defence and media company, may also join
the core shareholding group.
Interest from individuals and institutional investors is expected to be
strong. 'Renault is one of the most attractive assets in the public sector
and is one of the most profitable international automobile groups,' said Mr
Eric Michelis, automobiles analyst at Kleinwort Benson in Paris.
Unlike most of its international rivals, the French group weathered the
downturn in the industry over the past few years without falling into loss.
Earlier this month, Renault reported first-half profits of FFr1.7bn, more
than double the figure in the same period in 1993.
The first-half results were flattered by exceptional gains from the disposal
of shares in Volvo. But Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman, expects
significant progress in full-year results, partly because of an improved
performance by RVI, the company's trucks and buses division, and improved
sales of new products including the Laguna, the upper range saloon, and the
innovative Twingo mini-car.
For international investors, however, the operation may prove frustrating.
Mr Balladur's desire to maintain tight French control of the group suggests
that few shares will be made available to foreign investors.
Some investors have also expressed broader concerns about the retention of
majority state control. 'We have concerns that commercial considerations may
take a back seat to political questions and social factors such as promoting
employment,' said one US fund manager.
Most industry observers argue that such concerns should not be exaggerated.
'Renault has been managed like a private sector company for a long time,'
said Mr Michelis of Kleinwort Benson. Others add that moves towards full
privatisation are likely to follow. Previous privatisations such as Elf
Aquitaine, the oil group, and Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals company, have
been conducted through a step-by-step process, providing a probable model
for Renault.
'It is too sensitive to discuss full privatisation now, but I think this
operation should be seen as the first stage in a process,' said one merchant
banker in Paris, although he added that full privatisation could be a
protracted process.
In the longer term, Renault and potential investors are faced with important
strategic questions. The collapse of the merger with Volvo has deprived the
French company of important economies of scale and without a partner, in an
industry which has consolidated significantly over recent years in the face
of intensified competition. The improvement in automobile markets this year
has masked rather than resolved the threat of increased competition,
maintaining the vulnerability of the smaller manufacturers.
'With Volvo, Renault would have been the world's sixth largest vehicle
maker,' said one industry analyst in Paris. 'Alone it is tenth, and that may
not be big enough,' he added, referring to the efficiency gains in
production and vehicle development enjoyed by larger groups. Such a
consideration loomed large in the rationale for the merger with Volvo, which
would have yielded cost savings of FFr30bn by the year 2000 according to the
erstwhile partners.
The problem for Renault is that attractive partners are few and far between.
'Volvo was an ideal fit, partly because of its strong presence in the truck
sector,' said one official at the industry ministry, who admitted that
similar matches would be hard to find. The risk is that, as in the case of
the Volvo alliance, a protracted dominance of the French state on the
shareholder register could deter the potential allies which Mr Balladur
believes are needed to secure Renault's future.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, Under current personal equity plan rules, a company listed on the
Unlisted Securities Market is eligible for investment.
If such a company chooses not to seek a full listing when the USM closes at
the end of 1996 and consequently is marketed on the Alternative Investment
Market, then it will be ineligible for investment.
Unless the Pep rules are changed, this would mean that all such holdings
will have to be sold out of the Pep.
Maybe now is the time for all interested parties to write to the Revenue and
suggest that a change in the rules would be to the benefit of both investors
and companies.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Partnership projects must be more
equal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROY SWANSTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Joe Dwyer, Wimpey's chief executive, hit the nail on the head in his
analysis of the government's private finance initiative ('Private finance
projects need bigger return', September 7).
Previous government statements have been over-optimistic on the extent of
risk which the private sector is willing to bear. Companies have duties to
their shareholders and in many cases there are far more attractive
investments in terms of risk and return than large infrastructure projects.
So the government has to make these projects as attractive and certain as
possible if there is to be any real cost benefit in a joint venture.
There is still a widespread feeling that the Treasury is anxious to shuffle
off the risk element overwhelmingly on to the private sector. To combat this
there needs to be a stronger sign that government is prepared to co-fund
projects, particularly where social benefits are created. It is difficult to
see how some projects will get off the drawing board without genuine
public/private sector partnerships of this kind.
A problem remains in the Treasury's accounting rules. It insists that if a
private sector company builds, say, a toll road, it must bear the risk that
tolls will not cover the costs. The Treasury is unwilling to 'stand behind'
a company and bail it out if things go awry because the project will then
count as public expenditure and so increase the public sector borrowing
requirement.
But if government will not underwrite projects or share risks more equally
the private sector will naturally expect a higher return, perhaps 15 per
cent or more. The Treasury still seems unwilling to commit public money to
joint ventures in which the private sector stands to earn returns of this
dimension. Roy Swanston,

FT  14 SEP 94 / Arts: New look at 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, has a new artistic regime, and it will be
positively disappointing if it does not prove controversial. Neil Bartlett,
its new artistic director, has a wide-ranging talent: he performs, he
directs, he translates, he writes; he brings Shakespeare, Marivaux,
Victorian melodrama and Ruth Rendell to the stage.
But that is not where the controversy should lie. Bartlett is gay, and few
people in British theatre, if any, are working harder than he to demonstrate
how broad and complex a gay sensibility can be. Yet around almost all his
stagings - whether period or modern, comic or serious - hangs the same heavy
aura of camp, like clouds of incense in the air. This atmosphere reminds me
of the work of Lindsay Kemp, though Bartlett has infinitely more restraint
and refinement. Their similarities lies in an un-British appetite for
melodrama, in a lack of innocence, in a (sometimes joyous) sense of doom,
and in a climate of knowing decadence.
Bartlett's opening production at the Lyric is his adaptation of The Picture
of Dorian Gray, and it is a perfect demonstration both of his considerable
talent and of the drawbacks that go with that talent. Not only does he tell
Oscar Wilde's 1890 novel, he also interleaves it with a subsequent tale of
various of Wilde's friends meeting in 1924 to read the novel and act it out
and reminisce and discuss.
The intersection of life and art is one of Bartlett's specialties. The
friends of Wilde who assemble for this 1924 reading of the loved book are
Ada Leversohn, Reggie Turner, Robbie Ross, and Sidney 'Jenny' Mavor: each
intimate with separate facets of Wilde the artist and man. Even now, they
avoid calling a spade a spade - but this works to surprisingly powerful
effect. The great scandal of Wilde's career, the private life that was
rendered public, the cause of his appalling ostracisation from British
society: all this grows melodramatically in everybody's mind, like -
Bartlett forces us to see the parallel - the hidden portrait of Dorian Gray,
forever growing more repellent because of being secreted and repressed.
To this double melodrama - the scandals of both Dorian Gray and Oscar Wilde
 -Bartlett adds further melodrama of another kind: the musical kind, whereby
characters speak, often but not always, over a dramatic musical
accompaniment, as in some 19th-century music (and as in film). Nicholas
Bloomfield is Bartlett's composer, and his score, for six stringed
instruments and harp, has Bartlett's feeling for atmosphere and intensity
but not his achievement of one single style.
The music indulges in all kinds of 19- and 20th-century effects, it swoops
and scoops and pulsates and camps . . . 'Decadent', the word wrongly
attached to Wilde and only partly true of Bartlett, is utterly right for
Bloomfield. (The musicians play high above the action, on an upper level of
Ian MacNeil's handsomely atmospheric, triangular and successfully
claustrophobic set.)
I have saved the best till last. The six actors whom Bartlett has assembled
for this production are superb, and it looks as if they have profited from
detailed stylistic direction from Bartlett and/or his co-director Leah
Hausman. Tim Pigott-Smith is Robbie Ross and Basil Hallward, Maria Aitken is
Ada Leversohn, Benedick Bates is the Boy in the Guards and Dorian Gray,
Joanna Riding is the Maid and Sybil Vane, Paul Shaw is Sidney Mavor, and -
best of all - Bette Bourne is Reggie Turner and Lord Henry Wotton.
These actors come from widely different backgrounds, and this fact only
supports the strangeness of the meeting that Bartlett puts onstage. All of
them handle with great precision the conflicting mixture of sympathy and
malice in the air, the varying degrees of emotion and repression and
melodramatics involved.
Everything is beautifully focused. The many meanings of Wilde's tale -
Dorian Gray as Ganymede, Alcibiades, Mlle de Maupin, Mr Hyde - grow as you
watch. Bartlett's taste and style deserve to be controversial; his
professionalism is beyond reproach.
At the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, W6, until October 15; then touring to the
Nottingham Playhouse.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Arts: The Getty Museum fights on over The Three Graces
ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A High Court Judge, Mr Justice Laws, ruled yesterday that the government had
not acted unfairly in its efforts to keep Canova's sculpture of The Three
Graces in the UK. But the long saga is not yet over.
The Getty Museum of Malibu, California, which petitioned the courts, is to
apply to the Court of Appeal in the hope that it will over-rule Justice
Laws' decision that there was no need for a judicial review into the actions
of heritage secretary Stephen Dorrell.
The approach to the Court of Appeal will be made within the next seven days
but it could be weeks before the matter is finally settled. The department
of National Heritage said yesterday that it will not refuse an export
licence until the appeal was resolved.
In August, in his first act as heritage secretary, Dorrell added a three
month extension to the export deadline. This enabled the Victoria &amp; Albert
Museum and the National Galleries of Scotland to raise the Pounds 1.8m still
needed - from John Paul Getty II and Baron Thyssen - to keep the Three
Graces in the UK.
The Getty had bought the statue in 1989 for Pounds 7.6m but has been
constantly thwarted in its efforts to retrieve it from the UK.
A spokesman for the department of National Heritage said yesterday: 'We are
pleased the judge has accepted our argument'.
Mr Justice Laws awarded most of the costs against the Getty, but with an
endowment of more than Dollars 4bn and annual expenditure in excess of
Dollars 200m, they should be well within its budget.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Arts: Return of 'Turandot' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Covent Garden the seasons come and go. Turandot is back yet again after
ten years' good service and almost as many opening nights have passed since
the Royal Opera House launched its development plan, which by now must rank
as another of the company's longest running shows.
With the arrival of the National Lottery in the autumn, that drama looks set
to reach its final climax; Pounds 20.5m has already been spent on
architects' plans and other preparatory work, which would be enough to
provide spectacular new opera productions for years, so if the big push in
this crucial season comes to nothing there will be red faces all round.
Fortunately, none was necessary for artistic reasons on the opening night.
The Royal Opera's production of Turandot is one of its fail-safe successes.
It has been around since 1984, when Andrei Serban (the original producer)
unveiled what has turned out to be his most striking achievement for the
company's tour to the Los Angeles Olympics, but little of its vivid
theatrical colour has faded over the years. It is a still a splendid
evening's entertainment - and more.
It is perhaps worth recalling what Turandot used to be like before: garish,
fairy-tale Chinoiserie, dressed up in the mode of the day, at its worst like
a cross between Aladdin and the Tiller Girls in Peking. (Try the photo of
the 1947 tableau in the programme.) This production changed all that,
emphasising the cruelty and the oppression as a downtrodden people gather in
expectation of the latest public execution.
There is often the same bloodthirsty spirit among the audience, too. The
leading roles of Turandot are killers to sing and no opera offers more
ringside excitement. On Monday night Sharon Sweet was both making her Royal
Opera debut and singing the title-role for the first time, a double
challenge which she surmounted with ease. Her voice is big, bright and free
where it matters, namely at the top, where Puccini stretched his soprano's
vocal capacity to new heights. As Turandots go, she is formidable rather
than fearsome, not a Chinese tiger on the prowl like some others in this
production, but the role should suit her well.
When she and Giuseppe Giacomini's Calaf join in duet, ringing unison top
notes peal into the auditorium. Giacomini is a known quantity here, but that
does not make the strength and musicianship of his singing ('Nessun dorma'
generously phrased over the bar lines) any less welcome. Giorgio Giuseppini
was a gravel-voiced Timur; Simon Keenlyside's handsomely-sung Ping led the
tumbling trio of ministers.
Ideally, one would like more flesh on the tone of Elisabeth
Norberg-Schultz's Liu if the character is to acquire human depth, but her
brightly-focused, light soprano was pleasing as far as it went. In the
postlude after her first aria every note was drawn out, symptomatic of
conducting from Daniele Gatti that likes to make a meal of the music. He
does, however, have the panache to drive home Puccini's biggest climaxes.
All told, this was a decent Turandot all-round, but beware: cast changes
during the run are many and varied.
Performances until November 5.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Arts: The drama of technology - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drama is the glamourpuss of television, as the opening of the new autumn
season reminds us. Drama is more expensive than anything else, involves more
famous people, and is promoted more enthusiastically by the television
companies. If you have an 85-minute film such as Pat And Margaret written by
Victoria Wood, directed by Gavin Millar, with a cast led by Julie Walters,
Celia Imrie and Victoria Wood, or a four-part mini-series such as Faith,
with Michael Gambon starring in a story about sexual shenanigans among
politicians, then you are going to try to ensure that everyone knows about
it.
This applies not only to so-called prestige productions and single dramas,
but also in such well-tried categories as the British detective story -
ITV's Ruth Rendell Mysteries for instance - and the working class comedy
drama, such as BBC1's Common As Muck which is clearly aiming for high
ratings and intended for a long run. For all these dramas there will be
glossy brochures and press launches, cassettes will be biked to the
burgeoning army of preview writers, and the stars will be chauffeured around
to do their bit on daytime sofa shows, local radio, and Woman's Hour.
The same does not apply to programmes such as the Channel 4 science series
Equinox or the BBC2 series White Heat, about the development of technology:
budgets are lower, audiences smaller, and there are no stars to chat on the
sofas, so there is no hope of their being promoted with the same vigour. And
yet it is White Heat and Equinox which, in the last 10 days or so, have been
making me sit up straight on the old green sofa, and have literally altered
my perception of the world and of mankind. However long the longest running
of the new dramas proves to be, it is hard to see how it could ever equal
the impact of those programmes about technology.
Which is not to suggest that the drama has been poor. On the contrary, even
the least impressive, the Ruth Rendell Mystery, which has been
disappointingly familiar in its approach and atmosphere, has still succeeded
in hooking me firmly enough to ensure that I shall be watching on Friday to
discover whodunnit. It is hard to avoid the feeling that familiarity and
predictability are precisely the qualities for which ITV is now striving in
its drama. Faith, which was shown in one-hour segments on either side of
News At Ten on Wednesday and Thursday, would have been improved by dropping
all the material about the reporter's daughter, and ruthless editing to
reduce the four hours to two or less. It might then have become a taut, pacy
drama about politicians and the press instead of the diffuse piece of work
we saw, which gave us too much time to muse upon the last political drama
series in which the affair turned out to be homosexual (To Play The King).
The drama surprise of the new season is Common As Muck, a series about
northern dustmen which is presumably intended to do for BBC1 what Minder did
for ITV. The surprise is that it works so well, or did in the opening
episode. Matters may deteriorate, you always need three or four episodes to
be sure, but already it seems that comedy and plot are to emerge from
character rather than being draped over prefabricated 'characters'.
The seeming paradox of discovering that the dustman most ready to make
racist remarks is himself married to a black woman is (in my experience as a
junior reporter in the ethnic rainbow that was Slough in the 1960s)
absolutely true to life. As for Pat And Margaret, it was a deliciously
malicious character study which fulfilled all the promise of 'Acorn
Antiques' in Victoria Wood's sketch shows.
But while those dramas entertained me, Equinox with its programme 'The
Cyborg Cometh', and the opening programme in the White Heat series,
'Butcher's Blade', managed to startle me. Anyone who has read a fair amount
of science fiction will be familiar with two popular themes: first the
extension of individual human power via machinery (whether built in and
'bionic', or built on as hugely powerful robotic extensions) and second, the
assertion that the answer to the question 'Why are we here?' is 'To build a
machine cleverer than ourselves'. Between them these two programmes created
a picture, impressionistic yet vivid, of mankind standing on the brink of a
period when those fantasies could turn into realities, and we could change
dramatically in the process.
If they are right then the rapid evolution of mankind up to the point where,
today, he dominates the world, will look like kids' stuff compared to the
leap he is about to make. The most pleasing aspect of White Heat (which was
made for the BBC and the Discovery Channel by Uden Associates) is that, far
from being one of those typical gee-whiz television series that cannot wait
to zap you with the next bit of miraculous hardware, it is much more
concerned with aesthetics; with the emotional and cultural implications of
technological development. If you took the preoccupations of this series and
kept them in mind while watching Equinox it was not difficult to imagine man
achieving (if that is the right word) within only two or three generations
something close to immortality.
The picture emerging from the two programmes is of technology, from robotics
to genetic engineering, largely negating the weaknesses of the human body
and leaving human brains served by renewable mechanical parts. We are
already a long way down that road, and of course the journey has its
problems. Equinox told the chilling story of a woman in hospital who was
clearly brain-dead but whose heart would not stop beating. She had a
pacemaker and, this being the US, her family faced bankruptcy as the bills
mounted up while the ethics were being sorted out. 'Technology is evolving
faster than homo sapiens' said the commentary.
Clearly no such programme is ever going to out-rate Victoria Wood and Julie
Walters playing long lost sisters brought together by a ghastly TV show
called 'Magic Moments' (a title and concept which are probably being
developed in earnest somewhere even as you read this). But the implications
of White Heat and Equinox, for the smaller number of people who have been
watching them, are far more significant and much more long lasting . . .
even if they do not earn anyone any space on any of those sofas.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Business and the Environment: A case of green gains - David
Lascelles on the savings to be made through efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If being green were good for business, it would presumably happen of its own
accord. So why is there not more of it?
The Institute of Business Ethics believes that the best way to get the
message across is by citing case studies of companies which have gained by
being green. A new publication* this week, Benefiting Business and the
Environment, describes 70 environmental initiatives taken by 43 companies in
the UK.
Some of the companies are multinationals, such as Esso and National
Westestminster Bank. Others are tiny enterprises. The total annual savings
represented by the studies are more than Pounds 10m with an average payback
of 18 months. 'Thus,' say the authors, 'the potential for savings in the UK
as a whole is vast.'
Many of the savings came through energy efficiency. Forte, the hotel group,
saved Pounds 180,000 in 1993 by installing combined heat and power systems
in 60 hotels.
A more ambitious scheme came at Blue Circle, the cement maker, which used
several of its disused quarries for landfill and built electricity
generation plants at four of them to make use of the landfill gas they
create. The plants generate enough electricity to serve a town the size of
Salisbury, but require a government subsidy to make them economic.
Spring Grove Services, which washes 34,000 washroom roller towels a week,
plans to capture waste heat from the drying process to warm the factory. The
installation cost Pounds 57,000 and Spring Grove hopes to save Pounds 12,000
a year on energy costs.
Water saving is another theme. Arjo Wiggins Fine Papers in Dover has reduced
water consumption and waste by nearly 50 per cent with savings of Pounds
270,000 on effluent charges and raw material costs over the last three
years.
Several case studies show how companies have saved money by identifying
waste. Some go a stage further and turn it to advantage by recycling it.
Triplex Safety Glass used to send all waste glass to landfill. Now it
separates untreated glass for re-use to make patterned or wired glass
products, while other glass which has been toughened or printed on is used
as aggregate in cement and as reflective material in road-marking paint. The
savings are put at Pounds 274,000 a year.
Boots the Chemist carried out an audit which showed that it handles 70,000
tonnes of packaging a year. A saving exercise has cut out 70 tonnes of paper
and board and 180 tonnes of plastic, and 27 tonnes of virgin pulp have been
replaced by recycled fibre.
At Procter &amp; Gamble, the switch to refill containers for detergents has cut
out more than 11,000 tonnes of packaging over four years.
Transport is a big cost for business. TNT Express has set a target of 12 to
17 per cent reductions in fuel use by applying the fruits of research into
vehicle design and wider use of aerodynamic devices.
Skippingdale Paper Products, which makes paper nappies, estimates it saves
Pounds 195,000 a year in transportation costs by making a neater nappy.
What is not clear from the report is what prompted these companies to go for
such savings. Was it environmental concern, or more ordinary business
motives?
Many of the savings are in the area of fuel, water and landfill, all of
which have risen sharply in cost in the last few years as a result of
increased taxation or government regulation.
It may be misleading, therefore, to infer that these savings have led to
higher profitability: they may only have offset higher costs.
Julie Hill, one of the authors of the report, says that she and her
colleagues were not concerned about why the companies acted the way they
did. What was important was the outcome: companies that operated less
wastefully.

FT  14 SEP 94 / People: Watmoughs plans its succession
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Patrick Walker is planning to hand over the reins at Watmoughs, the
Bradford-based printer, after almost 50 years with the company.
Watmoughs was founded in 1888, when it started publishing Fur and Feather, a
magazine for budgerigar, rabbit and guinea pig breeders. When Walker joined
as a cost clerk in 1948, the company was still a publishing operation with a
printer attached.
He became managing director in 1965 when the group was floated. By then, 65
per cent of the business was printing the catalogue for Empire Stores.
'Everyone said how clever we were,' he recalled yesterday. 'They would run a
mile now.'
Watmoughs is still the biggest UK printer of mail order catalogues, along
with newspaper supplements, tabloids and many other products. Walker, who
became chairman in 1977, has guided the group's strong growth into a company
with operations in Hungary and Spain and a turnover last year of almost
Pounds 150m.
He is relinquishing his role as chairman and chief executive in January to
become executive chairman until January 1997, when Declan Salter (left), who
has been promoted from md of Watmoughs, to joint managing director of the
group's UK operations, will become chief executive. David Burn, md of
Varnicoat, will be the other joint md until the changeover; he will continue
as a director until he retires in August 1998.
Walker will remain non-executive chairman throughout 1997 when he will
finally retire at the age of 66. He plans to devote a lot more time to his
interest in 18th century English furniture, and English and Italian
drawings.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Business and the Environment: Cruising into trouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MARTINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The highly visible problem of ugly waste dumped by cruise liners on idyllic
Caribbean islands is to be the subject of a report funded by the World Bank
and the United Nations.
Cruise liners carrying up to 3,000 passengers visit islands where they
expect to leave their rubbish as they cannot throw it overboard. Each
passenger generates an average 2kg of rubbish a day. After three days at sea
a liner of 1,500 berths could need to dispose of 9,000kg of rubbish.
As one member of the International Maritime Organisation puts it: 'These
ships turn up, the passengers all get off and buy one funny hat each and get
back on to the ship. Before leaving, the captain hands thousands of bags of
rubbish to the port authorities.'
Ship-generated waste is estimated at up to 30 per cent of a smaller island's
total waste for a year. But adequate reception facilities for such large
quantities of waste are hard to find in developing countries. Unsightly
rubbish on beautiful beaches is the result.
Last year the Caribbean was given special status under IMO pollution
convention. The designation imposes heavy restrictions on dumping of rubbish
from ships. The study, which starts this month, aims to come up with a
variety of solutions including landfills, adequate incineration and
better-equipped ships.
John Schrinner, special project officer based at the IMO, says that simply
raising charges for liners is not the solution, since most of the islands'
economy depends on tourism. 'The cruise industry is very competitive and a
situation where ports are simply undercutting each other on reception
charges to win trade would not be ideal.'

FT  14 SEP 94 / People: Adding up the nuclear stocks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ross Chiese may have limited scope in his new job for using the acquisition
skills he has learnt at Hanson in the past 12 years.
But he believes the financial control techniques he has acquired at the
conglomerate should stand him in good stead at BNFL, the nuclear fuel
reprocessing company where he has started work as finance director. 'It is a
big ship to turn round,' he says. 'There is unsophisticated financial
information. The company is very successful technologically and
scientifically. But financial accountability needs improving fast or BNFL
will get left behind.'
Chiese, 44, is one of two recent appointments to the BNFL board; the other
is Alistair MacFarlane, vice chancellor of Heriot Watt University, as a
non-executive.
Chiese qualified as a chartered accountant in 1972 after attending school in
Harrow, Middlesex. His first job was with Ranks Hovis McDougall, where he
worked in a variety of accounting assignments before joining Hanson as a
financial controller.
He was promoted to deputy finance director in 1986 and dealt with many of
the company's acquisitions and subsequent disposals as well as being
responsible for financial control budgeting and capital expenditure
requirements.
His final Hanson job was assistant chief operating officer for the UK, which
also includes Hanson's interests in Australia and South Africa.

FT  14 SEP 94 / People: Sam Younger takes on the World
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC has recruited an insider, Sam Younger, 42, to head the BBC World
Service, its international radio service which is listened to by an
estimated 130m people each week.
Younger, who was promoted to director of broadcasting in February, takes
over as managing director on November 1. He succeeds BBC deputy
director-general Bob Phillis, who has been doing the job since April 1993.
David Witherow, 57, who has been the World Service's deputy managing
director since February 1989, is retiring at the end of the week.
The choice of Younger is likely to be well received by the staff of the
World Service who had been concerned that the BBC's new cost-conscious
management team might have insisted on appointing someone with more
commercial experience. Sam Younger comes from a well-connected family. His
father was a former Labour MP and big wheel in the Royal Institute of
Economic Affairs while his cousin, Royal Bank of Scotland chairman Lord
Younger, is a former Tory cabinet minister.
Educated at Westminster and New College, Oxford, Sam Younger was assistant
editor of Middle East International before joining BBC External Services, as
it was then called, as a talks writer in 1979.
Younger will combine the job of director of broadcasting with his new role
as managing director. He is being appointed to the BBC's board of management
and is also joining John Thomas and Nick Chapman, the managing directors of
Worldwide TV and Worldwide Publishing on the board of BBC Worldwide which is
chaired by Bob Phillis.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Business and the Environment: Rough waters predicted - Jane
Martinson reports on regulations sailing towards the shipping industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MARTINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chaos, jumble and madness are words used in the world's shipping industry to
describe the effect of environmental regulations.
As national governments and maritime organisations decide how to clean up
the oceans, much of the industry is unclear about new regulations heading
its way. Moreover, it is still disputing the effectiveness of pollution
regulations passed four years ago.
The US Oil Pollution Act, passed in 1990, was a direct result of the
grounding of the Exxon Valdez tanker the previous year. The law stipulates
that oil tankers sailing in US waters and built after 1990 have double
hulls. It imposes unlimited liability on shipowners showing gross
negligence.
Double hulls work on the principle that two layers of steel plating and a
cushion of air between them will provide more protection against oil spills
than one. But the effectiveness of the double-hull construction in
preventing major oil spills, which are usually caused by serious collision,
is questioned by many environmentalists as well as the industry itself.
From next July all ships which are 25 years or older will have to comply
with the double hull or similar requirements under regulations adopted by
the International Maritime Organisation, a UN-backed body which regulates
the world's shipping. New ship building orders have had to comply with the
IMO regulations since last year.
According to Michael Osborne, manager of the technical services department
of Shell International Shipping, double hulls 'can help reduce the pollution
from the many minor grounding and collision incidents which usually occur
within port limits when the ship is under pilotage and which have
contributed to the industry's poor image.'
Gerard Peet, Friends of the Earth International's representative at the IMO,
expresses qualified support for the design. He argues that while double
hulls afford some protection in minor accidents they do not prevent
accidents happening in the first place. He says it is unlikely that the
design would have prevented any of the major incidents that have had a
serious effect on the amount of oil pollution and caused much public alarm.
'I think double-hull designs will improve the situation - no one is arguing
that they are worse than single hulls - but they are certainly not the
complete answer. The real problem is not the design of tankers but the
quality of crews and implementation of international rules.'
This view is echoed by the IMO. Roger Kohn, the organisation's information
officer, says: 'The emphasis now is not on trying to deal with the
consequences of a major spill but in looking at the causes of the problem.'
The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation, an independent body
funded by the industry, says that although spills from major collisions and
groundings are responsible for a large percentage of the oil spilt in the
world, most spills result from routine operations such as loading and
discharging.
A number of regulations recently agreed by the IMO aim to improve the
management of ships, the training of staff and the checks on implementation.
From next July all ships more than five years old will be subjected to a
sort of shipping 'service'. Although the details are not yet clear, the
checks are likely to look for wear and tear that makes the ship both unsafe
and environmentally unsound.
A ruling to impose a management code on companies agreed earlier this year
will come into force in four years' time. The IMO is also looking at
updating training codes. A special implementation group has been set up to
encourage participating members to uphold the conventions they have signed.
The threat of continuing legislation and poor market conditions appear to
have sent the industry reeling. John Joyce, marine manager at the
International Chamber of Shipping, the London-based association of ship
owners, says: 'With all this regulatory focus on pollution not a word has
been said about freight rates and what anybody's going to do about that.'
Clarkson Research Studies, a leading broker, found in a survey last month
that daily operating costs for a 1970s-built Very Large Crude Carrier are
about Dollars 15,000. This compares with a new vessel costing Dollars 85m or
more and requiring an average of Dollars 35,000 per day operating costs. In
today's market, they do not earn enough to cover interest or depreciation.
Orders have suffered: a total of 38 VLCCs were delivered last year. Clarkson
estimates that at such low rates the existing fleet of tankers built before
1979 will not be replaced until 2003.
Martin Stopford, managing director of Clarkson Research, says: 'The attitude
is typically do nothing until doing nothing becomes too Much of a struggle
and then order a new ship if you possibly can.'
The situation could lead to the 'worst of all possible worlds' with ship
owners unable to pay for new ships and uneasy about repairing old ones
which, while perhaps solid, may be subject to punitive changes in
environmental legislation.
'Ship owners are not making enough money to replace existing ships and
aren't repairing them properly either. With punitive legislation hanging
over them a lot of owners are also adopting a wait-and-see attitude as they
don't know whether they are going to be legislated out of existence.'

FT  14 SEP 94 / Management: Why partnerships can pall - Adrian Michaels
finds companies sceptical about the value of collaborating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN MICHAELS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After decades as a minority practice pioneered by the likes of Marks &amp;
Spencer and International Business Machines, 'supply-chain partnerships'
between companies and their customer organisations are becoming commonplace.
About 40 per cent of companies in a new survey* already had customer or
supplier partnerships, and more than 90 per cent thought they were relevant
to them.
The study, by AT Kearney, a management consultancy, in collaboration with
the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, appears to
reinforce a picture created by many academics and even some consultants:
that harmony and companionship in supply chains and shared product
development are today's route to competitive advantage.
But most of the respondents to the survey are sceptical, and on several
counts. The researchers found no clear indication that companies in
partnerships acted significantly differently from those acting alone.
One pharmaceutical manufacturer in the survey said: 'They've got to give us
a lower price . . . That's the only reason we're doing it. It's not that we
want to be in partnership, we want to get the cost down.' An appliance
manufacturer observed: 'Getting your suppliers to share your market risk is
just a clever way of reducing your capital expenditure.', while another
judged: 'There is no such thing as a really nice customer.'
Partnerships in this sense seem more akin to those formed by Clint Eastwood
and Eli Wallach in spaghetti westerns - sleep with one eye open, or
preferably both.
The researchers found it was not easy for organisations to work together in
harmony on a long-term basis.
The study showed that partnerships suffer from an atmosphere of suspicion,
based on previous relationships where contracts have frequently been broken.
The result is an overwhelming reluctance to share vital financial
information. More than 50 per cent of respondents 'strongly disagreed' that
they exchanged detailed cost information with customers in the supply chain.
Especially infuriating to some companies in the consumer goods industry were
attempts by retailers to charge them for demand forecasts or sales data: 'If
customers are saying 'We want partnership', how can they charge for a
forecast . . . to actually make the business work between you?'
Although the exercise of power is clearly a sore point in partnerships,
examples cited by AT Kearney from other research show that there are gains
to be made for both sides from partnerships.
According to the consultancy, Motorola says it has worked closely with
suppliers in design and manufacturing to reduce material costs by 6 per
cent, while Fiat claims to have cut delivery cycle times. The report cites
the case of a manufacturer and retailer doubling sales of consumer products
in five years, almost eliminating inventory and cutting supply-chain costs
by 25 per cent. On the other side of the relationship, a supplier of
fastenings to, among others, IBM claims substantial business gains from
forging much closer partnerships with its customers and offering
much-improved field service.
One fundamental problem with partnerships is the lack of perceived shared
interests, according to Steve Young, an AT Kearney executive. Suppliers are
not usually exclusive, and may therefore be reluctant to share information.
Nor does either side tend to encourage exclusive relationships - the more
powerful wishes to avoid obligation, the less powerful is wary of
dependence. The answer, Young says, is 'earn trust, don't ask for it'.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Management: Merit in being a mentor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lorna Beckford believes that being a successful role model and mentor to
Veron Neale, a young Afro-Caribbean undergraduate, is a valuable two-way
process.
'It is important to demonstrate to young black people that they can be
successful in big companies. Conversely, I have enjoyed being a mentor to
Veron. Her questions sharpen my own thinking,' says Beckford, an equal
opportunities manager at British Telecommunications.
BT is one of a host of companies taking part in a pioneering scheme for
undergraduates developed by Norman McLean, careers adviser for African,
Caribbean and Asian students at the University of East London. It is a
unique post. Part of McLean's brief was to increase the success rate of
ethnic minority graduates in the job market.
Research by the Commission for Racial Equality has shown that black
graduates are twice as likely as their white peers to be unemployed after
graduating.
A priority for McLean was to establish better links with employers. McLean
says that many students may need a boost in confidence to encourage them to
apply for employers' graduate training schemes. 'Some students are the only
members of their families to have entered higher education and do not know
anybody in their own communities to whom they can go for guidance,' he says.
The mentor scheme provides a one-to-one relationship which allows students
to focus on their personal and professional needs. Being a mentor is a
serious undertaking and requires commitment, including spending up to half a
day every month for six months with the student.
Last year more than 100 mentors were recruited from 60 employers and McLean
is now recruiting employers for this year's scheme. In November he will
launch a nationwide programme involving seven universities and colleges.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Management: The point is to raise the game - Andrew Campbell
argues that detractors of strategic planning should focus on the execution,
not the idea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   BY ANDREW CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last few months have brought a torrent of bad news for strategic
planning. Henry Mintzberg's polemic The Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning*
has been reinforced by a pamphlet from OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants which
concludes that 'the humane thing to do with most strategic planning
processes is to kill them off'. More recently, a research report by
America's Planning Forum states that only 25 per cent of companies consider
their planning processes to be effective.
Like Mintzberg, a Canadian professor who for 20 years has been one of the
most influential writers about strategy, we could conclude that managers
should stop this futile exercise and start doing something more useful with
their time.
Wrong. Strategic planning is not futile. Research at the Ashridge Strategic
Management Centre has shown that some companies - both conglomerates and
more focused groups - have strategic planning processes that add real value.
They include ABB, BTR, Emerson Electric and General Electric.
Large companies consist of a number of business units linked together by a
corporate hierarchy. This creates a number of planning tasks. Each business
unit needs a strategy of some sort to guide the actions of the business
managers. The corporation as a whole also needs some corporate-level
strategy to guide the actions of the corporate-level managers. Finally,
there should be some connection between the corporate-level strategy and the
business unit strategies.
No sane manager, not even Mintzberg, would argue that these tasks are
irrelevant. What is being debated is the effectiveness of planning processes
as a mechanism for executing them.
Mintzberg would argue that the nature of strategy development makes it an
inappropriate topic for structured planning processes. Strategy should be
crafted around insights and discoveries using experiments and learning
processes, not planning documents and formal presentations.
So why do some companies have great planning processes? The reason is that
these processes are not designed to develop corporate-level strategy or to
develop the business unit strategies, they are designed to enable the
corporate-level managers to influence the strategies that have been
developed by business unit managers.
Possibly the best documented example is the planning process at Emerson, a
US company which is much admired for its management style and techniques.
The envy of most planners for its effectiveness and status with management,
Emerson's process is described, both by division managers and corporate
centre executives, as the heart of the company's management philosophy. It
involves large amounts of analysis, hefty documentation (with 70 required
charts) and day-long review meetings. Superficially, it appears to have all
the hallmarks of a bureaucracy out of control.
The process works because corporate managers have discovered that it is
possible to raise the performance of certain types of electrical product
businesses by influencing the managers in certain ways. For instance, the
margins of a newly acquired business can be improved from around 10 per cent
to around 15 per cent not only by focusing on more profitable products, but
also by benchmarking costs against best practice. Market share can be
improved by unusually precise choice of segments. As a result, detailed
analyses are required of measures such as profitability by product and
market share by segment.
The day-long reviews are gruelling, often confrontational, events in which
Chuck Knight, Emerson's chief executive, pushes businesses to go for more
stretching targets, arguing his case based on the information they have
provided, work done by his planning staff and benchmarks from other
businesses, both within Emerson and outside.
The company's corporate-level strategy is about helping electrical and
electronic businesses to raise their game, and its strategic planning
process is designed to make it happen. Knight is clear about what he wants
to do. The planning process, which has been refined for more than 20 years,
is his mechanism for making it happen.
Contrast this with the average company. Each year the corporate centre
managers look at the business plans with no clear sense of how to react to
them. They probe and challenge to test the quality of these plans. They add
up the numbers and find a shortage of profit or cash. They then make some
arbitrary reduction in capital expenditure or increase in profit targets.
They hope each year that the round of discussions will give them greater
clarity about the corporate-level strategy, but each year they are
disappointed, and present to the board something that is little more than
the sum of the business strategies. As one manager commented: 'Each year I
go into the review fired up with new enthusiasm. Each year I come out
disillusioned.'
It is not surprising then that only 25 per cent of companies consider their
planning processes to be effective, and that consultants such as OC&amp;C
suggest these wheel-spinning processes should be killed off.
If your company has an unsatisfactory strategic planning process, it is not
because planning is an inappropriate activity. It is because the corporate
centre managers do not know what they are doing. The problem will not be
solved by tinkering with the forms, formats, timetables or attendance. It
will only be solved when the corporate centre develops a value-creating,
corporate-level strategy and builds the management processes needed to
implement it.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Recruitment: Academics get into the act - Career planning in
the changing organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Changing business structures have led to a surge in interest among companies
in career patterns. So much so that some 26 companies and public bodies have
subscribed to a UK-based research group called the Careers Research Forum,
established to investigate best practice in career development.
The organisations have each paid Pounds 6,000 to join the forum, which is
funding a two-year research programme by Prof David Guest of Birkbeck
College at the University of London. The CRF, structured as a limited
company, is run by an advisory council of academics and human resource
specialists.
The panel includes Prof Guest with Prof Peter Herriot director of research
at Sundridge Park, Andrew Mayo of ICL, Andrew Garner of Boyden
International, the executive search firm, Mike Haffenden of OEC,
consultants, and Simon Barrow and Andrew Lambert of People in Business, a
management consultancy.
The Forum says it was established in response to widespread discussion about
changing career patterns. Delayering, fewer voluntary departures and changes
in the use of consultants and outsourcing have all reduced the likelihood of
one-company careers, say CRF.
It adds: 'At the same time there is a rapid change of pace in all
organisations. With the advent of new markets, technologies and structures,
people are expected to do more and do better, yet with the prospect of
limited career progression and no guarantee of security.'
The Forum is holding a public conference at the Dorchester Hotel, London, on
November 16-17. Further details can be obtained from CRF at 071 336 7790.
Without wheels
Why do we persist with the company car as a form of reward? Companies have
become increasingly concerned about the cost of the company car yet,
according to the latest employee benefits report by the Reward Group, most
are afraid to withdraw them in case it hinders the recruitment and retention
of staff.
Perhaps the reason has more to do with basic human nature. The managers
responsible for company car policies tend to run company cars themselves and
few people want to give up something voluntarily.
What many companies have been doing is extending the life of their fleets.
Almost a third of those in the Reward survey had lengthened replacement
periods, typically by 12 months to four years, or by an additional 20,000
miles.
Other trends highlighted by the survey included harmonisation of benefits
for all employees - some 45 per cent of companies surveyed had policies to
harmonise benefits such as holiday entitlement, hours of work, overtime
rates and sick pay among all staff.
Reward says that a typical benefits package for a director of a large
company (those with turnovers between Pounds 25m and Pounds 200m) would
include a company car (provided to 63 per cent of the directors - with free
private mileage for 84 per cent), changed every three years or 80,000 miles,
free private health insurance (87 per cent) and 25 days a year holiday with
a working week of between 46 and 50 hours.
Global earnings
The answer to all those anxious people who regularly call the jobs column
looking for international prices and earnings comparisons has been delivered
by the Union Bank of Switzerland in its latest edition of Prices and
Earnings Around the Globe.
It is three years since UBS produced the last edition, but the latest
version has been worth the wait. It not only gives price comparisons on a
range of goods and services in 53 cities, but includes data on incomes and
earnings across a range of jobs.
Whereas secretaries in Geneva, Zurich, Luxembourg, Dusseldorf, and Tokyo
seldom earn less than Dollars 35,000 a year, their counterparts in Budapest,
Manila, Jakarta, Prague, Bombay, Lagos and Nairobi will earn a tenth of
that. The global average salary of a departmental manager is about Dollars
43,300 with the biggest salaries in Tokyo and the top Swiss, German and US
cities.
The graph (right) shows the average earnings in 53 cities from the weighted
hourly net wages of 12 occupations: primary school teachers, bus drivers,
car mechanics, building labourers, skilled industrial workers, bank clerks,
secretaries, women industrial workers, cooks, saleswomen, department
managers, and electrical or mechanical engineers.
Employees in Zurich, Geneva, Tokyo, Luxembourg, Chicago and New York have
the most take-home pay and those in Nairobi, Lagos, Bombay and Caracas get
the least.
The dark bars show net income, light bars net income and the figures on the
right show the taxes and social security deductions as a percentage of gross
income. The figures marked from 0-25 on the bottom line are US dollars.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Ashdown unveils team reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown yesterday announced a revamped parliamentary team as part
of the Liberal Democrats' campaign to combat Mr Tony Blair's revitalised
Labour party.
The revamp coincided with a stark warning from Mr Charles Kennedy, party
president, of the challenge facing the Liberal Democrats.
Mr Kennedy, who will step down at the annual conference in Brighton next
week, rejected claims that Mr Blair's election signaled the end of the
Liberal Democrats as a political force. But he said the party would have to
'keep raising our game' to keep pace with Labour and the Conservatives.
'I was originally in the Labour Party but I don't feel tempted back now and
I don't believe all this tosh about the arrival of Tony Blair meaning the
end of the Liberal Democrats,' Mr Kennedy writes in Parliament's House
Magazine.
Mr Ashdown's reshuffle is intended to make better use of the party's 23 MPs.
He has also set up a committee of senior MPs and party officials to improve
long-term planning.
Mr Alan Beith, the deputy leader, has been moved from the Treasury brief to
home affairs in place of Mr Robert Maclennan, who will take over as party
president.
Mr Beith, who is thought to have wanted to retain the Treasury role, has
been given a bigger organisational role as chairman of the weekly meeting of
MPs, traditionally chaired by the leader.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, previously trade, industry and employment spokesman, will
head the Treasury, economics and environment team.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Revenue urged to pay compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue should consider offering compensation to taxpayers it has
mistreated, its independent adjudicator said yesterday.
Ms Elizabeth Filkin, the Revenue adjudicator appointed last year, said she
had come across several cases where she felt reimbursing overpaid tax was
not a sufficient financial response to complaints.
She said the Revenue should make additional ex gratia payments to taxpayers.
She has made the recommendation to the Commons committee on the
parliamentary commissioner - or ombudsman - which is considering the idea
for all government departments.
Her remarks coincided with the publication of the adjudicator's first annual
report yesterday, which showed that two-thirds of complaints against the
Revenue investigated by the office had been upheld.
Of 105 complaints settled in the 11 months to March 31, 65 were wholly or
partly in favour of the complainant, 36 wholly in favour of the Revenue and
four were withdrawn.
About 60 per cent were resolved by mediation and most of the rest through
formal recommendations. In 29 cases the Revenue made repayments to the
taxpayer ranging from Pounds 25 to Pounds 10,937.
The most common concerns related to the repayment of tax. The largest number
of complaints were about mistakes, the use of discretion, the attitude of
Revenue staff and delays.
There were 308 complaints which had been taken up for full investigation
during the year. The office received 1,615 complaints, which Ms Filkin said
was substantially more than had been expected.
Ms Filkin said that many of the problems taxpayers had with the Revenue
related to the size and complexity of the tax system. She said tax officials
sometimes failed to appreciate 'just how confusing and indeed frightening'
the Revenue could seem.
She stressed that complaints were inevitable in such a large organisation
that deals with as many individuals as the Revenue does, and it had
responded well to her recommendations.
However, she highlighted a tendency for managers to support their staff
automatically rather than examining an issue objectively after a complaint.
A number of apologies were given only grudgingly after mistakes were
identified.
She said the decision to launch investigations was normally justified but
there was sometimes a 'stubborn' reluctance by officials to close their
inquiries even after adequate responses from taxpayers.
Ms Filkin said that in some cases the accountant advising a taxpayer had
made mistakes and then tried to blame the Revenue. She said this was
something the accountancy profession should examine.
The costs of the adjudicator's office were Pounds 596,000 in the first year.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Regulators criticised over competition role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Utility regulators concentrate too much on promoting competition and not
enough on the strategic development of the industries they regulate, a
think-tank close to the Labour party said yesterday.
The report from the Institute for Public Policy Research, says regulation
should aim to raise the international competitiveness of UK utilities and
their suppliers.
The government should set industrial policy objectives for each sector,
which the regulators should implement. At present they are inventing
industrial policies for the utilities they regulate, it says.
The report calls for individual industry regulators to be replaced by four
regulatory commissions covering energy, communications, transport and water.
The commissions should include representatives of stakeholders in the
industries such as customers, suppliers and employees.
They should operate much more openly, with accountability to parliament
through a new select committee.
Mr David Souter, head of research at the NCU telecommunications union and
one of the authors of the report, said yesterday that the promotion of
competition by regulators was a form of 'industrial policy by default'. He
called for an 'industrial policy by design' for utilities that affected the
quality of life of every citizen and provided the infrastructure on which
businesses depended.
He said: 'Competition won't deliver important public policy objectives such
as energy-efficiency and regional fairness.' A less adversarial relationship
was needed between regulators and the utilities.
Professor Michael Waterson of Warwick University, the other author, said
regulation by price-caps was reaching the end of its usefulness. It allowed
some utilities to pass on certain costs to the consumer, and was
inappropriate where companies were diversifying.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Bupa extends healthcare products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bupa, the UK's biggest private health insurer, is making its expected move
into the long-term health-related insurance market.
The main element of its new product range is permanent health insurance  -
providing a replacement income if a policyholder cannot work because of
ill-health - extended to cover long-term care in old age.
Both areas are expected to see strong growth in demand as government changes
in the welfare system increase the need to insure privately.
Sales of permanent health insurance are expected to be boosted by the
introduction of an incapacity benefit next April. This will have tighter
definitions of inability to work and will pay smaller amounts to some of
those who qualify for benefit.
The move will take advantage of the strength of Bupa's name in the field of
health-related insurance.
Research has found that when potential buyers of permanent health or
long-term care insurance were asked which company they would expect to buy
it from, Bupa was often mentioned even though it did not offer that type of
product.
PPP, Bupa's smaller rival with 28 per cent of the private medical insurance
market, has already set up a subsidiary to provide long-term care and
permanent health insurance.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Exchange may ease rules on Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange might soon relax its rules governing the listing of new
Lloyd's investment vehicles, according to professionals at the insurance
market. The change would make it possible for Lloyd's managing agents to
obtain a stock market listing for 'dedicated' funds, which would supply
capital exclusively to their own syndicates.
Lloyd's raised about Pounds 800m in capital last year from corporate
investors for the first time in its 300-year history. But at present all
corporate investment funds listed on the exchange are categorised as
investment trusts and do not need to show a three-year trading record.
Market sources suggest that the exchange is prepared to allow an immediate
listing for a dedicated vehicle if its syndicates have a three-year trading
record and the last three years' accounts have been signed off.
A financier in a corporate capital scheme said: 'There would appear to be
light at the end of the tunnel. There would appear to be an accommodation.'
Relaxation would be unlikely to trigger a surge of interest from investors.
Many Lloyd's investment trusts are trading at a discount to their net asset
value. But institutional investors in particular are unenthusiastic about
the market's prospects.
The market is widely expected to make a profit of about Pounds 800m to
Pounds 1bn for the 1993 underwriting year, the results for which will be
reported in 1996, bringing it into the black for the first time since 1987.
The chief executive of one agency, who has given up plans to raise dedicated
funds, said: 'We'd quite like a lot more capital but they are not queueing
up.'
Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, said last month that the market
could raise between Pounds 125m and Pounds 250m in corporate capital for the
1995 underwriting year.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Dairy court battle launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dairy Trade Federation yesterday started moves to mount a High Court
challenge to the deregulation of the milk distribution industry in England
and Wales.
The industry body is seeking judicial review of the establishment of Milk
Marque, a voluntary farmers' co-operative to succeed the Milk Marketing
Board. It alleges that the new body will create an unregulated monopoly
which will force up the price of milk and other dairy products.
The federation said it hoped the action would lead to new safeguards for
consumers.
The government has agreed that the assets of the Milk Marketing Board, which
has been responsible for milk distribution for the past 60 years, should be
transferred to Milk Marque, and is anxious that it should come into being
without any further delay.
Mr Gavin Strang, Labour's agriculture spokesman, yesterday called on the
government to halt the deregulation scheme. He said it would inflict 'real
and unnecessary damage' on the industry.
He urged Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, to protect the
consumer and the industry from price increases and job losses, 'all of which
are a direct result of the government's own actions'.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Getty plea on statue rejected
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A High Court judge yesterday ruled that Mr Stephen Dorrell, national
heritage secretary, did not act unfairly in allowing extra time for Pounds
7.6m to be raised to keep the sculpture The Three Graces in Britain.
Mr Justice Laws refused the California-based J Paul Getty Trust, which had
agreed to buy the statue, a judicial review of Mr Dorrell's decision.
The trust told the court sitting in Leeds that a fresh application would be
made to the Court of Appeal within seven days.
The Getty Trust had agreed to pay Pounds 7.6m for the Antonio Canova
sculpture. The government extended a deferral of a decision to grant an
export licence earlier this year to allow the Victoria and Albert Museum and
the National Galleries of Scotland to raise the money. On August 9 Mr
Dorrell allowed a further three months' delay.
The Getty Trust argued that Mr Dorrell had said the first delay of six
months was a final one and the delay should not have been extended, and that
Pounds 3.6m towards the purchase from the National Heritage Memorial Fund
was unlawful state aid under European Union rules.
The judge accepted the government's denial that it had assured the Getty
Museum in February that the six-month deferral would be final. He said Mr
Dorrell was entitled to give great weight to what he saw as the cultural
importance of the Graces, and he was reasonable to conclude that a British
offer was at that time within striking distance of matching that of the
Getty Trust.
The judge rejected the argument over state aid, as neither the V&amp;A nor the
National Galleries are commercial undertakings.
He awarded costs against the Getty Trust in respect of the case against the
secretary of state but said it should not pay the court costs of the
National Heritage Memorial Fund.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Building orders continue recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery in UK construction orders has continued during the summer but
the value of contracts has fallen from earlier in the year, figures
published yesterday by the Department of the Environment show.
The biggest year-on-year gains have been for private housing and private
industrial construction, suggesting that companies which have survived the
recession may be starting to invest again.
Construction companies have warned, however, that margins for general
construction remain deeply depressed in spite of a rise in orders - although
few companies are now taking lossmaking work simply to boost cashflow.
The contracting arms of Amec, John Laing, Wimpey, Costain and Taylor Woodrow
have between them earned operating profits of just Pounds 10m on turnover of
more than Pounds 1.7bn in the first half of this year.
According to the Department of the Environment the value of orders at
constant 1990 prices won by contractors in the three months to the end of
July was 7 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year.
Orders, however, were 3 per cent lower than in the previous three months.
Private industrial orders were 30 per cent higher than in May, June and July
last year although they were 12 per cent lower than in the previous three
months.
Private housing orders were 2 per cent higher than in the previous three
months but 23 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year.
The surge in housebuilding has increased sales and prices, and led to
temporary shortages of some building materials, including bricks and aerated
concrete blocks.
The continuing low profitability of general construction is in spite of a 3
per cent rise in UK construction output in the first half of this year
compared with the first six months of last year.
Mr Colin Parsons, chairman of Taylor Woodrow, yesterday warned that margins
were unlikely to rise much in the next 12 months. The company yesterday
announced a doubling of half-year profits to Pounds 22m, due mainly to a big
improvement in housebuilding profits.
The environment department said yesterday that private commercial orders had
declined by 11 per cent compared with the previous three months, and fallen
by 4 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year.
Infrastructure orders were unchanged on the previous three months, but 6 per
cent higher than last year.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Sex bias payouts found to have risen sevenfold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Payouts in sexual discrimination cases have risen sevenfold since a European
Court of Justice ruling removed the statutory limit, an independent pay
analyst says today.
The equal opportunities review published by Industrial Relations Services
says that the decision has forced employers to take equal-opportunities
issues more seriously.
The report says that even when the awards made against the Ministry of
Defence over pregnancy dismissal cases are excluded the figures still show
that awards made by industrial tribunals in cases of unlawful discrimination
have risen 45 per cent.
The average compensation award over the 10 months before the European court
decision in November was Pounds 3,044. Since the decision the average has
risen to Pounds 21,785, mainly because of the MoD awards. Without the MoD
awards, however, the rise was still significant, increasing to Pounds 4,328.
Average awards for injury to feelings also rose from Pounds 1,371 before the
European court ruling to Pounds 1,796 afterwards.
Mr Gary Bowker, co-editor of the review, said: 'There is now a clear
financial incentive for employers to take equal treatment seriously and
import the principles of equality law into their personnel decisions.'

FT  14 SEP 94 / Manufacturing productivity outstrips pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Productivity continues to rise sharply in manufacturing while pay awards
remain steady, damping inflationary fears which led to Monday's rise in
interest rates, the Confederation of British Industry says today.
However, the CBI's pay and productivity figures suggest that the prospects
for an increase in full-time employment continue to look poor.
Most City analysts expect today's unemployment figures to show a further
fall of between 10,000 and 15,000. But Mr Adrian Cooper, of the stockbroker
James Capel, said the annual 4.2 per cent rise in manufacturing productivity
in the second quarter, up from 4 per cent in the first quarter, showed that
companies might be shedding labour faster than before.
In the first quarter of this year the workforce shrank by 73,000, the
Department of Employment said. The second-quarter figures, released today,
could show some employment growth, however. The department's Labour Force
Survey for March to May, published last month, showed an increase in
part-time employment of 86,000 while full-time employment fell by 8,000.
The Employment Policy Institute, the independent think-tank, says in a
report today that the annual cost of unemployment is about Pounds 34bn -
equivalent to more than 5 per cent of GDP, or 10 pence on the basic rate of
income tax.
The CBI figures on pay and productivity were generally welcomed. The
annualised productivity rise of 4.2 per cent is nearly back to the peak of
early 1993, when employment was still falling sharply but output was
starting to rise.
Manufacturing pay rises remained unchanged at 2.7 per cent in the three
months to the end of June. Settlements in the service sector rose to 3.3 per
cent to the end of June, up from 3.2 per cent in the three months to the end
of May.
Mr Robbie Gilbert, CBI director of employment affairs, said: 'British
employers have done well in controlling costs during the recovery. But
standing still will not be good enough.'
Fewer than half of redundant miners in a survey have found jobs and those
now outside the industry have taken an average pay cut of more than Pounds
70 a week, Michael Smith writes.
The survey by Coalfield Communities Campaign, an association of coalfield
local authorities, found that 89 per cent of former miners were worse off.
Of 878 former miners at five pits closed since October 1992, about 56 per
cent had not found new work. Of those in work most were in factory or
warehouse jobs.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Irish government moves to maintain impetus on peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish government yesterday moved to maintain the momentum behind the
peace process after Monday's loyalist bomb attack in central Dublin and as
violence broke out yesterday in north Belfast, John Murray Brown writes.
Senior Dublin civil servants opened talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, in preparation for the all-party Forum for Peace and
Reconciliation which the republic hopes to convene before the end of
October. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, has pushed for an
early convening of the forum to commit Sinn Fein to the democratic process,
bolstering the moderates at the expense of hardliners after the IRA's
announcement of a cessation of hostilities.
Although Mr Reynolds has repeated his wish that unionist parties will join
the forum, both leading parties - the Official Ulster Unionists and the
Democratic Unionists - seem likely to decline. Unionist officials are
resentful about what they see as Dublin's attempt to steamroll the process.
Mr John Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, last night said unionists
should prepare for 'political battle' when the British and Irish governments
publish their framework document - which is expected next month - laying out
proposals for political progress.
Meanwhile, in north Belfast, vehicles were hijacked and shots fired after
violent clashes in the city's crown court. The trial of a Roman Catholic man
accused of the attempted murder of loyalist Mr Johnny Adair had to be
adjourned after fighting between supporters of the two men. Police moved a
crowd of 40 loyalists into the Crumlin Road. Trouble then spread to the
nearby Protestant Shankill Road and continued sporadically into the night.
In a separate incident last night, a Protestant man was shot in the leg on
the northern outskirts of Belfast.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Cask ales draw a wider clientele
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Traditional cask ales are taking a rising share of the declining UK beer
market by attracting a wider range of drinkers, particularly among young
consumers and women, says a report.
The annual report on the sector by Carlsberg-Tetley, the UK brewing joint
venture of Carlsberg and Allied-Lyons, says the sales volume of cask ales
rose 9 per cent in the year to January while total beer sales fell 2 per
cent.
Cask beers, which derive some of their qualities from secondary fermentation
in the casks, have been taking market share from pasteurised keg beers.
The cask share of draught beer sales has risen from 35 per cent in 1987 to
47 per cent in February. The keg share has fallen from 65 per cent to 53 per
cent.
Several factors have contributed to the growth of cask beers. The British
are drinking smaller volumes of beer but are increasingly willing to buy
premium products such as cask ales.
Wider availability of beers has also contributed. Publicans have stocked a
broader range since the government required breweries to reduce the number
of pubs they owned.
Pubs are also attracting a broader clientele by offering better food and
facilities. A growing number of families go to pubs for meals and special
occasions.
The report says women account for about 16 per cent of cask ale drinkers.

off yesterday, however, when Calor said that 90 per cent of the 363
employees had signed the new contracts.
In separate negotiations the company has revised its pay offer to 52 drivers
at Calor Transport, its haulage division.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Prison 'knew security was lax'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prison chiefs at Whitemoor prison, Cambridgeshire, knew that security was
lax in the special unit housing IRA prisoners four weeks before last week's
armed breakout attempt, the Prison Officers' Association said yesterday.
It said that a senior manager at the top-security prison wrote to officers
staffing the unit, warning that he was 'fully aware of serious breaches of
security'. The association said it had a copy of a letter dated August 9,
which referred to cash and cameras being smuggled in through an area where
the prisoners received visitors.
On Friday six prisoners, five of them convicted IRA terrorists, made an
escape attempt armed with two handguns.
Mr Derek Lewis, prison service director-general, said the letter was an
internal memo from a junior Whitemoor governor about general changes. It
would form part of the evidence submitted to the inquiry into the escape
attempt. In May last year the Prison Service had given instructions that
visitors to high-risk prisoners must be thoroughly searched.
The executive of the Scottish Prison Officers' Association yesterday called
for a series of 24-hour strikes after a ballot approved action by a majority
of nine. On a 69 per cent turnout 1,322 backed strike action, with 1,313
against. The dispute is over pay, market testing of the prison service and a
proposed shake-up of grading.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Childcare subsidy hopes dashed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes that the government might extend childcare payments to more parents
with young families diminished yesterday after a government minister called
for clear limits to state aid in this area.
Mr Alistair Burt, the social security minister with responsibility for the
Child Support Agency, delivered a robust defence of 'traditional' family
values but said that ministers 'believe it would be wrong to use taxpayers'
money to subsidise childcare costs for all parents'.
Mr Burt, speaking at a Glasgow conference on Families and the Future, said
that the Department of Health was already spending Pounds 2m in grant aid
this year to help voluntary organisations increase the amount of childcare
for the under-fives, and that there had been a steady growth in non-state
day-nursery provision by the private and voluntary sectors.
Last year the chancellor announced a new allowance available to people
receiving family credit who need to pay for childcare. But this has not
reduced the calls from parents' pressure groups calling for more childcare
allowances to help both single and married mothers take up employment.
Mr Burt insisted in his speech that the government 'does not take a view on
what the ideal family should be'. However, he said the ideal of the
'traditional' family was under pressure, noting that the number of lone
parents had increased from 150,000 in 1981 to 430,000 in 1991.
He added: 'Stability is important in a child's life, and stability is
provided by the strength of the parents' relationship.'

FT  14 SEP 94 / Labour raps NHS 'image-building'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly 150 health trusts set up by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health
secretary, spent an average of Pounds 200,000 each on new logos and
image-building, Labour said yesterday.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the 143 trusts set up in
the government's fourth round of health administration reforms spent a total
of Pounds 37m on start-up costs.
He said the total cost of setting up all four rounds of trusts was more than
Pounds 100m - enough to provide 120 modern health centres.
He said: 'Millions of pounds have been spent - with no obvious benefit in
most cases - on setting up the new trusts with their new logo and image. We
need to restore common sense to the NHS, so that patients again come before
image-building.'
Mr Blunkett said examples of image-building costs included the Pounds 25,000
spent by the Priority Healthcare Wearside NHS Trust on 'changing signposts,
stationery, (and) identity badges'. Portsmouth Healthcare NHS Trust was said
to have spent Pounds 10,000 on a logo and stationery in addition to Pounds
85,000 on internal and external signs.
Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, accused Mr Blunkett of making 'yet
another petty attack on a huge programme of reform which is delivering
vastly improved healthcare all round the country'. He said the 'one-off
investment' in setting up NHS trusts had enabled hundreds of thousands more
patients to receive operations.
Mr Alun Michaels, a Labour home affairs spokesman, launched the party's
Partners Against Crime programme, just days after Mr John Major unveiled the
government's Partnership Against Crime crusade.
Labour's plan involves a partnership between the police, local authorities
and business, backed by a statutory framework to give a high priority to
crime prevention. It would not increase the number of police.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Upturn leaves big companies richer in cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic upturn has left large companies increasingly cash rich as a
result of rising profits and a series of bond and share issues.
In large non-manufacturing companies liquid assets reached their highest
level for more than 15 years in June, according to official figures released
yesterday.
The findings are likely to boost City hopes that investment, which has
lagged well behind the rest of the economic recovery, may pick up later this
year.
The Confederation of British Industry warned, however, that concerns about
demand might still be depressing investment, in spite of the increasing
availability of internal company finance.
The Central Statistical Office said the liquidity ratio (current assets
maturing in less than a year as a share of liabilities that must be repaid
in less than a year) of large non-manufacturing companies at the end of June
rose to a seasonally adjusted 178 per cent, sharply up from the 134 per cent
of the previous June.
In manufacturing the level was 127 per cent. This was fractionally down on
three months before but well above the 97 per cent recorded at the end of
June last year.
Overall, the liquidity ratio of the UK's biggest companies was 147 per cent,
unchanged on the previous quarter, which was the highest ratio recorded
since the series started 10 years ago. The survey covers about
three-quarters of the total net assets of the industrial and commercial
sector.
The CSO said yesterday that the most important reason for the rise in
liquidity was that companies had made a series of bond and share issues in
recent months against a background of rising profits and repayments of their
bank debts.
Mr Leo Doyle, economist with brokers Kleinwort Benson, said: 'These figures
. . . show that companies can invest now without going into debt.'
However, Ms Kate Barker, economist at the CBI, said that although investment
was expected to pick up later this year, recent CBI surveys had indicated
that many big companies remained cautious on investment and employment.

FT  14 SEP 94 / London Underground signs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, Marble Arch. London Underground
believes there is money to be made from the name signs which adorn its
stations, Charles Batchelor writes.
Mr Mike Horne (above), London Underground commercial development manager,
displays some of the 10,000 redundant station signs that will be auctioned
on November 30 in what the company believes will be the biggest sale of its
kind.
Some of the signs date from the 1920s but others have fallen victim to more
recent station refurbishments. Some are battered veterans of life
underground while others have never been used and are in pristine condition.
So confident are London Underground and auctioneers Brooks of interest in
the collection of enamel, glass and aluminium signs that they have hired
Olympia, one of London's biggest exhibition halls, for the sale.
Mr Robert Brooks, chief executive, said: 'We have already been inundated
with calls from as far away as the US, Japan and Australia by people who had
got wind of the sale. We expect interest from rail enthusiasts, tourists,
and the owners of restaurants and theme parks. This is a chance to buy a
part of London's history.'
The sale will include some of the best-known station names on the Tube as
well as more prosaic indicators of the way to the Exit, the Ladies or the
Gentlemen.
The more popular and more unusual signs are expected to fetch several
hundred pounds each but even the less glamorous destinations such as Turnham
Green and Stamford Brook may attract interest from local residents. Football
enthusiasts may want to acquire signs to Arsenal or Wimbledon.
Mr Brooks said: 'People may want to own the sign of the station where they
first met their future husband or wife.'

FT  14 SEP 94 / Mining survey finds that fewer than half of redundant miners
have found jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fewer than half of redundant miners questioned for a survey have found jobs
and those now working outside the industry have taken taken an average pay
cut of more than Pounds 70 a week, Michael Smith writes.
The survey by Coalfield Communities Campaign, an all-party association of
coalfield local authorities, found that 89 per cent of former miners were
worse off.
Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the
report demonstrated the cost paid by miners for the government's failure to
back their industry.
A total of 878 former miners at five pits closed since October 1992
responded. This represented 30 per cent of questionnaires which were sent
out between December last year and April this year.
About 56 per cent had not found new work. Of those in work the largest
proportion were in factory or warehouse jobs.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Walker tells court he lied to police investigators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Walker, the former chairman and chief executive of the Brent
Walker property and leisure group, yesterday admitted in court that he had
lied to police investigating the company's finances.
Mr Walker, giving evidence at the Old Bailey in his defence, was being
questioned over his police interviews concerning Mr John Love, a former
business associate.
Cross-examined by Mr Peter Rook QC, for the prosecution, Mr Walker admitted
he had wrongly told police attached to the Serious Fraud Office that Mr Love
was not connected with the Walker family trusts.
Mr Rook responded: 'So you accept that was a lie?'
Mr Walker replied: 'If you want to put it in those terms, yes.'
Mr Rook: 'You are someone that lies to get himself out of difficult
situations?' Mr Walker: 'No. By that time I was very angry. I had got round
to the stage of not being very co-operative. I am sorry about that.
'I had done 30 hours plus with the Serious Fraud Office - very aggressive
questioning like you are doing to me now, Mr Rook.'
Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director,
are accused of fraudulently inflating the profits of Brent Walker by
devising bogus film rights transactions. They deny charges of theft, false
accounting and conspiring to falsify accounts.
The prosecution claims that after Mr Love's death, Mr Walker used his name
in the bogus transactions involving Universal Talent Management, a company
that was run by Mr John Quested, a former director of the Brent Walker film
division.
However, Mr Walker dismissed these suggestions as 'fairy tales'.
He also denied using KPMG Peat Marwick, Brent Walker's auditors, to mislead
the SFO about who ran UTM. During an internal investigation into allegations
of improper deals with UTM Mr Walker told the accountants that Mr Love ran
UTM. This had been the case, he told Mr Rook.
The trial continues today.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Inspectors attack 'narrow' work-based qualification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New work-based qualifications concentrate too much on narrow practical
skills and provide insufficient knowledge and understanding about the job,
inspectors from the Further Education Funding Council said yesterday.
This criticism came in a report on the national vocational qualifications
introduced into colleges and workplaces over the past few years. The
council, whose responsibilities include ensuring the quality of further
education in England, also said that there was little evidence that these
qualifications were meeting their objective of rationalising vocational
qualifications.
In some colleges, they said, 'there has been an increase in the number of
awards. For example, in some vocational areas NVQs are now offered alongside
traditional qualifications'. More worrying for the government will be the
criticisms of the qualifications themselves.
The inspectors said there was evidence of widespread misunderstanding of the
aim of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications, which developed
the NVQs, that knowledge and understanding should be integral elements of
competence to do a job.
Some lecturers and assessors, as well as employers and a few employees, had
expressed concern about trainees' understanding of the principles underlying
competence.
A study commissioned by the inspectorate in brickwork, business
administration and hairdressing compared the new qualifications with those
they replaced. The overall impression gained from the study was that NVQ
trainees would be better fitted to carry out immediately the practical tasks
required in a particular job, but less able to appreciate the job in its
context and to react to changing circumstances.
Dr Terry Melia, the Further Education's Funding Council's chief inspector,
said more attention should be devoted to core skills and underpinning
knowledge, while employers should become more involved in training and
assessment in the workplace if the qualifications were to have credibility.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Tory grassroots to press Clarke for tax cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rightwing Conservative MPs yesterday warned the chancellor that grassroots
members of the party wanted tax cuts soon, as Mr John Maples, party
vice-chairman, stressed that the Treasury had only ruled them out this year.
Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, said he thought there would be room
for tax cuts before the general election but also predicted further rises in
interest rates.
After the decision by the Treasury to rule out tax cuts this year Mr David
Shaw, vice-chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, said a number
of his colleagues would be pressing the case for small reductions in
taxation.
He said: 'It should be fairly evident to government ministers and those in
parliament that the party out there, as well as people in the country at
large, want to see some sort of down-payment on tax cuts and want them to
start soon.'
Another rightwing backbencher said: 'Mr Kenneth Clarke (the chancellor)
would do well to think again. We need tax cuts now.'
While the chancellor remains confident that he will be able to face down any
protests from the right over his decision not to reduce taxes, senior
backbenchers made it clear that the party would expect them to follow a
period of sustained growth.
Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs,
said: 'We have to get public expenditure under control first, which will
lead to a period of sustained growth.
'Then we will be in a strong position to cut taxes.'
Mr Lamont said: 'I think there will be room, given the improvement in our
finances, before the next election for some modest tax cuts.'
The chancellor had 'skilfully lowered expectations' by correctly indicating
that those cuts would not come this year.
He added: 'He has very wisely taken a medium-term view and taken steps that
will place the Conservative party in a very strong position in two years'
time.'
He urged backbench critics of the chancellor's stance to keep their nerve
and said the government's willingness to control inflation would enhance its
credibility.
Mr Lamont also predicted further interest rate rises - only 24 hours after
the Treasury announced a 0.5 per cent increase.
He told the BBC that he expected to see rates 'edging up' towards 7 per cent
in the next year.
His prediction is at odds with the comments of Mr Jeremy Hanley,
Conservative party chairman, who said he hoped there would be no further
increases in the cost of borrowing.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Railtrack lifts strike capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack said it had managed to open 59 per cent of the rail network
yesterday, an increase of 2 percentage points on the figure achieved last
week.
New sections of line to be opened in the 14th week of signal workers'
strikes included the stretch between Tonbridge and Edenbridge in Kent, that
between Preston and Burnley in Lancashire, and suburban routes north of
Glasgow.
Services between London and Gatwick airport were disrupted by a train
failure unrelated to the signalling dispute.
Railtrack has achieved considerable increases in the track mileage open for
services in recent weeks but the latest increase is the smallest for some
time. It has concentrated staff at the more modern signal boxes covering
large areas of track but is now faced with staffing its smaller manual
signalboxes which control only small stretches of track.
The outcome of a two-day inquiry by Railtrack into last week's derailment of
a commuter train at Bickley in Kent is expected to be announced today. The
joint inquiry is being carried out by Railtrack and South East Trains, part
of Network SouthEast.
Railtrack said initial indications were that neither the signalling
equipment nor signalling staff were at fault. The inquiry is looking at the
technical operation of the points, signals, the train's brakes and the
actions of the driver.
Meanwhile travellers in London still face the prospect of disruption to the
Underground with the rejection by the RMT transport union of a request by
London Underground to call off plans for a strike ballot. The RMT was
offered a 2.5 per cent rise to call off the ballot.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Mobile phone price fall expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prices of mobile phones for new digital networks are set to halve by the
end of the year, according to Nokia, the biggest manufacturer of handsets
for the UK market.
The biggest network operator, Vodafone, confirmed the Finnish supplier's
projection.
Mr Alex Mott, UK marketing manager for Nokia, said the price of the
company's most popular GSM (digital) handset was likely to fall from about
Pounds 300 to Pounds 150 by the year-end.
He said the reduction would come mainly from increased subsidies paid by
network operators to dealers in an attempt to encourage more subscribers to
join new GSM networks.
Vodafone expected digital mobile phones to retail at between Pounds 99 and
Pounds 199, with most of the reduction caused by increased payments it would
make to dealers.
Vodafone and Cellnet are anxious to encourage greater use of their new
digital networks to avoid overcrowding on older analogue networks.
At the end of June Vodafone had 1.3m subscribers to its analogue network,
but only 37,500 on its digital network, with high handset prices the main
barrier. Handsets for analogue networks retail for as little as Pounds 50.
Network operators already subsidise digital handsets by about Pounds 150
each, so new subsidies could mean handsets selling at one-third of cost
price.
Nokia's international mobile phone sales have grown threefold in each of the
past two years, and it expects the same increase this year. It is opening a
new factory in Finland and intends to expand its range of handsets.
The two new digital network operators, Orange and Mercury One-2-One, will
also be under pressure to cut handset prices. However, with lower call
tariffs and subscription charges than their rivals, they may do so more
slowly.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Charities' portfolio range set to widen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Charity Commissioners are considering widening the investment powers of
charities to allow the use of derivatives in managing charitable portfolios.
Derivatives are financial instruments, the value of which is based on an
underlying investment such as shares and bonds.
Mr Sanjay Sen, assistant commissioner, said the use of derivatives was one
aspect of a review on investment powers which was being undertaken by the
commissioners. They are likely to make their recommendations later this
year.
The review reflects the commissioners' policy of seeking to broaden the
investment powers of charities. Last month restrictions on investing
elsewhere in Europe were lifted.
At present the use of derivatives is confined to common investment funds,
which are pooled investment vehicles designed for charities. They work in
the same way as unit trusts but dividends can be reinvested gross.
The investable assets of charities, excluding property and cash, are
estimated at Pounds 25bn, but only about Pounds 4bn to Pounds 5bn is
invested in common investment funds.
The commissioners have consulted fund managers on the use of derivatives.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Big cable companies consider TV investment boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The biggest cable television companies are considering a significant
increase in investment in programmes - including the possibility of
launching between three and five new channels in the next two years.
The leading companies, including TeleWest, Nynex and Bell Cablemedia,
believe a wider range of material exclusive to cable may be necessary to
drive cable television subscriptions to higher levels.
The cable companies have invested Pounds 1.5bn in building cable networks in
the UK out of a total projected investment of Pounds 10bn.
The industry is now considering setting up a company to acquire rights to
programmes and events and perhaps create new channels. The company, with its
own chief executive and programme director, would function rather like a
small version of the ITV Network Centre, which commissions programmes for
the national ITV network.
Debate is continuing on whether the initiative should take the form of
making individual programmes or sports events available for individual cable
companies to show as they like, or through the provision of new channels.
Some senior cable executives would like to see new exclusive sports,
entertainment and even movie channels for cable.
There is likely to be a parallel increase in local and regional programming.
Apart from trying to increase the subscription rate - there are already more
than 730,000 subscribers to modern systems with 1m forecast for the end of
this year - the cable industry would like to become less dependent on
British Sky Broadcasting. BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial
Times, has a stake, is still the dominant provider of premium channels.
The cable industry recently bought the rights to the 1996 Rugby World Cup
and Channel One, a 24-hour news channel, launches in the London area later
this year.
TeleWest, the joint venture between US West and TCI of Denver, the biggest
cable operator in the US, is convinced of the need for better programming on
cable.
The company feels so strongly about the issue that it is likely to go ahead
on its own if an industry-wide initiative cannot be agreed and funded.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Algeria releases leading militants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Algerian government has released the country's top two fundamentalist
leaders from prison and put them under house arrest and freed three other
other leading Moslem militants in a conciliatory move aimed at defusing
growing political tension.
The two paramount leaders of the banned opposition Islamic Salvation Front
(FIS), Mr Abassi Madani and Mr Ali Benhadj were transferred yesterday from
the military prison in Blida, due south of Algiers to a residence where they
will remain, for the time being under house arrest.
In a further gesture of goodwill, the Algerian head of state, Gen Liamine
Zeroual had three prominent members of the FIS ruling council, Mr Noureddine
Chigara, Mr Abdelkader Omar and Mr Kamel Guemmazi set free.
Gen Zeroual's move comes two weeks after Mr Madani suggested, in a letter to
the head of state that the FIS might consider a truce. Gen Mohamed Betchine,
secretary general of the presidency and one of General Zeroual's most
trusted advisers met the imprisoned FIS leaders on two occasions, in Blida
prison, the week before last.
The spokesman for the exiled leadership of the FIS, Mr Rabah Kebir, said his
party 'was happy about the liberation of our leaders that we consider a
positive step but not a sufficient one. All FIS leaders must be set free,
notably Mr Abdelkader Hachani, the head of the party's executive at the time
of the elections of December 1991. This will allow all conditions necessary
for the start of dialogue.'
The FIS was outlawed in February 1992 after winning 47.3 per cent of the
vote in the first round of Algeria's first ever multi-party elections in
December 1991.
The conflict which has pitted the military backed government against the
supporters of fundamentalist Islam has, according to figures just released
by the Algerian presidency cost 10,000 lives and Dollars 2bn worth of
damage, most notably to schools, 329 of which have been destroyed.
In recent months the US, Italy and Spain have strongly urged Algerian
leaders to open a dialogue with those fundamentalists who rejected violence.
France's position however has been more ambivalent. While the French foreign
minister, Mr Alain Juppe admitted that the 'status quo was untenable' the
powerful minister of the interior Mr Charles Pasqua has been vocal in his
support for the Algerian regime.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Cairo hits new note on population: But whether pledges will
be kept remains open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any attempt to gather the world's nations and forge in clear language,
acceptable to all cultures, religions and traditions a 20-year programme for
government policies bearing on human beings' most intimate behaviour was
always going to be ambitious. But the International Conference on Population
and Development has, to the broad satisfaction of the vast majority of more
than 150 governments, managed to agree an international document which meets
this extraordinary goal.
There were reservations to words in the text from some Moslem countries and
the predictable objection of the Vatican and its staunchest Catholic allies
over abortion and related issues. But few in Cairo felt these had detracted
from the central thrust of the conference's document, which provides a
complex, and costly, global programme of action for stabilising world
population growth beyond the year 2000.
There is nothing new about the problem Cairo addressed. As the text's
preamble explains, the world's population will have risen from the present
5.6bn people to between 7.8bn and 12.5bn by 2050, according to low and high
variants of present UN projections. Only implementation of the text's
programme would keep population growth close to the low variant, it states.
What is new from Cairo ('revolutionary', according to some) is the shift in
emphasis in the means of stabilising population growth: away from a
mechanistic focus on sheer numbers and the simple provision of family
planning services towards a 'holistic' developmental attack on population
problems which places enhanced womens' rights at its core.
As the text puts it, the programme 'commits the international community to
quantitative goals in three areas that are mutually supporting', which it
states as 'education, especially for girls; infant, child and maternal
mortality reduction, and the provision of universal access to family
planning and reproductive health services'.
To the delight of the myriad womens' groups lobbying the conference, very
few states quibbled with the document's focus on the 'empowerment' of women,
even though such feminist language and the rights implicit in the term were
unfamiliar, even alien, to many states.
Far more contentious was the definition of 'reproductive and sexual health'.
For many Moslem countries this new concept was at first too laden with
connotations of licentiousness to be acceptable, and much of the
negotiations focused on stripping from this concept any offending
ambiguities while retaining what mostly western health professionals
considered to be a vital international definition of an essentially new area
of health care.
It was a shift, said one, from a focus on the 'plumbing' of reproduction to
a broader conception of maternal health and women's rights, along with an
acknowledgment of the 'pleasures sexual life can give'.
In the end, said one delegate, the Moslem participants 'totally understood'
the concept, and endorsed it. Indeed, western negotiators had nothing but
praise for their Moslem counterparts, notably Iran, Egypt and Pakistan,
which a European delegate called 'conscientious, trustworthy and informed'.
For the Vatican, and a handful of hard-line Roman Catholic states, however,
the concept of 'reproductive health' could be stripped of what, in their
view, amounted to endorsement of abortion. These countries stood alone,
since, despite pre-conference talk of an 'unholy alliance' between the
Vatican and some Moslem states, none took shape. Abortion in most Moslem
countries is, anyway, permitted when the mother's life is at risk.
The Holy See's chief intent in Cairo was to prevent the document from being
open to the interpretation that it enshrined a right to abortion. Its dogged
fight did at least succeed in keeping the issue at the centre of
negotiations all week, much to the chagrin of numerous developing countries
which had wanted the focus placed more firmly on the 'development' part of
the conference's title.
A whole week was spent anguishing over one paragraph (8:25), which stated
that while abortion should not be promoted as a method of family planning,
governments should nevertheless address it as an important health concern.
But Cairo closed with the Vatican's opponents claiming victory. As even one
Holy See delegate admitted ruefully, having had 30-40 states behind it
before the conference, it ended with just a handful of hardline allies.
Moreover, as Mr Nicolaas Biegman, Dutch ambassador to the UN put it: 'The
Vatican was not able to turn the spirit of the document, because its spirit
is individual choice and giving individuals the right to plan their families
in their own way, including with contraception'.
Whether such lofty concepts translate into action in the shanty-towns of Rio
or the slums of Cairo is the Dollars 17bn question - the sum the document
says must be devoted to reproductive health programmes worldwide in 2000,
rising to Dollars 21.7bn (Pounds 14.4bn) in 2015.
Donor countries such as the US, UK, Japan and others pledged more money at
the conference to such programmes, but the programme of action places the
burden of resources, some two-thirds of the total, on countries to provide
themselves. Whether this burden will be carried remains an open question,
particularly in the poorest countries where population growth is greatest.
But many at the conference argued that the nit-pickingly-argued language of
the document already would, in fact, make a difference.
According to Ms Susanne Rance, a member of the Bolivian delegation and head
of the Bolivian Reproductive Rights Committee, an internationally-agreed
text on 'reproductive rights' would provide a powerful shield for her own
non-governmental organisation and the Bolivian government against what she
said had been persistent attacks by the local Catholic church on their
family planning programmes.
'They had been arguing that our programmes were coercive. Now we can point
to the document and say these are fundamental health issues and
internationally backed,' she says.
Other delegates saw the worth of the conference in having simply forced more
than 150 countries to concentrate on their own population policies. 'It's
just bound to freshen every government's mind on the subject,' one Canadian
delegate said. 'That's achievement enough and had occurred before the thing
even opened.'
The effects of Cairo 94 cannot properly be assessed now, or perhaps until
the next UN population conference 10 years hence. One certainty is that the
world's population is set to grow by at least 90m a year until then. Whether
the Vatican's message will be so clearly heard then, above the millions of
new voices is perhaps less sure.

FT  14 SEP 94 / India economy expected to see 5% growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Indian economy is expected to grow by 5 per cent in the year to the end
of March 1995, thanks to a good monsoon and a revival in industrial
production, the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, said yesterday.
The RBI forecast, in its annual report was markedly more optimistic than at
any time since the country embarked on economic liberalisation in mid-1991.
It said that the flow of new issues in the capital markets and increases in
lending by long-term development banks indicated a jump in private
investment after three years of stagnation.
The report forecast growth in real terms of 3 per cent in agriculture, 7 per
cent in industrial output and 10 per cent in private investment. These
figures point to a considerable gain over last year when the economy grew by
just 3.8 per cent. But the forecast economic growth rate of 5 per cent is
still short of the 5.5 per cent achieved in the pre-reform 1980s and even
further behind the rates achieved by India's leading economic rivals,
including Indonesia and China.
The central bank warned that inflation, running at an annual rate of 9-10
per cent, had to be cut by 4 percentage points and urged the government to
reduce public borrowing by reforming taxation, improving expenditure
controls and phasing out subsidies, except for those aimed at the poor.
In a strongly-worded passage, the bank insisted the government had to reduce
its debts or else 'sharply rising interest payments could well crowd out
vital expenditures'. It said interest payments would this year swallow 53.4
per cent of government revenues, up from 39 per cent in 1990-91. The bank
urged the government to set 'a finite time horizon' on efforts to reduce
borrowing. It praised the government for reductions in the first few months
of 1994-95, due to a surge in tax revenues, but said more long-term efforts
were needed.
The bank estimated that the combined fiscal deficit for the central
government and state governments together in 1993-94 was 8.9 per cent of
GDP, up from 7 per cent the previous year. The figures compare with a figure
of 7.4 per cent for the central government alone.
The report also commented upon the recent increases in foreign exchange
reserves, fuelled mainly by a rapid rise of foreign exchange inflows due
principally to foreign portfolio investment.
A strike called in support of lower caste demands for job quotas in the
north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh yesterday passed off with sporadic
incidents of violence in which three people were killed and 250 injured.

Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres and PLO head Yassir Arafat agreed
yesterday on ways to speed up donations to Palestinian self-rule projects
and to put the thorny issue of Jerusalem on one side for the time being,
agencies report from Oslo.
'We have the peace process back on track,' Mr Bjoern Tore Godal, Norwegian
foreign minister said.
The agreement, signed after a concert honouring the peace breakthrough a
year ago, was expected to put to rest bickering over the status of
Jerusalem, even though the city is never mentioned by name in the final
draft. In a 14-point document the PLO agreed to stick by the declaration of
principles under which Jerusalem's status would not be discussed for two
years.
Palestinian negotiators in Paris last week demanded to use part of the money
for health and education programmes in East Jerusalem. Israel objected,
saying any issue on Jerusalem was off limits until 1996, under the peace
accord. The talks then stalled.

relations. The US is offering improved links in return for North Korea
accepting full international nuclear inspections and stopping its nuclear
programme.
The discussions in Pyongyang, which began on Saturday, have focused on
technical matters such as selecting a location for the US office in North
Korea. A decision on whether to proceed with the offices will come after the
US and North Korea resume high-level talks in Geneva on September 23 to

North Korea allowed International Atomic Energy Agency experts access to a

FT  14 SEP 94 / China posts Dollars 170m trade surplus

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China posted a Dollars 170m (Pounds 110m) trade surplus in August, the first
after more than a year of deficit, Chinese customs officials said yesterday.
The General Administration of Customs put the success down to the
elimination of the two-tiered foreign exchange system this year, according
to the official English language China Daily.
In January, China moved to a single currency by eliminating Foreign Exchange
Certificates (FEC), which were traded to foreigners in exchange for hard
currency at a rate of Yn5.8 to the US dollar. The regular currency traded at
Yn8.7 to the US dollar.
After three years of trade surpluses, China recorded a Dollars 12.18bn trade
deficit in 1993 as economic growth of 13 per cent fuelled imports of oil,
steel, machinery, aircraft, cars and electronic goods.
The government did not report exact figures for imports and exports in
August but said the Dollars 170m surplus was a marked improvement over the
Dollars 70m deficit of July and reflected new momentum in exports.
Government and western economists had not expected the currency switch to
forestall another trade deficit for China in 1994, because of rising prices
and a continuing economic boom, but customs officials reported that the
yuan's effective devaluation had made Chinese exports more competitive and
imports costlier.
For the first eight months of 1994 exports surged 31.5 per cent to Dollars
68.95bn and imports climbed 18.3 per cent to Dollars 68.85bn.
Total foreign trade volume rose 24.6 per cent to Dollars 137.8bn through
August.

A strike called in support of lower caste demands for job quotas in the
north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh yesterday passed off with sporadic
incidents of violence in which three people were killed and 250 injured.
Shops were closed in cities throughout the state and road and rail transport
was disrupted. But public offices and banks mostly stayed open, according to
reports from Lucknow, the state capital.
The strike was called by the Bahujan Samaj party and the Samajwadi party,
the state's ruling parties, which represent the lower castes and which came
to office last year promising to implement job quotas. Their attempts to put
the pledge into effect has provoked inter-caste violence which has
threatened to bring down the state government.
Violent incidents were reported from at least 10 different districts,
including the Hindu holy city of Varanasi (Benares) and the industrial
centre of Allahabad, where the police fired on demonstrators who charged
court buildings.
Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav, the chief minister, told a public meeting near the
city of Ghaziabad yesterday that job quotas would be implemented even at the
cost of the collapse of his government.

<TEXT>
Japan's leading banks will today raise their long-term prime lending rate,
the rate charged on loans to their most creditworthy customers, by 0.2
percentage points to 4.9 per cent, the second increase in little over a
month.
The decision, announced yesterday by 11 big commercial banks, reflects the
sharp rise in bond yields since the start of the year.
The yield on the government's 10-year benchmark bond has risen from 3.2 per
cent in January to 4.5 per cent this week as investors have grown
increasingly optimistic about the country's economic prospects, and more
fearful of resurgent inflation.
That improving confidence was reflected in figures published yesterday by
the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) that suggested the long
slump in capital spending may be ending.
Private-sector machinery orders, excluding orders for ships and from
electric power companies, declined by a seasonally-adjusted 5.8 per cent in
July from the previous month, to a total of Y895.4bn (Pounds 5.79bn). The
figure represents a rise of 2.6 per cent on July last year. But an EPA
spokesman said the longer-term trend suggested capital spending was on
course to rise 1.1 per cent in the current quarter compared with the
previous three months.
That optimistic assessment was supported by a Japan Development Bank survey
published yesterday showing companies expect their capital investment to
fall just 2.4 per cent in the year to March.

The six-day shutdown of Australia's ports ended yesterday, with maritime
union members agreeing to return to work after Canberra reversed its
decision not to sell Australian National Line.
The government had announced plans to privatise the business, but last month
declared 'it couldn't be given away'. This prompted union fears that it was
to be wound down, triggering the shutdown. Yesterday, the government said it
would put the line up for tender, subject to Australian Labor Party
approval.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Why Japan's Socialists had to drop their political baggage
of the 1940s: It is the latest step in erosion of the old political
structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's Socialists yesterday completed a belated high-speed turn to the
right, having taken just a few weeks to cover the same ideological ground as
their European counterparts did in decades.
Their conversion to the centre ground was perfected when the cabinet of
Socialist Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, a profound pacifist, agreed to
send troops, albeit lightly-armed ones, to help Rwandan refugees in Zaire.
This is the same man who only two years ago led his party in an 'ox-walk' on
the floor of parliament, waddling up to the ballot box at snails' pace to
delay a vote on sending troops to assist the UN in Cambodia, the first
overseas mission by Japan's military since the second world war.
The Social Democratic party's change in strategy was made official at an
extraordinary party convention two weeks ago, in which members dumped the
party's traditional insistence that Japan's military action was
unconstitutional, and abandoned the party's formal wish to tear up the
US-Japan security treaty.
It is the latest step in the erosion of the old structure of Japanese
politics over the past year. The immediate aim of the Socialists' about-turn
is to fit closer with the conservative Liberal Democratic party, the
government coalition's senior partner. The LDP was the SDP's adversary for
nearly 40 years until they joined forces at the end of June.
But irrespective of the exigencies of running a coalition with the
conservatives, the SDP's outdated policies had been overdue for change. Its
ideology had remained more or less the same since the 1947 administration of
Mr Tetsu Katayama, Japan's only Socialist prime minister until Mr Murayama
won power by uniting with his old foes, the LDP.
The SDP's pacifist anti-US formula has held decreasing interest for Japan's
electorate since the end of the Cold War. In Mr Katayama's day, the then
Japan Socialist Party had 143 seats in the lower house of parliament, down
to 136 by the turn of this decade. Last year's general election, in which
the LDP lost power, nearly halved the Socialists' parliamentary seats to a
mere 70.
Union membership has similarly slid, from 56 per cent of the workforce in
1949 to 24.4 per cent in 1992, well below European levels. Union leadership
has been thrown into turmoil by the recent resignation of Mr Akira
Yamagishi, founding father of Rengo, the union con-federation.
Yet the Japanese Socialists' transformation has been quite different to the
swing to the centre over the past decade by its European counterparts.
Unlike in Europe, social policy has played no part in the change.
Japan's SDP has always laid more emphasis on foreign and defence matters and
less on social policy than European socialists. The Socialists have never
taken the initiative in traditional left-wing subjects, such as social
policy, consumer affairs or environment. Social affairs have tended to be
the preserve of the LDP.
This may be because Japan's SDP, unlike the conservatives, lacks well-funded
think-tanks. Until becoming a member of the government a year ago, the SDP
did not need such things, because its leaders had become used to a
comfortable working relationship with the LDP during Japan's long period of
one-party conservative rule.
SDP and LDP politicians informally overcame differences in a little-known
parliamentary body, the oddly named 'counter-measures' committee. In this
forum the Socialists were able to push for important legislation on pensions
and medical insurance, adjusted and adopted by the LDP as its own.
So it is little surprise that the LDP is today taking the lead on the
biggest social issue facing Japan: how to provide for the growing number of
pensioners. Here, the SDP is following social policy of a kind by opposing
the finance ministry's plan for a rise in sales tax, designed to cope with
the 'grey wave' but also likely to hit the low-paid.
The LDP is sympathetic to the finance ministry line, that a rise in indirect
tax is needed to compensate for the fall in the income tax base caused by an
ageing population.
The tax debate shows that despite the abandonment of its other policies and
the disarray of the union movement, the SDP is not on the brink of
disintegration. 'The SDP is behaving like a sponge, just absorbing the
shocks,' says Mr Takashi Inoguchi, professor of politics at Tokyo
University.
Its other strength during the turmoils of the past year has been to maintain
the party's unity just enough to provide the swing votes that dictate the
balance of power.
The SDP made it possible for Mr Morihiro Hosokawa and his allies to put
together the first non-LDP government since 1955 last year. In June, the
Socialists' decision to ally with the LDP brought down the ensuing coalition
of Mr Tsutomu Hata.
Yesterday's evidence that the SDP is getting more capable of operating as a
government party means its odd marriage with the LDP may last longer than
first seemed likely. Analysts think the government may be able hold off the
next general election for a year or more. The SDP's success in throwing off
its old policies means Japanese politics may be passing from upheaval to
relative stability.

<TEXT>
The vast majority of the world's governments yesterday ended nine gruelling
days' negotiations by endorsing a far-reaching global programme to stabilise
population growth into the next century which places enhanced womens' rights
at its heart.
The Vatican and a core of hardline Roman Catholic states said they could not
embrace critical parts of the International Conference on Population and
Development's 113-page final document bearing on abortion and other issues
anathema to Roman Catholicism. Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Malta and the
Dominican Republic joined the Holy See in its reservations.
In a statement to the closing plenary, Archbishop Renato Martino, head of
the Vatican delegation, said the Holy See wished 'in some way to join the
consensus even if in an incomplete or partial manner,' but could not endorse
substantial parts of the text, particularly those governing abortion and
those 'seen as accepting extra-marital sexual activities'.
'Nothing the Holy See has done in this consensus process should be
interpreted as an endorsement of concepts it cannot support for moral
reasons. Especially nothing is to be understood to imply that the Holy See
endorses abortion or has in any way changed its moral position concerning
abortion, or on contraceptives, or sterilisation or the use of condoms in
HIV AIDS prevention programmes.'
Several Moslem countries, including Iran, Libya, Algeria, Syria and
Afghanistan, stated reservations to parts of the final text, especially
references to 'reproductive health' services for 'individuals', holding such
language to endorse adolescent and extra-marital sex.
The document was greeted by womens' rights activists as a big advance on the
1974 and 1984 UN population conferences. 'I think we won a victory here,'
said Mrs Francis Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice, a US
lobby group.

FT  14 SEP 94 / US and N Korea talk in Pyongyang
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and North Korea yesterday ended what were described as 'serious and
co-operative' talks in Pyongyang about the establishment of liaison offices
as a first step to diplomatic relations.
The US is offering improved relations in return for North Korea accepting
full international nuclear inspections and a stop to its current nuclear
programme.
The discussions in Pyongyang, which began on Saturday, have focused on
technical matters such as selecting a location for the US office in North
Korea. But no details about the talks were disclosed in a short joint
statement.
A decision on whether to proceed with the liaison offices will come after
the US and North Korea resume high-level negotiations in Geneva on September
23 to settle the nuclear dispute.
North Korea offered several conciliatory gestures yesterday, indicating
satisfaction with talks with the US. It returned the remains of 14 US
soldiers killed during the Korean war and allowed International Atomic
Energy Agency experts access to a fuel fabrication plant and a fresh fuel
storage building they had previously been barred from.
The US and North Korea are also meeting in Berlin this week to discuss the
means to deprive Pyongyang of the ability to produce weapons-grade plutonium
from its nuclear programme.
The measures include converting the North's nuclear programme to safer
light-water reactors, providing alternative energy during the 10-year
conversion process, and the final disposal of plutonium-rich nuclear fuel
rods recently removed from the North's 5MW reactor.
One stumbling block to the successful outcome of the Berlin talks is the
North's insistence that the new light water reactors should be provided by
Russia, since it has had experience operating Soviet-designed reactors.
Instead, the US and South Korea want the North to accept US-designed
reactors being used by Seoul. South Korea has said it will refuse to finance
the bulk of the estimated Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) project unless its
companies are involved in the programme. Mr Robert Gallucci, the chief US
delegate to the Geneva talks, will arrive in Seoul today to discuss the
issue.

Japan's governing coalition of Socialists and conservatives yesterday
decided to send 470 soldiers to Zaire and Kenya, to help Rwandan refugees,
William Dawkins reports from Tokyo.
The three-month mission, to start on Saturday, is the third post-war use of
Japanese troops abroad since Japanese participation in United Nations
peacekeeping in Cambodia and Mozambique over the past two years.
Japan's African mission, in response to a request from the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees, coincides with the relaunch of its hesitant bid
to become a permanent member of the UN security council, the biggest test of
Japan's will to assume international responsibilities equal to its economic
weight.
A cabinet meeting yesterday gave Mr Yohei Kono, foreign minister, clearance
to voice Japan's wish for membership at a speech to the UN on September 27,
on condition that Japan does not use force on UN duties, in line with its
constitutional ban on using force to settle foreign disputes.

FT  14 SEP 94 / US readies at home and at sea to invade Haiti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US government yesterday took fresh steps to pave the way for an invasion
of Haiti. The defence department readied two aircraft-carriers for duty off
Haiti and sent its two most senior defence officials to Congress to try to
quell domestic opposition.
The military and media preparations are exciting speculation in Washington
that, after weeks of vacillation, the administration has reluctantly
committed itself to an invasion as early as next week, if the Haitian
military leaders do not step down within a few days.
President Bill Clinton will make a national televised address about his
Haiti policy on Thursday night, the White House announced late yesterday.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, has appeared frequently on
television in the past few days, explaining the reasons for an invasion and
giving US credibility worldwide as the primary justification.
Mr Anthony Lake, the president's national security adviser, yesterday echoed
Mr Christopher, saying: 'Our action in Haiti will send a message far beyond
our region.'
On the Senate floor, however, leading Republicans warned President Bill
Clinton against invading Haiti. 'It is time, Mr President, to put an end to
gunboat liberalism,' said Mr Dan Coats, a Republican on the Senate armed
services committee. 'There is no US national security interest at stake in
Haiti and there is no reason to risk even one American life.'
The strident attacks followed a letter to the Democratic congressional
leaders, from prominent Republicans in the House and the Senate on Monday,
demanding 'an immediate opportunity to debate and vote on a resolution
authorising the employment of US armed forces in Haiti'.
Mr Thomas Foley, Speaker of the House, yesterday said: 'It is possible there
will be a vote - next week at the earliest.'
However, the administration is understood to oppose a vote for fear of
finding its foreign policy stymied by overwhelming opposition in Congress.
Instead, it intends to explain the reasons and plans for an invasion so as
to win, if not the support, at least the acquiescence of Republican leaders.
Mr William Perry, defence secretary, and Gen John Shalikashvili, chairman of
the joint chiefs of staff, have gone to the offices of Senator Bob Dole, the
Republican minority leader in the Senate, for closed talks on the
prospective military operation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Susana Higuchi, wife of President Alberto Fujimori and in recent weeks
his most outspoken critic, has announced that she will run as an opposition
candidate for the presidency of Peru in the election due next April.
Her decision - which Peruvians were half-wanting, half-dreading - follows
six weeks of public feuding by the presidential pair. It will polarise the
national political scene.
Many Peruvians also fear it will cloud their country's rapidly improving
international image with the spectre of instability.
Announcing both her candidacy and the formation of a new political movement
 -Harmony Twenty-first Century - Ms Higuchi firmly rejected that
interpretation.
'When I see so much corruption, so many broken pledges, I feel the moral
obligation to confront the closed circles of political power,' she said. 'I
will fulfil the commitments my husband assumed, but with the transparency
Peru deserves.'
Her husband and his ruling alliance may accuse her of disloyalty, but her
intention, she said, is to expose illegality, unconstitutionality and
corruption within the government, rather than to oppose policy.
In past weeks, Ms Higuchi has laid a series of allegations before state
prosecutors, denouncing various cabinet ministers for corruption.
The charges, she complains, have been shelved with only cursory
investigation. She also says her private telephone is constantly tapped and
that she is being prevented from seeing her four teenage children.
Although early opinion polls do not indicate much public support for Ms
Higuchi, her corruption allegations - if substantiated - could be damaging
to an administration which has vaunted its honesty and 'technocratic'
approach.
Besides, with Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, former UN secretary-general,
expected to announce his candidacy on September 23, what once looked to be
an easy ride to re-election for Mr Fujimori could be a tough campaign.
Mr Fujimori, exasperated at the transformation into political opponent of
his once-loyal wife, who was a linch-pin of his 1990 presidential campaign,
has stripped her of her official title of First Lady.
Ms Higuchi has now moved out of the government palace to camp in a
pre-university academy which she founded years ago with her husband. From
there, she will run the foundation for underprivileged children over which
she presides - and her campaign.
The Harmony political movement - the word 'party' is still taboo in Peru
thanks both to previous political crises and systematic vilification of the
party political system by Mr Fujimori - is, as yet, an unknown factor.
It seems to be rooted in a women's group with backing from several respected
feminist lawyers who have been helping Ms Higuchi to launch her political
career.
There remains a legal stumbling-block to a candidacy by Ms Higuchi, however.
For her to run, the national electoral board, which is supposed to be
independent, will have to quash a law, recently passed by the ruling
Fujimori alliance, which prohibits relatives of the president seeking
elective office in Peru.
Ms Higuchi claims the law is unconstitutional.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Two cheers for Venezuelan growth plan: Joseph Mann and
Stephen Fidler on reaction to a two-year economic reform programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Businessmen in Caracas expressed moderate optimism yesterday about a
two-year economic plan unveiled by the Venezuelan government this week, but
it was criticised by some as insufficiently ambitious and lacking detail.
The most common criticism surrounded the plan's lack of precision about how
the ambitious macroeconomic goals set for 1995 would be achieved and when
controls on prices and foreign exchange transactions would be dismantled.
The government said it would cut 1995 inflation to 25 per cent from this
year's projected 65 per cent mainly by eliminating a stubborn fiscal
deficit; achieve positive GDP growth in 1995 after two years of recession;
and obtain Dollars 3bn or more from privatisations this year and next.
It also indicated an intention to reform the system of employee severance
benefits, a hindrance to investment, and to raise domestic petrol prices,
probably in 1995.
Mr Jorge Redmond, president of Conindustria, an industrial association whose
members represent around 7,000 companies, called the plan 'a step in the
right direction' and said it contained 'all the points required for economic
recovery'. But he said: 'We still need to see the 'how' of the government
programme'.
Mr Francisco Vivancos, a professor of economics at the Andres Bello Catholic
University, called the plan 'a good first step' and an integrated approach
to the country's economic problems. There was, however, no 'explicit
definition' of policies covering the exchange rate of the Venezuelan bolivar
or exchange controls, and the role of an independent central bank was not
discussed.
He raised questions about the 'extreme emphasis' given to projected
government revenues, a lack of reference to public sector spending cuts, and
the 'moral risk' of refinancing the debt of troubled businesses rather than
linking state credits to successful companies that increase productivity.
Mr Carlos Rafael Silva, former minister of finance and ex-president of the
central bank, asserted said the plan addressed 'the major objectives of
economic policy', but worried that there was no 'reference to reducing
government spending'.
Analysts at Bear Stearns in New York said the plan 'fell short of the
ambitious overhaul that we might have hoped for.' There were 'encouraging
aspects' but the 'absence of concrete major reforms, combined with obstacles
the Venezuelan government is likely to encounter in trying to reach its
goals, leads us to stop short of upgrading our investment outlook for
equities.'
The Venezuelan government has decided to take full control of Banco
Consolidado, one of the country's largest commercial banks, and several of
its subsidiary companies.
Consolidado began receiving government financial assistance in early August.
The bank will remain open and will be run by government-appointed
executives.
The takeover means the government has taken over three of Venezuela's four
largest financial institutions since the banking crisis began earlier this
year. The government said Monday that 17 of the country's 50 banks remain in
critical condition.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Brazil to cut wide range of tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil is to lower import tariffs on up to 13,000 items, as part of the
government's efforts to fight inflation.
The tariff reductions were due to take effect from January 1, so as to
coincide with the opening of the Mercosur trade pact's customs union.
Instead, the government will lower tariffs now to stimulate imports and stop
domestic producers raising prices.
Brazil's maximum import tariff will fall from 35 per cent to 20 per cent,
once the measure takes effect, probably this week. The average tariff, which
has been falling since the country started opening its economy to
competition in 1990, will drop to 14 per cent, compared to about 20 per cent
two years ago.
According to the finance ministry, increased imports will help add to
domestic supply and avert bottlenecks in the economy. Since the new
Brazilian currency, the Real, was launched in July, inflation has fallen
sharply and led to an increase in consumer spending. Some economists are now
worried about possible shortages and price rises.
Higher imports will also add to demand for US dollars. The Real is linked to
the dollar but, since its launch, it has appreciated 15 per cent against the
US currency as investment has flowed into Brazil. This has mainly been
directed at the stock market, where investors are excited about the
prospects of the former finance minister Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso
winning the presidential election on October 3.
The Real's strength is starting to worry manufacturers, who say that exports
could suffer.
The main sectors affected by the tariff reductions include cars and consumer
goods. The government has not accepted calls for import quotas from Brazil's
car-makers, whose workers remained on strike yesterday over a pay claim.

Beaches near Havana, Cuba's capital, were deserted yesterday after the Cuban
authorities reimposed a ban on illegal departures under an immigration
accord agreed with the US on Friday.
'The fury seems to have passed,' an Interior Ministry police officer said at
a beach at Brisas del Mar, about 18 miles east of Havana. A few days before,
Brisas del Mar and Cojimar, another beach near Havana, had been crowded with
makeshift rafts and boats as hundreds of refugees set off north across the
Straits of Florida.
The Cuban authorities gave a 72-hour grace period ending midday yesterday
for would-be rafters to give up their attempts. The authorities said force
would be used after the deadline if necessary to halt illegal departures by
sea to the US.

FT  14 SEP 94 / US retail inflation up a modest 0.3%

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US retail inflation remained modest in August, encouraging Wall Street,
which had taken fright at last Friday's sharper than expected jump in
wholesale prices. The consumer price index rose by 0.3 per cent, the same as
in the previous two months. This compares with market forecasts of a 0.4 per
cent rise and the month's wholesale price rise of 0.6 per cent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 19.52 higher at 3,879.86, though the
bond market reaction was more restrained, with the 30-year long bond up
11/32 to yield 7.68 per cent.
The government also reported a widening of the trade and current account
deficits in the second quarter of the year. The shortfall on goods and
services rose to Dollars 27bn (Pounds 17.3bn) from Dollars 24.3bn in the
first three months, while the current account balance, which covers all
international transactions, was in the red by Dollars 37bn, against a
revised Dollars 32.3bn in the January-March period.
The merchandise trade deficit expanded to Dollars 41.8bn from Dollars 37bn,
reflecting the relative strength of the US economy against that of its
principal trading partners.
Exports did increase - to Dollars 122.7bn from Dollars 118bn - but less than
imports, which rose to Dollars 164.4bn from Dollars 155bn in the first
quarter. This was the largest quarterly deficit in six years.
The consumer price index now stands 2.9 per cent higher than in August last
year and has risen at an annual rate of the same amount in the first eight
months of this year.
The so-called 'core' index, which strips out the more volatile food and fuel
sectors, has also risen by 2.9 per cent in the two periods. Last year the
overall CPI went up by 2.7 per cent.
In August, as throughout the summer, the rise in international oil and
coffee prices were the main upward forces, with the energy component of the
index rising by 1.4 per cent and the cost of a gallon of petrol at the pump
going up by 3.7 per cent. The price of coffee, up 22 per cent in the month,
pushed the grocery index up by 0.6 per cent.
But this was counterbalanced by otherwise modest increases in the food
sector and by a 1 per cent drop in clothing prices. Some of the sharp rises
in the cost of meat recorded in the wholesale index are expected to work
their way through to the retail level, but the prospect of good harvests
should mitigate this impact on the index.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Narrow Quebecois win boosts markets

Canada's financial markets rose sharply yesterday as investors took heart
from the separatist Parti Quebecois' unexpectedly narrow victory in Monday's
elections in Quebec.
Although the PQ won 77 of the 125 seats in the National Assembly, it gained
only 44.7 per cent of the popular vote, against 44.3 per cent for the
outgoing Liberals.
Bond and currency markets were buoyed by pointers that many Quebeckers voted
on Monday for a change in government rather than for independence, and that
the PQ may have an uphill battle gaining a majority in a referendum to
decide whether the predominantly French-speaking province should remain part
of Canada.
The Bank of Canada intervened to slow the rise of the Canadian dollar, which
closed more than a full US cent up at 74.38.
Canada's commercial banks responded to the improved markets by cutting their
prime lending rate from 7.25 per cent to 7 per cent.
Recent opinion polls show that close to 60 per cent of Quebeckers oppose
outright independence. However, the PQ's leader, Mr Jacques Parizeau,
reiterated his determination to press ahead with a referendum next year.
The PQ has pledged to push a formal declaration through the Quebec
legislature expressing a desire to begin sovereignty negotiations with
Ottawa. It will also set up a commission to draw up an independence
constitution. In English-speaking Canada, Mr Bob Rae, premier of Ontario,
called for the referendum to be held as soon as possible.
The PQ, which held office from 1976 to 1985, failed to gain a mandate in a
referendum 14 years ago to negotiate a loose form of sovereignty for Quebec.
Mr Ghislain Dufour, head of the Quebec Patronat employers' organisation,
with more than 400 member companies, offered to co-operate with Mr Parizeau
but urged him to focus on jobs, social problems, public finance and high
taxes. 'We differ with the PQ on many issues and our offer of co-operation
excludes independence,' he said. 'Mr Parizeau must end the constitutional
uncertainty as soon as possible.'
Quebec's business leaders largely kept out of the election campaign, while
privately backing the Liberals.
They opposed Mr Parizeau's promises to the big unions, such as public
service job security, his high-spending policies and commitment to
separation. Now they are forming a detailed strategy to swing the expected
referendum against independence.
'The PQ has a mandate to govern but not to lead Quebec into independence,'
said Mr Michel Vennat, a lawyer-businessman and Counsel for Canadian Unity
chairman.
David Buchan reports from Paris: The French foreign ministry yesterday
reacted to the Parti Quebecois election victory by restating its carefully,
if inelegantly, worded policy of 'non-indifference and non-interference'
towards relations between Canada and the majority francophone province.

FT  14 SEP 94 / 'Two solitudes' separate further: Quebec Elections - Bernard
Simon on growing polarisation in post-election Quebec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canadians voted this week, for the second time in less than a year, to make
their country a more difficult place to govern. By sweeping the separatist
Parti Quebecois into office in a provincial election, Quebeckers have
reinforced polarisation between English and French-speaking Canadians, long
described as Canada's 'two solitudes', which began in last October's general
election.
Recession-weary voters broke with political tradition across the country
last year by virtually annihilating two of Canada's three national parties,
the Progressive Conservatives, which had held office for nine years, and the
left-leaning New Democrats. The third party, the Liberals, easily won the
election.
But the opposition benches in the federal Parliament are now filled with MPs
from two regional groupings: the Bloc Quebecois, which favours Quebec
independence, and the Reform Party, with its base in English-speaking
western Canada. Reform has little sympathy with bilingualism or Quebec's
'unique' status as an outpost of French language and culture.
Federalists took solace yesterday from the relatively narrow margin of the
PQ's victory in Quebec. Although it won 77 of the 125 seats in the National
Assembly, the PQ's share of the popular vote was only fractionally ahead of
the outgoing provincial Liberals. The separatists also won fewer seats on
Monday than when they first took office in 1976.
Mr Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister, expressed a view likely to be
heard from many federalist quarters in the months ahead. 'Throughout the
election, the Parti Quebecois and its leader again and again stated that
this election was about a change of provincial government. Nothing else,' Mr
Chretien said. 'I am convinced that in the coming months Quebeckers will
once again demonstrate their profound attachment to being a full part of
Canada.'
The unexpectedly close result will undoubtedly complicate the PQ's drive
towards independence. The party's leader, Mr Jacques Parizeau, has promised
to hold a referendum on sovereignty some time in 1995. Even before the
election however, there were signs of division in the PQ's ranks about the
referendum strategy.
Mr Parizeau sounded a conciliatory note in his victory speech on Monday
night. But he also vowed to press ahead with the PQ's raison d'etre. 'In
1995, we will go before Quebeckers and ask them the question that will make
a people into a country,' Mr Parizeau said. 'We have begun a new chapter in
our history.' The PQ's drive to achieve that goal is likely to test Mr
Chretien's political skills to the limit.
The new government in Quebec will have several weapons to put federalists on
the defensive and win support for a 'Yes' vote in the referendum, if and
when it takes place.
Mr Parizeau plans to push a 'solemn declaration' through the National
Assembly within the next few weeks expressing Quebec's desire to start
negotiations with Ottawa on sovereignty. A committee will be set up to draft
a new constitution. The PQ is likely to press for recognition
internationally that Quebec is more than just one of Canada's 10 provinces.
At home, Mr Parizeau will lose no opportunity to point out the costs to
Quebec of overlapping federal and provincial jurisdictions, and of the slow,
often ineffectual, decision-making among the provinces.
He noted in the election campaign that the US, Canada and Mexico took only a
few years to draw up a North American free trade agreement, while Canada's
10 provinces have been unable to dismantle their non-tariff trade barriers
in 127 years of confederation.
The PQ can count on support from the 54-strong Bloc Quebecois contingent in
the Ottawa House of Commons. Mr Lucien Bouchard, a former Canadian
ambassador in Paris and now the BQ's leader, noted on Monday night that 'we
will now have two teams to demonstrate the cost of federalism.'
Political observers expect the Liberal government in Ottawa will do its best
to avoid a confrontation with the separatists for the next months. Instead,
it is expected to go ahead with initiatives - such as social security and
healthcare reform - which could demonstrate to Quebeckers that being part of
Canada has benefits as well as costs.
The problem is that the government cannot put Quebec at the top of its
agenda without running the risk of alienating the west. The Reform Party,
reflecting the views of many English-speaking westerners, takes the view
that it would be better for Quebec to leave than to give it special
treatment.
Mr Chretien is expected to maintain a relatively low profile in the run-up
to the referendum. His strongly federalist views and country-bumpkin image
have damaged his credibility in his native Quebec. Liberals are also acutely
aware that Mr Chretien needs to be seen as the entire country's prime
minister. Even before the Quebec election, the federalist forces had begun
casting around for a suitable person to lead them in the referendum.
The provincial Liberals' unexpectedly strong showing on Monday has boosted
the reputation of their leader, Mr Daniel Johnson, who took over as premier
only nine months ago. It would be surprising if Mr Pierre Trudeau, the
outspokenly federalist former prime minister, now in semi-retirement in
Montreal, did not intervene at some stage.
The man to watch however, is Mr Jean Charest, the youthful Quebecker who is
one of only two remaining Conservative MPs in the House of Commons. Mr
Charest, briefly deputy prime minister last year under the ill-fated
government of Ms Kim Campbell, is widely respected and some Liberals would
probably be willing to allow him to hold centre-stage. The risk is he could
revive the party.

FT  14 SEP 94 / EPA moves to review dioxin emission control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Environmental Protection Agency in the US yesterday came a step closer
to regulating emissions of dioxin. It opened public debate on a toxic
compound which it links with cancer, reproductive and immune disorders and
other health problems.
The federal agency released a review draft, confirming its 1985 findings on
the toxic dangers of dioxin, the chemical compound created by the combustion
of some types of waste, as well as by chlorine bleaching of pulp and paper.
After 120 days of the EPA taking comments, the issue of dioxin emission
control will go for a review which could shape new rules. These could be
ready by September 1995.
Vietnam war veterans said that the report should clear the way to more
compensation for ex-soldiers exposed to the chemical compound Agent Orange.
Retired Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, head of a US veterans' committee on the issue,
said in Hanoi yesterday he would ask President Bill Clinton and
congressional committees to provide more funds for research on effects of
dioxin.
The EPA study is likely to provoke a response from industries dealing with
medical and municipal waste, as well as paper producers. Dr Lynn Goldman,
EPA assistant administrator for prevention, pesticides and toxics, stressed
the agency's willingness 'to build a broad scientific consensus on dioxin's
toxic effects'.
The report finds 'the highly toxic compound  .. a proven animal carcinogen
and a probable human carcinogen', but the agency does not intend to act
immediately on its findings. It is to decide appropriate measures in the
light of reaction by industry and science.
According to the draft study, waste combustion accounts for about 95 per
cent of all known emissions. Most of this is from medical and municipal
waste incineration.

Mr Ghislain Dufour, head of the Quebec Patronat employers' organisation,
with more than 400 member companies, yesterday offered to co-operate with
Parti Quebecois leader Mr Jacques Parizeau, but urged him to focus on jobs,
social problems, public finance and high taxes.
'We differ with the PQ on many issues and our offer of co-operation excludes
independence,' he said. 'Mr Parizeau must end the constitutional uncertainty

Quebec's business leaders largely kept out of the election campaign, while
privately backing Mr Daniel Johnson's Liberals.
They opposed Mr Parizeau's promises to the big unions, such as public
service job security, his high-spending policies and commitment to
separation. Now they are forming a detailed strategy to swing the expected
referendum against independence .
Many business leaders yesterday urged the new Quebec government to put the
economy first and get the referendum over as soon as possible.
Mr Peter White, chairman of the Canadian arm of Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger
publishing empire, said: 'They must work on the recovery and
competitiveness. The election results require them to put an honest question
in a referendum within 10 months.'
'The PQ has a mandate to govern but not to lead Quebec into independence,'
said Mr Michel Vennat, a lawyer-businessman and Counsel for Canadian Unity
chairman. 'It must work with Ottawa and the other provinces and not isolate
itself.'
Mr John McCallum, the Royal Bank of Canada's chief economist, said the PQ
must co-operate with Canada or Montreal's economy would suffer.
Mr Robert Stewart, chairman of Scott Paper, with several mills, said it
would be 'very serious' if the PQ assumed it had won a mandate for
sovereignty.
David Buchan reports from Paris: The French foreign ministry yesterday
reacted to the Parti Quebecois election victory by restating its carefully,
if inelegantly, worded policy of 'non-indifference and non-interference'
towards relations between Canada and the majority francophone province.
Determined never to repeat General de Gaulle's incendiary call in 1967 of
'Vive le Quebec Libre,' France has since tried to avoid being seen to take
sides between the Canadian and Quebec governments. The foreign ministry
spokesman said yesterday Paris 'has followed the elections with interest'
but would not comment on the result.
France, he said, had 'a special historical as well as cultural relationship'
with Quebec, but at the same time intended to 'pursue the development of its
excellent relations' with Canada, whose government is headed at the moment
by a French Canadian, Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
Quebec is not the only Canadian province to belong to La Francophonie,
France's answer to the Commonwealth, which groups nearly 50 French-speaking
states or regions. New Brunswick, which unlike Quebec is officially
bilingual, also belongs.

<DATELINE>
   HANOI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US report saying dioxin is more likely to cause cancer than was previously
thought should trigger more compensation for veterans exposed to Agent
Orange in the Vietnam War, activists said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Hanoi.
Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, head of a veterans' committee on the issue, said in
Hanoi he would ask President Bill Clinton and congressional committees to
provide extra funds for research on effects of dioxin.
The report by the US Environmental Protection Agency, released in Washington
yesterday, strongly supported the veterans' cause, he added.
Admiral Zumwalt, the most senior wartime US commander to visit Vietnam since
the war, held talks last weekend with Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh and
former communist military commander General Vo Nguyen Giap, who masterminded
the US defeat.
Admiral Zumwalt, 73, carries special weight on the Agent Orange issue
because of intimate involvement with its use and impact. He ordered it
sprayed in southern Vietnam when he commanded US naval forces in Saigon in
1968-70, and became an activist for veterans after his son, a navy
lieutenant who had been exposed to the chemicals in Vietnam, died of cancer
in 1988.
His associate, Dr Arnold Schechter of New York State University in Syracuse,
said research in Vietnam was vital because it had the world's largest
contamination of dioxin.
'This report . . . concludes that dioxins are much more toxic in a number of
different ways than had been thought to be the case previously and it opens
up new areas for compensation,' he said.
The EPA said dioxin was a potential cause of illnesses other than cancer
even at very los levels. These include developmental, reproductive, hormonal
and immune system problems.
He called for stricter regulation of industries that emit dioxins.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Clinton calls for campaign 'to roll back tide of violence'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday signed into law the anti-crime bill that
finally passed both houses of Congress last month after a protracted and
partisan battle. The bill will provide federal money to help hire more
police officers, stiffen sentences for a variety of offences and tighten
controls on some assault guns.
But it also offers money for community development corporations,
improvements to city parks and recreation facilities and studies on sexual
assault on college campuses and 'battered women's syndrome'. 'Let us roll up
our sleeves and roll back this awful tide of violence,' Mr Clinton said in a
White House ceremony to mark the signing.
He called the bill 'a big step toward bringing the laws of our land back in
line with the values of our people'.
However, the legislation is expected to damage US efforts to comply with its
obligations under a number of international human rights conventions by
increasing prison overcrowding and by placing the US further outside
international norms for treatment of juvenile offenders.
The bill coincides with the publication yesterday of a compliance report for
the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, which the US
ratified in 1992, 15 years after it was first signed by President Jimmy
Carter and 26 years after its unanimous adoption by the United Nations.
In the preface to the report, Mr John Shattuck, assistant secretary of state
for human rights, acknowledges 'areas of concern' including police
brutality, the treatment of prisoners and the death penalty.
The US maintained a reservation to the covenant's ban on the execution of
juvenile offenders and joins only Bangladesh, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria and
Pakistan in continuing to apply the death penalty in some states for crimes
committed by juveniles.

FT  14 SEP 94 / World Trade News: White House gives up fight for fast-track
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration yesterday abandoned its fight for 'fast-track'
authority to negotiate future trade pacts. It had been looking to pave the
way for next month's legislation, needed to implement the Uruguay Round
trade deal.
No announcement was expected, but a trade official said the administration
recognised approval of the authority by Congress 'is not going to happen'.
By granting fast-track authority, Congress promises to vote on trade
legislation without amendment.
The fast-track request has become so controversial that the administration
feared it would hinder passage of the Uruguay Round legislation and thus
jeopardise its approval by foreign governments.
The immediate purpose of the fast-track request was to open formal
negotiations with Chile, which is next in line, after Israel, Canada and
Mexico, for a free trade deal with the US. Informal talks have already
begun.
The administration had badly wanted fast-track authority for its Summit of
the Americas, a meeting with the leaders of the Latin American democracies
in December in Miami, and a meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Council
forum in December in Jakarta.
In recent days, officials have taken pains to point out negotiations on the
Uruguay Round were undertaken two years before Congress approved President
Ronald Reagan's fast-track request in 1988. They say they expect 'a full
debate' next year on President Clinton's request.
Some trade analysts believe Congress will never turn over to the executive
branch the kind of broad authority it has had in the past. Even the
fast-track proposed this year called for closer scrutiny of the
administration's moves.
Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the trade subcommittee, this week voiced one
of the dilemmas facing the administration on future trade deals. 'If we
begin talks and cannot agree, or if we reach agreements and cannot ratify
them, we do not return to the status quo. We slide back. We cause ill
feeling, we alienate one another, and it takes years to recover,' he said.
However, he warned, going too slowly may result in getting left behind.
'Brazil has already suggested going on to a South American free trade area.
We could find ourselves shut out if we don't keep up.'

FT  14 SEP 94 / World Trade News: EU tackles US-Japan trade ties - Guy de
Jonquieres on Brussels fears over concessions to Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union will seek concrete assurances from Tokyo this autumn that
Japan will not respond to US pressure on trade by favouring US exporters at
the expense of European producers.
Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, plans to stress his
concern about such discrimination at a long-delayed meeting on November 19
in Tokyo with a Japanese team led by Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the minister for
international trade and industry.
Though the EU has still to formulate specific demands, commission officials
in Brussels say Sir Leon is determined that the meeting agree practical
measures to ensure that any Japanese trade concessions to the US are also
extended to Europe.
'Sir Leon will be delivering a tacit ultimatum to the Japanese,' one
official said. He aims to underline the importance of the meeting by taking
with him several other senior commissioners.
At last weekend's Quad summit in Los Angeles, Sir Leon taxed Mr Hashimoto
with several cases where the EU believes Japan has accorded US suppliers
preferential treatment for political reasons.
He is worried that such practices may proliferate as Japan seeks to head off
the threat that the US will designate its trade practices as unfair at the
end of this month and initiate trade sanctions proceedings under its Super
301 legislation.
Among the instances of apparent discrimination cited by the EU are:
A sharp rise in the value of Japanese imports of US cars and car parts in
the first half of this year, while imports from Europe fell.
Japan Airlines' decision this year to buy Boeing 737-400 aircraft without
seriously considering the rival Airbus A320.
Japanese carriers' consistent failure to specify Rolls-Royce aero-engines
for their airline fleets.
Exemption of US medical equipment from inspection procedures still applied
to similar European exports.
Several European governments have expressed fears that their exporters may
be squeezed out of the Japanese market.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, recently wrote to Mr Tomichi
Murayama, his Japanese counterpart, demanding that Dassault be given equal
treatment with US companies in bidding to supply support aircraft to Japan's
self-defence agency. The November meeting will pose a test of Sir Leon's
policy of extracting trade concessions from Japan through patient
negotiation, in contrast to the noisily aggressive tactics and threats of
sanctions deployed by the US.
The meeting follows a rebuff by the US and Japan last spring of a proposal
by Sir Leon that they should expand their bilateral trade talks to include
the EU.
Since last year, EU and Japanese officials have met regularly to try to
identify and negotiate away obstacles in cases where internationally
successful European companies had difficulty penetrating the Japanese
market.
However, the only substantive results so far have been a relaxation of its
beer licensing rules and the establishment of joint industry groups to
discuss co-operation between European and Japanese manufacturers.
Successive Japanese governments have also resisted EU proposals for
ministerial-level trade talks.
It has taken a year since the idea was reluctantly accepted by Tokyo to set
up this November's meeting.
EU officials hope that, as well as securing Japanese commitments to equal
treatment of European exports, the meeting will expand regular bilateral
negotiations to a wider range of industry sectors and markets.

Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, yesterday placed the promotion of
British exports to Asia at the top of his agenda when he brought a
delegation of British businessmen to his meeting with Mr Chuan Leekpai, the
Thai prime minister, at the start of an Asian tour.
Britain is the biggest European investor in Thailand, but both Mr Hurd and
his entourage of chief executives acknowledged that UK manufacturers had
allowed Japan to dominate trade and investment with the region. They said
they would try to win contracts in the defence, telecommunications and civil
engineering sectors to redress the balance.
'Those of us who've been coming to Bangkok for some years are always
astounded by the progress,' said Mr Richard Turner, group marketing director
for Rolls Royce. 'I think that we in Britain have probably not paid enough
attention to it in the past.'
In his new role as midwife to British business contracts, Mr Hurd attended
the signing in Bangkok of an agreement between Balfour Beatty, the
construction arm of BICC, and Thailand's Sahaviriya group, to establish a
Pounds 3m (Dollars 4.65m) joint venture to bid for infrastructure projects
in Thailand and other Asian countries.
The construction of everything from road tunnels and airports to factories
and power stations in the region will be worth billions of dollars to such
companies in the next few years. A feasibility study is now underway for a
proposed rail link between Nong Khai in north-eastern Thailand and
Vientiane, the capital of Laos.
Mr Hurd also announced the establishment of the Thai-British Business Group,
a forum to bring together business executives from the two countries.
Although many companies from Britain and elsewhere in Europe have been slow
to take advantage of the rapid growth of south-east Asian economies, there
are signs of improvement. Last year UK exports to Thailand rose 38 per cent
to Pounds 660m, while imports from Thailand rose 20 per cent to Pounds 770m.
Mr Hurd noted that some Thai companies - including the Landmark group which
recently bought the Royal Lancaster Hotel in London - had invested in
Britain, and he urged Thai investors to follow Japan in looking at Britain
as a gateway to Europe.
Today Mr Hurd is scheduled to go to Vietnam.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Matra Transport, a unit of Matra-Hachette, is expected to appeal against a
court ruling which reversed an earlier judgment requiring the Taipei city
government to pay the French company NTDollars 1bn (Dollars 37m) in damages
over a mass transit construction dispute.
In a highly publicised fracas, a government-backed arbitration panel last
October awarded Matra the funds in compensation for extensive losses
incurred due to construction delays on the 11km Mucha Line of the city's
mass rapid transit system. Matra's contract for its section of the transit
system is estimated at nearly Dollars 300m.
The Taipei district court ruled on Monday that Matra had not followed
procedures as outlined in the contract in the event of a dispute. 'The main
reason the court invalidated the ruling was because Matra didn't follow its
contract with Taipei's department of rapid transit system (Dorts) before it
sought arbitration,' the court said.
Matra had originally sought NTDollars 2bn in damages from Dorts, which it
claimed was responsible for the delays.
Following the arbitration panel's ruling, Dorts filed a counter-suit.

FT  14 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Honda's UK output of Civic to double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Honda yesterday unveiled its new Civic small family car range for the
European market. Next year, this will lead the company to more than double
production, to around 100,000 cars a year at its UK assembly plant.
Mr Kazue Ito, president of Honda Motor Europe, said total investment at its
plant at Swindon, southern England, would rise to Pounds 700m (Dollars
1.1bn) by the late 1990s, with production capacity rising to more than
150,000 cars a year.
Honda was seeking to increase its annual European car sales to 300,000 a
year by the end of the decade from 164,576 last year, and a target of
200,000 in 1995. It aimed to raise its European market share from 1.4 per
cent to 2 per cent over the same period, and would increase its European
dealer network from 1,700 to 2,300 by 2000. Mr Ito said Honda was aiming to
produce around half the cars sold in Europe at its UK plant, with the
remainder imported from Japan and the US.
Around 500 jobs will be added at its UK plant by the late 1990s from the
level of 2,000 that will be reached by the end of this year.
The five-door Civic unveiled yesterday, which will compete with European
rivals such as the Ford Escort, the Volkswagen Golf and the Opel/Vauxhall
Astra, is the second car to be built by Honda in Europe following the launch
of the Accord at the end of 1992. Volume production of the Civic at Swindon
will begin next month, with the car going on sale in some parts of southern
Europe in December, in Germany in January and in the UK in March.
The Civic is the first step in an ambitious joint production programme with
Rover, the UK carmaker, which will launch a sister car, built under licence
from Honda, early next year, to replace the Rover 200/400 range. In the
European market, the Civic will replace the Honda Concerto, previously built
at Rover's plant at Longbridge, Birmingham.
Honda is aiming to sell around 60,000 of the Civics in Europe next year,
while output of the new Rover 400 range at Longbridge will total more than
200,000 a year.
The level of commonality between the Honda and Rover ranges will be around
70 per cent for the bulk of Rover's output, which use its own K-Series
engines, but will rise to more than 90 per cent for versions using Honda's
automatic transmission and 1.6 litre engine. Honda said yesterday that Rover
had been licensed to produce five- and four-door versions of the new range,
which will be Rover's most important volume car at its Longbridge plant. The
licence would run to the end of the year 2000, but an extension could be
negotiated.
The UK-built Honda Civic will have a local European content of more than 80
per cent, with Honda and Rover using a common network of more than 200
suppliers.
Mr Ito said the new Civic was 'the most important car' Honda had ever
launched in Europe and would be 'one of the foundations' of its future
expansion. The car is derived from the four-door Honda Domani launched in
Japan two years ago. Design and basic engineering was carried out in Japan
with some detailed development and testing carried out at Honda R&amp;D centres
in the UK and Germany.
Honda said it was achieving an assembly time for the larger Accord at its
Swindon plant of 12.5 hours per car.
The Japanese carmaker is negotiating with Rover, PSA Peugeot Citroen of
France and other European carmakers for the supply of diesel engines for its
European-built cars. It had no plans to produce diesel engines itself.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Claes favoured for top Nato post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister, has emerged as favourite to
become the next secretary-general of Nato.
Mr Claes, a Flemish Socialist who won plaudits for his forceful leadership
during last year's Belgian presidency of the EU, has secured broad support
among European allies.
The US has apparently tipped the balance by signalling it has no objection
to Mr Claes's bid to succeed Mr Manfred Worner, who died of cancer last
month. 'There is a feeling that he could grow in the job like Manfred
Worner,' said a Brussels diplomat.
A final decision is likely when EU foreign ministers meet their Canadian and
US counterparts at the UN general assembly in New York at the end of this
month.
Neither of the two other candidates - Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, a Norwegian
who is the UN mediator in former Yugoslavia, and Mr Hans van den Broek, the
European Commissioner for external political affairs - looks strong.
Mr van den Broek is said to be willing to step aside after the new Dutch
coalition government's decision this week not to oppose Mr Claes. He would
like to stay on in Brussels and has secured the Hague's support for holding
on to his current portfolio at the Commission.
Mr Stoltenberg's candidacy is trickier to handle. Until recently, Norway
thought it had an inside track on the job after it agreed to support
Germany's campaign to give Mr Worner a second term.
Rumours that Mr Claes's appointment could force Mr Karel van Miert to step
down as Belgium's EU Commissioner responsible for competition policy, were
dismissed in Brussels last night.
Mr Claes told Reuters last night: 'I have said I am interested ..but I am
not lobbying and it is in the interests of the credibility of the
organisation to have a serious consensus.'
Traditionally, the post of Nato secretary-general goes to a European, while
that of Supreme Allied Commander is reserved for an American.

Italian police have arrested over a dozen drug company representatives and
health officials, Reuter reports from Palermo. They are suspected of
systematically overcharging hospitals of some L1000bn (Pounds 412m) over the
past 10 years. Magistrates have warned another 120 people they face
investigation in the affair. The arrested officials included representatives
of Germany's Bayer and Boehring Mannheim and the US company Beckman
Instruments, along with Italian company Dasit.
The drug company officials are alleged to have leased equipment used for
blood testing and analysis to health departments almost free of charge in
return for being paid up to four times the going price for accompanying
chemicals and drugs. Palermo magistrates have sent out documents on the case
to other Italian cities so that colleagues can investigate whether there
have been similar incidents elsewhere.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Epidemics swamp ailing health system: Chrystia Freeland
finds grim prospects for the sick at Moscow's Municipal Hospital No. 32
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A young blond man in khaki army fatigues lovingly fondles a machine gun
under a sign which announces, in large, hastily scrawled block letters: 'The
Toilet Does Not Work'. This is the reception area of Moscow's Municipal
Hospital No 32, a stone's throw away from the sparkling, recently restored
White House, which is the seat of the Russian government.
Bleak conditions like these in state hospitals throughout the former Soviet
Union are the daily consequence of a health care crisis which has been
dramatically exposed this summer by outbreaks of cholera, diphtheria,
dysentery, anthrax and Siberian malignant anthrax.
These infectious diseases, which have sprung up everywhere from the
Leningrad region on Russia's north-western rim to cities on the Pacific
coast, have become so prevalent that one Moscow newspaper has created an
'epidemics' column, which informs readers of the day's newest sickness.
Some Russian doctors say that diseases long eliminated in the west have
always been prevalent in the Soviet Union but that in the past the Communist
regime suppressed news of outbreaks and swiftly imposed a quarantine on
infected regions. However, statistically, many parts of the former Soviet
Union appear to be suffering a health crisis on a scale normally seen only
in wartime. In Russia, Ukraine and Estonia the population is now shrinking,
with deaths outnumbering births in some regions by 2 to 1.
The shortcomings in Russia's health care system are apparent at Municipal
Hospital No 32, an average hospital in the heart of Moscow. Ten people are
crammed into each room and there is one bathroom for every 15 patients.
Dr Boris Storozhilov, the chief doctor at the hospital, says that part of
his hospital's malaise stems from the same fiscal squeeze which is
bedeviling Russia's entire economy. When their often delayed wages are paid,
the 12 doctors who care for the hospital's 170 patients earn 85,000 roubles
a month (about Dollars 39), nurses earn just 65,000 roubles a month (Dollars
30) and nurses' aides get (Dollars 18).
'Obviously, these are miserable salaries given the prices booming around
us,' Dr Storozhilov says. 'It is impossible for us to find new, young
employees at these rates. Everyone is throwing himself into commerce.' Dr
Storozhilov says that the hospital has only one tenth of the nurses' aides
it once employed and the staff shortage is so acute that doctors race
towards female visitors to the hospital with the hopeful question: 'You're
coming about the job?'
These 'miserable' wages are one reason why much of Russia's still nominally
state medical system is being privatised by stealth. Dr Storozhilov says
that 'because of the wild capitalism which is developing all around us and
the inability of doctors to do well in this new environment, some doctors
take money on the side from their patients for what they should be doing for
free.'
Hospital No. 32 is also suffering indirectly from the economic decline of
Russia's state sector. The federal government finances the hospital's
operating costs but in the past, typically in a country in which industry
and government were part of a single monolithic system, local factories
bought most of the equipment for the hospital.
'Now the factories are even poorer than we are,' Dr Storozhilov says. 'They
are working at half capacity and laying workers off, so our medical
equipment is rusting away.'
Dr Storozhilov has noticed another effect of the collapse of the state
factories whose employees his hospital treats. 'Today, sick people are
afraid to admit it, in case they get laid off,' Dr Storozhilov says. 'They
work until they drop and only then do they come in to the hospital.'
When they do arrive, many Russians are now too poor to follow the old Soviet
practice of bringing in food from home to supplement their bland hospital
diets. 'All the refrigerators on our wards, which used to be over-flowing,
are now empty,' Dr Storozhilov says.
But if, at Hospital No. 32, it is the worst of times for some Russians
things have never been better. About 10 per cent of Russians now buy private
medical insurance which gives them the right to be treated at the elite
Kremlin hospitals, whose state of the art facilities used to form the
'fourth administration' which ministered to the bodies of politburo members
and their families.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Mitterrand's 'clarification' adds to confusion: After 14
years in power, the man and his image are crumbling fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Think of all those between the ages of 15 and 20. Ever since they became
conscious of the political life of their country, all they have ever seen is
me.
Two months since saying this, and in the 14th year of his presidency,
President Francois Mitterrand and his image seem to be crumbling fast.
On Monday night, the French president underwent 90 minutes of questioning on
television, ostensibly to clarify comments he had made about his health and
his political past.
Yet, still, he raised more questions than he answered. This was probably
inevitable in the case of his health, given that the precise pace of Mr
Mitterrand's prostate cancer is unknown. But what he has done is plunge
French politicians into an early race to take his place in the Elysee next
May - or earlier.
The revelations could prove a setback for his own Socialist party - and
perhaps give a boost to the far right.
Immediate reactions to Mr Mitterrand's TV interview were mixed. Some praised
the president's courage in talking about his cancer, and his candour in
tracing his move from the political right to the left; from his pre-war
conservative upbringing eventually to socialism.
Others said they were moved, but used the word 'pathetic'.
Mr Rene Monory, the centrist president of the Senate who would take over as
interim head of state if the president died in office or resigned, said: 'I
was a little sorry to see the president explain himself in such a way . . .
it does not usually end this way'.
Others complained that Mr Mitterrand was over-stretching their credulity in
asserting that, when he went to work for the Vichy collaborationist
government in 1942, he knew nothing of the anti-semitic laws it had passed
in 1940; and that only in 1986 did he have cause to break off contact with
Mr Rene Bousquet, the ex-Vichy police chief. But even yesterday Mr
Mitterrand had a Jewish defender in Mr George Kiejman, his former justice
minister, who came to his aid against sharp criticism from Mr Serge
Klarsfeld, France's best-known Nazi hunter.
But much of the French right believes the left has walked into its own trap
in identifying itself so strongly with the resistance. Certainly, some
Socialists - though not those at the very top - were yesterday expressing
their 'disgust and bitterness' at Mr Mitterrand, and calling for 'a break
with Mitterrandism'. This is defined as a form of persistent 'ambiguity' in
personal and political relations.
The fact that this ambiguity seems to have persisted right into the
Mitterrand presidency appears most to upset the French Communist party,
which was only allowed by Stalin to enter the anti-German resistance after
1941.
In a new book on the president entitled 'The Right Hand of God', three
French journalists claim Mr Mitterrand has consistently sought to divide the
right by promoting and wooing Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front.
In 1982, they claim, President Mitterrand arranged for the NF to get
increased coverage on state television; and between the two rounds of the
1988 election, asked Mr Le Pen to swing his vote behind him rather than the
gaullist candidate, Mr Jacques Chirac. These claims are denied by close
Mitterrand associates. But it is true that the introduction of proportional
representation in the 1986 parliamentary elections, designed primarily to
minimise Socialist losses, had the side effect of helping the NF.
Yesterday a senior NF party official suggested that 'if Francois Mitterrand
was elected despite his real flirt with Vichy, then Jean-Marie Le Pen can be
elected despite his false image as a Vichyist'. This, too, stretches belief.
But it is likely that Mr Le Pen, who is due next Sunday to become the first
declared candidate for the 1995 presidential race, will try to turn Mr
Mitterrand's revelations to his own benefit.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur will try to keep his government
ticking over until early 1995 when he intends to announce his own
presidential candidacy, against, among others, that of Mr Chirac.
But the weekly cabinet meetings on Wednesdays, over which Mr Mitterrand
presides, will become even more curious affairs. The president will be
watching for divisions in the government which he might divulge publicly, as
he did last week to Le Figaro newspaper. Among his ministers, the rival
Balladur and Chirac clans will be on the lookout for any sign of increasing
presidential infirmity to send them to the hustings.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Berlusconi heads off unions' pensions protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, has temporarily headed off
a showdown with the powerful trades union movement over proposed cuts in the
generous state pensions scheme.
Cutting pension benefits is an essential element in the right wing
coalition's plans to reduce public sector spending in the 1995 budget. Over
the past eight days there has been a series of industrial stoppages
organised by angry trade unionists. This included yesterday's action at
Fiat's usually tranquil Mirafiori plant in Turin.
But after their first meeting on the issue yesterday with Mr Berlusconi, the
heads of the three main trades union confederations talked of having made a
'step forward'. Both Mr Berlusconi and the union leaders said it was
important first to establish the principles of how the system was to be
reformed, and then discuss the nature of the cuts.
This represents an important change in the government's approach. Until now
the emphasis has been on finding a specific sum of money from the cuts. The
Treasury has been pushing for cuts of over L8,000bn (Pounds 3.31bn) while
the labour ministry whose brief directly covers pensions, has suggested the
figure be held below L6,000bn.
'We must avoid a negotiation over how much money we are going to cut from
welfare payments and instead we must face up to how we are going to reform
the system in a way that is compatible with resolving the problem of our
public finances,' Mr Berlusconi said.
The two sides are due to meet again next Monday. In the meantime union
leaders will be meeting ministers discussing other aspects of the budget,
especially fiscal policy.
Mr Berlusconi's hands were slightly tied at yesterday's encounter. He had
hoped that a special 18-person commission set up in early August to examine
pension reform would have completed its report.
However, Monday's completion deadline slipped because commission members,
who included technicians and trades union representatives, failed to agree
on its contents. The report - or probably two separate reports - are now due
to be ready by next Monday.
The government is seeking to find up to L50,000bn through increased revenues
and spending cuts in the 1995 budget. The spending cuts account for two
thirds of this and a quarter of these are expected to come from welfare
payments and especially pensions.

opposition to co-operate more closely and form a consensus on key areas of
economic reform such as privatisation. In a state of the nation speech to
parliament, the president said Romania's international standing had improved
markedly in the past two years but parliament needed to become more
efficient and to provide foreign investors with further legal guarantees.
Several laws necessary for Romania's successful transition to a market
economy, such as bankruptcy and competition laws, are held up in a backlog
of legislation at the country's hung parliament, which is dominated by
nationalist and ex-communist parties supporting the president. Mr Iliescu
said the opposition, which controls 47 per cent of parliament, also bore
responsibility for leading the country forward. However, chances of an
agreement between the left-wing government and centre-right opposition
parties lessened last month following the inclusion of the country's leading
ultra-nationalist party in the cabinet.

Two officers from the Russian peacekeeping force in Georgia's breakaway
region of Abkhazia were killed and a third was wounded when gunmen fired on
their car on Monday night. The attackers fled. The officers were the first
victims among the Russian peacekeepers since the 3,000-strong force was
deployed in the region in July to monitor a fragile ceasefire and the return
of about 250,000 Georgian refugees. Russia's defence minister Pavel Grachev
said Moscow would apply 'the toughest sanctions' against the perpetrators.
Mr Grachev said he had sent his deputy, Colonel-General Georgy Kondratyev,
to Abkhazia to investigate. A press release issued by the Abkhazian
representive in Moscow blamed 'a Georgian sabotage group'. Abkhazian rebels,
supported unofficially by some Russian army officers and volunteers from the
Caucasus, drove Georgian government forces from the Black Sea region in a
bloody conflict last year. But no lasting settlement of the separatist
dispute has yet been signed.

Russian prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin has denied any presidential
aspirations of his own in the 1996 elections. 'Now is not the right time to
change president,' he said. He also warned of new political tensions this
winter, but ruled out further 'bloody upheavals'.
Speaking on German television, he voiced concern about future unemployment
and food supplies, but did not predict a repeat of last October's armed
rebellion. 'We have extremists who think their purpose in life is to
demonstrate and shout in the city squares,' Mr Chernomyrdin said, but
conveyed his 'belief in the Russian people'. He acknowledged that a recent
presidential anti-crime decree giving police greater powers against
organised crime was unconstitutional, but said it was essential under
current circumstances, 'even if it infringes the rules of our constitution'.

The president of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula lifted his blockade of
parliament yesterday but the two sides appeared to be far apart in resolving
a struggle over who is to run the pro-Russian region. After reopening the
parliament, President Yuri Meshkov announced that he had agreed to Ukrainian
President Leonid Kuchma's 'zero option' compromise of withdrawing the
decrees that closed down the parliament in return for the assembly
rescinding a law trimming the president's powers.
But members of parliament, locked out of their building for two days, are
still objecting to the zero option. 'I appeal to deputies to start talks
tomorrow. An agreement has been reached,' President Meshkov said in a
two-minute address to parliament. 'I am prepared to meet you to work out a
solution to the constitutional crisis.' He then walked out of the chamber,
giving deputies no chance to question him. President Meshkov issued decrees
on Sunday denouncing parliament as corrupt, suspending its activities,
calling for a new constitution and taking control of local radio and
television.

Italian police yesterday said they had broken up a criminal organisation
based in Bari capable of smuggling up to 5,000 illegal immigrants a month
into the country via the coastline of the Puglia region, on the Adriatic
coast. This is the largest immigration ring uncovered and highlights the
involvement of organised crime in this increasingly profitable business.
More than 20 people were arrested, including Italian nationals, Slavs and
North Africans. In addition to being charged with bringing people illegally
into Italy, they were accused of organising prostitution and providing false
documentation.
The Italian authorities are showing increasing concern over the import of
prostitutes. Prostitution has been one of the main activities unaffected by
the two-year-long recession. But with the economy beginning to recover, the
authorities are also anxious to cut-off a new flow of hopeful job seekers.
The main problem is Albania. During the summer more than 200 Albanians a
week are believed to have entered the country illegally via the Puglian
coast.

banking industry. 'This is the start of a new era of positive relationships
between management and workers,' said Mr Philip Jennings, FIET's general
secretary. The bank's management will be required to consult with its
employees across Europe on its business strategies, restructurings and
employment policy. Employees from 10 European Union countries (except

The pace of recovery in western Europe's new car market slowed for the
second successive month in August.
The 4.7 per cent sales increase over the same month last year compares with
monthly rises of up to 13 per cent in the first half of this year, according
to ACEA, the European automobile manufacturers association, Reuter reports
from Brussels.
However France, Spain and Scandinavia defied the trend. Registrations showed
the sharpest percentage gain in Denmark, where they rose 69.7 per cent, and
Spain, where they were up 34.5 per cent.
Britain had the most registrations with 452,600, a 2.8 per cent increase.
The worst performances were in Portugal, where registrations fell 11.9 per
cent; the Netherlands, down 8.9 per cent; Belgium and Luxembourg, down 4.7
per cent; and Germany, down 4.1 per cent.
Germany still had the second highest number of registrations, at 201,800,
followed by France with 147,500.
French registrations rose 18.8 per cent compared with a year earlier.
In separate figures, ACEA said Ford had the largest share of new
registrations with 14.7 per cent. Volkswagen was second with 12.7 per cent,
followed by General Motors at 12.6 per cent. Japanese manufacturers captured
12.5 per cent of the market, ACEA said.
Fiat had the largest percentage increase in registrations, up 22.1 per cent
from August 1993.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Russia may cut tax to curb vodka deaths
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL and DMITRI VOLKOV

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian officials are debating whether to reduce excise duties on domestic
vodka as part of an attempt to curb consumption of bootleg products and
low-quality imports which are believed to be responsible for a sharp rise in
deaths from alcohol poisoning.
According to industry representatives, domestic vodka producers have
experienced a 'catastrophic decline' in sales this year as their products
had been undercut by cheaper imports, especially from Germany and Poland,
and bootlegged alcohol, which evades taxes.
Fashionable high-quality western vodkas, such as Absolut and Smirnoff, have
also captured market share, and sales of these would also be hit if a change
to the duty system favours local producers. The government is considering
raising tariffs on imported liquors, as well as imposing quotas on alcohol
imports from other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States -
although this would run against the grain of recent trade talks.
Domestic vodka producers have called for a reduction in excise duty from 85
per cent to 75 per cent following a cut from 90 per cent earlier this year.
They argue that this would produce higher sales of legally produced liquor,
reducing the death rate from poisoning and increasing the government's
overall tax revenue. However, such a move would stimulate concerns about
total levels of alcohol consumption.
A report from the health ministry, presented yesterday to ministers at a
meeting of the commission on economic problems, estimated the death rate
from alcohol had almost doubled in a year.
The commission discussed means of tackling the problem - including lowering
excise duties to encourage drinkers to buy safer liquor from approved
producers - and promised to produce concrete solutions within 10 days. But
the finance ministry expressed anxiety that a lowering of excise duties
would damage budget revenues from alcohol, which account for a significant
proportion of the government's income.
According to health ministry figures, an average of seven to eight people
per 100,000 died from alcoholic poisoning between 1986-89. That had risen
sharply to 18 per 100,000 by 1992 but climbed to 37 per 100,000 in the first
half of 1994. In some regions in the northern territories the death rate has
been more than one in 1,000 this year.
The government is likely to order a crackdown on illegal manufacturers which
are producing lethal ethylene-based liquor. The government commission heard
that one illegal still in the Sverdlovsk region had produced 5m decalitres
of dangerous moonshine.

</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Higher telephone tariffs helped to push Spain's headline inflation rate up
by 0.6 per cent in August, but the annual consumer price index was unchanged
at 4.8 per cent. Underlying inflation, which excludes fresh food and energy,
rose by 0.4 per cent to lift the year-on-year rate to 4.5 per cent against
4.3 per cent in July. The figures reverse a falling inflation trend over the
past months and look certain to delay interest rate cuts forecast by the
economy minister last week. Registered unemployment was meanwhile reported
to have dropped by just under 30,000 last month to 2.5m, 16.3 per cent of
the labour force. The seasonally adjusted figure is estimated to have fallen
by 14,000, the biggest fall in August since the 1988-89.
Norway's August trade surplus fell sharply to NKr1.6bn from NKr5.7bn in July
and compared with NKr5.2bn a year ago. The decline was caused by a 22 per
cent drop in oil and gas exports because of summer field maintenance.
Switzerland's second quarter industrial production was 10 per cent higher
than in 1993.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Safety inspectors warn over rail services on strike days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Safety on the railways on strike days was called into question yesterday
with warnings from the Health and Safety Executive reminding operators of
their responsibilities to the public as the network faced its 18th day of
disruption.
The warnings, from the executive's railway inspectorate, came as the
Confederation of British Industry called for a law to compel unions to hold
'refresher' ballots of strikers in long-running disputes.
Two written and several oral warnings have been issued to Railtrack, which
runs the network's infrastructure, and other operators, it was disclosed.
The warnings are the first indication of concern in the inspectorate about
safety standards on strike days, when supervisory staff have been operating
signal boxes. They are the first stage of a formal procedure that could lead
to an order for closure of parts of the network.
The executive's concern was made known as Railtrack was expected today to
complete its inquiry into last week's derailment at Bickley in Kent.
The inspectorate said it had looked into about 100 allegations of unsafe
working practices since the strikes started. An official described the
warnings as a 'shot across the bows' of operators.
It found that 'the general level of safety' was being maintained on strike
days.
Railtrack denied that safety standards were being compromised. 'We would not
have people in signal boxes if they were not 100 per cent competent to
operate them safely,' it said.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT transport union's general secretary, said last night
the inspectorate's warnings confirmed his union's fears. 'This explodes the
claim made by Railtrack that the system has operated safely on strike days,'
he said.
The RMT is seeking a meeting with the inspectorate this week to discuss the
issue. Mr Lew Adams, general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers' union,
said he had expressed his concern about the 'constant stress' his members
were suffering during the dispute when he met Mr Brian Mawhinney, the
transport secretary, on Monday.
Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, who made the call for new
laws, said it was reasonable to ask whether a 'yes' vote in a ballot should
be interpreted as giving a union a right to call strikes indefinitely. 'I
wonder whether all those signallers who voted 'yes' did so on the assumption
they might still be in dispute three months later with no negotiation in
sight,' he said.
However, he rejected the suggestion that legislation should be introduced to
outlaw strikes in essential services. He also rejected the imposition of
binding arbitration, which he called a 'two-edged sword' that would deny
management the right to manage.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Forte fails to win control of Savoy but expands role:
Chairman announced in shake-up as company keeps independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rocco Forte won a role in the management of the Savoy hotel group
yesterday. But the prize of overall control - for which his family has
battled for 13 years - eluded him: the Savoy remains an independent company.
The board announced that the Savoy would have a new chairman in Sir Ewen
Fergusson, former British ambassador to France. He succeeds Sir Anthony
Tuke, who is retiring at the end of the year. The board said it would
appoint a new managing director to succeed Mr Giles Shepard, who resigned on
Monday. This is likely to be Mr Ramon Pajares, general manager of London's
Four Seasons hotel.
The board added that a chairman's committee would be set up to work with the
new managing director. It would include Sir Ewen; Mr Forte, who chairs the
Forte group; and Mr John Sinclair, who represents shareholding trusts
controlled by the family of Sir Hugh Wontner, Savoy president until his
death in 1992.
That is a success for Mr Forte, indicating acceptance that his group has a
legitimate interest in the Savoy's future. Forte owns 68 per cent of Savoy's
shares and 42 per cent of its votes. Nevertheless, Savoy loyalists such as
Sir Hugh and Mr Shepard had long regarded Forte as a cost-cutting group
unsuited to run such venerable properties as the Savoy, Claridge's and the
Connaught.
The Savoy announcement went on, however, to say: 'The board has been
informed that discussions between Forte and certain of the trusts which have
a significant interest in the share capital of the Savoy have terminated.'
That means that the trusts controlled by the Wontner family are no longer
thinking of aligning themselves with Forte to give the latter control. The
dual share structure set up by Sir Hugh in the 1950s to see off predators
such as Sir Charles Clore and Mr Harold Samuel, and which continues to
deprive Forte of overall control, remains in place.
The decisions followed months of acrimony and speculation. The Savoy board
gathered at 11.30 am to settle the group's future and by lunchtime had
finished after an apparently even-tempered gathering.
Forte, however, was putting a brave face on the outcome. It said it fully
associated itself with the words of Sir Anthony, who said: 'The board has a
common pur-pose which is to provide the highest-quality service for all our
customers at the same time as producing an adequate return for all our
shareholders.'
Under new management, the Savoy is likely to improve on its financial
performance of last year, when it made pre-tax profits of only Pounds
725,000 on turnover of Pounds 83.3m. It announces first-half 1994 profits
today. A better return might satisfy Forte.
'It's the end of the story,' one long-time participant in the struggle said
hopefully. On the other hand, it might prove difficult for Forte to abandon
an ambition of gaining full control.
Time is certainly on the Fortes' side. Mr Forte's father, Lord Forte, who
launched the takeover battle in 1981, is still going strong at the age of
85. Mr Forte is a youthful 49 - and his son Charles is not yet three.

      hts to bolster defences against takeovers.
1981: Forte launches hostile Pounds58m bid. It gains 68 per cent of
      shares but only 42 per cent of the vote.
1981-89: Forte campaigns to secure change in voting structure to
      enable it to obtain control of Savoy.
1989: Truce agreed. Forte appoints two directors to Savoy board;
      agrees not to increase its stake for five years. Campaign
      on voting structure continues.
1994: Mr Rocco Forte is appointed to Savoy's three-man
      chairman's committee. But dual share structure remains.
