FT  12 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Germans on a slippery slope
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Why is it that the richest country in Europe has suddenly fallen victim to
lottery fever? The odds against winning are 140m to one. Yet the Germans
have become obsessed to the point of frenzy with their lottery. Enthusiasm
has risen in tandem with the prize money, which multiplies in each
successive week that the jackpot fails to attract a winner. So contagious is
the disease that border crossing points have reportedly been jammed, as
Austrian and Dutch hopefuls have flooded in to join the domestic punters.
This behaviour seems at odds with the common perception of the Germans. Such
hard-working folk should surely frown on an intellectually undemanding form
of money making which is distinguished by a near-total divorce between
effort and reward. And while the phenomenon will cheer the organisers of the
forthcoming British national lottery, it can only give a headache to
academic theorists who seek to rationalise the behaviour of gamblers.
The fund-raising side of lottery economics poses few explanatory problems.
There is a clear correlation between lottery activity and government
deficits. In the days when church hostility to the payment of interest was
reflected in tough laws against usury, lotteries, like tontines and
annuities, constituted a politically correct form of state funding.
The museums of the Vatican were financed by lotteries. Benjamin Franklin
paid for canons for the city of Philadelphia in the same fashion. London
owed its 17th-century water supply and its 18th-century bridge at
Westminster to lotteries. Sydney Opera House could not have been built
without them.
Oddly uncreative
While governments continue to run lotteries, companies (and the wider
share-ownership movement) have become oddly uncreative in their use. If
Ladbroke's dividend were payable by way of lottery, its cost of capital
might be reduced; and the working-class customers of its betting shops who
have no trouble grasping the mathematics of four-horse accumulators might
take more readily to the share-owning democracy.
The difficulty comes on the behavioural side. Lotteries have historically
appealed to the poor, who spend a disproportionate share of their income on
gambling despite the long odds against them. This has prompted accusations
of fecklessness. A witness before a British select committee on gambling at
the turn of the century declared: 'If the betting craze goes unchecked, the
sober youth of Germany will take the reins of the commercial world.' Oh ho.
Murderous instincts
Prohibitions on gambling have often been justified in the name of protecting
the poor. France's revolutionary government put a stop to the Loterie Royale
in 1793 because it was seen as exploitative. Yet it was revived when it
emerged that the people were simply punting elsewhere. The instinct becomes
stronger when times are hard: the 1930s saw a tremendous gambling upsurge.
Freud speculated that men were unconsciously bent on losing money to
compensate for the guilt they felt over their murderous instincts towards
their fathers. Surveys established, more plausibly, that Catholics gambled
more than Protestants.
The most convincing explanation for this haphazardly rewarding working-class
behaviour is that it constitutes psychological insurance. For people whose
opportunities for advancement appear blocked, the lottery offers hope, as
well as fantasy and escape. But where does that leave the Germans? They are
rich, as well as being predominantly Protestant. The unemployment rate in
the west is lower than in Britain, France or Italy; and while the east is
clearly different, the frenzy is a pan-German phenomenon. Moreover, recent
research has established that a surprisingly high proportion of lottery
users in Germany are not down-at-heel workers, at risk of losing their jobs
and in need of hope, but civil servants. This, it seems, is their idea of
living dangerously.
Clearly we need a new behavioural theory, which the US campuses are well
equipped to provide. As for Germany, the question is whether economic
recovery will bring the country's sober youth back to earth.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Privatising British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The lengthy and painful saga of British Coal enters its closing chapter on
Wednesday, when bidders make their tenders to buy the state-owned company.
All that remains is for the government to ensure it gets the highest
possible value for the taxpayer - and for observers to bewail the
might-have-beens. What would have happened if Arthur Scargill had not been
the leader of the National Union of Mineworkers, or if coal had been
privatised earlier, or if the structure of the electricity privatisation had
not encouraged the 'dash for gas'? Truly, this has been a tragedy of errors.
For the purposes of the sale, British Coal has been divided into five
regions, and bidders can put in for as many as they wish. The government
will then choose the winning bids, with a view to completing the
privatisation by the end of the year. In assessing those bids the government
has set itself two objectives. The first is to maximise the return to the
taxpayer. The second is to preserve the largest economically viable coal
industry in the long term.
The first aim is both sensible and laudable: taxpayers deserve the greatest
possible recompense for the billions of pounds they have poured into British
Coal over the years. There is also no justification for underpricing
privatisations in the way that many have been underpriced in the past.
The second aim needs to be examined more closely. If this statement is
merely a long-winded way of saying that the coal industry must stand on its
own two feet, that is acceptable. But if it means that the government is
prepared to accept lower bids in return for commitments by purchasers not to
close pits, it should be rejected.
Soften the blow
Even at this late stage, the government may wish to soften the blow of coal
rationalisation. But the terms of the sale should not be bent to give coal
that extra chance of survival. That temptation has been yielded to too often
in the past. Subsidies, if any, should be explicit, not hidden inside a
manipulated bidding process.
It is true that the economics of mining seem somewhat special, in that
investors have the choice of 'raping' mines or investing in them over the
long term. And it may be that a lower bidder would put in a business plan
that promises to preserve mines - and jobs - for a longer period. But
accepting such a bid would just be a concealed job subsidy. And how could
such bidders be held to this commitment if the market turned against them,
without distorting the business still further? There have been suggestions
that detailed terms could be written into licences, but that would surely be
unrealistic.
Competitive bidding
There is only one criterion to be applied: the highest bid wins. Thus will
the greatest value be extracted from the nation's coal. The sole requirement
is to ensure that the bidding is sufficiently competitive. The government
may also need to set reserve prices, to avoid underbidding.
By the same token, the government should have no hesitation in selling all
five regions to the same bidder if that were to yield the best return. There
would be no serious loss of competition: domestic coal's strongest
competitors are natural gas and imported coal. There may even be a case for
keeping the coal industry in one piece, to enable it better to confront
these competitors.
Although the assets being offered for sale are a mere shadow of the business
that British Coal once was, they do have the makings of a durable, if small,
industry. The cutbacks of the last two years have greatly reduced costs, but
there is enough scope for further savings. Meanwhile, the prospects for the
UK coal market have become clearer now that the share of coal in power
generation has fallen to more sustainable levels. If anything, the major
challenge facing coal's new owners will be environmental, rather than
economic: how to deliver a product that conforms to the country's much
tighter atmospheric pollution targets, and covers the environmental
liabilities that mining operations always create.
Managing the coal industry's long decline has been one of the most
intractable - and costly - challenges confronting British governments for
more than a generation. This privatisation must be the end of it. From now
on, coal should be just another industry.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Inheritance of Irish regiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R MALACHI O'LOUGHLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Bruce Clark ('Security issue fraught with danger', September 5), did
not paint the full picture in describing the role and history of the Royal
Irish Regiment.
The regiment was formed, out of 'Options for Change' by an amalgamation of
the Royal Irish Rangers and the Ulster Defence Regiment, the former being a
conventional line infantry regiment, the latter being deployed in Northern
Ireland.
It has long been a tradition of the Royal Irish Rangers, inherited from
their predecessors, the Irish Regiments, to recruit from both Northern
Ireland and the republic with no religious discrimination, as can be seen
from the number of Catholic commanding officers they have had: this attitude
is already spreading within the whole recently constituted regiment.
There is now a service battalion which takes its place in the line as a
regular army unit, currently deployed in the eastern Mediterranean, and six
home battalions in Northern Ireland.
I feel that, by trying to simplify matters, Clark might have unwittingly
traduced one example of real integration.

FT  12 SEP 94 / To catch an Asian tiger: Nikki Tait asks whether Australia
has found the right strategy to exploit new markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three years ago, Austrade, Australia's main trade promotion organisation,
had 18 offices in Asia. Today, it has 30.
The increase speaks volumes for the effort Australian politicians and
industrial representatives are putting into expanding links with the region.
Last week alone, a delegation of 50 landed in Beijing to promote wool
products; in Tokyo, Mr Paul Keating, Australian prime minister, lauded the
benefits of an Asian free trade area to his Japanese counterpart; while back
home, a drive to boost exports of services was launched.
Australia's attempts to build economic links with Asia are usually traced to
the early 1970s, and were in part a response to the decision by Britain,
Australia's traditional trading partner, to throw its lot in with Europe.
But these efforts have accelerated in recent years - and, in broad terms,
are producing results.
As politicians enthusiastically note, more than 60 per cent of Australia's
exports of goods now go to Asia, compared with 26 per cent in 1960. By
contrast, exports to western Europe (including the UK) accounted for only 13
per cent of last year's total, against 46 per cent three decades ago.
The annual rate at which this Asian business is expanding is also
impressive, although export growth has slackened from the double-digit
percentage increases of the late 1980s. Australia's total trade with Asia
advanced by almost 12 per cent last year, to nearly ADollars 67bn (Pounds
32bn). Exports were up by about 9 per cent, meaning that an additional
ADollars 3.3bn worth of goods were sold. Imports rose by 14 per cent.
But the need to do even better is paramount. For years, Australia has had a
structural problem with its current account, running deficits and then
partially funding these with foreign capital inflows. In the 1970s, the
trend was for the current account deficit to represent an increasing
proportion of gross domestic product. From 1982 onwards, the position
stabilised at 4 to 5 per cent of GDP, but did not improve. By the end of
1993, net foreign debt stood at about 43 per cent of GDP.
The current concern is that a strong upturn in the domestic economy will
spell problems for Australia's trade balance. In the upswing of a business
cycle, Australia's imports tend to rise faster than exports, partly because
of the need for foreign-made plant and equipment, so worsening the current
account deficit. The combination of rising imports and a falling dollar
contributes to higher inflation. In response, interest rates have to be
raised. In short: boom and bust.
A substantially improved export performance would help remedy the situation.
As Mr Bernie Fraser, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, has put it:
'The best way for Australia to grow faster and escape the external
constraints of large current account deficits and rising foreign debt is
through increased exports.' Asia, with its high-growth economies and
relative proximity, is the obvious target.
If the argument for pursuing Asian trade is compelling, realising this
objective is complicated for several reasons.
First, Australia has traditionally acted as Asia's 'farm and quarry'. Raw
materials and unprocessed agricultural produce - primary products -
accounted for 55 per cent of total Australian exports to Asia last year. The
biggest categories were coal, gold, iron ore, aluminium, beef, wool, crude
oil and natural gas.
Continuing to rely on these exports means being hostage to volatile price
cycles, while growth in demand is relatively slow. Moreover, the
vicissitudes of nature can intervene: at present there are concerns about
the trade implications of a severe drought in key east-coast agricultural
areas.
So the focus of the government's export drive falls on 'elaborately
transformed manufactures' or ETMs - a trade department category which covers
'products with unique features which permit their identification as
differentiated products on world markets' (that is, skim milk powder does
not count, while branded Macadamia nut chocolates do.)
ETM exports have been growing more quickly than exports overall, and now
account for about 14 per cent of total sales to Asia. But trade officials
admit it can be difficult to make inroads: 'I think we, and everyone else,
find (the Japanese market) quite hard work,' says Mr Ralph Evans, head of
Austrade.
Second, the mix of export destinations looks slightly less healthy when
examined in detail. Japan dominates the picture, accounting for 25 per cent
of Australia's total exports, and about 40 per cent of those going to Asia.
Here, the main exports are beef, coal and iron ore. Orders and prices for
the latter two have been adversely affected by the Japanese recession and
its effect on the steel and power industries.
Sales to the China/Hong Kong region, however, are more encouraging. They
rose by more than one-fifth in 1993, and the balance of ETMs to primary
products is significantly better. Mr Evans, says this is one of the most
important areas for exporters in the next few years, along with Indonesia,
Australia's nearest neighbour.
A third problem for the export drive into Asia is the level of trade
barriers in the region and Australia's limited clout in combating them,
given its small domestic market and different cultural history.
The six countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations, which now
have a regional free trade agreement aimed at lowering barriers to
intra-Asian trade, are themselves forging links with bigger economies to
their north, such as China. It is not clear what advantage, if any, they
would see in admitting Australia to their ranks. At a transport conference
in Darwin last week, a Malaysian trade consultant made the point bluntly:
'Many people in Asia will need to be convinced that it in is their interests
that Australia becomes part of Asia.'
Australia has responded partly by lobbying within the Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum, a loose grouping of some Australasian, Asian and North
and South American countries. Much play was made in Australia of an
internally generated Apec report for leaders of member states, which called
for complete trade liberalisation in the region by the year 2020.
But for some companies seeking to export to the region, this - and the
latest Gatt agreement - are all-too distant promises. 'There's a lot of
talk, and I know the Australian government is putting on a lot of pressure,
but these countries are not moving (on trade barriers),' says Mr Peter
Horeaens, director of Asian operations at Kellogg Australia, the US-based
cereal manufacturer. Tariffs on cereal-based products, for example, range up
to 60 per cent in Thailand and more than 100 per cent in Pakistan, he says.
Fourth, Australia's ability to aid would-be exporters is more limited than
that of some competitors chasing the same business in Asia  - a function of
the country's size. 'Compared to Group of Seven nations, we don't have such
deep pockets when it comes to export credit guarantee financing and the
like,' says Mr Evans of Austrade.
Finally, and perhaps most controversially, there is a price to be paid for
putting trade and Asian relations so high on the agenda. Australia is by no
means the only country negotiating the culture clash between western values
and those of Asian countries. But if this is a tough problem for a large
country with well-defined beliefs like the US, it is every bit as
problematic for a country with a small economy which is still trying to
establish its own national identity. Trade talks with Indonesian
representatives invariably incite demonstrations over the East Timor
situation, for example; ministerial visits to China rekindle human rights
concerns; and so on.
Asian trade is a path which Australia has little option but to tread - and
it is doing so with impressive determination. But steering a route round the
potholes will remain a substantial task.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Virus test decision should be
explained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr HAROLD W D HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial 'Open science' (September 8) was exactly on target. This
society, which has worked for more than 26 years to preserve Britain's
native butterflies, moths and their habitats, was very concerned indeed to
learn of tests of a genetically engineered virus near Oxford.
The virus was known to be lethal to a large proportion of the UK butterfly
and moth species on which it had been previously tested in the laboratory,
although the commercial aim of the new field tests, we understand, is to
develop sprays to combat insect attack on crops in, mainly, developing
countries. The test site was just 100m from Wytham Wood, one of the richest
sites for lepidoptera in the whole of the UK, including now-rare species.
We raised formal objections when we first heard about these tests, which are
only notified to the public by advertisements in local newspapers. We were
therefore concerned to hear that, on the advice of the ACRE Committee, the
secretary of state for the environment, John Gummer, had authorised the
tests. In the following weeks we have made vigorous efforts to find out from
him the basis of the trials, what consideration the ACRE Committee gave to
our and others' objections, and what practical steps were insisted upon to
guard against escape of the virus and where the responsibility lies for
monitoring these precautions.
We have received two letters which really do not go any way to answer our
questions. It is high time, as you say, that the deliberations and bases of
decision of such committees were in the public domain. We are forced to be
suspicious that the committee gave inadequate consideration to the risks and
the objections; if this is not the case, why is there so much obfuscation of
their processes of decision.

FT  12 SEP 94 / English culture not yet vindicated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The role of late Victorian English culture in the relative decline of the
British economy continues to excite scholarly controversy. It was in the
years around the turn of the century that key features of the English
upper-middle class assumed their familiar mould: education for an imperial
role in spartan boarding schools, which emphasised classics and neglected
science; the aspiration of business leaders to the lifestyle of country
gentlemen; preoccupation with distant overseas investment rather than
domestic business; the exaggerated differentiation of male and female roles;
and the suppression of feeling in the famous stiff upper lip.
Analysis of English relative economic decline in these terms received a new
lease of life in a book by the American historian, Martin Wiener, in English
Culture and the Decline of the Industrial Spirit, 1850-1980 (published in
1981 and republished by Penguin). His thesis about how crippling the dislike
for the capitalist ethos was to economic development is not, of course,
novel. The economist Alfred Marshall observed in 1903: 'By the 1860s and
1870s, many of the sons of manufacturers were content to follow mechanically
the lead given by their fathers. They worked shorter hours; and they exerted
themselves less to obtain new practical ideas.'
What distinguished Wiener was the verve of his writing and its wealth of
detail. An aspect on which he shed new light was the English rural
affectation. Between the wars not only the Conservative leader, Stanley
Baldwin, but also the Labour leader, Ramsay MacDonald, made great play of
being countrymen at heart. The historian JH Plumb remarked: 'The dream of an
Elysian England of patriarchs, well-fed peasants, contented, if illiterate
craftsmen, and compassionate, profit-sharing landlords has haunted English
radicalism.' I have myself been told that the countryside was only real when
the majority of the population were involved in country pursuits - making me
think, not very guiltily, of pleasant afternoons spent sipping Pimms in the
west country, or drinking Gluhwein looking at the Alps.
A counter-attack was launched by an Australian historian, WD Rubinstein, in
Capitalism, Culture and Decline in Britain, 1750-1990 (Routledge, 1993).
Rubinstein's argument is that there is nothing that needs explaining in
Britain's economic record and that the cultural attitudes highlighted by
Wiener were not a source of weakness.
He does seize on a genuine fault in Wiener's identification of economic
development with industry. The latter always accounted for less than 50 per
cent of British employment, as I guess it would of other industrial
countries such as the US and Germany; and it was a mistake to emphasise
complaints about the decline of manufacturing, which is worldwide. But if
'business' is substituted for 'industry' in Wiener's book, 90 per cent of
his argument remains unaffected.
Rubinstein maintains:
that British living standards have risen remarkably in the past few decades,
even while commentators have bemoaned British economic performance, and that
ownership of specified consumer durables compares quite favourably with, for
example, the US or France;
only a small proportion of pupils at the great public schools came from a
business background in the 19th century, and among these there was no drift
to other careers;
English culture was no more anti-business than Continental or even American
culture. He can call in aid the entrenched anti-capitalism of postwar German
novelists and the automatic Marxism of the French intellectual elite until a
decade or two ago - although it is rather less convincing to bring in
American writers from Twain to Henry James;
more tangibly, that concentration on financial and overseas activities was a
rational and successful allocation of talent and capital in the late 19th
and early 20th centuries.
Despite the rave notices of reviewers, who only examine one book at a time,
Rubinstein is not ultimately convincing. Of course the British, like most
other western peoples, 'never had it so good' in the postwar decades. But
the best available indices of consumption per head show that most European
countries have overtaken Britain; and the gap is increased if account is
taken of longer British working hours. But the gap has stopped widening
since the advent of the 1979 Thatcher government.
Rubinstein's own researches on public schools are inconclusive. The business
classes entered these schools in much greater numbers in the 20th century
and were present even in the 19th in lesser public schools, for which there
are no data. The point is not that these schools triggered a drift out of
business, but the somewhat distant managerial style which their products
assumed - people who affected to talk like Harold Macmillan and saw foreign
exchange as a matter for 'Jews and Armenians'.
The cultural comparisons encourage a wallow among favourite authors. But in
my subjective view, Rubinstein does not in the end score. Of course German
scholars excelled at classics as well as chemistry. But they were also
better at both.
The point about relative returns in British industry compared with financial
activities or overseas investment seems more tangible, but only seems. Even
if these domestic returns appeared low, they were not given by ineluctable
natural forces but reflected the quality of entrepreneurship and
professional skills which were applied to them.
The historical controversy is now itself history. But let us not romanticise
the pseudo-aristocratic culture which was not all that nice to those that
got on the wrong side of it.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: East/west factor key to German
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr HOLGER SCHMIEDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is reassuring to read that the FT has become more upbeat on
Germany's economic prospects ('German facelift', September 9). Nonetheless,
your notion of growth through exports may need a qualification. While it is
true that west German exports were indeed up nicely in the first half of
1994, imports had grown even faster. Net exports made no contribution at all
to the west German recovery this year. Instead, the only significant forces
lifting west German real gross domestic product above its end-1993 level
have been housing construction and stock-building. Had housing construction
remained flat in the first quarter, GDP in the period would have fallen by
0.2 per cent instead of rising 0.5 per cent; had companies not piled up
inventories in the second quarter, real GDP would have gone down 0.1 per
cent instead of surging 1 per cent.
Housing construction and stock-building are transitory. Apart from unusually
good weather, the house-building frenzy is fuelled by the expiry of a tax
break at the end of this year; companies will not want to pile up
inventories for ever. These two forces of growth should thus moderate a lot
in 1995.
There is one little understood aspect of west German exports and growth. For
the national accounts statistics, west German exports include trade with
east Germany. In the early 1990s, west Germany enjoyed a big growth push
when, after German monetary union at a ludicrous conversion rate, west
German suppliers wiped east German producers off the east German market. In
coming years, this process will be reversed.
The heavily subsidised investments in east Germany are finally paying off.
The new east German producers have started to (re-) gain the home market and
establish a foothold in the west. West German net exports to east Germany
could start to fall soon. While the surge in such exports provided a strong
second wind to the west German upswing in the early 1990s, their imminent
fall should ensure that the west German upswing will be more modest than one
may have expected by just looking at earlier upswings.
Although private consumption should soon recover from its 1 per cent slump
in the second quarter and machinery investment should edge up nicely, there
is thus no risk that the upswing may get close to overheating territory any
time in the foreseeable future. A modest non-inflationary upswing, which
helps to do away with the big public sector deficit, should be the best
possible news for markets and the Bundesbank.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not defending a high-cost Logitech
operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GIACOMO MARINI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ian Rodger, in his article about Logitech, 'Almost caught in a mouse
trap' (August 22), states: 'With the factories in Taiwan and Ireland running
well and a new China venture in the works, the high-cost California factory
could be shut down. Marini, who was responsible for US operations, resigned
in protest, but profitability was restored . . .'
From the tone and the context of the sentence, it may appear that I was
defending a high-cost and unprofitable operation, thus damaging the best
interest of Logitech.
In 1992, I was executive vice-president and chief operating officer and my
responsibilities included all Logitech factories worldwide, including
Taiwan, Ireland, China and California. Each of them had a vice-president or
general manager reporting, directly or indirectly, to me.
I had no more vested interest in the California plant than in any of the
other plants. The manufacturing strategy at the time called for different
roles for the plants. The California plant was used primarily for new
product introductions, being close to the main design centre. I had managed
the transition of products to lower cost plants in a systematic and orderly
way. As the pressure on costs was increasing, I had a very specific plan of
accelerating the transfer of products to lower-cost plants.
The California factory was not shut down in 1992 and it is still in
operation today. It continued to operate with about the same number of
employees after I left and until the first quarter of 1994. Only recently
has the headcount been reduced.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Arts: Literature turns over an old leaf - Jackie
Wullschlager looks at changing attitudes to the novel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a sensational shortlist: a bestseller about love and hypnotism, a
blockbuster about battles and brides in Ruritania, and a pornographic
shocker about teenage sex and baby murder so explicit that only an obscure
Newcastle publisher would risk printing it. Out are the eminences gris of
Victorian letters - novels by Thomas Hardy and Mrs Humphry Ward, who advised
Gladstone and Roosevelt, didn't make the grade.
This week the shortlist for the hypothetical 1894 Booker Prize will be
announced by six judges, including biographer Victoria Glendinning and
broadcaster Melvyn Bragg. They have avoided dull and worthy classics and
chosen six books which stirred the fin de siecle world and remain compelling
today: George du Maurier's Trilby, Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda,
George Moore's Esther Waters, Kipling's Jungle Book, George Gissing's In the
Year of Jubilee and RL Stevenson's The Ebb Tide. The winner will be revealed
on October 15 (four days after the 1994 Booker Prize ceremony) at the
Cheltenham Festival of Literature.
Like today's Booker Prize, it is a publishing gimmick; Everyman, which is
backing the spoof award, is a significant publisher of classic Victorian
novels. But the retrospective Booker is also a fascinating exercise in
historical reconstruction. It raises questions about how the relationship
between literature and society has changed in the past 100 years.
First, the similarities. A good yarn is a good yarn. Of the 1894 books,
Trilby is the tale of a tone-deaf model who sings like an angel when
mesmerised by the sinister hypnotist Svengali, then croaks like a crow when
he dies during one of her concerts. The Prisoner of Zenda tells of an
Englishman impersonating the King of Ruritania and rescuing him from demons.
On the 1994 list Romesh Guneskera's Reef is about a Sri Lankan servant boy
and his mysterious master, while Jill Paton Walsh's Knowledge of Angels
re-enacts the wolf-child legend. All the books on both lists are gripping
stories.
The lists share key themes. Both, for instance, have books about colonial
exploitation - Stevenson's The Ebb Tide and Abdulrazak Gurnah's Paradise,
which is set in the First World War in German East Africa. Both provoke in
similar ways.
The controversial books of 1894 were Trilby, with its louche vie boheme
milieu, and Esther Waters, in which a 17-year-old girl is seduced,
impregnated and offered the services of a professional baby killer for a
fiver. It is now seen as Moore's best work, but in 1894 it had problems
finding a publisher and the powerful circulating libraries refused to take
it.
A century on, the relationship between fiction and sexual morality remains
vexed. Last week, a Times critic complained about the inclusion of Alan
Hollinghurst's candid novel of homosexual love, The Folding Star, on the
Booker list, because it offended Judaeo-Christian ethics.
But even if Hollinghurst wins the Booker, his novel will not become the
succes de scandale of Esther Waters and Trilby, which became the bestselling
novel of the 19th century. For the great difference between then and now is
that in 1894 a Booker Prize was not needed to sell fiction.
Today, we accept the gap between literary writing, such as Hollinghurst's,
and popular bestsellers by writers like Jeffrey Archer and Barbara Cartland.
This is the gap the Booker tries to bridge by giving high-level publicity to
works which would not normally reach a mass audience. The trick works - last
year's winner, Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha sold 360,000 hardback
copies. Before the short-list was announced it sold 10,600.
The Victorians, in contrast, were lovers of contemporary fiction. Novels
accounted for 20 per cent of published books, and no distinction was made
between high and low art. In the mid 19th century, Dickens made Pounds
12,000 for Little Dorrit, the equivalent of nearly Pounds 400,000 today.
Between 1861 and 1894, when the population of the UK was half that of today
and the literate population smaller still, Mrs Henry Wood's East Lynne sold
400,000 copies. All the 1894 Booker writers were popular names; they were
also serious, skilful writers whose books can be reread with pleasure 100
years later.
Why was fiction so much closer to the public heart in 1894? Social, cultural
and psychological reasons play a part. Socially, the 1890s reading public
was a vastly more homogenous group than today: a small number of middle
class authors wrote for a middle class audience at a time when to be
literate was to belong to an elite. The idea of a two-tier, up and
down-market, fiction was irrelevant. Culturally, these writers and readers
were certain of their place in the mainstream, and the novel was their
political and intellectual forum.
Today we no longer share the Victorian confidence in the novel as a key
genre of our age. Modernism and the overturning of the traditional form by
Joyce and Woolf weakened 20th-century belief in the novel and encouraged the
divergence between highbrow and lowbrow. The dominance of film and
television has made novels a more marginal form and perhaps they no longer
attract the most creative talents. George du Maurier originally offered the
outline of Trilby to Henry James, who he thought would write a better novel.
Today du Maurier would have sold it to Hollywood or the BBC.
The fantasy element of fiction, in which we identify with characters as if
we know them, was answered in the 19th century by the novel; in the 20th
century we have TV soaps. Just as the tabloid newspapers feature characters
from EastEnders, so when Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop was running as a
serial there was widespread press speculation on whether Little Nell would
die, and readers wrote in begging for her to be saved. Sentimentality,
accessibility, topicality - what characterises today's soaps were clear
features of the novel in 1894. Both In the Year of Jubilee and Esther
Waters, for example, centre on the burning 1890s debate about marriage,
feminism and the 'New Woman', yet both are also tearjerkers which everyone
enjoyed.
The 1894 books are compelling because they prefigure our own times and yet
are set back from them. Trilby is a tale of hypnotism and the unconscious a
decade away from Freud; The Ebb Tide paved the way for Conrad's Heart of
Darkness and the first questioning of colonial oppression.
It is unlikely that the 1994 Booker choices will speak as eloquently of new
trends today. Whereas the 1894 titles had contemporary settings, many of the
1994 books are historical (such as Paradise) or are driven by nostalgia
(such as Beside the Ocean of Time). Which book will win on October 15?
Stevenson will get the sympathy vote because he died in 1894 in Samoa, the
setting of The Ebb Tide. Jungle Book will get the retrospective vote,
because it is the best-known today and has fashionable mythic overtones in
the lost paradise of Mowgli's jungle; its position on the list may also
rescue it from schmaltzy Disney associations and confirm it as a serious
novel about a young man's self-discovery.
My vote goes to Trilby. Soft-focus, ideologically shaky - in its
anti-Semitic portrait of Svengali - and sometimes sloppy, it is a story of
demonic possession and haunts the imagination like a fairy tale long after
better-written works have faded from memory. Like Rebecca, the popular novel
by du Maurier's granddaughter, it is a natural equivalent of what the
current Booker Prize seeks to create: a combination of the classic and the
bestseller.

For some reason Channel 4 is staying very quiet about one aspect of its new
series Quarrels. The billing says these programmes 'bring together disputing
parties, whether individuals or groups', but in the first two episodes, at
any rate, race is a factor. Today a Muslim resident of Leicester confronts a
prostitute who works on the street outside his house (8.00pm). BBC2's series
on technology, White Heat, which began well last week, moves on to the
question of technological change: does it occur to supply a need, or do
innovations create their own demand? Until somebody created a disposable
nappy, nobody needed one. Fiction writers 'invented' death rays, and then
along came the laser which can shoot down aircraft, restore sight and read
bar codes - yet it was not invented to do any of those (8.00pm). BBC2
considers OJ Mania: The Media Trial Of OJ Simpson (11.15pm). Millions of
Americans watched the scenes live on television when Simpson set off up the
highway and was pursued by a phalanx of police cars. Some now doubt whether
Simpson can ever get a fair trial.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Arts: Terfel rules on the last night - The Proms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Proms are an equal-opportunities employer. In a splendid break with
tradition, the solo singer invited to deliver the classic anthem for the
Last Night of this hundredth Prom year was not a woman, but a man. And not
just any male opera singer, but the marvellous Bryn Terfel. Music is not the
main point of the Last Night, and the excited Prom audience had been loud
with coughs and popping balloons through the opening Bach and Vaughan
Williams items - but from the moment Terfel began his first solo in Walton's
Belshazzar's Feast he commanded hushed attention from the entire Albert
Hall. His diction alone is compelling; and then there is the vibrant
firmness of his bass-baritone voice, even finer when singing quietly than in
full volume; plus the fact that you never see, or hear, him breathe. All
this had the Prommers in thrall; Terfel tamed the beast.
For Rule, Britannia], he returned in Welsh rugby fan uniform. Within this
mighty young lion, there is an impish boy; just as within his rhetorical
sternness there is a contemplative lyricist, and within his life-giving
openness there is a brooding darkness. All these contrasts make him
fascinating.
The conductor, Andrew Davis, handled this loaded occasion - including his
speech - with a perfect blend of concentration, humour, and panache. There
is a sense of conspiracy for these events that makes the standing Prommers,
with their chanted messages, part of a special community with the BBC
Symphony Orchestra, the BBC Singers, and the BBC Symphony Chorus. That
everyone playing the music well matters not quite so much as the way
everyone joins in the unison ritual sways and bounces. Still, I must record
that two other soloists deservedly won the Prommers' cheers and respect:
Evelyn Glennie, the ebullient soloist in Paul Creston's Concertino for
Marimba, and Michael Davis (the BBCSO's leader) whose solo violin led the
famous Meditation from Massenet's Thais.
Flags of all nations were waved; and 'Care For the World' T-shirts were worn
as well as boaters, helmets, and Union Jack bowlers. This year's chutzpah
prize must go to the group who waved - during 'Rule Britannia", can you
believe? - a banner reading 'Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival'. But the
musicality prize goes to the standee who held a heart-shaped balloon aloft
during the Thais Meditation. During the final phrase, exactly as the solo
violin took another ascent into the empyrean, he let his balloon rise
another yard towards the dome above.

FT  12 SEP 94 / People (Names in the News): Kidder shrugs off the axe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the rest of Wall Street waits for the axe to fall at Kidder Peabody,
the troubled investment bank has been busy making senior appointments which
suggest it is exploring ways to make the business grow, rather than shrink,
writes Richard Waters.
Last week, the General Electric subsidiary said it had created a new
worldwide business development job for Michael Madden. The move effectively
puts the long-time investment banker in line to take over as Kidder's number
two next year, when GE hopes to draw back from the direct control it
currently exerts.
Madden, 45, was head of Kidder's investment banking for three years until
1989, when he left - apparently over a leadership tussle - for Lehman
Brothers. He rejoined Kidder last year, and has now been given the rather
grandiose title of head of global origination - making him responsible for
drumming up business for the bank from companies looking to raise money in
the capital markets.
At the same time, Kidder said it had appointed Norman Liu as managing
director in charge of business development. Liu comes across from GE
Capital, and part of his job will be to find ways of creating new business
between his former employer and Kidder. In the past, the two financial firms
have had a stand-off relationship.
Despite these moves, though, rival banks continue to expect significant
cost-cutting at Kidder. The revelation earlier this year that
previously-reported profits of Dollars 350m were fictitious - a fact that
Kidder has blamed on former bond trader Joseph Jett - has highlighted the
bank's disproportionately large cost base and over-dependence on one area:
mortgage-backed bonds.

FT  12 SEP 94 / People (Names in the News): Conde accuses establishment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mario Conde, abruptly dismissed by the Bank of Spain last December as
chairman of Banco Espanol de Credito, alleges in a book to be launched today
that he was the victim of an establishment plot, writes Tom Burns.
Those who lost a lot of money in Conde's former institution, Spain's fourth
largest bank, including US backers of a JP Morgan fund which invested
Dollars 175m just over a year ago in a Banesto rights issue, might want to
know how it was that Bank of Spain inspectors discovered a Dollars 3.5bn
over-valuation of the bank's Dollars 61bn assets.
But El Sistema, which was written at Conde's ranch in southern Spain and
aboard his yacht in the Mediterranean, is about dark politics - not shadowy
auditing.
Son of a customs official and a clever lawyer turned businessman, Conde was
a rank outsider to banking in 1987 when he and a friend sold their
pharmaceuticals company Antibioticos for Dollars 481m, and then used their
proceeds to buy themselves on to the Banesto board.
On becoming chairman weeks later, Conde, aged just 39, fought off a hostile
takeover attempt and proceeded to enlarge the bank at breakneck speed,
conducting, in the process, a wholesale reorganisation of its widespread
industrial assets.
Conde claims he fell foul not just of the network of traditional families
who had run Banesto for generations, but of Spain's sistema, the
establishment, which he found lurking in the Bank of Spain, in the finance
ministry and in the influential El Pais newspaper group. 'I found out how
real power works in Spain and that is what I want to explain,' says Conde.
The maverick financier, who says he is an admirer of Silvio Berlusconi,
plans a countrywide lecture tour in which he will argue that Spain's sistema
needs a shake-out similar to the one Italy has undergone.
Conde's self-evident ambitions are unlikely to impress high court
magistrates who are currently sifting evidence on his business dealings.

In the past couple of years, Swiss Bank Corporation has become a power in
London investment banking and solidified its position in the US with a

Now Hans de Gier, one of the SBC directors who has been in the thick of
these developments, is off to Singapore to assess how the bank can build up
its relatively small business in the fast growing Far East.
Is he being sidelined in favour of his long-time partner, Marcel Ospel, at
the top of SBC's international business? Not at all. Promotion comes with
the job - to deputy group chief executive, a uniquely elevated position for
a non-Swiss (de Gier is Dutch) in a big Swiss bank. 'We feel Asia is the
most exciting part of the world, and we have to build a meaningful presence
there, so we need a commitment at senior level,' says de Gier.
But it does not sound as if the bank will be making the kinds of brash move
there that it has in London and the US. 'I know Asia very superficially. My
job will be to listen carefully,' de Gier says.
In fact, he has already made waves in the region, poaching most of the
equity research staff from WI Carr in Tokyo and Hong Kong in 1986 for SBC.
'We want to strengthen our product base and distribution and build a quality
investment bank,' he says.
de Gier, 49, who joined SBC in 1980 along with two other Orion Bank
colleagues, is less forthcoming about the career implications of the move.
'I am excited about Asia per se. I am not taking it for internal career
reasons.' But he makes clear that he does not expect to stay forever in the
Far East.

FT  12 SEP 94 / People: The head who saw off Patten - As schools return for
a new academic year, Joan Clanchy tells John Authers that, while she regards
league tables as 'good clean fun', she drew the line at controversial
English tests for 14-year-olds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Joan Clanchy, headmistress of the North London Collegiate School, has had
fame thrust upon her in the past two years. She can lay the blame at the the
feet of the government and its spasm of education reforms.
Until two years ago, she and her school almost seemed to be going out of
fashion. A tall Oxford-educated Scot, she took over as head of North London
nine years ago having previously been head of St George's School, Edinburgh
 -another traditional girls' school.
A keen academic historian, Clanchy was then best known only as one of the
most imposing figures in a girls' school movement increasingly threatened by
the decision of some boys' schools to go mixed, and as a pragmatic
educational traditionalist.
With this reputation in mind, ministers appointed her to the National
Curriculum Council, the quango which administered the new curriculum it was
imposing in all the state schools of England and Wales.
Now, Clanchy starts a new school year as head of a school still bathing in
positive publicity, thanks to its mighty showing in exam result league
tables; it was top of the FT's table for girls' schools last year and this.
Meanwhile, the new education secretary, Gillian Shephard, has introduced a
radically reformed package of tests following a revolt by the teaching
profession in which Clanchy was seen to take a leading part. It accounted
for the political head of Shephard's predecessor, John Patten.
Ironically, Clanchy disapproves of the league tables which have showed her
school to perform prodigiously. Like most teachers, her first concern is for
individual pupils, and she is alarmed by the distraught reactions from girls
who managed 'only' a B in their GCSE exams - league tables now reveal that
81.5 per cent of the GCSEs taken at North London Collegiate last term
resulted in A-grades.
Unlike many independent school headmistresses, she has experience of the
state sector, having started her teaching career at a comprehensive, and is
quick to admit that North London is very privileged.
Set in beautiful buildings on the edge of an Edgware park, the school is
heavily over-subscribed, and she therefore has the luxury of being able to
select pupils, interviewing parents as well as their daughters.
She also treats the welter of positive publicity for girls' schools which
the tables have triggered with amusement: 'League tables,' she says, 'are
good, clean fun, but they don't necessarily show that girls' schools are
particularly wonderful. What they might show is that 16-year-old girls work
a lot harder than boys.'
The truly interesting phenomenon, for her, is girls' previous
under-performance, not their more recent improvement. She points out that
girls now out-perform boys by a wide margin at GCSE at both single-sex and
mixed schools, a disparity which is widening every year.
She believes this is a social circumstance: 'Girls, particularly those of
middle-ranking academic ability, now believe that they have a real chance of
entering a career with their academic qualifications, and so they are
working for them.'
And she attributes this to girls' 'constant lack of confidence'.
On this reading, the case for single-sex education does not rest on league
tables. Instead: 'The big argument for single-sex education is that you
don't have to conform to gender stereotypes. That's not just in science and
maths but in behaviour generally.'
North London Collegiate conforms to enough stereotypes to show that it has
not lost touch with its traditions. Girls wear uniform until the sixth form,
when most of them choose to dress smartly in any case. Many play hockey.
Standards of discipline seem high enough to satisfy any parent, and the
girls treat teachers - particularly Clanchy herself, just turned 55 and a
dominant figure standing around six feet tall - with obvious respect.
But it has shed enough stereotypes to move with the times. The student body
is almost as ethnically mixed as its neighbours in the state sector, partly
thanks to the government's assisted places scheme for children from
low-income families.
Cooking has been dropped in favour of craft, design and technology. Girls
are offered the chance to run their own companies as part of the Young
Enterprise scheme - 'selling each other junk' as Clanchy cheerfully
describes it - and this year's most popular A-level subject was maths.
Most North London Collegiate girls seem boisterously self-confident, and
obviously expect to take on a challenging career when they graduate. Thus
the school's role under Clanchy is, if anything, to challenge stereotypes.
One of these is that maths and sciences are a male preserve, and Clanchy
points out: 'It used to be that Latin and Greek were the ultimate measure of
cleverness. Now that women do much better than men at those subjects, all
the attention has shifted to the sciences.'
Views like this explain why Clanchy is a popular figure among other girls'
school headmistresses - in great part due to her opposition to the
introduction of national curriculum tests for 14-year-olds.
In March last year she fired off one of her first shots: 'The more we learn
about the tests the more insensitive, bureaucratic and absurd they seem. My
school, like all the others at the top of the league table, will not be
doing them.'
To make her point clearer, she then resigned from the National Curriculum
Council. This decision, she later told a sympathetic audience at the Girls'
Schools Association, had only been taken after several late nights agonising
in her kitchen.
In her resignation letter, she told Patten: 'The dominant aim has become a
curriculum designed for tests, and the result is a model of English teaching
which is barren and anti-intellectual. It is almost as if there is a
determination on the part of the council to pick a fight with English
teachers.'
It was as if, she said, 'the Highway Code had been narrowed down to
instructions on the three-point turn'.
Until then, Patten had assumed that objections to testing were restricted to
a handful of ideologically motivated teachers' union activists.
Heedless of Clanchy's warning, he chose to battle on, believing he could
beat the teachers in the battle for public opinion. He was wrong.
She treated this with icy disdain. Like many in the educational profession
she felt he should have been relieved of his post at least a year earlier
than he was, and referred to him as 'the Great Unshuffled'  - a nickname
that was to become very popular in the teaching profession. Shephard would
do well to pay her more heed.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Business Travel: BA relaunches Club Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways will unveil today a Pounds 70m revamp of its Club Europe
business-class services.
It is the biggest investment BA has so far made in the European business
travel market. It comes at a time when European business travel is
recovering from recession and airlines are facing new challenges from the
imminent Eurostar Channel tunnel rail services and from growing
liberalisation in the European single aviation market.
In a study of the European travel market to coincide with the launch of the
new BA Club Class services, DeAnne Julius, BA's chief economist, notes that
European air travel continued to increase appreciably even during the last
three years of recession.
Between 1989 and 1992, the total number of passengers travelling for
business reasons in Europe rose by 15.5 per cent. Julius forecasts growth of
4.4 per cent in 1995 and 5.5 per cent in 1996 in European scheduled air
traffic.
These forecasts take into account what BA expects to be the likely effects
of the Channel tunnel. 'We expect it to divert a portion of current
city-centre London to Paris traffic, but also to stimulate additional
leisure travel between Britain the Continent,' she says.
BA does not expect the Channel tunnel's impact on total European air traffic
to be large. But a number of other industry analysts disagree and say the
start of Channel tunnel passenger rail services in November is likely to
spark off a fierce fares war on air, rail and ferry traffic.
BA's chief economist believes the European economy is on the threshold of an
accelerating recovery, which will clearly have an impact on business travel.
The UK is leading the way, with recovery now also finally gathering momentum
in the German and Italian markets. French prospects are also looking good,
she adds.
The Club Europe revamp also reflects the growing importance BA is now
placing on the overall European market. 'The growing European air transport
market is crucial to BA, with Europe as a whole, rather than the UK alone,
now its home base,' Julius emphasises.
This shift has seen BA increasing its European flights by 22 per cent
between 1991 and 1993, as well as reinforcing its European presence by
investing in new European airline subsidiaries, including TAT in France and
Deutsche BA in Germany.
BA's Club Europe was originally launched in 1988 as one of BA's first new
branded services.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Media Futures: Electronics in the dock - Singapore's
courtroom of the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perry Mason probably would not approve. Rumpole of the Bailey would hate it.
Singapore recently unveiled its latest high technology creation - the so
called court of the future, dominated by computers and video conferencing,
rather than files and shuffling clerks.
Singapore is trying to computerise most aspects of government business. Now
its technicians from the state controlled National Computer Board (NCB) have
moved into the court room.
Though Singapore no longer has a jury system, its justice system still
resembles the old colonial British model, with judges taking endless notes
in longhand, lawyers shuffling mountainous files, assistants carrying
weighty legal tomes.
'The first thing we want to try and do is use technology to organise
paperwork and procedures in court,' says Joseph Teo of the NCB. 'Everything
would be digitised and fed on to the judge's computer. The court system
would become paperless and there would be instantaneous transcription of
proceedings.'
Teo is one of a handful of NCB technicians behind a scheme called Court
Vision 21, billed as the most ambitious court computerisation plan under way
in Asia.
'In time we want to try and move into virtual courts - which would allow
people the freedom to transact court matters from offices and homes.' says
Teo.
Though this sounds futuristic, similar experiments are already under way in
the US, Canada and Australia. Teo and his technicians feel they have an
advantage in implementing such systems in Singapore. The island state is
small, with a population of under 3m.
Singapore has a high degree of computer literacy: about 30 per cent of
households have computers. Ten years ago Singapore had only about a thousand
computer professionals. Now it has 14,000. The NCB plans to have fibre optic
cables connected to every home and office by early next century.
Teo demonstrates how a robbery trial might take place in years to come. The
prosecution would be able to present its case on a large television screen
through using a series of icons describing how and when the robbery took
place. The icons could be animated and there would be sound. And, for
example, a witness could give his or her statement via a video conferencing
link with Hong Kong.
IBM and other companies have helped NCB come up with the equipment to make
the court of the future work. A range of 'litigation support software' is
used to allow the judge - who need not necessarily be in court - to call up
on his personal computer both evidence and exhibits through a variety of
multimedia tools.
The court has access to other computer aids: 'SING' - Sentencing Information
Guide System' - allows instant storage and retrieval of documents in the
form of text, video, image and voice.
In a jury system, members could, while making their decision, have instant
access to voice testimony, exhibits or specific areas of the prosecution or
defence cases presented.
Lawyers and judges can also call up Lawnet, a database containing
Singapore's laws. All past court decisions will also be available through
the computer network.
The system has several advantages: it would be likely to speed up court
proceedings dramatically. Juveniles would no longer have to go through the
trauma of going to court - they could give evidence from their homes.
Singapore is already implementing computer-based systems for hearing
applications for bail, eliminating the time and money it takes to bring a
prisoner to court.
But there are also some serious reservations about the system. For one thing
delivery of testimony via video is not now admissible in Singapore's courts.
The NCB says that the Singapore Chief Justice and other figures in the
judiciary have been very supportive and it is hopeful that handicaps to the
implementation of interactive courts can be overcome.
The system, however, asks a great deal of lawyers and judges. They would not
only have to be experts on the law, they would have to become computer
technicians as well. The clash between one of the world's oldest professions
and one of the most modern could be a painful one.
The court of the future might speed up the legal system. But digital justice
could make the judicial system seem very inhuman and distant. It could also
make going to court more expensive.
In many countries the judiciary worries that the person with the most
expensive lawyer has too many advantages. In the court of the future a
defendant might find he or she not only needs a good lawyer, but also that a
good multimedia presenter could be a great asset.
Singapore's aim is to have everyone plugged in to the information
superhighway. The NCB says that Singaporeans will increasingly use computer
technology to carry out a wide range of chores, like shopping or banking.
They will then have more 'discretionary time' to do other things.
Singaporeans are having to accept computer technology in many areas of
activity. In 1996 Singapore plans to introduce the world's first electronic
road pricing system, with motorists being automatically charged, through an
electronic card fixed to their vehicles, for driving on certain roads
'People in Singapore are very technology orientated,' says Teo. 'That is in
our favour as we try to introduce multimedia into the courts. The changes
are bound to bring problems. It is a question of taking one trench at a
time.'

FT  12 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Why agents are 'going global' - The
expected deal between American Express and Thomas Cook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business travel agents are getting fewer but bigger - a fact that will not
have been missed by any company with a sizeable travel budget. This trend
towards bigger agencies with wider geographic reach (the agents like to call
it 'going global') is likely to be confirmed today, with the expected
announcement that American Express is buying large parts of the Thomas Cook
travel agency business.
Alongside the combined networks of the US agency Carlson and the
French-based Wagonlit, which formed a business travel joint venture earlier
this year, American Express will rank as one of two agencies with a claim to
broad reach in both the US and Europe.
None of this is likely to make much difference to the average travelling
businessperson. It will be noted, however, in the travel departments of big
companies around the world as a sign of the continuing reshaping of the
business travel market.
Perhaps one question above lies behind the latest deal: in future, why will
big companies need travel agents at all?
These intermediaries traditionally have performed two functions: collecting
and sorting information (about schedules, fares and the like) and using
their size (where they have it) to negotiate better prices or obtain
preferential treatment for their customers.
Due largely to advances in information technology, both roles are under
threat. Computers make the job of sifting information much easier, as well
as enabling companies to keep better track internally of the travel needs of
their staff. This in turn has has made it easier for companies with big
travel budgets to go straight to the airlines to negotiate their own volume
discounts.
IBM, for instance, says: 'We negotiate rates directly with some of the major
carriers, and the agents simply implement those (agreements.)' Some of the
biggest US companies - including General Motors, Merck and Black &amp; Decker -
want to take this one step further. Through a joint company called Business
Travel Contractors, they are proposing to pool their buying power to force
the airlines to give them better rates. As part of the deal, the airlines
would not pay any agents' commissions, and would stop issuing frequent flyer
miles to these companies' employees.
If agents have no role in negotiating prices, or even the choice of airline,
the commissions on ticket sales, which form the bulk of their income, will
come under increasing threat. The combination of new low-cost airlines and a
move by many companies to reduce their use of business-class has brought
down the average ticket price, with direct consequences on commissions (a
standard agent's commission is around 10 per cent of the ticket price.)
In this environment, it is not surprising to see some consolidation in the
business travel agency business. Also, by extending their network
geographically, the agencies hope to increase their value to their biggest
customers by providing information and negotiating muscle in overseas
markets.
As in other service industries that rely on multinational companies for
their income, the conventional wisdom now holds that big is better. 'Either
you need to be a global company, or you need to be a very good niche
player,' says Travis Tanner, president of Carlson. 'There isn't a very good
chance of survival in the middle market.'
One reason, runs the argument, is that big companies prefer to use fewer
agents. 'North America is leading the charge, followed closely by Europe,'
says Tanner.
Is consolidation among agencies good for the business customer? To the
extent that being bigger brings down an agent's costs (by as much as 30-40
per cent, says Tanner,) yes - though the disruption in service that often
accompanies takeovers in service industries may counterbalance this. Also,
the bigger agents should have more power to negotiate lower fares in
international markets, though this is an argument that the agents admit has
yet to be proven.
Perhaps most significantly, though, scale will justify the investments in
new technology that the biggest agents plan to make in the years ahead.
Control of information is the most significant factor that is likely to
justify their continued existence over the long term, since even the biggest
companies will be able to rival the intermediaries in the international
travel markets.
Facing shrinking commissions from airlines, the agents are already trying to
persuade big companies that they should pay fees for their services.
Providing a service that justifies those fees is the challenge for the rest
of this decade.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Media Futures: BBC and Channel 4 move to exploit rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two British broadcasters, the BBC and Channel 4, are about to launch
significant initiatives which emphasise the importance of the acquisition
and exploitation of film and programme rights in the increasingly
competitive broadcasting market.
Channel 4 will this evening launch its first video label and plans to
release at least 24 titles a year under its own name. The channel is also
interested in a joint venture in cinema distribution in the UK, apart from
keeping the UK video rights of future feature films it invests in under the
Film on 4 banner.
The aim is to have a greater participation in future in the exploitation of
films such as the current international hit - Four Weddings and a Funeral.
The BBC, which has been given active encouragement by the government to
develop an international commercial business, is joining two private
investors in a new television rights acquisition company called Delta.
The BBC is expected to have a 20 per cent stake in the new venture which
will be run by Ann Harris, at present the director of co-production in
London of the Italian-owned RCS Films and Television.
The other two backers of Delta are Gartmore, the UK investment fund, and
Media Ventures, which has stakes in Teletext, ITV and UK Talk Radio, the new
national commercial station launching next year.
Colin Leventhal, head of Channel 4 International and managing director of
Channel 4 Video, hopes that video sales will double Channel 4
International's turnover over the next three years. Last year the channel
had revenues of Pounds 11m and profits of Pounds 4m on its sales operations.
The video business will begin with the launch of five titles, retailing at
Pounds 12.99 each. They range from three Equinox programmes, Fly Navy,
Spitfire and Space Shuttle Discovery to two comedy titles, The Most
Unpleasant World of Penn &amp; Teller and Totally Bill Hicks, a compilation of
the Channel 4 tribute and his last live performance in the UK.
For the Christmas market Channel 4 will launch a video of Brookside, its
regular soap opera - nearly half of which will be new material. In every
case the channel says it will be working closely with independent producers
who provide most of its programmes.
In the past Channel 4 has sold video rights on request to other companies
but only about half a dozen titles were released.
Leventhal says he is confident that the new venture 'will be a welcome
addition to the services we offer our viewers, while at the same time
generating significant revenues for Channel 4.' It will also take him into
head-on competition with the BBC - usually after Disney the leading video
'sell-through', as opposed to rental label, in the UK.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Long opening hours and the presence of a 'captive audience' are turning
airport shops into real money spinners, says a report published last week.
The report, Airport Retailing in the UK, by the Corporate Intelligence Group
predicts that UK airport shops are heading for sales of more than Pounds
600m in 1994 - a 50 per cent increase on the 1990 figure despite the
recession. Sales by the end of the decade could be worth Pounds 1bn a year,
boosted by sales at shops run by high-street names such as Boots, WH Smith
and Lillywhites.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Striking a blow for the airlines - When the
industrial action is over, some passengers may not return to UK trains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES JENNINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While it may be a pain in the neck for business travellers, for UK airlines
the signal workers' strike on one or two days a week since mid-June has been
a godsend. British Midland claims to have carried 27,000 extra passengers in
the past three months, compared with the same period last year; while
British Airways is reporting an extra 9,000-10,000 passengers a week on its
domestic routes - a 10 per cent increase on numbers 12 months ago.
No one yet knows how many of these newly won passengers will stay with the
airlines once the strike is over. As British Midland's spokeswoman says: 'So
far, the figures suggest that they've mostly been travelling on strike days.
There's no evidence - yet - that people are fundamentally changing their
habits.'
What the airlines do know, however, is that it gives them a new group of
customers to whom they can advertise their product. BA recognises that many
business travellers' first experience of the airline will be on a domestic
route. 'It is,' according to the company, 'our shop window. It's where we
sell BA.'
To this end, the airline has been introducing incentives, including a
no-reservation shuttle service on the London-Glasgow and London-Manchester
routes; automated ticket dispensers; and complimentary food and drink on all
flights, no matter how brief. 'You get a four-course meal and a drink on the
London-Glasgow route. It's a masterpiece of timing,' proclaims BA.
But British Midland's latest manoeuvre in the battle for business travellers
is perhaps more interesting. This week sees the introduction of the Diamond
Pass: a season ticket entitling the holder to five return journeys to any of
the airline's destinations within a period of three months from the date of
issue.
The price is Pounds 699: which means that, on some routes, a British Midland
pass holder could save as much as Pounds 221 over the equivalent five
first-class rail tickets.
'We've had this planned since the start of the year,' says British Midland.
'It's not a response to the rail strike, and we're not trying to capitalise
on it.' It does, however, throw a new element into the business traveller's
equation of time, convenience and cost.
Even without British Midland's new initiative, ticket prices on some routes
are already creeping towards parity. Although an InterCity first-class
return from London to Manchester stands at Pounds 130, against Pounds 180
for an equivalent BA ticket, a first-class InterCity return from London to
Glasgow is Pounds 184, while on BA or British Midland, the equivalent is
Pounds 224. For London to Newcastle, the figures are even closer - Pounds
180 for InterCity, Pounds 206 for BA/British Midland.
Throw in considerations such as time and convenience, and InterCity's
advantage shrinks further. London to Manchester by train takes two and a
half hours, plus half an hour, say, to get to the station; the plane takes
50 minutes, plus, say, an hour and a half to reach Heathrow and check in.
Glasgow, on the other hand, takes five and half hours by rail, compared with
an hour and a quarter by air.
This is where British Midland's strategy looks most effective. Leaving aside
the logistical questions (such as whether you are going from city centre to
city centre, or outskirts to outskirts), if you can save on price as well as
time on the longer routes by going by air, the logic of train over plane
evaporates.
As BA puts it: 'We've seen a steady growth in the number of business
travellers flying over the last few years, and although we're not doing any
special research to find out who's going to change from rail to air after
the strike, the fact is that some people are bound to change for good.'
Luckily for InterCity, there are not enough airports to turn the UK into
another United States, where businessmen fly everywhere. But with every day
of strike action, InterCity must view the future with rather less certainty.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Business Travel: 'I am afraid it is unsafe to land' -
Michael Cassell had to prepare for an emergency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was when the Belgian businessman sitting next to me scribbled a farewell
note to his wife that I began to take seriously the plight of British
Midland flight BD147 as it circled Brussels airport.
We might now believe that modern air travel is as routine as hopping on and
off the bus. But when your aircraft's captain breaks the news there is a
technical fault making the DC-9 'unsafe to land', you can't jump off and
catch the one behind. The incident which last week brought a dozen 'B' movie
scripts to life began with an announcement that the landing had been aborted
because of indications the landing gear was faulty. The crew would consult
with engineers on the ground.
Passengers eyed each other, but pressed on with reading the papers and
punching their laptops as the flight attendants, smiling impressively,
gathered together outside the flight deck door.
Minutes ticked by. The aircraft, announced the captain in his finest 'trust
me' tones, would now have to fly over the airport so ground crew could take
a look. Having done so, he again broke the nervous silence. There were, he
said, visual indications that the landing gear was down and locked, but the
instrumentation still insisted otherwise.
'I am afraid, ladies and gentlemen, that we will therefore have to prepare
for an emergency landing. Rescue services have been alerted. Please listen
carefully to the cabin crew who will instruct you in emergency landing
procedures.'
Two passengers leapt to their feet. 'Sit down. Now,' snapped the chief
steward.
Emergency landing procedures were read out quickly from a card, perhaps too
rapidly for already-racing minds to take in. 'Loosen neckties, feet under
seat, head on knees, hands on head.' A stewardess asked, in an exquisitely
inappropriate way, whether we were 'happy' with the instructions; individual
lessons were given to those who were not. At no time was any language other
than English used.
Emergency exits were pointed out and we were asked to locate the nearest to
us. Would assigned exits not be more sensible in order to avoid chaotic,
two-way traffic in the aisle, or is it unwise to be too prescriptive in the
face of unpredictable events?
The aircraft circled for the last time. I envied the cars and the cows
below, oblivious to the drama above their heads. The utter inability to
influence the outcome induced a bizarre calm. My brain was busy with
banalities rather than the meaning of life. Who would walk Muffin? Who would
write the articles for the survey on European Business Locations which had
put me up here?
At what seemed an extraordinarily slow speed, the aircraft dropped to the
end of the runway as the instruction came: 'Brace, brace, brace.' I
half-heartedly obeyed, resenting the potential indignity of being found with
my head between my knees.
The landing was, of course, perfect. Shrieks of 'Yes]' and applause broke
out. The aircraft stopped on a sixpence, surrounded by emergency vehicles; a
foam cannon pointed at the window.
A stewardess walked down the cabin and asked if everyone was all right. We
were 'safe', the captain said, but engineers were to insert pins in the
undercarriage before we moved another inch. The runway remained closed.
Our flight deck heroes thanked us for our calm; we thanked them for theirs.
'That should be worth a thousand free Air Miles,' someone told the chief
steward.
The incident was deeply disturbing, but the handling of potential calamity
by a well-rehearsed crew was professional and successful. On the return
trip, I studied the emergency procedures card for the first time in years,
comforted by the thought that the incident was as rare as it was unwelcome.
British Midland operates more than 52,000 flights a year and says it cannot
recall the last such electrical malfunction. It was, said a spokesman, a
'once in a lifetime experience for passengers and crew'.

It is hard to believe that yet another new set of Beethoven symphonies can
produce fresh insights, but John Eliot Gardiner's magnificent version with
the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique (Archiv Produktion) will surely
set new standards of excellence for future performances. Exploiting the
clarity and precision of period instruments, Gardiner has used recent work
by textual scholars to try to get closer to the composer's final thoughts on
these canonic pieces, resulting in some radical re-fashioning of tempi which
are barely recognisable from some of the lumbering recordings of the past.
If you like your Beethoven sprightly, listen and enjoy the work of a great
interpreter.
Before the designer suits and the Royal Albert Hall, Eric Clapton used to
play the blues. From the Cradle (Reprise) is an entirely logical follow-up
to the success of his Unplugged album, which proved definitively that there
was a new generation interested in the music which Clapton grew up with.
They are all here - Willie Dixon, Elmore James, a lovely 'How Long Blues'
and great guitar-playing all round - but there is also a distinct shortage
of surprises.
Sinead O'Connor (below), on the other hand, would rather grow her hair long
than produce a predictable album. Universal Mother (Ensign) has the most
cringe-worthy moments on an album since John Lennon's Primal Scream period,
but she shares with him a raw and passionate intensity which is hard to
ignore. Motherhood is her pre-occupation this time round, although grief,
Irish political history and Kurt Cobain also get a look in.
A new batch of rare jazz recordings has been re-issued by EMI on their Blue
Note Connoisseur series. Pick of the current crop is True Blue by Tina
Brooks, a talented and unjustly neglected tenor saxophonist, who teams up in
this 1960 session with Freddie Hubbard and Duke Jordan.
Esa-Pekka Salonen, conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic, continues his
efforts to popularise modern music with his world premiere recording of
Witold Lutoslawski's Fourth Symphony, coupled with the same composer's Third
Symphony and Les Espaces du Sommeil (Sony).
Latest move to bring affordable classical recordings to an ever-expanding
audience is EMI's partnership with WH Smith in producing a range of
compilations of Gilbert and Sullivan, Bach, Beethoven, Maria Callas, early
hymns and psalms, as well as themed collections on
'Vienna', 'the spirit of Russia' and more.

circus and discovers that sales of white Ford Broncos have gone up by 30 per
cent since the allegation that Simpson used it as a getaway car. Such is the
power of fame in America that in a recent poll a large majority of people
thought Simpson could not be guilty because he is too famous and
good-looking. Watch and wonder.
Carlton Television's sponsorship deal with the Donmar Warehouse bears fruit
with this special televisation of its production of Cabaret (Wednesday
10.40-12.40am, lTV). Those who didn't manage to get a ticket can console
themselves with this production, although it won't have the audience
participation of the original, in which performers at the Kit Kat Club would
lead members of the audience into a dance. Jane Horrocks as the cut-price
chanteuse is somewhat inconsistent, and therefore unconvincing. However,
Alan Cummings, as the sleazy MC, leers into the lens with great aplomb. Sam
Mendes' award-winning production is much closer to what lsherwood might have
seen in the Weimar Republic so don't expect it to be anything like the
cleaned up Hollywood version.
Radio Four's funniest comedy Knowing Me Knowing You. With Alan Partridge
makes its transition to television (Friday, 10.00-10.30pm, BBC2) with the
eponymous spoof chat show host blundering his way through more interviews in
a set modelled on the lobby of a 'top international hotel'. The TV version
is less subtle, and
therefore not as much of a
guffaw-inducer as its sound-only predecessor, but, nonetheless, when it
works, it works spectacularly well.
The entourage following operatic superstars tends to consist of yes-men,
rather than lensmen, so the BBC is crowing about being allowed to tail
Placido Domingo while he jetted around the world. The result has been
chopped into four documentaries entitled Placido Domingo: Tales From the
Opera (Sunday, 8.00-9.00pm, BBC2). He comes across as a genuinely amiable
man, and opera lovers will relish being allowed into rehearsals.
The most talented member of the Just A Minute team and the most miserable
panelist on Have l Got News For You, gives us the ones he's loved from the
world of variety in Paul Merton's Palladium Story (Sunday, 8.00-8.50pm,
BBC1), a two part documentary on the pleasure palace. It is a bit long on
anecdotes, not all of which are up to scratch, but includes some good
archive material.

World peace is bad news for world cinema. As yesterday's villains become
today's peacemakers - sometimes even as the films hit the screen (see Tommy
Lee Jones' Irish terrorist in the recent Blown Away) - where do Hollywood
and Harrison Ford turn? After Russians in The Hunt For Red October and the
IRA in Patriot Games, the new Tom Clancy page-to-screen romp is Clear And
Present Danger. Colombian drug barons are the baddies - no danger of detente
there - and the action is brisk, if not intellectually stretching, with Ford
in prime form.
If you want art not action, there is Smoking/No Smoking. In a corner of a
French studio that is forever England, director Alain Resnais gives us his
five-hour, two-film version of Alan Ayckbourn's playlet series, Intimate
Exchanges. Warm to the prettily eccentric visuals: France's idea of a
seaside public school is out of Fragonard by Osbert Lancaster. But be
warned: the film is also Very Long.
You could stay at home by your VCR and see something short about British
boarding-school life. The Terence Davies Trilogy, made in the late 1970s and
now on video, is three dour, searing vignettes - barely making feature
length together - about the agony and occasional ecstasy of institutional
growing up. From the future director of Distant Voices, Still Lives, here is
a calling card in black-and-white, with all the pained, pithy eloquence to
come.
In brief: Two National Film Theatre treats for September. One is a
neatly-timed Alain Resnais season, giving us the Maitre's oeuvre from Last
Year In Marienbad to this year in Ayckbournland. The other is a round-up of
that other great time-juggler, Britain's Nicolas Roeg. Performance, Don't
Look Now, Eureka ..All the fun of the subliminal flashback and eyeblink
jump-cut, and of the once most inventive mind in British cinema.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Sport: King Lear at the Palace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watching live athletics is almost as different as can be imagined from
watching the sport on television. At the World Cup meeting staged last
weekend at Crystal Palace, I spent several hours trying to think what,
exactly, the spectacle in the arena reminded me of. Eventually it clicked.
Anyone who has, during the last year or so, attended a performance by the
Royal Shakespeare Company will be familiar with those dumb show opening
scenes that directors so love. Convinced that they can improve upon the
beginning of, say, King Lear, they have their cast come on to the stage and
parade meaningfully, performing bits of silent business as they swerve
dramatically in their big boots. To the audience, the whole thing looks
pointless, indeed shambolic, though at the same time it is obvious that some
choreographic hand, some guiding principle, is behind it all.
The World Cup meeting looked just like that. On to the stage strolled
phalanxes of attendant lords and ladies, self-important in their badges of
officialdom. Then, in their midst, appeared a troupe of taut young men
wearing costumes that proclaimed their different factions; after a few
moments they began to perform complicated rituals, readying themselves for
acts of great dynamism. Suddenly, behind them, a small army of women began
to hurl missiles across the stage. The scene had filled with a diversity of
displays which pulled one eye in one direction and the other in at least
another three.
Television invests athletics with intense concentration but, in reality,
this is diffused by confusion: little ladies in blazers scuttle past Linford
Christie as he runs his lap of honour; discuses are thrown at Sally
Gunnell's head; medal ceremonies take place as, behind them, a lone 10,000
metres runner completes her race five minutes after the thing has been won.
Of course there are moments when significance is palpable within this scene,
as for example at the appearance of King Lear - Christie, himself. But these
are fleeting compared with the general impression of amiable chaos. What I
remember most is watching preparation rather than action. Most athletes
spend about 5 per cent of their time on stage doing what they are supposed
to be doing; 95 per cent of it they spend in revving themselves up, hobbling
up and down the track as if afflicted with gout, visualising, improvising
and, above all, getting dressed and undressed. In fact, what the World Cup
meeting really reminded me of was a rehearsal of an RSC dumb-show opening
scene.
But if the spectacle has the self-obsessed, faintly comical and occasionally
thrilling aspect of highbrow theatre, its audience is a very different one
from those who worship at the Barbican Centre. This crowd was, in fact, pure
David Cassidy concert audience circa 1973. All sporting crowds disseminate
different atmospheres, from the testosterone-suffused one at football
matches, to the Airwick-fresh one of tennis tournaments; here, the dominant
force is that of the teeny-bopper.
Adults become afflicted with it too, scurrying around Crystal Palace for a
glimpse of Du'ane Ladejo's back. Autograph books are carried like begging
bowls. Girlish wails fill the sky as Linford Christie removes his sweatshirt
though, since the screaming is just as loud for Gunnell, it is presumably
familiarity rather than physicality that causes the excitement.
It is a friendly atmosphere, pleasantly remote from the glamorised, moneyed
and almost decadent image of athletics that tends to be presented by the
media. There is something reassuring in the teeny-boppers' unquestioning
love for their heroes. This is partly because they are expressing something
that one might feel oneself, but would never dare to express so
uninhibitedly; partly too because they are cutting through the crust of
cynicism that has grown over the sport, and proving, with their trust, that
much of athletics is still trustworthy.
It may be that the atmosphere is rather different at, for example, those
Grand Prix meetings in which athletes compete for the proceeds of the
Brinks-Mat robbery. After all, the World Cup has at its heart a premise that
derives from the amateur tradition: it is an event in which competitors
represent nations or continents, rather than themselves, and at which
winners walk away with honour rather than with an armful of gold bars.
For this reason the World Cup is derided by some, who see it as almost
hypocritically inappropriate to the world of modern athletics.
Paradoxically, they also criticise any top athlete who fails to appear at
it.
Like the sport itself, such people seem uneasy with the current balance
between professionalism and amateurism - what, they wonder, ought to be
going on? Is it ridiculous, or is it charming, to expect supreme soloists to
want to subsume their identities into that of a nation or continent? The
fact is that it doesn't matter. The crowd at Crystal Palace proved that, as
it took constant pleasure in the notion of belonging to and owning a team,
but found real joy in the sight of individual greatness.

FT  12 SEP 94 / This Week: FT Guide to Coal Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After 47 years in the public sector, the British coal industry is being
privatised. Why?
The government says its sees privatisation as giving the industry the best
chance of improving productivity and ensuring the largest economically
viable coal industry which the market could support aim in the long term.
Another (unstated) attraction is that privatisation would free ministers
from direct involvement with an industry which frequently causes it
political problems like the public outcry over pit closures two years ago.
What do the unions think about it?
Arthur Scargill, NUM president, and other union leaders have tried hard to
thwart the government's privatisation plans but to little effect. Their
moment seemed to come two years ago when the public backed their campaign to
halt pre-privatisation pit closures. But the government retreated only
temporarily and has since closed more mines than it announced even in
October 1992. The NUM remains vehemently opposed to privatisation but the
Union of Democratic Mineworkers, which broke away from it after the 1984-85
pits strike, is part of a consortium bidding for some British Coal's mining
assets in Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire.
What is for sale?
The government is offering the 16 operating deep mines and 32 opencast sites
in five 'core' regions, and seven mothballed pits as stand-alone entities.
Non-mining assets, including Coal Products, the smokeless fuel manufacturer,
and British Fuel Groups, fuel distributor, are being sold separately by
British Coal. Of the core regions South Wales and Scotland are likely to
attract the largest number of bids because of their access to high-quality
coal near the surface. The other regions are the north-east of England,
which is exclusively opencast, and central north and central south regions,
where all but one of the 16 operating mines are located.
How much is it all worth?
The proceeds are small by comparison with other privatisations but could
still raise more than Pounds 1bn. The non-mining subsidiaries alone make a
combined operating profit of Pounds 40m a year on turnover of Pounds 700m
and, according to some analysts, could be worth more than Pounds 500m. Of
the core regions, the central north and central south regions are likely to
attract the highest bids because of the value of contracts with electricity
generators which last until 1998. David Price, editor of Coal UK, an FT
newsletter, says the annual profits of the two regions could be more than
Pounds 150m a year (although this will be decreased by whatever the
successful bidder pays for the assets).
What is the sale timetable?
Bidders for the core regions and stand-alone pits must put in their tenders
by 5pm on Wednesday. The government is likely to announce a preferred bidder
for each region by the end of next month and hopes to complete the sales by
December 24. Timetables for non-mining sales vary, although some deals will
not be completed until next year.
Who are the bidders for the core regions?
Although there is nothing to stop a bidder putting in tenders for all five
regions, British Coal seems certain to be split up. The government favours
competition and, in any case, few bidders are contemplating an all-embracing
bid. Of 25 'parties' which have applied successfully for the right to bid,
only RTZ is an international coal company and it is unlikely to join the
fray. Of the others, recently floated RJB Mining is among the few likely to
bid for all five regions. Other companies considering bids for one or more
regions, but not all five, include construction companies Taylor Woodrow,
Miller Group, Amec and Wimpey. Exclusively mining companies include Ryan
Group and Coal Investments. CI, run by Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal
commercial director, is likely to bid for the central north and south
regions in a consortium with the UDM. Other bidders include three management
buy-out teams, one of which hopes to win control of all three English
regions.
What will happen to jobs?
Coal privatisation is unusual in that the industry has been rationalised
before, rather than after, privatisation. The workforce 10 years ago was
more than 220,000. By the end of this year it will be about 12,000. Some
40,000 jobs have gone in the last two years alone, as the government has cut
the number of operating deep mine pits from 50 to 16. More job losses are
inevitable after privatisation as the industry continues to improve
efficiency. More deep mines could close too. Significant changes to working
practices will occur as the new owners take advantage of a recent agreement
to introduce flexible shifts.
Will the industry survive?
There will certainly be a coal mining industry in the next century but it
may be rather smaller, and possibly much smaller, than now. The two large
electricity generators in England and Wales will require 15m tonnes of coal
a year (half their current purchases) just for the two coal-fired power
stations to which they have fitted equipment to reduce sulphur emissions.
The size of the total market will depend on factors including the price of
gas, the other main generation fuel, and the progress of the nuclear
industry's plans to build more nuclear power stations. But the price of
world coal will be the biggest influence on size; if buyers can purchase
supplies more cheaply from abroad than the UK there will be nothing to stop
them from doing so.

<TEXT>
Dirk Bogarde was a good, under-recognised film actor who has become a good,
under-recognised writer. That under-recognition may be changing. His
autobiographical volumes, from A Postillion Struck By Lightning through to
the latest, A Short Walk From Harrods, have acquired, deservedly, a
respectful following, and his novels, most recently Jericho, have confirmed
that he has the gift.
A Period Of Adjustment, following on from Jericho, will be well received.
The narrator inherits a house in the south of France from a brother who has
died of Aids. He visits, likes it, settles, decides to stay, and in the
process wins his 10-year-old son Giles from his estranged, career-woman
wife. He falls in love with his sister-in-law, mother of a Down's Syndrome
child; there is a tragedy on the last page.
That's all. It takes a very confident writer to carry off a story which
relies on so skimpy a 'plot', and Bogarde demonstrates on every page - most
of all in the dialogue (where his actor's skills may have helped),
especially tricky here where most of the characters are speaking French most
of the time - that he has taught himself a second profession.
There are three focal points. The first is the house: 'Jericho lay still and
silent, like a sleeping dog in the sun. I stopped the car beside the mossy
pillar which marked the boundary of the land, and Giles got out. We stood
looking up the path through the potager, past the big cherry and the fig, to
the long, low, rough-stone house, the two sentinel cypress trees (one for
Peace, one for Prosperity), the green curtain of heavy vine falling from the
iron trellis shading the terrace . . .'
The second is the narrator's sense of a new life (''Perhaps Jericho will be
a terrific healer? You know? A complete change-around. A new life. One
doesn't often get a second try at life, does one?'') The third is the
relationship between father and son, which is well done, convincing,
satisfying.
Let's not get carried away, this isn't Tolstoy. But it's that old-fashioned,
comfortable product, a middle-brow novel which gives pleasure. There can
never be enough of them.
A Period of Adjustment by Dirk Bogarde. (Viking Pounds 15, 280 pages)

FT  12 SEP 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - Leif Mills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leif Mills, at 58 the new president of Britain's Trades Union Congress, is
also general secretary of the Banking Insurance and Finance Union. He is the
first graduate from Balliol College, Oxford, to reach the heights of the TUC
and he is proud of that fact. An official of the union since national
service, he became general secretary in 1972 and was elected to the TUC
general council in 1983.
Most union leaders have been kept off public bodies over the past 15 years
but not Mills. He sat on the armed forces pay review from 1980 to 1987 and
was on the Monopolies and Mergers Commission from 1982 to 1991. A member of
Investors in People UK and the council of the National Council for
Vocational Qualifications, he is currently a trustee of the Civic Trust.
Along with a phone and fax, what piece of office equipment would you need on
the island?
A word processor so I could write a new novel. I have already written one
that is unpublished about the TUC Congress called A Week in the life of
Smith, Brown and Jones.
What would you take to remind yourself of early days in the union?
I would take the first copy of our magazine - The Bank Clerk - which I
edited.
Who would you take with you besides your family?
Sir Ranulph Fiennes. I would like to hear about his polar expeditions.
What food would you like to eat?
Big jars of prawns with mayonnaise.
And to drink?
A couple of hogs heads of Brakspeare brew, a local Henley beer.
What would you take to read?
The Worst Journey in The World by Aspley Cherry-Garrard, the story of
Scott's expedition to the Antarctic. It would be a useful antidote to the
heat of the desert island. But I'm a great Bertie Wooster fan so I would
like to take the PG Wodehouse books.
A film?
Carol Reed's The Third Man with Orson Welles. I know every word of the
dialogue. I would also like to take The Hill starring Sean Connery, which is
about the military police. I was a second lieutenant in the Royal Military
Police when I was doing my national service in Malaya.
What would you most like about desert island life?
Basking in the sunshine would be wonderful.
What would you most miss on the desert island?
The opportunity to row every week with my friends in my local rowing club.
One item to preserve your sanity?
I would love to take a computerised chess-set to play against. It would keep
my mind active.
One item to ease the strain?
A pipe with plenty of Gold Block tobacco. I still find smoking a relaxation.
Any regrets?
That I just failed to win an Oxford rowing blue.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Management: Volumes in learning - take it as read
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What happens to all those management books that get published in greater
number each year? There must be a market for them, or publishers would not
print so many. But who has the time (or the inclination) to sit down and
read them?
The answer seems to be, practically nobody. Managers buy the books, only to
leave them on their shelves for show-off value, or at best to dip into them
briefly. The Management Training Partnership, a training consultancy, has
done some research into the reading habits of the UK's personnel directors,
and found that three-quarters of them buy at least four heavyweight
management books a year, but only one in five of these volumes stands any
chance of being read.
The problem is partly the books themselves - which are too long and too
tedious - and partly that managers have no opportunity to read volumes
during the day and no desire to do so at night.
While they may buy Charles Handy's latest or Michael Hammer's book on
re-engineering, the only book that they have actually read right through
over the years is The Goal, written by the Israeli eccentric Eli Goldratt.
And the reason they have read that is that it is written as a pacy novel.
The message to writers and publishers is that if they want their books to be
read, as well as sold, the style cannot be too downmarket, and the arguments
cannot be summarised too briefly nor in big enough letters.
So far the lesson has not been learnt: few books contain such summaries. The
problem may be that if you condense the arguments in many management books
too ruthlessly, you would be left with simple statements of the glaringly
obvious.
What does the inside of your bathroom cabinet look like? Is the toothbrush
near the toothpaste, and are both located for ease of access? Are your ties
hung up with the colours ranging from dark to light for speed of selection?
Is your breakfast routine organised in such a way that you do not move from
the cupboard to the table more than once? If not, you could be wasting
valuable minutes every day.
These are some of the handy tips contained in a new edition of How to Gain
an Extra Hour Every Day. This is one volume that does not suffer from the
general malaise of management books: it has sold 2.5m copies since it was
published in 1955, and almost every page is a quick-to-read summary,
containing few words of more than two syllables.
People may read this sort of thing - but do they take any notice? It is all
very well to be told to get up at 5am, do several hours' work before
breakfast, to move your toothbrush from its accustomed space, and to make
lists of priorities every day on a wallchart in your office, which will be
so tidy it will have almost nothing else in it. But try living that way.
It's easier to show willing by buying the book.
Ray Josephs, the author of this fine work, is 82 years old and still
charging round Europe armed with aide memoires and maps, and sending off
letters with all the important bits highlighted in yellow pen.
He is part of a tradition of elderly management writers who seem to keep
going longer than people in almost any other line of business. W. Edwards
Deming, the father of them all and inventor of total quality management, was
93 when he died last year. Peter Drucker is in his mid-80s and still going
strong.
At first sight it is surprising that in an area so full of fads, gurus can
survive for half a century and more. Perhaps it proves that it's a cushy
life being a guru. Alternatively, it shows that fashions change only on the
surface; people will always want more time, to be better at motivating
employees, and to achieve greater efficiency. Anyone on to a good idea does
well to stick to it.
I was taken aback the other day to get a letter inviting me to reconsider a
donation I had made to the Rwanda Emergency Appeal. Apparently the
government has decided that anyone who gives more than Pounds 50 with a
credit card in response to a charity's plea on TV should be allowed to think
better of it.
There are many expenditures that it would be good to be given a chance to
reconsider, but this happens not to be one of them. What about that awful
sofa, that expensive holiday, that ludicrous pair of shoes, that second-hand
car with the alarming clanking sound? And what about all those sluggish
investments?
Some shops give you your money back if you change your mind, but for most
expenditures there is no way out. As there is nothing to insure us from a
burst of greed or vanity, why should we be given protection from a
shortlived burst of generosity?
Perhaps the government feels that the sight of starving children beamed into
our living rooms makes us spend more than we otherwise would. But surely
that is the whole point.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Management: The flamboyant troubleshooter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jean-Marie Descarpentries is an enfant terrible among French managers.
Unusually flamboyant, voluble and opinionated, his reputation as a turnround
specialist is laced with controversy.
His special talent is for provoking change in companies in crisis; managing
in untroubled times is not his forte. 'Creative confusion' typically
describes his style. He is fond of boasting that he has been fired from
every job he has held with the exception of McKinsey &amp; Co, the management
consultancy, where he worked between 1969 and 1976.
The companies with which he has been involved include the glassmakers Saint
Gobain of France and Glaverbel of Belgium. As chair-man and chief executive
of Carnaud, a leading French packaging group, he first restored the company
to health, then led the Pounds 780m acquisition of the UK's Metal Box
Packaging in 1988.
What Descarpentries did for Carnaud has been described as a textbook
corporate turnround. It lost FFr159m (Pounds 19.3m) on sales of FFr4.6bn in
1981; by the time of the merger it was making FFr365m on sales of FFr7.23bn.
The merged company, one of Europe's largest in the packaging business,
proved less of a success as Descarpentries found that his cerebral theories
about managers who behave either as horsemen or monks drew little response
from the pragmatic British. Tensions grew within the company, senior
managers left and performance fell away. Finally, after two years of
increasing tension he quit. Critics say he underestimated how hard it would
be to restructure Metal Box.
Trained at the Ecole Polytechnique, he was a paratrooper while in the army.
Stories abound of the tactics he uses to shock people into action. While he
may have mellowed, he shows no signs of slowing down. At 57, he works
extraordinary hours. Meetings often last until 10 or 11pm, explained only
partly by the fact that during the week he lives by himself, joining his
wife at the weekends at their 17th-century farmhouse south of Paris. For the
average company doctor, Groupe Bull might be the last big turnround, but
Descarpentries is already talking intriguingly about his next job.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Management: A last-ditch survival mission - How France's
troubled Groupe Bull is being turned around as it prepares for privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Eisenhower, then supreme Allied commander, pondered the future of
Europe in this bare room near Versailles. Today it is the boardroom of
Groupe Bull, the troubled French computer manufacturer, and Jean-Marie
Descarpentries, chairman and chief executive, does the pondering.
There has been much to think about since his appointment 10 months ago.
Bull, state-owned and awash with red ink, is in crisis. Its move from a
prestigious Paris address in Rue de Malakoff, first to a tower block in the
city's financial district and then to this sprawl of tin-roofed sheds at
Louveciennes, reflects its straitened circumstances.
In the early days of Nato, the Louveciennes complex was the supreme
headquarters of the Allied powers in Europe. It has been owned by Bull for
years but has been unused until now. When the remaining headquarters staff
have moved in, it will save about FFr500m (Pounds 61m) a year.
Every franc counts. Bull, which turned over FFr28.25bn last year, has lost
some FFr15bn in the past three years and has depended on continued
government investment for survival. But the government's patience and that
of the competition authorities in Brussels is exhausted.
Bull will receive a final tranche of FFr3.1bn this year to clear its debts.
Descarpentries, a controversial figure noted for his colourful management
theories and his turnround skills - though they are not infallible - was
appointed by Gerard Longuet, industry minister, with a mandate to prepare
the company for privatisation.
At the time, the mission seemed almost impossible. Bull was among the
weakest of the traditional full-line computer makers, including IBM and
Unisys. They were caught flat-footed by sudden changes in the computer
market which promoted the growth of networked small computers at the expense
of large machines.
Bull and the others found themselves with declining mainframe sales, a cost
structure out of line with potential revenues, and short of skill in the
technologies needed to compete in the new industry.
The company's situation was aggravated by two additional burdens. It had
been France's computer champion for years, making the search for new
investors politically sensitive. Moreover, years of state ownership had
inculcated a stultifying civil service mentality which Descarpentries'
predecessors, the analytical Francis Lorentz and the bluff Bernard Pache,
seemed unable to counter.
Descarpentries seems, however, to have made remarkable progress in a short
time. In the first half of the current year losses were more than halved,
from FFr1.98m to FFr843m. Now he and his senior managers are talking
confidently of making an operating profit for the year as a whole. By the
middle of next year, they say, the company will be into net profit.
Privatisation is expected to start in November.
If their predictions are correct, Bull will become much more attractive as a
potential partner for other companies. Brussels, furthermore, will have to
accept that the billions of French francs poured into the company in the
past few years have been important to the company's restructuring.
George McNeil, head of Bull Europe, says it is no mirage: 'We are a
different company from six months ago. The culture has changed. Progress has
become the norm.'
Cynics counter that it is not difficult to transform the short-term
financial results of a company in Bull's position. Staff numbers can be cut,
and unprofitable operations closed or sold off. Such measures can damage a
company's viability, however, making it difficult to return to growth.
Critical skills are lost with people made redundant; some operations,
although loss-making at the time, may prove essential to future strategy.
Descarpentries says he rejected this traditional approach in favour of what
he describes as a 'different' turnround technique, which puts what he calls
'tension' on every part of the company by establishing benchmarks against
which progress is measured.
Staff numbers continue to fall, nevertheless. There are about 29,000 today
compared with 33,000 when he arrived. Comparison with other companies
suggests the workforce is still too large.
Descarpentries' initial analysis told him he could expect a rapid turnround.
His diagnosis was that Bull had solid business strengths, loyal customers
and a history of sound strategic decisions. But operations, the management
structure and reporting systems were weak. He estimated that curing these
faults would take 18 months. In the opposite case, where a company is sound
operationally but has weak business fundamentals, turnround takes twice as
long, he argues.
He was encouraged by data showing that the information technology business
is growing strongly - 6 or 7 per cent a year - offering rich opportunities
in Europe, where computerisation has proceeded more slowly than in the US.
The task, then, was to restore Bull to profitability rapidly, and then find
ways for it to grow at least as fast as the industry. This includes
broadening its equity base - NEC of Japan, IBM of the US and France Telecom
already hold stakes - and finding more business partners for its product
operations. Two more, Motorola and Tandem Computers of the US, were
announced on Friday.
Improving Bull's operational capability called for a complete change of
management and reporting methods. Three weeks into the job, Descarpentries
set about choosing the top 10 managers in Bull (from a list of 25) to form a
new executive team to run the company. He chose those whose track record and
performance at interview identified them as people who got things done.
Many of the existing managers, he thought, placed cleverness above action:
'A lot of the top people came to me without any figures. They knew a lot;
their ideas were very conceptual. I did not understand what they told me,
but I am sure it was very clever. But they never told me: 'My turnover is
this, my profit margin is that.' '
Those who failed to make the top 10 either left the company or settled for
lower positions. A key point was that Descarpentries was choosing people,
not filling positions. As he admits, at the time he did not know enough
about the company to know what kind of structure was required. He reckoned,
however, that if he put power in the hands of the best people, the rest
would follow.
Descarpentries next took his newly appointed executive board to the holiday
town of St Malo in the middle of winter for three days and nights of almost
continuous talks. He asked them to choose the next 100 top managers to staff
the organisation.
Only in the last hour of the session, however, did he tell the 10 what
positions he wanted them to take in the structure - the objective being to
get unbiased views of the abilities of the middle managers under discussion
free from pre-emptive strikes on behalf of particular executives.
Today, Bull is decentralised and streamlined. There are seven
product/service divisions, four geographic networks covering the globe and
three corporate functions: organisation, business development and finance.
Old Bull hands say the company used to be dominated by the finance
department. Today, conventional budgets have all but been scrapped and
managers are measured only in terms of progress against the previous month's
figures.
Only 10 business criteria - revenue, headcount, profit margin and so on -
are used for monthly reporting, replacing the thousands of business
statistics which used to be collected. Descarpentries says: 'We have changed
our financial culture completely. We measure only progress and, at the end
of each six-month period, we compare ourselves to the best in the field.'
All of this was put in place between November 10 and 13 last year.
There is strong pressure to reduce non-salary costs: the move to
Louveciennes is an example. In the first half of this year, these costs fell
by Dollars 108m (Pounds 70m), which Descarpentries regards as a good start.
Salaries and benefits are similarly under pressure, with some salaries
frozen. Revenues rose an encouraging 12 per cent at the half-way stage,
suggesting Descarpentries is on the right track.
The recent history of the computer industry has been full of false dawns,
however, and it will take several sets of good results before the sceptics
will be convinced that the change is permanent.
When asked if Bull's recovery looks real, a senior manager for one of its
European rivals shrugged his shoulders. Perhaps, his gesture said, but hopes
have been dashed before and this is a fickle business.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Jail break did not breach ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government dismissed fears from rightwing Tory MPs and some unionists
that the failed attempt by IRA prisoners to shoot their way out of Whitemoor
jail in Cambridgeshire on Friday night would affect the peace process.
Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist security spokesman, said that the
attempted breakout broke the ceasefire and showed that the IRA had not
changed its spots.
However, Downing Street said that the attempted jail break did not breach
the ceasefire and would have no effect on the search for a permanent peace.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Tory chief admits 'yobs' gaffe was incompetent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporter
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jeremy Hanley, Tory party chairman, agreed last night that questions had
been raised about his competence for the job. The admission came after he
had described a serious disturbance at a boxing tournament as 'just
exuberance'.
Senior Labour figures seized on the gaffe, which came only two days after Mr
John Major, the prime minister, declared war on 'yob culture' and admitted
that there was widespread fear in the community of crime and violence.
Early yesterday morning Sir David Frost asked Mr Hanley on BBC television to
comment on scenes at Saturday's super-middleweight bout in Birmingham
between world champion Nigel Benn and Juan Carlos Gimenez of Paraguay.
Chairs were thrown and several people were injured. Mr Frank Warren, the
fight promoter, said that security had 'completely broken down' before the
police arrived.
Sir David asked Mr Hanley if the scenes in Birmingham had been an example of
'British yobs at work'. Mr Hanley, smiling broadly, replied: 'No, I think
that sort of thing, you know, it's just exuberance . . .'
He later described his comments as 'clearly an incompetent response'.
Interviewed on Sky television, Mr Hanley admitted: 'Yes, as you say, it
queries my competence.' He explained that he had not seen film of the events
in Birmingham before Sir David had asked for his comments.
Mr Hanley said: 'As soon as I saw the film I was absolutely horrified
because it was exactly the sort of yobbish behaviour - indeed worse than
that - that John Major was describing, and condemning quite rightly. Yes, I
have made a mistake and I am very willing to apologise for it. This is
completely my fault.'
Later Conservative Central Office, of which Mr Hanley is head, denied that
the chairman had admitted that his competence was in question. 'There is no
question of Mr Hanley resigning or stepping down,' an official said. 'This
was just a small mistake made on a television interview.'
Mr David Blunkett, Labour party chairman, said: 'Mr Hanley's admission of
his mistake and inexperience amply demonstrates John Major's mistake and
continuing ineptitude in having appointed him to such a senior position in
the Conservative party.'

FT  12 SEP 94 / Chipper outlook for spud supremos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The humble spud is making a comeback against the combined onslaught of rice
and pasta, a conference in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, will be told today.
Delegates to the World Potato Congress, which opened last night with a gala
reception and a parade of flags of the 50 countries attending the two-day
event, will be told how advertising and ideas for new recipes have reversed
a drift away from the potato.
Consumption in the UK fell from 105kg per head a year in the early 1980s to
99kg in 1991 as consumers were attracted to 'glamorous' pasta or rice
dishes.
But an advertising campaign by the Potato Marketing Board, in its third year
of five, has helped push consumption up to 107kg, said Mr Bob Griffiths, the
board's marketing services manager.
The increase has been in processed potatoes but Mr Griffiths added: 'Our
efforts have stopped the slide in consumption of fresh potatoes.'
The campaign has focused on the nutritional value of potatoes and their
versatility. Consumer surveys suggest potatoes are difficult to prepare
compared with pasta, sales of which are rising 10 per cent a year.
So far the potato board has spent Pounds 5.5m on the campaign although the
industry might be seen as overreacting. Rice consumption, although 70 per
cent higher than a decade ago, is just 3kg per head in dry weight and pasta
consumption is just over 2kg. The retail potato market is worth Pounds 3.5bn
compared with an estimated Pounds 185m for pasta.
Potato prices have risen 50 per cent this year however, due to lower
plantings and a poor harvest. But Mr Griffiths insisted there is no evidence
of consumer resistance. 'People are prepared to pay more providing they get
a good-quality product.'

FT  12 SEP 94 / Number of big employers falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The past decade has witnessed a shift in employment away from the large
employer, according to figures published today.
At the same time there has been a jump in the number of people with the
power to take on or shed staff.
The figures from the Department of Employment show that most people in work
are now employed by businesses with fewer than 100 people.
The figures, compiled by Vista Communications, employment consultants, show
the extent of the decline of the large company.
The report says that there were 300,000 more businesses employing 100 people
or fewer in 1991 than there were in 1981. During the same 10-year period the
number of companies employing more than 500 people fell 25 per cent.
'The effect of this change is to create nearly a third of a million more
chief executives with the power to hire and fire,' Mr Peter Walker, Vista's
managing director, writes in the report.
The report identifies two main reasons for the growth of small businesses.
First, a federalisation of large conglomerates and public utilities has been
caused by the need to control costs and act more flexibly towards the
customer.
Second, technology is allowing companies to concentrate on core business and
contract out the supply of goods and services where necessary.
'This can be seen particularly in electronics where it is now almost
impossible to purchase a product which is wholly manufactured by one
company,' says Mr Walker.
He adds that the new breed of managing director needs to be more responsive
to employees.

FT  12 SEP 94 / PM confident Clinton will rebuff Adams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is confident that Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, will
turn down a request to meet Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, who is
expected to visit the US later this month.
The Irish government is understood to believe that a meeting between the
Sinn Fein leader and Mr Clinton would move the peace process forward.
However, Downing Street, which is opposed to Mr Adams being granted a visa,
has lobbied hard against any meeting with the US president which it believes
would enrage unionists. It is confident that the US State Department has
accepted its advice.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, has revealed that it was a
call from him to Mr Clinton which cleared the way for a US visa to be issued
to Mr Joe Cahill, a veteran republican, on the eve of the IRA ceasefire. Mr
Reynolds said he believed that the ceasefire would not have come about if
the visa had not been issued to Mr Cahill.
Meanwhile European Union foreign ministers were briefed in Germany by Mr
Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign
minister, on the peace process. Mr Hurd said the IRA would have to prove by
'words and deeds' that its ceasefire was permanent.
Mr Spring said he believed the joint declaration signed in Dublin on Tuesday
by Mr Reynolds, Mr Adams and Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly nationalist
SDLP, proved that the Irish government's interpretation of the IRA ceasefire
announcement was correct.
'As far as we are concerned, the leadership of the IRA has made a
declaration, they have renounced violence and that is on a permanent basis,'
he said.
It was now up to the British government to respond positively by announcing
its acceptance of the ceasefire.
The province is already guaranteed nearly Pounds 1bn in EU aid and the Irish
Republic Pounds 6bn in the next six years.
But Mr Spring made clear that more must be done 'to meet the needs of the
new situation'.
The EU has already contributed about a third of the Pounds 230m made
available so far to the International Fund for Ireland, set up after the
Anglo-Irish agreement in 1989 to support peace initiatives through
job-creation schemes and other aid.
The call for more cash won the approval of the other foreign ministers, who
instructed the European Commission to draw up plans for extra funding in
consultation with London and Dublin.
However, final proposals are not expected to be ready until December.
Mr Hurd tried to reassure unionists that they had nothing to fear from the
peace process.
He said: 'I hope they will recognise that it is a straightforward decision
by the IRA that the armed struggle is not working, it is not producing
results and that they should abandon it as prescribed in the Downing Street
declaration.'
He also indicated that there would be no early lifting of the broadcast ban
on Sinn Fein.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Cashless society suffers a setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of transactions settled in cash rose for the first time in at
least seven years, a survey showed yesterday.
The Association for Payment Clearing Services for banks and building
services said the number of cash payments of more than Pounds 1 rose 1.6 per
cent to 16.9bn.
It was the first time in the seven years the survey has been running that
the number of cash transactions rose, accounting for 63 per cent of all
transactions.
Non-cash transactions also grew 2 per cent last year to 8.9bn.
The association said the rise in cash transactions last year had been
unexpected and was unlikely to be maintained as the economy recovered.
The biggest area of growth for non-cash payments was debit cards, rising 26
per cent last year to 2m a day, only slightly less than the volume of
credit-card purchases.
Debit cards were winning market share from cheques and were expected to
achieve 'double-digit growth rates' for the rest of the decade.
It said credit-card purchases, after falling in 1991 when annual fees were
introduced, had recovered in 1992 and last year, and were expected to grow
about 4 per cent a year until the end of the decade.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Archer not expected at party conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative party managers are relieved that Lord Archer is not expected to
attend the party conference next month.
The millionaire novelist and former deputy chairman of the party, who was
recently the subject of an investigation into alleged insider dealing, has
been a prominent figure at past conferences. However, party managers are
understood to be relieved he will not be present while questions remain over
his role in the purchase of Anglia Television shares.
Mr Jeremy Hanley, Tory party chairman, said Lord Archer would not be able to
attend next month's gathering in Bournemouth because he was busy with his
duties as a working Conservative peer.
'I don't think he is actually coming for the simple reason that the House of
Lords are well in session,' he said yesterday on BBC television. 'They have
got a running three-line whip and he is a hard-working peer.'
Lord Archer's share dealing was investigated by the Department of Trade and
Industry after a business associate of Lord Archer - whose wife is a
non-executive director of Anglia - made an Pounds 80,000 profit.
Although Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, ruled that no
action would be taken over the deal, Labour MPs have been pressing for a
full explanation of Lord Archer's role in the affair.
Mr Hanley warned that Lord Archer may have to bow to pressure and make a
full public statement when he returns to Britain from a book-signing tour
abroad. 'It is very much a matter for Jeffrey,' he said.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Dairy trade launches court battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dairy trade will this week begin its legal battle to overturn new milk
marketing arrangements which it believes will force up retail prices and
bring in a flood of imports.
The Dairy Trade Federation, which represents milk processors, intends today
to submit to the High Court its case for judicial review of the government's
approval of the scheme.
The hearing to decide whether it has an arguable case is expected later this
week or early next week.
Dairy companies are challenging the selling system introduced by Milk
Marque, the farmers' voluntary co-operative, which takes over when the
statutory Milk Marketing Board is abolished on November 1.
They say the auction system, under which they have tendered for supplies
from Milk Marque, has increased their costs by up to 24 per cent for some
dairy products.
Mr John Price, director-general of the federation, said its lawyers would
argue that Mrs Gillian Shephard, then agriculture minister, was wrong on two
counts under the 1993 Agriculture Act when she approved arrangements for
opening up the Pounds 3.3bn market in England and Wales in June.
'No reasonable minister knowing what she and her officials knew at the time
could possibly say this purchasing system took account of the interests of
purchasers,' he said.
Even if she believed that, Mrs Shephard was wrong to assume the scheme took
account of consumers' and farmers' interests and would lead to competition
in milk marketing, he said.
The dairy trade argues that Milk Marque, which controls 65 per cent of
supplies, has a monopoly of the market. Because of European Union milk
quotas, British farmers can produce only 85 per cent of domestic dairy
needs, and processors say they have little choice but to buy the bulk of
their milk from Milk Marque at the prices it sets.
Last week Tesco, the supermarket group, said UK price rises would force it
to buy dairy products from continental Europe.
If the federation wins leave for a judicial review, it hopes its case will
be judged next month before November's planned market deregulation.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Pensions body calls for more time on shortfalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Association of Pension Funds has urged the government to allow
employers more time to make up shortfalls in pension schemes when tougher
funding rules take effect.
The government proposed in a white paper a minimum solvency standard which
would require pension schemes to hold enough assets to pay the 'cash
equivalent' value of each member's benefits if the scheme were wound up
immediately.
It proposed that schemes with assets of 90 per cent or more of the standard
should have up to three years to make up the shortfall but those below that
should make up the shortfall within three months.
The association wants the government to allow the schemes meeting 90 per
cent or more of the standard to have up to 10 years, and those below 90 per
cent up to three years.
The association said it 'believes that such cash injections would be
extremely disruptive and unnecessary for financially sound employers'.
The purpose of the new standard is to ensure that members of pension schemes
receive all promised benefits if the scheme is wound up. In many cases an
employer is insolvent following wind-up and scheme members cannot receive
their entitlements.
Critics who oppose giving employers more time to make up a deficit point out
that too frequently it is employers in financial difficulty that do not have
the resources to fill the shortfall. By the time the longer grace period is
over, the shortfall may be even larger and the employer may have already
gone into receivership, they warn.
The association is urging the government to try to improve pension security
by setting a long-term funding standard. This is a reversal of the
association's initial position which had urged the Goode committee, advising
the government on occupational pension reform, to seek a minimum solvency
standard.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Teenagers 'still opt for traditional jobs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Teenagers are still opting for jobs traditionally associated with a
particular gender and are satisfied with the government's Youth Training
scheme, says the independent Policy Studies Institute.
An institute report, published today, says that more than half of young
women employees surveyed and over three-quarters of female trainees had
chosen occupations such as office work, hairdressing and caring.
More than half of young men asked were entering fields such as construction,
engineering or computing.
Ms Catherine Shaw, a research fellow at the institute and author of the
report, said: 'It is surprising to find, in the mid-1990s, so many young
women still either choosing or being directed towards traditional and, in
many cases, low-paid occupations.'
More than one-in-three young men said they never did any cleaning, cooking
or shopping for food.
The report is the second in a series examining a large group of 16- and
17-year-olds from six inner city areas. About half those surveyed are from
ethnic minorities.
Other findings include:
More than 80 per cent of YT trainees are satisfied with the training and
optimistic about job prospects.
Three-quarters of the sample were still in full-time education. Nearly half
of those taking A-levels were finding their courses more difficult than they
expected.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Blair faces rail strikes motion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The two main rail unions are expected to put forward an emergency resolution
at the Labour party conference urging backing for the signal workers, who
begin another two-day stoppage from midnight tonight, David Goodhart writes.
The conference, at the end of the month, could be overshadowed by the strike
by members of the RMT union. Mr Tony Blair, party leader, may find it
difficult to remain aloof from the issue as he did last week at the Trades
Union Congress. Any political discomfort for Mr Blair will be eagerly
exploited by the Conservative conference at the beginning of October.
The Labour leadership will do its best to ensure that the wording of the
resolution by the RMT and the Aslef train drivers' union does not cause
political embarrassment.
The party said: 'We hope that everyone will seek to avoid a situation which
turns the strike into a con-flict point for Labour and political capital for
the Tories. That means that the wording of the emergency resolution will
have to be looked at very carefully.'
Railtrack, the state-owned company that operates the rail network, said
yesterday that trains from Paddington to Plymouth would operate normally
during this week's strike for the first time since the signal workers'
strikes began.
It said: 'This has been achieved in part by the increasing number of RMT
signallers who are now working normally.' A total of 97 RMT signal workers
in the region had returned to work.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Language staff try to master VAT-speak: Why English schools
are having tax troubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Richard and Sue Johns, directors of Kingsway English Centre, a private
language school in Worcester, signed a contract to build new premises, they
had no idea it would result in a tax nightmare.
Just after they completed the building deal, Customs &amp; Excise granted all
independent English language schools exemption from value added tax,
effective from this month.
So far so good. The government's decision came after several years of
lobbying by Britain's 1,000-plus private English-as-a-foreign-language
schools to be on an equal footing with the 200 English-teaching state
colleges, which have always been exempt.
The independent schools had long argued that VAT forced them to charge
higher prices than the state colleges and hoped exemption would sharpen
their competitive edge - and boost profits.
But VAT exemption has a down side. The Johnses, for example, can no longer
reclaim VAT on some of the supplies and services, such as building
materials, they buy for the school. When they signed the building contract
earlier this year, they expected to be able to do so.
They have decided to create a company to build the premises. That company
will reclaim the VAT and the school will rent the property.
The Johnses' juggling is an example of how VAT exemption has turned out to
be a mixed blessing for an industry which claims to be the UK's
eighth-largest source of invisible earnings, ahead of film, television and
advertising.
For the 550,000 people who travel to Britain each year to study English and
spend about Pounds 570m during their stay, the VAT change has not produced
the widespread price reductions they may have expected.
No school has discounted prices by anywhere near the 17.5 per cent rate of
VAT. A few have cut fees by as much as 5 per cent, but most are merely
refraining from increasing fees this year.
'There is a bit of grumbling from travel agents who are now demanding lower
prices,' said Mr Johns.
The schools say it is not simply a matter of cutting their fees by 17.5 per
cent. 'The savings from not charging VAT are much less than most people
assume,' said Mr Timothy Blake, principal of the London School of English,
which is lowering its fees by 5 per cent next year.
'If one is not able to recover VAT on inputs there are increases in
overheads. So in the short term we have something of a communications task.'
This task is made difficult by the fact that there is no single industry
body to speak for it, promote its interests and set and monitor standards.
'So many professional organisations for EFL schools are springing up,' said
Mr Jergen Gemmeke, director of Munich-based agent Prolinguis, which places
3,500 students in English language schools in the UK each year. 'It is not
clear who does what, why and for whom.'
At least three associations have been set up by EFL schools, each with its
auditing schemes and codes of conduct. But the British Council, the UK's
main agency for cultural relations overseas, is the only body which hires
independent, trained auditors to inspect EFL schools in Britain through its
recognition scheme.
When the government decided in April to grant VAT exemption to the schools,
Customs &amp; Excise announced that it would exempt only schools which were
recognised by the council.
But when a number of 'non-recognised' schools, notably members of the
Association of British Language Schools, argued that the ruling would create
unfair competitive practices, the government extended exemption to all
independent EFL schools.
The government's attempt to draw a distinction between schools illustrates a
marketing problem faced by many schools and by home tuition centres, where
pupils stay in teachers' homes.
The British Council, the British Tourist Authority and many chambers of
commerce advertise only schools which pass muster with the British Council.
'If we could be recognised, it would definitely cut the costs of marketing,'
said Ms Susan Anderson, co-director of Channel English Studies, a home
tuition service.
Because the council's recognition scheme is voluntary, only those schools
which apply are inspected. The recognition scheme costs each school about
Pounds 1,000 a year in fees to the British Council.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Rise of 4.5% seen for prices of homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
House prices should increase an average of 4.5 per cent both this year and
next, according to Mr Patrick Moon, an economic adviser to Lloyds Bank.
Writing in the bank's economic bulletin, Mr Moon forecasts accelerating
price rises in later years, lifting prices an average of 5.5 per cent a year
up to 1998. However, only in 1997 will negative equity cease to be a drag on
the market.
Mr Moon's forecasts for this year and next year suggest that house prices
will rise somewhat faster than inflation.
However, this contrasts with reports last week from Halifax and Nationwide
building societies. Halifax, the largest lender, said prices had been
broadly stable since the beginning of the year while Nationwide said price
rises were likely to be close to the rate of inflation by the end of this
year.
Prices are forecast to rise fastest in the south-east over the next five
years with an annual average rate of 6.9 per cent while prices will rise
most slowly in the Yorkshire areas and Humberside, where the average annual
increase is expected to be 3.7 per cent.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Labour plans bank to aid small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party plans to create a business development bank for small and
medium-sized enterprises and to introduce a law entitling companies to a
temporary moratorium on debts to avoid unnecessary bankruptcy.
The proposals are contained in a consultation paper to be launched on
Thursday and form the first substantive recommendations to come from the
Industry Forum, a body set up last year to promote detailed dialogue with
the private sector in the formulation of party policy.
The forum has so far recruited about 40 companies and individual
businesspeople. Its activities reflect the party leadership's effort to
construct a consensus for an industrial policy.
In calling for an emphasis on measures to help the small company sector,
Labour says it intends to address the problem of long-term finance.
A development bank, formed by an incoming Labour government, would use
private finance to form an investment fund that would give priority to
small- and medium-sized businesses.
The bank, in which private-sector partners would share ownership, would
operate on a profit-making basis 'at arm's length' from the government. It
would act as an intermediary between the short-term demands of the financial
markets and companies' longer-term needs.
Labour also wants to introduce measures to prevent the collapse of viable
companies confronting temporary financial problems. It says there should be
a legal right for businesses in difficulty to invoke a debt moratorium for a
limited period during which it could develop a rescue package. The
initiative would be based on the US Chapter 11 insolvency provisions but it
would be restricted to small companies.
Among other proposals to be announced by Mr Derek Fatchett, Labour industry
spokesman, the party says it intends to tackle the rising problems of late
payment by introducing a statutory right to interest, a move already being
proposed by the European Commission.
The party also says there is considerable disquiet in the small-business
community over 'rogue directors' and says ministers have been slow to
disqualify executives found unfit to run companies. Labour intends to review
the procedures for the removal of unfit directors.
The document, Going for Growth, will not be formally adopted as policy at
this year's party conference but will be used as a basis for discussion over
the next year.

FT  12 SEP 94 / CBI armed for white paper war: Howard Davies' early and
unusual intervention in a departmental spending row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A row between the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry over
spending and taxation is not something that the Confederation of British
Industry would normally be involved in.
Although Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, has a habit of not
intervening unless he is sure of winning, he has made it clear that he will
continue to act as an irritant in Whitehall and Westminster if he senses any
Treasury backsliding over the white paper on competitiveness  - first
announced by the DTI.
Mr Davies is not about to sign up for everything the DTI does. Indeed, he
took the unusual step of publicly reminding Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, that the white paper, published in May, had demonstrated
the need for business advice and support services as good as those available
in competitor countries.
This meant upgrading the services for small businesses at home and export
activity abroad. Yet these are the kind of schemes that the Treasury wants
scrapped. 'The whole point in having a competitiveness white paper was that
it set out government policy on spending and taxation across all
departments,' Mr Davies said.
Yet, as he told Mr Heseltine at a CBI dinner last week, the ink was scarcely
dry on the white paper before the Treasury began to throw the basis of the
policy into question.
Mr Davies was referring to the plans of Mr Michael Portillo, the former
Treasury chief secretary, to slash the DTI budget. These plans, when leaked
during the summer, caused a political row between the government's two
principal heavyweights - Mr Portillo and Mr Heseltine.
Mr Davies is concerned that the Treasury may feel that economic growth would
enable an abandonment of the principles of the white paper.
The CBI believes Britain must use the recovery phase to work on correcting
four deficits: the public sector borrowing requirement, the balance of
payments, the skills deficit, and the investment deficit.
The first is portrayed as a government responsibility. Mr Davies believes
the other three can only be solved by a partnership between the public and
private sectors.
'The DTI and the CBI have shown that they are ready to develop that
partnership. I hope that the rest of the government allow us to get on with
it,' he said.
Treasury officials have expressed surprise at the tone and content of Mr
Davies' remarks. Irrespective of the help they believe the government
already gives British industry, they remain adamant that the white paper
does not prevent them from questioning spending.
The Treasury's response may have been predictable, if not the one hoped for
by the CBI, but Mr Davies has taken heart from comments by Mr Heseltine that
the white paper represented the policy of the whole government.
'This (assurance) is what we wanted to hear,' Mr Davies said, an assertion
that the Treasury did not dispute. But although the CBI was on the winning
side in the latest departmental battle it will not be clear who has won the
war until after the latest spending round.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Housing groups may be given credit ratings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The largest and strongest housing associations rank with larger property
investment companies and middle-ranking building societies as investment
opportunities, says a report published today by a credit-rating
organisation.
IBCA says that credit rating would give the larger, soundly financed
associations ratings in the single-A range. Such ratings would make it
easier for them to raise private finance to top up government grants for
building low-cost housing.
However, it warns that the attractiveness of associations to investors could
be reduced by further cuts in government grants or by significant reductions
in housing benefit.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief secretary to the Treasury, warned last week that
he would target housing benefit in the autumn public-expenditure round after
steep rises in the bill over recent years.
Housing benefit helps low-income households pay their rent, and is seen by
investors as underpinning associations' income streams. Attempting to reduce
the benefit at the same time as cutting grants is likely to produce severe
strains in the sector, it says.
The Housing Corporation, the quango that distributes government grant to
associations, estimates that associations will need to raise Pounds 7bn on
the capital markets over the next three years.
Those which achieved investment-grade ratings would be able to draw on a
much wider investor base and cut the cost of borrowing.
IBCA says that it would be prepared to rate associations and also the
debenture issues undertaken by groups of associations.
While the sector is closely regulated by the Housing Corporation, this would
not protect creditors in all circumstances, according to IBCA. There is also
a danger that greater competition for government grants - or fears that
grants may be harder to get in the future - will lead associations into
uneconomic development.

<TEXT>
The economy will form a patchwork of boom-and-bust areas over the rest of
this decade, making obsolete ideas such as the north-south divide, a leading
forecasting company reports today.
The Henley Centre identifies the 50 areas with the best and worst prospects
and says the pattern of prosperity will become more polarised at a local
level as divides emerge within regions.
Within greater London, for example, the centre forecasts that areas such as
Kensington and Chelsea and the neighbouring borough of Hammersmith and
Fulham in will prosper, reflecting large numbers of professionals working in
growing information industries and expanding small-business sectors. Waltham
Forest, however, is among the bottom 25 because of a large overhang of
negative equity in the local housing market and a greater reliance on more
traditional industries.
The three main southern areas - the south-east, south-west and East Anglia -
account for 11 of the 25 winner areas and eight of the 25 worst areas.
In the north-west, Liverpool is in the bottom 25 while nearby Warrington is
in the top 25. The bright forecast for West Lothian in Scotland contrasts
with a poor outlook for Cumnock and Doon valley.
The factors it has considered include:
Underlying dynamism as illustrated by past performance in creating
employment.
Labour supply and whether there is an expanding, younger workforce with
up-to-date skills.
The entrepreneurial skills base and strength of local business.
The employment structure as reflected in the balance of growing and
declining sectors in an area and the distribution of head offices of big
companies.
Communications. Many of the coastal areas in the bottom 25 are peripheral to
national and international markets.
London has been voted the best European city in which to locate a business,
Healey and Baker, an international property consultancy, said.
Its fifth annual European Real Estate Monitor left the rankings of the top
six cities unchanged from last year. The next five in order were Paris,
Frankfurt, Brussels, Amsterdam and Zurich.
The rankings are based on a survey of 510 executives in nine European
countries.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Tory relief as Archer not due at conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative party managers are relieved that Lord Archer is not expected to
attend the party conference next month.
The millionaire novelist and former deputy chairman of the party, who was
recently the subject of an investigation into insider dealing, has been a
prominent figure at past conferences. However, party managers are understood
to be relieved that he will not be present while questions remain over his
role in the purchase of Anglia Television shares.
Mr Jeremy Hanley, Tory party chairman, said Lord Archer would not be able to
attend next month's gathering in Bournemouth because he was busy with his
duties as a working Conservative peer.
'I don't think he is actually coming for the simple reason that the House of
Lords are well in session,' he said yesterday on BBC television. 'They have
got a running three-line whip and he is a hard working peer.'
Lord Archer's share dealing was investigated by the Department of Trade and
Industry after a business associate of Lord Archer - whose wife is a
non-executive director of Anglia - made an Pounds 80,000 profit.
Although Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, ruled that no
action would be taken over the deal, Labour MPs have been pressing for a
full explanation of Lord Archer's role in the affair.
Mr Hanley warned that Lord Archer may have to bow to pressure and make a
full public statement when he returns to Britain after a book-signing tour
abroad.
'It is very much a matter for Jeffrey. I am not asking him to explain
anything. I merely think that the pressures of the press on any individual
in our society are such that Jeffrey will find it is probably better to
speak rather than not,' he said.
Meanwhile, Mr Hanley warned potential backbench rebels that they must adopt
Labour's new disciplined approach if the party is to stay in power.
He admitted that divisions over Europe had damaged the Tories and urged MPs
to rally round the leadership of Mr John Major to defeat the challenge of
Labour's Mr Tony Blair.
'I think the discipline of the Labour party is actually something that
parties ought to concentrate on. If you have a united party then it is very
much easier,' he said.
He was earlier forced to issue a retraction after saying that crowd violence
at a boxing match was 'just exuberance'.
There was chaos on Saturday night during a world championship contest at
Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre when rival gangs fought and threw
chairs. Conservative Central Office issued a statement on Mr Hanley's behalf
saying that he 'very much regrets' the impression he gave in a live BBC
television interview that any violence in sport could be exuberance.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Treasury to help axed staff on jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury is setting up an outplacement counselling scheme to find new
employment for staff made redundant in an impending shake-up.
The results of a fundamental review into the Treasury's operations are
expected to be delivered to Sir Terence Burns, permanent secretary, at the
end of this month. It is expected to recommend staff cuts and a reduction in
the Treasury's layers of management to reflect its changing role.
The review, being handled by Mr Jeremy Heywood, a former principal private
secretary to chancellors Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Norman Lamont, and
supervised by Sir Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI, was announced in
the Budget last November. Yesterday Treasury officials described as
'premature' a report that a third of its top 120 staff faced the axe.
Mr Heywood has been investigating the organisation of staff and the
allocation of resources inside the department. One particular challenge is
to adapt the Treasury, which oversees the government's economic and
budgetary policy, to decentralisation and delegation among the spending
ministries.
One of the aims is to place more emphasis in the Treasury on setting the
agenda and getting the framework for policy right. But if this is achieved
the department will be less involved in detailed supervision and
second-guessing of other ministries, with the result that some officials
will be surplus to requirements.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Trade ministers firm on ratifying Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trade ministers from the European Union, US, Japan and Canada yesterday
expressed their determination to see the landmark Uruguay Round word trade
pact ratified on schedule by the end of this year. They spelt out their view
at the conclusion of a 'quadrilateral' meeting of the world's leading
economic powers in Los Angeles at the weekend.
The talks, covering a range of trade issues, come as implementation of last
year's agreement signed by over 100 countries under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade faces a difficult passage in the US Congress and a
jurisdictional dispute in the EU, while other countries appear to be taking
a 'you first' approach.
'We all accorded the highest priority to the rapid and effective
implementation of the Uruguay Round and bringing the World Trade
Organisation into operation on January 1 1995,' said Mr Mickey Kantor, the
US trade representative, Sir Leon Brittan, EU external trade commissioner,
Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's trade minister, and Mr Roy MacLaren, Canada's
trade minister.
Mr MacLaren added: 'Our commitment will encourage other parties to proceed
expeditiously and it is our expectation that there will be only a minimal
number of countries that do not meet this deadline.'
Overshadowing the Quad agenda, however, was an escalating trade battle
between the US and Japan. The US has threatened to impose sanctions unless
there is agreement on insurance, automotive parts and government procurement
of telecoms and medical equipment by September 30. Mr Kantor and Mr Yohei
Kono, Japan's deputy prime minister, agreed to meet again around September
23 in an effort to avert sanctions. Talks in Washington and Los Angeles over
the past few days had been 'instructive', Mr Kantor said. Mr Kono called the
talks 'substantial'.
Officials said it appeared some agreement may be close on insurance but the
two sides remained divided over US insistence that some means of measuring
progress on opening Japan's markets be included in any agreement.
Deregulation in Japan will lead to 'less and less influence of the
government of Japan' over commercial matters, said Mr Hashimoto. 'So we
cannot commit ourselves to something that goes beyond the scope of
responsibility and reach of Japanese government.'
At the Quad session, ministers also discussed unfinished business remaining
from the Uruguay Round. This includes reaching a multilateral agreement on
financial services, telecommunications and other areas.
'In financial services, there has been a rapprochement which will enable us
to persuade those (South East Asian) countries that have not yet done so to
make realistic offers and advance toward an agreement,' said Sir Leon.
The 'nuts and bolts' issues of the transition from Gatt to WTO took up much
of the discussions. 'We have made real progress,' said Sir Leon.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Clinton's foes on scent of 'fast-track': Threats to the
power to negotiate trade pacts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Virulent partisanship in the US Congress, which nearly killed popular crime
legislation last month and threatens proposed health insurance reform next
month, could claim another victim: the fast-track negotiating authority
President Bill Clinton needs to secure new trade pacts with Latin America
and Asia.
With just four weeks left before Congress is due to recess for elections,
time is running short for agreement on many disputes surrounding the
legislation needed to implement the Uruguay Round world trade deal under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Among the problems yet to be resolved is how to raise funds to compensate
for reduced revenues due to tariff cuts agreed in the round.
Failure by Congress to approve legislation before it recesses would severely
jeopardise Gatt members' pledge in April to ratify the round in time to put
it into effect and establish the new World Trade Organisation at the start
of next year.
Not only is it inconceivable that the timetable could be kept if
foot-dragging by Congress prevented the US formalising its commitment to the
round; delay in Washington could provide a pretext for other governments to
defer parliamentary approval of the deal, raising the risk of indefinite
slippage.
So far, fewer than 30 of the 125 participants in the round have ratified it.
Outlook for action by the EU is clouded by a jurisdictional dispute between
the European Commission and the Council of Ministers, while there are also
uncertainties about the timetable in Japan.
In the face of the mounting obstacles in Congress, the Office of the US
Trade Representative is understood to be weakening in its resolve to seek
renewal of President Clinton's 'fast-track' authority to negotiate further
trade agreements.
A request for such authority, which requires Congress to vote on legislation
without amendment, was included in the Uruguay Round package at a time when
it seemed non-controversial.
Matters have been complicated by Senator Robert Dole, the Republican
minority leader, who has made frustration of the president's legislative
agenda his top priority. In a much publicised recent article in a newspaper
in his home state of Kansas, he argued for a postponement of the Gatt
legislation while questions of its costs and its effects on US laws were
assessed.
Mr Dole's stance has been welcomed by the round's opponents on the left and
right, who have argued for delay in the hope that with more time they can
mobilise enough opposition to kill it. Adding to their glee, Mr Rush
Limbaugh, the right-wing chat show, crusader has come out against the WTO.
The White House is said to be still reluctant to give up fighting for
fast-track, which it deems vital for the president's credibility when he
meets Asian leaders in Jakarta in November and Latin American leaders in
Miami in December.
A decision could come soon, but observers of past decisions by President
Clinton's White House are expecting a cave-in.
The fast-track is in most trouble in the Senate, which failed to include the
necessary authorisation in its own version of implementing legislation.
Trade officials then met Republican congressmen and got it included in the
House version, after they reluctantly agreed to drop labour and
environmental issues as specific goals to be sought in future trade
negotiations.
Staff members of the Senate finance committee and the House ways and means
committee are now working to resolve differences in the two versions, so the
legislation can be sent to the White House and returned to Capitol Hill in
time for final votes this year
The administration is widely accused of fumbling passage of the Gatt
legislation by not moving sooner to settle the tariff revenue problem, by
incorrectly assessing congressional sentiment and by taking a strident
position on the labour and environmental issues in the hope of satisfying
the Democratic left.
A former senior Bush administration official said Republicans and business
lobbyists were alarmed by the 'boasts' of Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, that all future trade deals would seek to raise the
environmental and labour standards of foreign trading partners.
On the other hand, Senator Dole is displaying 'the worst type of partisan
manipulation of trade issues' which 'will not serve him well,' he said.
If, as expected, the Republicans gain seats in both houses in November,
President Clinton could have even more difficulty pushing fast-track
authority through Congress next year. That, in turn, would be a humiliating
setback to US plans for hemispheric integration and trade initiatives in
Asia.

FT  12 SEP 94 / White House rejects Congress role on Haiti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration is determined to resist growing demands that any
invasion of Haiti be made contingent on the prior approval of Congress.
Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, said in an interview
yesterday that Congress would certainly be 'consulted' but that it was vital
that the president's 'constitutional authority be preserved.'
He noted that neither Presidents Reagan or Bush had sought congressional
backing before ordering US troops into Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1989,
operations which he compared in scale with any intervention in Haiti.
Over the weekend, Mr Ross Perot, the 1992 independent presidential
candidate, lent his voice to Republican criticisms that any invasion would
be principally designed to boost President Bill Clinton's sagging domestic
popularity before the mid-term congressional elections in November.
In a personal attack exceptional by even his own standards, Mr Perot said
that because Mr Clinton had avoided service in Vietnam he was obliged to 'go
to those people in Congress who understand what war is about.'
His speech in Denver, the first in a cross-country tour designed to
influence congressional elections, was conspicuous for its attacks on Third
World countries. He suggested that Haiti was a country whose people 'like a
dictator'.
Mr Christopher dismissed these arguments as 'pure baloney' and flatly
rejected suggestions that any military action be delayed until after the
November elections.
He was confident that, if and when any action was taken, the president would
receive plenty of political and public support once the case for
intervention had been laid out. Key reasons for action were the dangers
posed by the Haitian military regime to hemispheric stability, the need to
end human rights violations in Haiti and the credibility of the United
Nations, which has directed that all reasonable steps be taken to restore
democracy to the island.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A consortium of Russian oil companies is developing plans to invest in Iraq
in anticipation of the possible lifting of United Nations trade sanctions.
The Russian consortium, consisting of Lukoil, Mashinoimport, and
Zarubezhneft, has been talking to Iraqi officials for several months about
developing existing projects. Zarubezhneft, which handled overseas oil
projects in the Soviet era, has had previous experience of working in Iraq.
Mr Vagit Alekperov, Lukoil's president, has fleshed out plans in recent
meetings with senior officials from the Iraqi oil ministry.
Lukoil, one of the new generation of privatised Russian oil companies, plans
to exploit the western Kurna and northern Rumeila fields in northern Iraq.
It is reported to be willing to negotiate initial investments of Dollars
800m (Pounds 516.1m) to Dollars 1bn but would need a total of Dollars 2.3bn
for oil prospecting and equipment supplies.
Lukoil said it would be possible to finance most of the project through
private investment although, like all other Russian energy companies, it has
faced cash-flow problems because of the build-up of inter-enterprise debts.
Lukoil has been trying to offset these by developing its activities outside
Russia to increase its hard-currency earnings.
Weekend reports from the Iraqi News Agency said Iraq and Russia had signed a
Dollars 10bn trade agreement to take effect after the lifting of the
four-year oil and economic embargo.
The news agency said the agreement covered industry and oil projects, but
did not elaborate.
Iraq has outstanding debts to Russia of more than Dollars 10bn. Moscow is
continuing to press for a lifting of the international embargo on trade with
Baghdad which was imposed after the Gulf war in 1991.
Other foreign oil companies, including Elf Aquitaine and Total of France,
have also been jostling to take advantage of any relaxation of the trade
embargo with Iraq, according to Russian officials.

<TEXT>
France and China have signed a series of commercial contracts worth
FFr15.9bn (Pounds 1.94bn) during an official visit to Paris by Mr Jiang
Zemin, the Chinese president.
Mr Zemin's visit, which involved meetings with both Mr Francois Mitterrand,
the Socialist French president, and Mr Edouard Balladur, the centre-right
prime minister, marked the culmination of a year of intense diplomatic
effort by the French to bring about a rapprochement with China after Beijing
protested at the French decision to sell jet fighters to Taiwan.
The thaw between the two countries has heralded a wave of commercial
initiatives between French companies and the Chinese authorities.
Two of the largest contracts involve Elf Aquitaine, the recently privatised
French oil group, which is the main investor in a FFr11bn refinery
construction project in Shanghai and has concluded a crude oil trading
agreement with Sinochem, the Chinese concern responsible for importing and
exporting chemicals.
Mr Zemin was met by Chinese dissidents and Tibetan protesters at both ends
of a train journey from Paris to Bordeaux to visit a nuclear power station,
AP reports. Police detained four protesters at the Montparnasse station in
Paris, part of a group of two dozen, as they tried to unfurl a protest
banner.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Conference boost for women activists

   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
As the International Conference on Population and Development haggles its
way to a conclusion this week, at least one group of women is already
expressing delight at having been 'empowered' by the week-long gathering.
These are the hundreds of women who dominate membership of the 450 Egyptian
non-governmental organisations attending the conference. After years of
battling for their causes disparately and under the tight control of the
Ministry of Social Affairs, traditionally suspicious of anything which could
be construed as political organisations, they suddenly won the trust of the
Egyptian government during preparations for the conference.
'It all started with Mr Maher Mahran (Egypt's population minister)
recognising the importance of NGO participation in the conference,' says Mrs
Sarah Loza, co-ordinator of the Egyptian NGOs gender equity committee.
'Since Egypt was hosting the conference, he knew it had to have a leading
role.'
Mr Mahran, she says, suggested Egypt's NGOs establish a 15-strong steering
committee (of which 11 are women) to co-ordinate their approach to the
conference. In a country where the areas of political participation -
particularly for women - are heavily circumscribed, the effect appears to
have been galvanising.
'Through the ICPD, the government of Egypt recognised the NGOs for the first
time as solid partners,' says Mrs Loza. 'It's a fantastic start. It's the
first time Egyptian NGOs have come together to form a set of recommendations
and have been given complete freedom to do so.'
National Societies, as NGOs are dubbed in Egypt, have operated under strict
controls since the 1960s, when the socialist government of Gamal Abdul
Nasser kept an iron hand on all social and political groups.
The Nasserite Law 32, passed in 1964, not only restricted creation of new
organisations, but heavily constrained NGO activities by allowing the
Ministry of Social Affairs to repeal internal decisions made by these
organisations and giving the government powers to disband them at will. The
government had traditionally tolerated such groups largely as entities to
carry out its own policies.
Stripped of any real legal status, Egypt's NGOs therefore had limited
influence on the country's development or population policies, operating in
many cases like a diffuse set of charity organisations.
But preparations for the population conference looks to have changed that.
The steering committee, for instance, has submitted recommendations to Mr
Mahran for the revision of Law 32 and for a raft of changes to the legal
status of women in Egypt, including easing restrictions on abortion during
the first three months where the pregnancy is unwanted and due to the
failure of contraception, and on the rights of Egyptian women married to
foreigners to hand their nationality down to their children.
Many among the NGOs say their new status arises from the realisation in the
government that empowering such groups could help create a bulwark in Egypt
against the creeping influence in other areas of civil society of Islamic
groups, particularly the Moslem Brotherhood. The Brotherhood is Egypt's
largest informal organisation and its members dominate key professional
associations such as the lawyers and doctors syndicates.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Poll blow for Japanese coalition: By-election defeat raises
prospect of creation of New New party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan's ruling coalition of socialists and conservatives was humiliated in a
by-election yesterday, the first measure of its popularity since it seized
power in a parliamentary coup 10 weeks ago.
The defeat in Aichi, the heartland of the car industry, gives a symbolic
boost to attempts by the 10 parties in opposition to merge into a single
party, able to rival the Liberal Democratic party for parliamentary clout.
Voters had condemned the coalition of the LDP with its long-time enemy, the
Social Democratic party, as 'an act of betrayal' and now wanted a
progressive new party, maintained Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former prime
minister. The LDP joined hands with the SDP to muster enough votes to oust
Mr Hata's five-party coalition government in June, so ending the LDP's first
spell in opposition for 38 years.
The outcome of yesterday's poll poses no immediate threat to the government,
since the Aichi seat - in the upper house, the less powerful of the two
parliamentary chambers - was already in opposition hands. It does not affect
the political situation, said Socialist prime minister Tomiichi Murayama.
But if yesterday's result does convince doubters among the opposition to
join forces with Mr Hata and his allies, this will, to the relief of many,
simplify Japan's convoluted politics. The new grouping has been
provisionally named Shin-Shinto (New New party) by the Japanese press.
The vote increases the stature of former prime minister Toshiki Kaifu, who
led the opposition campaign in Aichi, his home prefecture, and is widely
seen as a candidate to lead the new party.
The government nominee, a former United Nations official, Mr Jiro Mizuno,
was beaten by nearly 384,000 votes by the opposition candidate, a former
Labour Ministry bureaucrat, Mr Yuzuru Tsuzuki, who attracted just over
925,000 votes. Mr Mizuno modestly claimed the result was his personal fault
and did not represent a judgment against the government.
A low turnout in Aichi yesterday testified to apathy among the voters, jaded
by three changes of government in the past year. Only 43 per cent of the
electorate voted, below the 47 per cent of the previous upper house election
two years ago, but slightly ahead of the gloomiest newspaper predictions.
The seat became vacant after the incumbent was convicted of lying about his
academic qualifications in electoral publicity.
The third-placed candidate, a television talk-show hostess, Ms Makiko
Suehiro, played to voters' discontent by saying that her adversaries were
merely indistinguishable pawns in a Tokyo power game. Mr Hata is reported to
have provided evidence of that theory by mixing up candidates' names and
mistakenly urging his supporters to vote for the government nominee.
The government did no better. Ms Makiko Tanaka, director general of the
science and technology agency, called the government's candidate Mr Shimizu
instead of Mr Mizuno, at a rally.
Despite the elements of tragi-comedy at Aichi, the election was significant
in that it took place under conditions similar to those provided by reformed
electoral system for the more powerful lower house, due to come into effect
next year. This will introduce a mixture of single-seat districts and
proportional representation, to replace Japan's unique system of large
multi-seat constituencies. The new system aims to encourage politicians to
attract voters with policies, rather than cash and construction projects.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Telecoms worries as Indian official goes

<TEXT>
Companies hoping to invest in India's telecommunications market have reacted
with shock to the sudden transfer of Mr Nagarajan Vittal, the top civil
servant in the Telecommunications Ministry and a strong advocate of economic
liberalisation.
They fear his departure last week from the ministry could delay the
implementation of a telecommunications policy announced in May, in which the
government promised to end the state's monopoly of basic telephone services
and invite private enterprise, including foreign companies, to invest up to
Rs230bn (Pounds 4.75bn) in the industry.
'Mr Vittal's departure is bad news,' said a Delhi representative of a US
telecommunications group with plans to invest in Indian telecommunications
services. 'He wanted to make things happen quickly. Implementing the new
policy is bound to take longer now.'
Mr Vittal, who was telecommunications secretary and chairman of the
government's telecommunications commission, remains secretary in the
Electronics Ministry, a post he held in tandem. He also remains India's
candidate for an elected senior post at the International Telecommunications
Union in Geneva.
Government officials suggested that Mr Vittal's transfer would give him more
time to lobby for the ITU post. But few observers in Delhi believe this was
the real reason for his job change.
Mr Vittal was brought into the Telecommunications Ministry late last year at
the behest of Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, to lead a radical
overhaul of the industry. But he ran into tough opposition from Mr Sukh Ram,
the telecommunications minister, who sided with the ministry's bureaucrats,
its trade union leaders and others who wished to slow reform. The conflicts
between these two abrasive characters frequently surfaced in the press - to
Mr Narasimha Rao's anger.
Mr Vittal's departure could mean the new telecommunications policy will be
less liberal in practice than in intent. Among issues still to be settled
are the maximum shareholding foreign companies will be permitted to hold in
an Indian telecommunications carrier, the commercial relationship between
the new private carriers and the state-run network, and regulatory matters.
The ministry also has still to solve a long-standing muddle over the award
of licences for cellular telephone networks.

FT  12 SEP 94 / International Press Review: Hard news on the sports pages -
Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese weekend newspapers have an endearing fondness for parish-pump news,
as if there were an unwritten rule against startling exhausted salaryman
readers during days off.
As always on a Sunday, the Japan Times decorates its front page with a
colour photograph of the flower of the week, yesterday a wild clematis. The
Daily Yomiuri leads its columns with a mild crisis in the prison service,
caused by a shortage of prison library books written in Farsi, for the
growing number of Iranian inmates.
On the sports pages, the top story in both papers is the failure of the
latest attempt to solve the US professional baseball strike. This is a
remarkable story to Japanese readers, few of whom would ever dream of going
on strike, let alone over a game where honour is at stake.
No labour troubles in Japanese baseball, where Ichiro Suzuki of the Orix
Blue Wave made his 185th hit of the season on Saturday, well on the way to
beating the 44-year Japanese record of 191 hits in a season, established by
the late Fumio Fujimara of the Hanshin Tigers. What is more, Fujimara had
the benefit of a 140-game season, 10 games more than allowed to Suzuki in
today's Pacific League.
Inside, the Japan Times' main editorial turns its back on international
affairs, despite the fact that this has been an interesting week, with a
nasty row between China and Taiwan over whether Taiwanese President Lee
Teng-hui should accept an invitation to the Asian games in Hiroshima early
next month.
Instead, the Japan Times offers its collective wisdom on why the government
should be nicer to the aged, no disrespect intended to the septuagenarian
prime minister Tomiichi Murayama.
The paper's editor is moved by the latest annual age count from the Health
and Welfare Ministry which shows that Japan has a record 5,593 centenarians,
an increase of 791 on last year.
The grey wave is a big story in Japan. This is not just because the average
lifespan is the longest in the world, at 76 years for men and 82 for women.
Japan's elderly are also its biggest national headache. The proportion of
pensioners is rising faster than anywhere else in the world, with horrendous
consequences for the government's finances.
The Japan Times offers no solutions, but instead ticks off council workers
in Saitama prefecture for disconnecting a 79-year-old lady's
air-conditioning on the grounds that it was an expensive luxury for someone
on welfare assistance.
Japan has had its hottest summer for decades and even now the temperatures
are still in the 30s, so it was no surprise that the poor old woman ended up
in hospital, suffering from dehydration.
The whole country will have a chance to draw the moral from this sad tale at
leisure on Thursday, Respect for the Aged Day, one of Japan's 14 national
holidays.
Not that the rest of world has completely passed the weekend press by.
Simply that the international stories tend to be treated with less interest
 -with the perennial exception of news about the US, the focal centre of
Japan's view of the outside world.
Nowhere in the press, for example, is it possible to find a word of advice
on how Mr Murayama should wriggle out of the diplomatic embarrassment
presented by Mr Lee's possible attendance at the Asian games.
Among the sports papers, Chunichi Sport drily points out that the matter is
too political to be handled by the games organisers. Daily Sport reports
without comment a government official's remark that China, with which Japan
has diplomatic relations, is more important than Taiwan, with which it has
no formal ties.
The Nikkei Weekly does offer the prime minister some advice, not on how to
resolve the games dilemma but on how to minimise the damage. It counsels Mr
Murayama to cancel a planned official visit to China next month and stay at
home.
Another reason not go is that Mr Murayama risks offending the Taiwanese by
being in Beijing on October 10, Taiwan's politically sensitive national day.
Why is it so hard for Japan to choose between China and Taiwan? It may be
something to do with the growing number of Japanese businesses opening up in
Taiwan, the latest reported last week being Fuji Bank.
Having to make hard choices also interferes with Tokyo's policy of keeping
as many friends as possible in Asia. No wonder the Japanese press prefers to
stay on the sidelines of the diplomatic fracas over the Asian games.
Choosing the flower of the week is far more civilised.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Assad's speech lifts Israeli peace hopes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Israel yesterday hailed a weekend statement by Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad, saying it was aimed at preparing the Syrian public for peace. At
the same time there was growing optimism in the Jewish state of an imminent
breakthrough in stalled peace negotiations.
In a speech to the newly elected Syrian parliament on Saturday Mr Assad said
peace with Israel was a strategic option and he was willing to work towards
peace and 'meet the objective requirements that are agreed upon'.
Mr Itamar Rabinovich, chief Israeli negotiator with Syria, said: 'It's first
and foremost a speech preparing public opinion in Syria.'
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said Mr Assad had 'declared he
has a strategy of peace. . . and there were more than hints that he
understands that peace truly means peace, that is to say normalisation of
relations'.
Israeli officials say privately that significant progress has been made in
US-brokered negotiations over the return of the occupied Golan Heights in
return for full peace, and both governments have now entered a period of
preparing their publics for a deal.
Mr Uri Savir, Foreign Ministry director-general, said yesterday that US
secretary of state Warren Christopher would return to the region this month
or next and that US officials were optimistic about a substantial
breakthrough.
However, Israeli optimism has yet to be matched in public in Damascus, and
Mr Assad's speech reiterated Syria's unconditional demand for a full Israeli
withdrawal from the Heights - a demand unacceptable, so far, to Israel and
the traditional stumbling block in talks.
Last week Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, presented for the first
time a plan for a partial withdrawal from the Golan, backed by US military
assistance, followed by a three-year trial period marked by normalisation,
including setting up embassies.
Mr Rabin said that only after the normalisation period would Israel
negotiate the line of its final withdrawal from the Heights.
The move was immediately rejected by Syria as unacceptable but Israeli
officials say the Rabin plan was an opening gambit meant partly to test
Israeli public opinion. They said that by comparing the deal to Israel's
phased 26-month withdrawal from the Egyptian Sinai between 1980 and 1982 Mr
Rabin was also hinting that a similar deal with Damascus would culminate in
full withdrawal.
Mr Rabin's plan opened a fierce public debate in Israel between proponents
and opponents on territorial withdrawal from the Golan. On Saturday
thousands of Jewish settlers on the Golan held a mass rally to kick off a
campaign of uncompromising but non-violent civil disobedience they say will
be 'the battle for the Golan'.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Counting cost of burgers for bankers: Big Macs enter
calculation of pay scales at UBS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic research department of one of the world's leading banks has
settled upon the McDonald's Big Mac hamburger as an international measure to
quantify the purchasing power of wages.
Union Bank of Switzerland has included a Big Mac scale in its new edition of
Prices and Earnings around the Globe, a survey of international prices and
wages.
The UBS researchers say the best way to illustrate the purchasing power of
wages is to set them in relation to the prices of individual products. The
most suitable measures, they have found, is a 1kg loaf of bread and a Big
Mac.
According to the UBS statistics, the worst place to be if you are penniless
and in need of a hamburger is Lagos, the Nigerian capital. There it will
take you more than 11 hours of toil, almost two full workdays, to earn
enough to buy one, compared with 14 minutes in Chicago at the other end of
the scale.
International price comparisons and cost of living indicators are becoming
increasingly valuable to executives negotiating pay packages for overseas
postings. The UBS survey uses a uniform basket of goods so that clear
comparisons can be made.
The survey shows that while the top earnings are in Switzerland, the most
expensive apartments are in Hong Kong and the dearest clothes in Tokyo.
Household appliances are cheapest in the US.
North America also has the least expensive motoring, while those using
public transport in Europe can expect to pay through the nose.
Among the smaller items, a shampoo and set at a women's hairdresser costs
between Dollars 40 and Dollars 65 (Pounds 42) in Oslo. The best places for a
cheap hairdo - less than Dollars 7 - are Taipei, Caracas, Budapest, Nairobi,
Prague and Bombay.
The biggest gross earners are the Swiss, the Danes and the Japanese,
followed by the Germans, Luxembourg and the US. London is midway in the
earnings league behind Milan and Paris, with Nairobi, Lagos and Bombay at
the foot of the table. Luxembourg incomes, however, enjoy the most
purchasing power, followed by those in Toronto, Montreal and Dusseldorf.
People in the Far East tend to work the longest hours, while the least hours
are worked by those in Madrid.
Of the 53 cities in the comparison, Tokyo is the most expensive, with Lagos
surprisingly in second place, followed by Oslo and Zurich.
If you are thinking about a romantic weekend away, the cost of spending a
night for two in a double room with a bathroom in a first-class hotel ranges
from Dollars 112 in Nairobi to Dollars 382 in Tokyo. A regional breakdown,
however, shows that North America offers the best overnight deals, at an
average of Dollars 185 for two. A night in London on those terms will set
you back Dollars 375.
The southern hemisphere also seems to be the best place to go for a
candlelight dinner. An evening meal of sirloin steak or rib of beef with two
side dishes and dessert, no drink, costs Dollars 76 in Singapore and Dollars
72 in Tokyo, whereas the same quality fare can be had for Dollars 8 in
Nairobi. Lisbon, Helsinki and Athens are the cheapest cities for dining in
western Europe, where prices are about average on the whole.
Totting everything up, including a night in a hotel, two evening meals with
a bottle of house red wine, a taxi ride in the city centre, car rental for
half a day, cinema tickets for two, a couple of Big Macs and two bus rides,
the most expensive city for a flying visit is Tokyo at Dollars 740, with
Zurich, Geneva and London following at Dollars 600 each. The cheapest place
for a quick visit is Nairobi at Dollars 200, followed by Kuala Lumpur at
Dollars 240, Tel Aviv at Dollars 250, then Bombay and Caracas, each at
Dollars 260.

<TEXT>
As the International Conference on Population and Development haggles its
way to a conclusion this week, at least one group of women is already
expressing delight at having been 'empowered' by the week-long gathering.
These are the hundreds of women who dominate membership of the 450 Egyptian
non-governmental organisations attending the conference. After years of
battling for their causes disparately and under the tight control of the
Ministry of Social Affairs, traditionally suspicious of anything which could
be construed as political organisations, they suddenly won the trust of the
Egyptian government during preparations for the conference.
'It all started with Mr Maher Mahran (Egypt's population minister)
recognising the importance of NGO participation in the conference,' says Mrs
Sarah Loza, co-ordinator of the Egyptian NGOs gender equity committee.
'Since Egypt was hosting the conference, he knew it had to have a leading
role.'
Mr Mahran, she says, suggested Egypt's NGOs establish a 15-strong steering
committee (of which 11 are women) to co-ordinate their approach to the
conference. In a country where the areas of political participation -
particularly for women - are heavily circumscribed, the effect appears to
have been galvanising. 'Through the ICPD, the government of Egypt recognised
the NGOs for the first time as solid partners,' says Mrs Loza. 'It's a
fantastic start. It's the first time Egyptian NGOs have come together to
form a set of recommendations and have been given complete freedom to do
so.'
National Societies, as NGOs are dubbed in Egypt, have operated under strict
controls since the 1960s, when the socialist government of Gamal Abdul
Nasser kept an iron hand on all social and political groups.
The Nasserite Law 32, passed in 1964, not only restricted creation of new
organisations, but heavily constrained NGO activities by allowing the
Ministry of Social Affairs to repeal internal decisions made by these
organisations and giving the government powers to disband them at will.
But preparations for the population conference looks to have changed that.
The steering committee, for instance, has submitted recommendations to Mr
Mahran for the revision of Law 32 and for a raft of changes to the legal
status of women in Egypt, including easing restrictions on abortion during
the first three months where the pregnancy is unwanted and due to the
failure of contraception, and on the rights of Egyptian women married to
foreigners to hand their nationality down to their children.
Many among the NGOs say their new status arises from the realisation in the
government that empowering such groups could help create a bulwark in Egypt
against the creeping influence in other areas of civil society of Islamic
groups, particularly the Moslem Brotherhood.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Crimea's president, Mr Yuri Meshkov, yesterday added fuel to a raging
internal political fight by suspending parliament and taking full control
over the autonomous republic.
Mr Meshkov's step follows weeks of rising tensions on the separatist
Ukrainian peninsula which came to a head last Wednesday when the local
parliament voted to strip the president of his powers.
For now, the internal power struggle in Crimea does not threaten
Ukrainian-Russian relations. It is primarily a domestic dispute over
political style, policy and the pace of attempts to break with Kiev and
reintegrate with Russia. But Crimea remains the sorest point in often tense
relations between Kiev and Moscow.
Speaking on Radio Crimea Mr Meshkov called parliament 'corrupt' and
'unworthy' and asserted control over local councils and the media. Police
surrounded the parliament building, stopping MPs from entering. Mr Meshkov
promised new elections by December and a referendum on a new constitution by
April 9. At a special evening session, the parliament declared Mr Meshkov's
decree unconstitutional and urged Russia, Ukraine and the UN to protest.
In Kiev, the Ukrainian ministry of interior said Mr Meshkov had exceeded his
authority, according to the Interfax-Ukraine news agency. Ukrainian
president Leonid Kuchma said the conflict 'threatened security' in Ukraine.
Mr Kuchma, who won massive support from Crimean voters in Ukrainian
presidential elections in July, met Mr Meshkov on Saturday, and Mr Meshkov's
aides claimed their president had Mr Kuchma's support.
Transferred from Russia to Ukraine in 1954, the pre-dominantly Russian
region expressed its dissatisfaction with the disastrous economic policies
of the Ukrainian government by endorsing Mr Meshkov's pro-Russian platform
in Crimean presidential elections last January.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Christian Democratic Union and its Social Democratic Party rival both
won decisive victories yesterday in two regional elections in eastern
Germany - seen as an early poll test ahead of federal elections on October
16.
The CDU premier of Saxony, Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, and the SPD premier of
Brandenburg, Mr Manfred Stolpe, swept back into power with absolute
majorities.
Big gains were also made by the former communists - the Party of Democratic
Socialism (PDS). They became the third largest party in both states.
But the Free Democratic Party, the junior partner in Chancellor Kohl's
governing CDU-led coalition in Bonn, failed to get the 5 per cent minimum
required to enter either of the two state parliaments. A similar fate befell
the Bundnis 90/Green party.
The FDP's failure to clear the hurdle is a big blow to the party. It raised
further doubts about its ability to get back into federal parliament - a
possibility that could upset coalition forecasts.
In Saxony, the only state where the CDU has an absolute majority, Mr
Biedenkopf, a former law professor, was returned with 58.1 per cent of the
vote, according to provisional figures. This is more than four percentage
points higher than in the last election in 1990.
The SPD failed to make inroads in Saxony, winning only 16.6 per cent of the
vote, 2.5 percentage points less than in 1990. The FDP's share of the vote
was cut from 5.3 per cent to 1.8 per cent and the Bundnis 90/Greens' vote
fell from 5.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent. The PDS vote rose from 10.2 per cent
in 1990 to 16.5 per cent.
In Brandenburg, the only eastern German state with an SPD-led coalition
government, the party's share of the vote rose from 38.2 per cent in 1990 to
53.5 per cent. But the strong showing may reflect the special factors at
play in eastern German politics rather than national trends.
The CDU's share of the vote in Brandenburg collapsed from 29.4 per cent in
1990 to 18.9 per cent. The FDP vote fell from 6.6 per cent to 2.1 per cent,
and the Bundnis 90/Greens vote also dropped from 9.3 per cent to 3 per cent.
By contrast, the PDS share of the vote rose from 13.4 per cent to 18.9 per
cent.
Mr Werner Hoyer, FDP chairman in Bonn, said the party's poor showing was an
'extremely atypical result'. He did not believe it could be compared with
the outcome of the federal poll next month. The party would return to the
Bonn parliament 'if we can keep our nerves'.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Albania clings to some repressive levers of state - A series
of recent political trials have questioned the country's commitment to human
rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten years ago, Mr Sokol Bregu, was sentenced by an Albanian court to 12
years in prison for spreading propaganda against the state. His crime was
committed in an overheard conversation over coffee with friends when he
suggested that, compared with other Western European countries, Germany had
the strongest economic potential. Mr Bregu spent seven years of his sentence
in the notorious Spaci jail where he was forced into hard labour in a chrome
mine. He was frequently beaten, his family and friends were rarely allowed
to visit and he was only released in 1991 following the liberalisation of
the communist regime.
Compared with 45 years under Enver Hoxha's repressive Stalinist regime,
Albanians are undoubtedly enjoying more freedom now than ever before. Since
their election in March 1992, President Sali Berisha and his Democratic
party-led coalition government have made much progress in starting to
rebuild the economic and social structures of the country. Despite severe
economic difficulties, the novelties of shopping in well-stocked stores, of
taking home money earned through private enterprise, and of talking openly
about the outside world, have still not worn off.
Over the past few weeks, Albania has been closely watching a controversial
trial of five men from the country's ethnic Greek minority. They were
sentenced last Wednesday to between six and eight years in prison on charges
of espionage and illegal possession of arms. The men were leading members of
Omonia, an Albanian political movement which campaigns for the rights of the
country's ethnic minority. The case was widely seen as a warning to
extremists in the minority to drop their demands for limited autonomy in the
south.
It is just one of a series of political trials in Albania over the past few
years and its outcome has not only severely damaged already strained
relations with Greece, but also re-opened the debate about Albania's
commitment to human and civil rights.
The Omonia trial came under criticism for its proceedings and was described
by many as a throwback to the communist era. It was conducted under an
amended version of the old penal code drawn up by Hoxha's regime. An
unofficial report written for the International Helsinki Federation of Human
Rights said that 'much of the evidence against the defendants seems
circumstantial and vague'.
Diplomats in Tirana say that the problem lies with the country's
institutions which are remnants of the old regime and have yet to be
modernised. Others say it is the continuing totalitarian attitude of the
government, many of whose members were closely associated with the
communists. 'There is still a big gap between our (new) laws and the
mentality of our institutions which is difficult to change,' explains Mr
Gramoz Pashko, an opposition MP who is probably the president's harshest
critic. Dr Berisha, he says, 'is not the most tolerant when it comes to
political minorities.' He cites the case of Mr Fatos Nano, the former prime
minister and leader of the opposition Socialist party who is now serving
nine years on charges of corruption, as an example. 'I'm not convinced that
Fatos was proved guilty, it was a form of vendetta,' he says.
Other former senior politicians have been sent to jail for alleged crimes
against the state. The president has defended these measures as necessary to
prevent a wave of revenge attacks. But strikingly, Albanians are not
interested in taking revenge on those responsible for the previous era.
Other criticisms focus on the slow pace of constitutional and legal reform.
code will be essential in assessing the government's democratic and human
rights credentials and also to Albania's application to join the Council of
Europe. A decision on membership has been postponed until 1996 because so
much of the country's legislative framework is still lacking.

Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's reformist prime minister, urgently needs voters to
swing to the right if he is not to lose power to the tenacious Social
Democratic party in next Sunday's general election.
The Social Democrats, under the leadership of former prime minister Ingvar
Carlsson, are expected to perform strongly enough to form a government,
probably seeking an unusual alliance with the Liberal party, a member of Mr
Bildt's minority right-centre coalition, to reach a majority.
In the absence of any single party or Bildt-led majority government, such a
coalition would almost certainly be welcomed by the financial markets as the
best prospect for producing a credible fiscal policy to attack Sweden's big
budget deficit and spiralling public debt. An opinion poll in yesterday's
Svenska Dagbladet newspaper offered Mr Bildt some hope, showing his
government gaining some ground over the past week. However, it still trailed
the Social Democrats by 46.7 per cent to 41.1 per cent.
A good showing for the Social Democrats would represent a significant
rebound from the slump to 37.7 per cent 1991. The strongest trend in recent
polls has been to the left, with the former communists of the Left party and
the Environment party gaining sharply following a Social Democratic
commitment to cut some welfare spending.
But Mr Carlsson and Mr Goran Persson, the shadow finance minister, have made
it clear they prefer co-operation on economic policy across the traditional
political blocs - perhaps including the Centre party as well as the Liberals
 -rather than relying on their erstwhile allies on the left for a
parliamentary majority. This, they believe, would convince the markets the
deficit can be tackled and bring an early fall in interest rates which, at
around 11 per cent on five-year government bonds, have already begun to
erode recovery from a deep three-year recession.
Mr Bengt Westerberg, the leader of the Liberal party, has clearly signalled
his willingness to work with the Social Democrats if the present coalition
cannot form a new government and the Social Democrats accept his party's
emphasis on creating favourable conditions for private sector companies.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Italy seeks greater influence in Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN, ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, will today launch Italy's
attempt to increase its standing in Brussels during a meeting with Mr
Jacques Santer, the incoming Commission president.
Mr Berlusconi will show Mr Santer a list of heavyweight non-partisan
candidates for the two Italian seats on the new European Commission, which
takes office in January.
But he will also try to convince Mr Santer to accept a delay in the formal
nomination of commissioners, in the hope that Italy can win one of Brussels'
top economic portfolios for its candidates.
The new Italian government is keen to boost Italy's stature in the European
Union to the same level as Britain, Germany and France, following decades in
which it has lacked real influence. The recent proposals by Germany's
Christian Democratic Union for a hard core of EU countries, excluding Italy,
have underlined the problem. Politicians and ordinary Italians are angry
that their country, a founder member of the Union, might be consigned to
'league division two', as the Italian headlines put it last week.
The list of potential Italian candidates for commissioner is headed by
Professor Mario Monti, a distinguished economist and head of Milan's private
Bocconi University, Mr Renato Ruggiero, a former trade minister, and Mr
Enrico Vinci, secretary general of the European Parliament.
The list is deliberately non-partisan, ending fears that nominees might be
drawn from the right-wing National Alliance.
Alliance ministers have already faced protests from their European
counterparts at EU meetings, because of the party's neo-fascist roots.
But Italy wants some guarantee that Prof Monti will receive an economics
portfolio in Brussels. Such a guarantee is difficult to give because it will
not be clear whether Denmark intends to renominate Mr Henning
Christophersen, the existing economics commissioner, until after the
forthcoming Danish elections.
Mr Ruggiero's availability is also unclear, because he is still in the
running for head of the World Trade Organisation, the planned successor to
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Even if Mr Christophersen does not remain at his post, other EU countries
may object to an Italian overseeing the convergence of EU economies in the
period up to European monetary union.
Some EU members are not convinced of Italy's commitment to meeting the
deficit and debt targets laid out in the Maastricht treaty.
Prof Monti, a strong advocate of budget rigour, underlined his claim to the
job with an article in Saturday's Corriere della Sera newspaper, in which he
argued that the Italian government could and should bring its budget deficit
within the Maastricht limits.
In a speech on Saturday, Mr Berlusconi repeated his promise that a 'rigorous
and committed' 1995 budget would be agreed by the government later this
month.
He is also likely to lay out Italy's objections to a 'two-speed Europe' at
today's meeting with Mr Santer, who is beginning a tour of European
capitals.

FT  12 SEP 94 / EU ministers revive single currency hope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LINDAU, GERMANY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The end of recession had revived the prospects of a European single currency
by the end of the century, but only greater fiscal rigour would deliver the
conditions for it, European Union finance ministers warned at the weekend.
Meeting informally at Lindau in southern Germany, the ministers also
signalled that political considerations could loosen the criteria which the
Maastricht treaty sets for convergence towards economic and monetary union
(Emu). It looks increasingly likely that the rules on deficit and debt
levels will be applied flexibly to Ireland, whose government debt is well
over the 60 per cent of gross domestic product recommended in the treaty.
This could pave the way for the inclusion of other heavily indebted states
such as Belgium.
The weekend meeting prepared for the first use of 'excessive deficit'
proceedings when finance ministers next meet in Brussels on September 19.
Under this process, the European Commission will recommend budget deficit
targets for 1995 and 1996 for the 10 states (all except Luxembourg and
Ireland) which are above the budget-deficit target of 3 per cent of GDP set
for Emu.
Germany perceptibly softened its opposition to flexibility for Ireland. Mr
Theo Waigel, finance minister, underlined that Dublin was well within the
deficit criteria and had made 'considerable progress' in cutting its debt
ratio from 116 per cent to 90 per cent.
Mr Waigel, in German press interviews on Saturday and in his press release
for the meeting, had said that 'we did not write the debt quota (of 60 per
cent) into the treaty as a joke' and that 'special treatment' would
undermine public and market confidence in a single currency.
Yet after the meeting, Mr Waigel sought to defuse the Irish issue, saying
merely that 'we must make sure right from the beginning that the criteria
are clear-cut'. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said the 3 per cent
deficit target 'is the upper limit; it should not be taken as a yardstick to
aim at'. Only Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French minister, stood up for
rigidity. He said: 'If you choose a loose interpretation then we have to
explain very clearly why we are doing this.'
The ministers agreed in principle to publish the Commission recommendations
on excessive deficits after their meeting in Luxembourg on October 10.
This could help clear the fog over Ireland, but could also risk market
instability for countries such as Belgium and Italy.

FT  12 SEP 94 / The two-tier Europe debate is refuelled: The EU's great
economic divide - interest rates, deficits and inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Different levels of budget deficit, variations in currency volatility, and
member states' widely varying inflation records are the three main causes
behind differences in general rises in long-term interest rates. These are
the main conclusions of a report to EU finance ministers on Saturday by the
European Monetary Institute (EMI), the embryo of the European Central Bank
foreseen by the Maastricht programme for economic and monetary union (Emu)
by the end of the century.
According to Maastricht, Emu and a single currency will only come about if
member states meet treaty rules on convergence of inflation and interest
rates, budget deficits and government debt.
Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, EMI president, told finance ministers meeting at
Lake Constance in southern Germany that the markets had established three
clear tiers of countries in terms of the rise of long-term interest rates
between January and August 29 this year.
The presentation, intended to underline the need to bear down on deficits
and inflation, and to promote exchange rate stability and structural
economic reform, will inevitably fuel the current debate about the EU
dividing into a 'hard core' of committed and able integrationists,
surrounded by outer circles of second and even third division countries. In
Mr Lamfalussy's analysis, the recognised hard core - Germany, France and the
Benelux countries - are all in tier one (where long-term rates have risen by
less than 2 per cent) alongside the US and Japan. In tier two, where
long-term rates have risen between 2 per cent and 3 per cent, are the UK,
Denmark and Ireland. Taking up the rearguard, with rate increases of more
than 3 per cent, are Italy, Spain and Portugal. The three 'correlations'
establishing this order, Mr Lamfalussy suggested, were rates of inflation
between 1984 and 1993; the highest public deficits in 1994; and market
perception of currency stability.
Mr Henning Christophersen, EU economic affairs commissioner, said the
'markets have a memory like elephants' about the policy mistakes of the
1980s. 'We are all agreed that we would not repeat these mistakes in the
light of the recovery' in economic growth, he said. The European Commission
last week revised average EU growth predictions for this year from 1.6 per
cent of gross domestic product to 2 per cent, forecasting 2.5 per cent
growth next year.
Mr Christophersen emphasised that this depended partly on the strength of
the dollar and on the need to prevent the fiscal relaxation and high wage
settlements of the late 1980s. He and Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance
minister who chaired the weekend meeting, also underlined the need to keep
within a 'virtuous circle' - with exports leading the recovery followed by
revived investment, and only then revived domestic demand. Some EU officials
said that several member states, including the UK, were over-emphasising the
'short-term' growth engine of domestic demands.
One senior EU official argued that the three countries in the EMI's second
tier - the UK, Denmark and Ireland - were all plausible candidates to join
the 'hard core' in entering Emu. But the British and Danes were paying an
interest rate premium in terms of perceived currency stability, because of
their opt-outs from Emu in the Maastricht treaty.
Ireland, another official said, suffered because of its high government
debt, but mainly through 'guilt by association' because of its close
economic ties to the UK.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, insisted that 'opt-outs
did not feature in Mr Lamfalussy's analysis', and that 'our opt-out plays no
part' in Britain's higher long-term interest rates.

About 40m lottery addicts in Germany - and thousands in neighbouring
Austria, Switzerland and France - were anxiously waiting to find out today
whether any of them had won the country's lottery, whose jackpot has risen
to DM42m (Pounds 17.5m). The numbers were drawn on television on Saturday
night, but the country won't know until today whether one or more winners
will claim the prize - or whether the jackpot will grow yet again. The
jackpot has already risen to its highest level in the 40-year history of the
lottery; it has kept rising for 11 weeks because no-one marked all the
winning numbers on their cards. The 'lotto' frenzy has reached such
proportions that the finance ministry in Bonn had to issue a statement last
week following a TV satire that suggested Mr Theo Waigel, the finance
minister, was all set to bend the rules of the game and use the jackpot to
plug gaping holes in the budget.

An increasing number of people who have not been given asylum in Germany are
reported to be leaving voluntarily so as not to forfeit future chances of
becoming a German resident. Officials in the 16 German states said people
refused asylum were leaving of their own accord instead of waiting for
deportation. Until July last year the German constitution guaranteed an
automatic right of asylum. But faced with an annual influx of 500,000
asylum-seekers, restrictions were introduced. Once deported, people are
forbidden to re-enter Germany for at least 10 years and are not entitled to
any social benefits. Others who leave freely can, in theory, return the next
day and renew their application for asylum. In the first eight months of
this year, 81,864 people applied for asylum, 68.4 per cent fewer than in the
same period the year before.

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Swiss government will today announce its plan for preventing
discrimination against EU truckers driving through the Alps. The idea is to
set road usage tariffs so high that truckers put their vehicles on trains,
and to set the train fares low enough that EU truckers will not be inclined
to divert to already overcrowded Alpine road passes in Austria or France.
According to a report in the Sonntags Zeitung, a Zurich newspaper, existing
charges for all trucks transiting the Alps would be raised by about SFr400
(Pounds 200) per trip starting in 1998. These measures became necessary
after the Swiss decided in a referendum last February to ban international
transit truck traffic from the Alps from 2002. The decision enraged
governments and truckers in France, Germany, Italy and Austria because it
applied only to through traffic. Truckers on internal journeys in
Switzerland or on trips to or from Switzerland could continue to drive
through the Alps. The European Commission said it would not negotiate with
Switzerland on any transport issues, including landing rights for Swissair,
until measures were introduced to prevent discrimination against EU
truckers.

<TEXT>
Greece's socialist prime minister, Mr Andreas Papandreou, has warned that
the country's economy is not expected to recover before 1996. He said his
government would maintain tight austerity policies over the next 12 months.
The opening of the Thessaloniki trade fair at the weekend, Mr Papandreou
said inflation would be held at 11 per cent this year, close to the
government's target of 10.5 per cent. 'Next year's budget is being prepared
in a spirit of austerity so that borrowing needs can be further reduced, but
it will be a difficult year that will decide the economy's future course,'
he said.
Public sector wage rises are to be held at 6 per cent next year, below the
projected 8 per cent inflation rate. Growth in gross domestic product is
forecast at 1.2 per cent, against 0.8 per cent this year. Mr Papandreou's
remarks, coming a few days before Greece's economic convergence plan is
submitted for approval by European Union finance ministers, appeared
intended to reassure European Commission officials suspicious that Greece's
commitment to reducing fiscal imbalances may start to weaken.

Fiat of Italy is planning to begin car assembly in Mexico and is negotiating
a joint venture with Dina, the leading Mexican truck and bus maker, with the
aim of producing up to 100,000 cars a year. Mexico is attracting a growing
number of the world's leading car makers in the wake of last year's North
American Free Trade Agreement. The Mexican car industry is dominated by
Volkswagen of Germany and Nissan of Japan along with the big three US
producers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler.
Fiat said it was planning to produce its Uno small car range for sale in the
Mexican market and in some Central American and Caribbean markets. Fiat is
already well established in South America, with car production in Brazil,
Argentina and Venezuela. It had a 24 per cent share of the Brazilian market
last year and 30 per cent in Argentina. Fiat said it planned to supply
components, such as engines and gearboxes, for the Mexican operation from
its existing facilities in South America. It insisted it had no plans to use
a Mexican production base to re-enter the US market, from which it withdrew
the Fiat brand in 1983.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Slovenia poised to clinch debt deal with banks

Slovenia, the richest of the six former Yugoslav republics, is poised to
reach an agreement with its commercial bank creditors on the share it will
assume of former Yugoslavia's external debt. Three years after it declared
independence, this is the last leg of Slovenia's struggle to disentangle
itself from Yugoslavia.
Negotiators from Slovenia's Ministry of Finance and central bank in New York
last week met a committee of creditor banks, chaired by Chemical Bank. A
deal is expected to be agreed in the next two weeks and announced at the
World Bank meeting in Madrid. It must be ratified by Slovenia's parliament
and banks holding the debt.
Slovenia is already receiving funding from the World Bank and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development but many western commercial banks
are still reluctant to lend until the issue is resolved. Yugoslavia's last
debt rescheduling agreement, in 1988, left the now defunct state with about
Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.5bn) of debt. But a debt-for-equity swap programme in
1989 and 1990 reduced this to Dollars 4.2bn of commercial bank debt and
Dollars 300m of trade paper.
Slovenia has already agreed to assume the part of the debt owed by Slovene
banks and companies. The negotiations centre on about Dollars 1bn of
non-identified debt - for which the borrower was the National Bank of
Yugoslavia or another federal entity - and which cannot be traced to one of
the six republics.
Slovenia's negotiators want the banks to allocate the non-identified debt
using the formula the World Bank employs when a country breaks up. Under
this, Slovenia would assume just over 16 per cent of the non-identified
debt. The creditor committee has been pressing for a higher percentage,
because Slovenia and Croatia are the only two former Yugoslav republics able
to restart payments.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Computer giants clash over strategy: Compaq attacks Intel
over advertising campaign and chip pricing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Relations between Compaq Computer and Intel Corporation, the two companies
which have jointly dominated the world personal computer business, were
strained to breaking point at the weekend after a bitter dispute over
commercial strategy burst into the open.
Intel is the world's leading supplier of microprocessors, which are the
heart of personal computer systems. Compaq is the leading manufacturer of
personal computers, and as a result, is Intel's largest customer.
Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's chief executive, accused Intel of pursuing
strategies which were damaging his company.
He accused Intel of launching an advertising campaign promoting Intel at the
expense of Compaq; of not rewarding Compaq for being Intel's largest
customer; and for making computers in direct competition with Compaq.
The dispute between the two companies, which have been close allies, has
been simmering for months, industry experts say.
The clash could open a new front in the 'microprocessor wars' which are
expected to determine the direction of the computer industry for the
forseeable future. The dispute is not simply over the future technology used
by personal computers but also the conflicting marketing strategies employed
by semiconductor makers and computer makers to establish a brand reputation
for their products.
The dispute burst into public in dramatic fashion at the annual Etre
conference, an two-day gathering attended by senior executives of virtually
every significant computer company.
Mr Pfeiffer, obviously angry and upset, left no doubt that if Intel did not
respond to his complaints, he would turn to other suppliers for Compaq
microprocessors. Such a shift of allegiance would mark a sea change in the
balance of power in the industry.
It was the synergy between the two companies which allowed them to take
market share from IBM, the former market leader. Compaq earned revenues of
Dollars 7.1bn (Pounds 4.58bn) in 1993, while Intel's revenue was Dollars
8.78bn that year.
Compaq has three chief complaints:
The 'Intel inside' advertising campaign was promoting the semiconductor
company at the expense of Compaq's brand name, Mr Pfeiffer said. The
campaign, which has been running for months and has cost Intel several
millions of dollars, is designed to ensure that personal computer makers
carry an 'Intel inside' sticker on their products.
Mr Pfeiffer believes the Compaq brand name gives him a significant advantage
in a market where competitive products are often very similar in price and
performance and that the Intel sticker devalues that advantage. Compaq
believes it is not being rewarded by Intel for its position as the company's
largest customer. Intel has been driving down the price of its flagship
microprocessor, the Pentium, to defend and improve its market position. It
already supplies the microprocessors found in 90 per cent of the 40m
personal computers manufactured annually.
Compaq says it should be able to take advantage of its bulk buying power to
secure discounts that would enable it to command higher growth profit
margins.
Compaq is angry that Intel continues to make its own personal computers in
competition with Compaq.
The row has delighted Intel's competitors, including the US companies AMD
and Cyrix who have been trying to break Intel's stranglehold on the market.
Mr Hans Geyer, Intel's general manager for Europe, replying to Mr Pfeiffer's
accusations, said that the company would not be deflected from its strategy
set out by Mr Andrew Grove, the company's combative chief executive.
Industry experts believe that only one or two microprocessors will have
significant market share in future. Competitors include Intel, IBM which has
developed a chip called Power PC, and Digital Equipment with its Alpha chip.
called Alpha. The row between Compaq and Intel, if not resolved quickly,
could significantly change the balance of power in this war.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Rail chiefs plan to share cost of future disruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of future rail strikes will be covered by an industry-wide
risk-sharing scheme, the office of the rail franchising director said
yesterday.
The scheme would spread the cost of 'severe disruption', such as strikes,
bridge or tunnel collapses and acts of terrorism, between operating
companies.
It would also help to reduce the threat posed to the privatisation of the
railway by the continuing signal workers' dispute, now entering its 14th
week. The RMT transport union has said that the damage caused by the strikes
to the finances of the train operating companies will make it impossible to
sell them to the private sector before the next general election.
However, a spokesman for the franchising directors said there had 'been no
lessening of interest from the companies seeking to buy franchises' since
the dispute started.
The risk-sharing scheme under discussion would go further than existing
industry arrangements because it would indemnify train operating companies
against revenue losses and not just against the direct cost of an incident.
The franchising director's office said: 'Strikes would be a risk that would
be managed. The details are still being discussed and finalised.'
The franchising director and the train operating companies have been in
talks with the insurance industry to devise a method of covering
catastrophic losses. At present, British Rail meets all but the largest
losses.
But a conventional insurance arrangement would be extremely expensive,
insurance industry sources said. Insuring railway operations would be a new
experience for British insurers, so initially premiums would be high.
Insurance costs could be the third-largest item of expenditure for the train
operators after track access charges and salaries. A risk-sharing scheme, by
contrast, would be cheaper to operate.
Rail industry officials believe the signal workers' strike is the 'last
gasp' of the old railway structure. Drivers and maintenance workers will in
future be employed by individual companies so would not have the capacity to
disrupt the entire network.
In a separate development, the Department of Transport and Railtrack denied
they had discussed a 'doomsday plan' to sack the signal workers and shut
large parts of the railway network if the dispute continued.
The next two-day stoppage is due to start at midnight although Railtrack
said it expects to open more than half of the network.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Japan's banks rejoin Euro-loans market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, NICHOLAS DENTON and DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese banks have started an aggressive push into the European syndicated
loan market, helping to push down banks' margins on lending to large
companies close to the levels of the late 1980s, according to bankers.
Smaller Japanese banks pulled back from lending at fine margins to European
companies after the 1988 Basle accord, which required banks to hold more
capital against loans. But they re-entered the market this summer.
'They are back in the market in a big way,' said Mr Grant Johnson, a
director at NatWest Markets.
The renewed push by Japanese banks has led to margins on syndicated loans -
where several banks share a large loan to a company - and has worried
bankers because it has contributed to margins falling to half the level of a
year ago.
Bankers say that loans to 'investment grade' companies must have margins of
at least 0.8 per cent above the cost of funds to cover fixed costs and make
a return on capital. Such loans are now being made at margins of below 0.25
per cent.
Many European and US banks are competing to lend to high credit quality
companies because loan demand from other sectors of the economy is weak.
Japanese banks have recovered from the worst effects of the recession in
Japan.
The recovery in the Tokyo stock market compared with the lows of two years
ago and the strength of the yen has helped to shore up banks' balance
sheets.
Aggressive competition for business, in which the Japanese banks played a
central role, led many banks to make loans at uneconomic margins in the late
1980s. One senior banker warned: 'Banks are starting to shoot themselves in
the foot.'
Although large Japanese banks such as Fuji and Sumitomo remained in the
London market - the centre for European syndicated loans - many of the 130
smaller banks authorised to lend overseas withdrew at the turn of the
decade.
But European bankers say they believe that smaller banks were given a signal
by the Japanese Ministry of Finance after the financial year-end in April
that they could resume lending abroad.
The treasurer of one company said it was hard a year ago to get banks to
make five-year loans, but that had changed.

FT  12 SEP 94 / EU rebuffs US plan to lift ban on Bosnia arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   USEDOM, GERMANY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union foreign minis-ters have rejected lifting the arms embargo
against the Bosnian Moslem-led government, calling it an 'absolute last
resort'.
The stage is thus set for a rift with the US over the war in the former
Yugoslav republic.
EU ministers, meeting at the weekend on the remote island of Usedom on
Germany's Baltic coast, said lifting the embargo would probably lead to a
withdrawal or dramatic scaling down of the UN's humanitarian and
peace-keeping mission.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, warned of 'incalculable
consequences' should US President Bill Clinton press ahead with his plan to
start lifting sanctions if the Bosnian Serbs failed to agree to the US-EU
peace settlement by October 15.
The fragile cessation of hostilities and the risks of a wider winter war in
Bosnia were driven home early yesterday morning after Mr Hans Koschnik, the
EU administrator in the ethnically divided town of Mostar, narrowly escaped
assassination in a rocket-propelled grenade attack. News of the assault
shocked EU ministers, who called on President Franjo Tudjman to control
renegade Croatian forces. Earlier they backed a strategy of 'total
isolation' of the Bosnian Serbs in the hope of forcing a peace settlement in
the next few months.
At the same time, ministers edged towards approval for rewarding Serbia for
its month-long blockade of the Bosnian Serbs, starting with a suspension of
sport and cultural sanctions and a re-opening of Belgrade airport to
international flights.
However, Mr Kinkel emphasised that the reward was depended on President
Slobodan Milosevic accepting a 'credible international presence' to monitor
the border with the Bosnian Serbs and ensuring that the border was sealed to
prevent weapons smuggling.
Latest EU intelligence reports suggest that the threat of renewed fighting
this winter is real. Officials at the foreign ministers' meeting spoke of
deteriorating relations between Croats and Moslems, with the Bosnian Serbs
girding themselves to strike against the Moslems if the arms embargo is
lifted. British officials made clear at the weekend that the US would bear
the brunt of recriminations which were bound to follow a withdrawal of the
UN peace-keepers. They held out little hope that the US administration can
persuade Congress to drop its support for lifting the embargo.
Mr Clinton opposes lifting the embargo unilaterally, but has agreed to
launch a diplomatic effort to persuade the UN Security Council to move in
that direction on October 15.
If the Security Council blocks the move, the US is likely to move towards a
unilateral lifting of the embargo a month later. British officials said it
was unlikely that either the UK or France would veto a resolution because of
a common reluctance to veto a Security Council motion sponsored by the US.
Alison Maitland in London adds: Mr John Major, the British prime minister,
will today be briefed on the situation in Bosnia by Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
defence secretary, and Field Marshal Sir Peter Inge, chief of the defence
staff. Officials said no decision had been made on whether British troops
should be withdrawn.
Britain has 3,300 troops in Bosnia.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Finance (8): Dollars 4bn
sell-off was historic peak - Apart from KPN, there are few big
privatisations left in the Netherlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Netherlands' privatisation programme reached a historic peak in early
June when the government sold a 30 per cent stake in Koninklijke PTT
Nederland (KPN), the country's telecommunications and postal company, to
investors for Fl 6.9bn (Dollars 3.9bn).
A second tranche of KPN shares, representing a holding of at least 20 per
cent but probably significantly more, is due to take place before the end of
1997. At the present share price for KPN, this would raise a minimum of Fl
4.6bn for the government, and mark another important milestone for
privatisation in the Netherlands.
However, apart from the rich pickings offered by KPN, there are few big
privatisations left in the Netherlands, a country which never went in for
the large-scale nationalisations that have left European counterparts such
as France and Italy with holdings ranging from banks and insurers to
computer companies.
So far, the new government that was sworn in late last month has given no
sign that it intends to step up the pace of privatisations.
Unlike some other countries, privatisation is normally a politically neutral
concept in the Netherlands. The Dutch state has not made long-term,
concerted efforts to create a 'people's capitalism' along the lines of that
which Margaret Thatcher pursued when she was prime minister of the UK. At
the same time, privatisation is not a party-political issue.
This was underlined by the KPN transaction, which took place a month after
an inconclusive general election had left the country in a political vacuum
with a caretaker government. However, because all four main political
parties had given full support to the flotation ahead of the election, the
sell-off went ahead as planned and as scheduled.
The lack of political opposition to privatisation in the Netherlands means
that most of the rest of the state's corporate holdings could be sold off
without too much difficulty.
In Dutch, 'privatisation' has a double meaning that can be confusing to
foreigners. As in the Anglo-Saxon sense of the word, it can mean the sale of
government shares to outside investors, generally by means of a bourse
flotation. But it can also mean the process by which a government entity or
organisation is turned into a public limited company and allowed to act like
a private, commercial enterprise. All the shares remain government-owned,
but the organisation is considered to be part of the private sector.
This was done at KPN in 1989, as a prelude to this year's bourse flotation.
But the same process has taken place at smaller organisations, such as the
State Mint, which mints government coins and medals. Its 'privatisation'
took place on January 1. 'For the time being, all shares will remain in
government hands,' the finance ministry said. 'But it cannot be ruled out
that the mint may be sold if there is an attractive offer from a serious
company.'
The Dutch state's holdings are a mixture of minority stakes in
publicly-quoted companies, such as steel group Hoogovens, chemicals group
DSM and the national carrier KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, as well as 100 per
cent ownership of organisations such as Dutch Rail and the Government
Printing Office.
Many of the stakes, such as the government's minority holding in Fokker, the
aircraft manufacturer, are the results of rescues or capital injections. The
Dutch state tends to see these holdings as temporary and when circumstances
permit will reduce its stakes. In the case of KLM, the government's stake
has fallen from as high as 78 per cent in the mid-1970s to around 38.2 per
cent today.
Shares owned in companies that already have a share listing are easier for
the Dutch state to sell. One of most obvious candidates in this category is
DSM, in which the government still has a 31 per cent stake following the
public sale of the rest of its shares in two tranches of around 34 per cent
each in January and September 1989.
Unlike the situation surrounding KLM, where there is perhaps a strategic
value in owning shares because of the political nature of international
aviation agreements, there is no reason for the Dutch state to hold on to
its DSM shares.
However, no date has been given for the sell-off. 'We have a written
commitment from the state that it will first consult with us,' said Ad
Timmermans, the company's finance director, last month.
The company has said it would prefer the next, and presumably last, tranche
of the state's shares not to be sold through a public offering, as in the
previous two tranches, to avoid the need for time-consuming road shows to
potential investors.
The DSM sale is likely, but not guaranteed, to take place later in the
1990s. One definite sale, which has already been agreed in principle, is the
divestment of the state's remaining 20 per cent stake in Fokker, the Dutch
aircraft maker. Deutsche Aerospace, part of Germany's Daimler-Benz group,
bought a 51 per cent stake in Fokker in 1993 through the purchase of new
shares and shares owned by the Dutch government. The contract stipulated
that the government would sell its remaining stake to DASA in 1996.
Apart from DSM and Fokker, there are few immediate privatisation candidates,
but there are other possibilities if the government needs to raise money to
reduce the large and growing public debt. The remaining choices, however,
have the potential to create controversy.
For example, the Dutch railway system, sometimes mentioned as a long-term
privatisation candidate, is still loss-making. Any sale of the company which
would herald a rise in passenger fares could be expected to be
controversial.
Equally, any move to sell off part of the state's majority holding in
Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport would put the government in a delicate position
because of the continuing debate between proponents and opponents over the
airport's ambitious expansion plans.

FT  12 SEP 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Merloni earnings
jump 51%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction appended to this article.
Pre-tax profits at Merloni Elettrodomestici, the Italian manufacturer of
domestic appliances, increased by 51 per cent in the first half of 1994,
helped by increased sales outside Italy.
Merloni, quoted on the Milan stock exchange but majority-owned by the
Merloni family, announced on Friday that profits rose to L21.6bn (Dollars
13.7m) in the first half of this year, compared with L14.3bn last time.
The company, which trades under the Ariston, Indesit and Scholtes brands,
recorded consolidated sales of L905bn, against L726bn, an increase of 24 per
cent.
With the consolidation of the company's production units in Turkey and
Portugal, some 72 per cent of sales - or L657bn compared with L495bn a year
earlier - are now made outside Italy, although exports were virtually the
same as in the equivalent period. Excluding the Portuguese and Turkish
factories, Merloni's total turnover rose by 16 per cent.
On Friday, Merloni shares rose to L5,450, compared with an opening price of
L5,405.
Merloni is the only large Italian white goods producer still in Italian
hands, but it faces stiff competition from larger rivals such as Zanussi,
owned by Electrolux of Sweden, which also achieves about 70 per cent of its
sales overseas.
In July, Zanussi announced that its operating profits had increased by 51.3
per cent to L257bn in 1993, on sales of L3,022bn, of which L2,079bn came
from abroad.
CORRECTION
In an article from 12 Sept entitled 'Merloni earnings jump 51%', it was
stated that 'Merloni is the only large Italian white goods producer in
Italian hands'. Candy Group have asked us to point out that Candy
Domestic Appliances Spa is a privately owned Italian company.

FT  10 SEP 94 / International Company News: Anglovaal industrial unit ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Anglovaal Industries, the industrial arm of Anglovaal, the South African
mining house, increased attributable profit for the year to June by 18 per
cent to R407.1m (Dollars 110.6m) from R343.7m for the previous year.
Pre-tax profits rose 8 per cent to R763.8m from R704.4m, but an 8 per cent
decrease in tax paid to R220.3m from R238.8m helped to lift bottom-line
earnings. This was in spite of the inclusion of a one-off transitional levy
of 5 per cent to help pay for April's elections.
Turnover rose 16 per cent to R9.67bn from R8.32bn, of which 5 per cent was
the result of acquisitions. The dividend was increased to 230 cents from 195
cents. However, due to reduced cash resources and additional borrowings, net
financing costs on the year were R14.4m, a sharp reversal from the previous
year's R18m in net interest income.
Mr Jan Robbertze, managing director, said trading had been negatively
affected by the political uncertainty in the run-up to the election but
conditions had improved significantly in May and June.
Mr Robbertze said certain of the group's holdings, which include Consol,
plastics manufacturer; Irvin and Johnson, food processor and Grinaker,
construction and electronics group, still had substantial idle capacity and
suffered from pressure on margins.

<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Banco Portugues do Atlantico, Portugal's second largest bank, are
to be readmitted to trading on the Lisbon stock exchange on Monday after a
month's suspension following the announcement of a hostile bid by Banco
Comercial Portugues, a smaller rival.
The securities exchange commission (CMVM) suspended the shares on August 10
after BCP's Es132bn (Dollars 39.04bn) offer for a controlling stake of 40
per cent of BPA.
BPA shares were last quoted at Es2,650, a gain of 31.8 per cent from July 26
when BCP bid Es3,000 a share. The CMVM said BCP could buy 1.65m shares, 1.5
per cent of BPA capital, at the offer price. But BCP will be allowed to
purchase these shares only if the government authorises the offer. A
decision is expected on Tuesday.

FT  10 SEP 94 / TSB to end commission for life sales staff
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB is to merge its banking and insurance sales force as part of a shake-up.
The banking group said yesterday that it will pay its insurance sales staff
a salary rather than commission.
It will introduce a package made up of a basic salary, a team bonus based on
branch sales and customer service performance, and a personal bonus which
will be based on overall performance rather than specific product sales
targets.
TSB said that, under the new regime, bank managers would take on the
supervision of staff selling banking and insurance products.
The move, which comes into effect on November 1, is the final stage in TSB's
bancassurance strategy, it said.
Mr John Elbourne, retail director, said the shake-up meant the bank was
'offering best advice across the total product range and creating the most
fully integrated banc-assurance structure in the UK'.

FT  10 SEP 94 / God the economist: Michael Holman finds Christian Aid on his
doorstep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christian Aid says: 'It seems that God is very interested in economics.'
It may well be that this respected British charity is absolutely right.
But as the opening argument in Christian Aid's indictment of the World Bank
and IMF, it is somewhat disconcerting.
We all know the feeling. The doorbell rings, and there stands an intense,
well-meaning evangelist, tract in hand.
Common courtesy then requires that we at least give the visitor a hearing,
but we are determined we will not get drawn in. Otherwise before we know it,
we are engaged in a debate based on a premise which we were too polite to
reject, but which takes on a logic of its own.
Thus it is with Who Runs the World, Christian Aid's analysis of the Bank and
the Fund. It contains a blast of Old Testament fire and brimstone, with a
whiff of humbug.
It begins: it seems fair to assume that God may well be 'very interested in
economics'.
Christian Aid, ensconced on my mental doorstep presses on. The text starts
to take on a conversational life of its own, assisted by its use of italics
and bold type.
Christian Aid now fixes me with the gaze of the proselytiser who has made a
breakthrough.
'The main reason for failing to worship the true God is our unchallenged and
sinful allegiance to other sources of power in our world.'
There is no answer to that. 'Yes, well, I see what you mean, even if I do
not actually believe in God, as such . . .'
The doorstepper now gets a glint in their eyes. The voice shifts from
italics, which was bad enough - the visual equivalent of enunciating words
slowly and carefully to someone who is either a foreigner, or mentally
challenged.
I am now addressed in bold.
'So if our financial institutions destroy poor people they must be judged.'
I am now the quarry caught in the headlamps, bemused.
I search for an escape. Humour them, always humour them . . .'Yes, you may
well have a point,' I mumble. I am about to say: 'I think that is my
'phone.' Too late.
Christian Aid, foot now firmly in the doorway, cunningly changes the tone.
Calmly, in a voice patient and reasonable, the logic of the premise is
pursued: 'Behaviour that destroys the poor person is always condemned (in
the bible).'
Without warning, another burst of bold:
'So if we accept powerful financial systems without question we may fall
into sin.'
One final salvo and Christian Aid, armed with the Good Book and the
testimony of its ideological missionaries in the field, has cleared the way
for the onslaught on the IMF and the Bank:
'So we are called upon to dream about God's will done on earth.'
I shake myself awake: 'Were not these countries in a spot of bother before
the Fund and the Bank had a go at them?'
Christian Aid makes a small concession. 'Even before Structural Adjustment
Programmes came on the scene, third world countries were already in great
difficulties. In some, a few people with influence in government or business
had sufficient power to protect or even enrich themselves . . .'
I start to splutter. Worse, I find myself speaking in italics. 'A few?' I'm
even tempted to use bold, but stick to italics. 'Even enrich themselves?'
I want to add: 'Is that all you can say about a whole generation of
kleptocrats?' But Christian Aid is in full flight.
'Third world governments had borrowed money in the 1970s . . . to cover the
cost of rocketing oil prices and to build and improve necessities such as
roads, schools and factories.'
This is too much. 'Hang on] What about white elephants, French chateaux and
Swiss bank accounts?'
But Christian Aid has moved on, offering testimony from those Third World
citizens afflicted by the IMF and Bank policies.
'There is an astonishing level of knowledge' about the activities of the
duo, says Christian Aid, quoting the testimony of the 'victims'.
I try to calm down. 'Yes, but they do not always get the full picture. You
know, no money for medicine but enough to buy those new tanks.'
Again, Christian Aid has a ready response on behalf of the 'victims of the
World Bank's failure to listen'.
'Some governments too do not listen to their people.'
'It is more than some, it is most governments,' I want to add.
I am now getting even more irritated. 'Will you not at least concede that
something had to be done?' I ask.
Christian Aid frowns: 'Some failures have certainly been due to the
incompetence or corruption of third world governments . . . Change certainly
had to happen.'
I nod vigorously - but too soon.
'We do not absolve governments of their responsibilities . . . but argue
that the World Bank and the IMF should take into account what governments
are actually likely to do and what it is politically possible for them to
achieve.'
I have one last go. 'I do not quite follow. Could you explain how this would
apply to Daniel arap Moi, widely believed to be putting away a bit of the
old what-have-you while living above the shop?'
But by now we have lost each other. Shared passions, shared concerns, but
divided by our convictions. Who is right? God knows.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Safety in numbers, the family logic: Those who want to halt
population growth do not understand human nature
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nine months ago my sister, Thomasina, died. She was 32. My immediate
emotions were of simple grief, partly at my own loss, partly at her much
greater one. But the passage of time has brought with it other, more complex
and surprising emotions.
In particular I have begun to feel, in some strange way, outnumbered: that
the balance of Lawsons versus the rest of the world has been altered to my
family's disadvantage.
I felt this most strongly, I am ashamed to say, at a gathering with my best
friend and her four brothers. Much as I liked them all, I was overcome by
envy of their superior force.
It is not as though I am without allies, however. I have two remaining
sisters, and come to that, a further two half-siblings. But the feeling of
being outnumbered remains.
However, being neither an unreasonable nor a vindictive man, I do not
propose to demand a cull of my friends' families in order to restore the
local balance of power. I am not even tempted to demand reprisals among the
many more numerous families in the great world outside, in order to ensure
that the Lawsons are not defeated in their aspirations by the madding and
ever-competitive crowd.
That however, does seem to be the motive of those developed world delegates
in Cairo for this week's United Nation's International Conference on
Population and Development. They are deeply worried that the earth's
environment will not be able to support the growing industrialisation of the
developing world's billions.
Or, not to beat around the bush, western delegates are concerned that they
themselves might be facing much stiffer competition for the resources which
in the past - first through colonialism and later through superior economic
power - they have found it so easy to acquire.
Naturally the western delegates in teeming Cairo do not quite express things
in this way. They prefer to say that it is in the developing world's own
best interests to limit their populations.
This argument persists, even though there is no proven connection between
high densities of population and poverty - think of Singapore and Taiwan
versus Mongolia and Chad - and even though there is clear evidence of
declining birth rates in the developing world without any intervention from
western busybodies such as Lady Chalker.
One country in which coercive, imposed birth control has been tried is the
People's Republic of China, which aspired to become the-not-so-many-people's
republic of China. The result has been the widespread slaughter of female
infants, and the creation of a class of fat, spoiled only-sons. Meanwhile,
in the province of Canton, booming through the recent introduction of local
capitalism, there is an acute labour shortage.
Here, indeed, lies the solution, if one is needed. Capitalism has
consistently showed itself capable of refuting Malthus's ancient prediction
that food production could not keep up with population. Indeed, the problem
has recently proved quite the reverse: there has been a global
overproduction of food, creating such economic absurdities as the Common
Agricultural Policy.
Meanwhile the African starvation which we witness so distressingly on our
television screen is directly the result, not of unchecked fornication, as
the Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Fairbairn argues, but of the imposition of
feudal or socialist economic policies. And, much as Lady Chalker and Sir
Nicholas might dislike the thought, the rational response to a high
mortality rate is to produce more children.
It would be irresponsible for the heads of any family to behave otherwise,
unless it craves extinc-tion.
For this reason, what I would most have wanted, in the nine months since my
sister's death, is to have fathered another child. And, in the absence of
that, the continued rude health of my 20-month-old daughter is the greatest
consolation; that, together with the arrival of my first niece, born a week
after my sister's death, and named Cosima Thomasina.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Private View: Aussie boyo comes out punching - Bob Hawke
still displays the pugilistic streak that carried him to the top in
Australian politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly three years after being knocked out of the political ring, veteran
pugilist Bob Hawke is still throwing punches. Australia's four-term former
prime minister might have dropped in the weights since the Labor party
leadership was snatched from him, but he looks very fit for 64: short, wiry,
quick on his toes and eager to trade blows.
He was in London this week to promote The Hawke Memoirs, a smoothly-written
record of his triumphs which critics have found self-serving, even by the
standards of political autobiography. In particular, Hawke's successor, Paul
Keating - his one-time finance minister and friend - gets a pasting.
In the snakepit of Australian politics, attack is the usual form of defence.
When I suggested that the memoirs had the tone of a man who felt grossly
under-valued - I did not dare use the word 'whingeing' - Hawke began
chastising the Australian media for bias. They were the reason, he said, why
he had 'inclined to be emphatic'.
Like Margaret Thatcher, Hawke lost his premiership in an inner-party putsch.
Was he still as sore about it as she appeared to be?
'No. I believed the party had the right to make a mistake, if I can put it
that way. I did not feel bitterness about the party making a decision. I did
have some bitterness about some of the tactics that were employed and what,
in my judgment, was some unprincipled, dishonest undermining.'
What happens to a man used to power and attention when it is taken away?
'I can't say what happens with Mrs Thatcher or someone else. But with this
man - because I've done it all my life - when I've finished one thing, I get
very interested and involved in the next stage of my career.'
His plan to re-launch himself as a television interviewer of world leaders
fell through. Instead, Hawke has set up as a consultant on Asian affairs and
has a couple of Australian university chairs he has yet to warm.
There must be some withdrawal symptoms, I said.
'I don't know how long I've got to go on about it. At the time, right at the
time, there was. But what I'm saying is, that's something that's finished. I
don't want to go into what I've earned in this period. But I've earned very
well. My time has been fully occupied working long hours and a whole range
of things which are tremendously satisfying.
'You either believe me or you don't. I mean, I keep saying I'm not one that
looks back. I fought to keep the position. I was hurt right then, but then
that was it. Done.' He punched the palm of his hand.
Do you see in Paul Keating some of your own faults?
'No, no. That's a nice bit of amateur psychology. But entirely without
foundation.'
Hawke took the question as a reference to his own ousting of Bill Hayden
(now Australia's Governor-General) as Labor leader before the election
victory of 1983. 'The evidence showed that I was the one to get Labor into
power, and not Bill. Here (in 1991), you had a situation where the contender
said that even if he had a less chance of winning the next election than me,
he wanted it because it was his turn. That sort of ambition was totally
different.'
I reminded Hawke of some of the pejoratives he had used about Keating. He
picked up a copy of the memoirs and began to read from one of many marked
pages: 'From hesitant beginnings, Paul had grown in confidence, competence,
courage, imagination and determination . . .'
I know political memoirs are an exercise in self-justification, I said, but,
in retrospect, might you have left all that stuff about Keating out?
'Of course I wouldn't' He glared at me as if I had lost my marbles. 'Why
would you? I mean, has history changed? Do the facts change?'
Maybe it would have been more dignifed . . .
'What's the question of dignified?' he spluttered.
To say less, I mean.
'Why? What's the question of dignity involved in history. That may be your
perception about one's responsibility writing the facts of history, and why
and how things happened. All I can say to you is it's not mine. If the
concept underlying your question is that dignity is more important than the
facts . . . that's a perverse view.'
It wasn't, quite. But it was a good jab, and I stepped back.
Hawke achieved his aim of making Labor a natural party of government by
grabbing the political centre. He also embarked on a bonfire of
protectionist controls. What advice had he got for Tony Blair, Britain's new
Labour leader?
'I don't presume to tell him - I would want you to preface with that. But,
for what its worth, he should adopt policies that are relevant to the needs
and aspirations of the country. It's no good having outdated shibboleths.
The basic philosophy is to pursue policies which will be electorally
relevant and acceptable.'
At the same time, he added, a social democratic government should see its
role as creating equality of opportunity for every citizen.
Hawke's mother, Ellie, a strictly religious person like her husband, Clem,
was convinced her boy was destined for great things - especially after his
elder brother, Neil, died young of meningitis. I asked him if he shared her
conviction.
'I had some sense that, in a strange way, my life had been developing in a
way that was preparing me for the capacity to move through the ranks of the
labour movement to leadership. It's a very fair question, a relevant one.'
After reading law and economics, and with politics at the back of his mind,
he went as a Rhodes Scholar to Oxford University where his choice of
research topic - Australia's unusual wage-bargaining system - led to a job
with, and inexorable rise to the top of, the Australian Council of Trade
Unions, the equivalent of Britain's TUC.
'The way those things happened, it was almost as though . . . if I'd been
sitting there, almost being able to choreograph the steps in a career, you
couldn't have done it any more relevantly. That's the point I'm making. I'm
not excluding the fact that within me there was a well-developed ambition to
move through and go to the top.'
If Bob Hawke once was famous for his gambling, swearing, drinking and
womanising, he was even more famous for his public confessions and tears. I
asked this former yard-of-ale record holder: Why did you hit the bottle so
hard?
'Oh, I don't know. I tended to do everything hard. Remember when I had the
accident and nearly died?' (While at university, he crashed his Panther
motorcycle and ruptured his spleen.) 'I just then determined to do
everything flat out. I didn't determine to drink flat out - the main thing I
determined to do flat out was in respect of my studies. But I was a person
that was full of energy. I never did things in a half-hearted way. In a
sense, that applied to my socialising.'
Was it just socialising, or were you trying to get away from something?
'No. As I said, I shared Churchill's view that I got more out of drink than
it got out of me. It was a very useful and important part of developing
relationships, cementing them. The Australian political labour and
industrial scene is a very gregarious, mateship sort of thing. The reason I
gave it up was there were too many instances where I behaved stupidly. I
wasn't proud of some of the things I did.' In 1980, with the Labor
leadership in his sights he turned over a new leaf and became teetotal.
Many writers have described Hawke as an exceptionally paradoxical,
complicated man. Did he agree?
'Well, I don't know what 'complicated' means. I'm not being semantic about
this. Whether I am, in fact, more complicated that Joe Blow, I don't know.
Neither do you. I'm not professionally qualified to answer the question. I
wonder whether it only becomes an issue because I'm a prominent person.
'I don't fully know myself. No human being does. But to the extent that I do
know myself, I don't think I am terribly complex. I understand what drives
me. I understand what my passions are. But I could be wrong.'
The boyo image, I said, was almost a caricature of an Australian: was that
really you, or something you found politically useful?
'Oh, come on. Come on, don't be silly. You really are an amateur
psychologist. I am a gregarious bloke who loves his sport, is passionate
about his sport and good at it, loves people . . . in a sense, a
quintessential Australian since I've been like that.' He held his palm close
to the floor.
'Sport, people, lack of pretence. Let's get down to it. That's been me all
my life. I mean,' he sniffed, 'that's how I've related to the Australian
people. To come along now with this 'Have you really adopted this persona?'
Come off it, mate]'
People seem to be confused by you, I said. That's why I ask.
'That's why I'm giving you a direct answer. To refute the nonsense.'
I nipped across the ring and asked why there was no mention of the
entrepreneurs Kerry Packer or Alan Bond in the memoirs, and only one of
Rupert Murdoch - compared to King Midas. Your left-wing critics have made a
lot of the fact that you were big mates with them and say you gave them the
run of the roost.
'Wait a minute. If I spent my time writing about inaccuracy and
misrepresentation . . . I mean, it was a canard from the word Go. I knew
these people. Bond, early in my prime ministership, wins the America's Cup.
I was photographed with him and lauded him for what he did, as did the rest
of Australia. I was never close mates with Bond, or with Packer or with
Murdoch. They had no part in determining the policy I ran.
'I happened to believe that Australia was over-regulated, and that it had
been buggered by a conservative government which was supposed to be for free
enterprise but continued to cosset it behind high tariff walls. I was for
internationalising the economy' . . . here he banged his fist . . .
'deregulating, bringing in foreign banks, floating the dollar. Within that
context, you have entrepreneurs who go like that.' He shot his arm towards
the ceiling. 'Big surprise]'
Australia, I said, used to be seen as brash, noisy and chippy - a bit
ashamed of its culture. Do you think it has grown up in some way?
'I think it has in many ways, yes. It is true we have been exporting
reasonable quality culture for a goodly period of time.' He made it sound
like wooltops.
'But you're right. Australia's got more confidence in itself now, beyond the
traditional areas where we were great at tennis and swimming and so on.
'Some of the insouciance you talk about is still there. I hope for God's
sake it will remain a part of us. But now there's a quality of real
self-assurance, as distinct from the attractive bravado.'
I stepped from the ring to leave the former title-holder looking as fresh as
a daisy for the next bout. Thanks very much, I said,
'It's been a pleasure,' he replied. 'The economics, the politics - and the
psychology]'

FT  10 SEP 94 / Sport: Grand carnage - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomorrow's men's singles final of the 114th US Championships at the National
Tennis Centre, Flushing Meadow, will produce a new champion. That much, at
least, is certain at the end of a fortnight when upsets have abounded. Who
we shall be hailing as he holds aloft the famous silver cup and pockets a
cheque worth Dollars 550,000 is difficult to predict.
In today's semi-finals, the 1991 Wimbledon champion, Michael Stich of
Germany, seeded No 4, will play unseeded Karel Novacek of the Czech
Republic, ranked 56, in the top half. In the lower half, Andre Agassi,
unseeded for the first time since 1987, will play fellow American Todd
Martin, seeded No 9.
When Jaime Yzaga beat Pete Sampras, the defending champion, on Tuesday it
meant that for the first time since tennis went open in 1968, only three of
the seeds had reached the quarter-finals: Stich, Martin, and the left-handed
Austrian, Thomas Muster (13). Once again, the growing depth in the men's
game was apparent.
The carnage had begun early. Wimbledon finalist Goran Ivanisevic (2) fell at
the first hurdle to the German giant Markus Zoecke whose serve is nearly as
big as his own. 'Maybe it's a brain injury. As soon as I come here it is
finished. It's not a problem with New York, it's a problem with me,' said
Ivanisevic.
Boris Becker (7), also lost in the first round, beaten by America's Richey
Reneberg. The 1989 champion was disappointed. 'I thought I had a good
chance,' said Becker. 'But it was extremely slow this year - both the court
and the heavier, softer balls.' Almost as slow as Becker himself, one might
have added.
Another former US Open winner, fifth seeded Stefan Edberg (1991, 1992), fell
in the third round to fellow Swede and frequent practice partner, Jonas
Bjorkman. The match was played at night in the same cold, windy conditions
that had prevailed when Edberg lost to Aaron Krickstein in 1988. Thus, for
the first year since 1986, Edberg has failed to reach a Grand Slam final. He
was the victim of his own frailty on serve and an inspired piece of
attacking play from Bjorkman who had given notice of his advance by beating
French Open champion Sergi Bruguera two weeks ago in Schenectady.
Bruguera had performed well at Flushing Meadow until he was hammered into
submission by Muster in the fourth round.
Michael Chang, the sixth seed, believes that he is at his best on the
surface. He proved it, too, in one of the best matches of the tournament
when he faced Agassi in the fourth round. It was a full-blooded contest. The
quality of shot-making from both men was remarkable, the result a tonic for
a sport that badly needs the survival of characters like Agassi.
If, at times, Agassi's sinister black cap, black, white and blue striped
shirt, plus black socks and shoes, makes him look more like Darth Vader than
a tennis player as he darts about firing bullets from his light-sabre of a
racket, one can still admire his astonishing timing and his courage in going
for his shots.
Whether Martin will be cast in the role of Luke Skywalker this afternoon
remains to be seen. Certainly the tall, upright, all-American boy has done
well to survive after saving three match points against Guillaume Raoux of
France in the first round. He is carrying a groin injury that inhibits his
movement and is playing well below the form that took him to the final of
the Australian Open in January and the semi-finals at Wimbledon. Yet he will
start as favourite. Martin has won three of his five matches against Agassi.
At a time when the age eligibility rules for women are being redefined to
protect the young from burn out and exploitation, Steffi Graf, herself an
infant prodigy when she began, will be defending her title today against the
22-year-old from Spain, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario. The great rivalry that is
developing between these two - Graf leads 24-7 but has lost two of their
last three meetings after holding match points in both - is about the only
thing that is holding the women's game together. Already, the shortage of
quality performers has brought a restlessness among the tournament promoters
and some of the leading players. Together with the International Management
Group they are proposing a revamped circuit with fewer tournaments.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Sport: Fall in a minor key - Baseball
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For this baseball fan, the season began with all the promise of a sunny
April afternoon. On opening day at Yankee Stadium, the home team put on a
display that signalled a year filled with tantalising possibilities.
Four months later, my summer ended on an ambivalent note, far away from the
top tier of the professional ranks, where play has been brought to a halt by
a player strike. At Skylands Park, 65 miles west of New York city, the New
Jersey Cardinals were showcasing the scrappy brand of baseball which
attracted thousands of new fans to 'minor league' ballparks this year.
This year was marked by a rebirth of sorts for the minor leagues, where
small-town clubs such as New Jersey helped fill the void left by the strike
for millions of disenfranchised fans.
The walkout - which involves players on the 28 teams which comprise the
American and National leagues - is in its fifth week. It has forced the
cancellation of hundreds of games. With only 23 days left in the regular
schedule, there is no agreement in sight.
The cessation of play could not have come at a worse time. Even if a
settlement is forthcoming, the strike has already spoiled a season in which
some of baseball's hallowed individual records were threatened for the first
time in decades.
The strike proved to be a windfall for the 200 or so minor league teams
which play in the relative obscurity of small cities and towns across the US
and Canada.
The main purpose of these 'farm' teams - most of which are independently
owned - is to cultivate young talent for the major leagues. In exchange for
an operating subsidy, each club fields players who can be moved around the
parent club's organisation at any time.
This year, the minor leagues carried their role to its logical conclusion.
The strike forced television networks that feature baseball as their
programming mainstay to turn in desperation to the farm system.
ESPN, the 24-hour sports channel, twice called on the Birmingham Barons of
the double-A (triple-A is the highest minor league level) Southern League to
fill embarrassing holes in its schedule. Why the Barons? Its left-fielder
happens to be a former professional basketballer by the name of Michael
Jordan.
Jordan's decision to try his hand at baseball this spring, brought a wave of
welcome publicity to the minors, but he deserves only a small part of the
credit for the farm system's season in the sun. After a long decline which
began in the 1960s, minor-league teams have been enjoying a steady
resurgence in popularity over the last few seasons.
In 1993, total attendance at minor-league games reached 32m, up from 10m in
the 1960s, when television introduced major-league action to the
hinterlands. Today, new minor-league ball parks such as Skylands are
springing up across the country, as local and state governments trip over
one another to entice franchises to their areas.
The reasons behind this resurgence are complex. In part, the farm teams have
benefited from a disenchantment with big league baseball which has been
bubbling just below the surface for years. The strike has further sullied
the image of a sport in which the median player salary is Dollars 500,000
(Pounds 322,600) and billionaire owners are suspected of cooking their books
to show operational losses.
As a consequence, young farm hands - who earn Dollars 1,400 a month plus
Dollars 18 a day in meal money - seem more like the idealised 'boys of
summer' than their big-league counterparts. Most minor leaguers support the
strike and, to a man, hope one day to make it to 'The Show'. But in the
friendly confines of a small stadium like Skylands, it is easy to imagine
the Cards are playing baseball for the sheer enjoyment of it. At least one
very rich Baron is certainly doing just that.
Economics has played a big role, too. Salaries are lower, and so are tickets
and refreshments. Families of average means - most of whom now live in the
suburbs - can enjoy professional baseball without the expense and
inconvenience of travelling to the big city.
At Skylands Park, the family event sphere seemed more like a county
fairground than a big-league ball-yard. The good-natured crowd was equally
divided between pre-teens - girls as well as boys - and their
thirtysomething parents. Beer drinkers were thin on the ground.
The atmosphere contrasted sharply with opening day at Yankee Stadium, where
players on the field had to compete for attention with the numerous brawls
which erupted in the grandstands.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Sport: The emperor climbs towards Olympus - Sport Politics /
The growing power of Primo Nebiolo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Olympic movement is poised for profound changes. Last week the
International Olympic Committee held its centenary congress in Paris. The
constitutional changes and elections that took place give some clues to the
future of the IOC.
President Juan Antonio Samaranch stands down in 1997. The succession may
well have been settled by the voting last week in the hotels of la Defense.
Primo Nebiolo had, on the face of it, a good week. The widely-feared emperor
of track and field, officially described as President of the International
Amateur Athletic Federation, saw the rules change to his benefit and the IOC
admit a new cadre of potential supporters. Making all members, elected or
appointed, eligible for every office gives an opportunity to the Monte
Carlo-based capo to stand for the top job three years from now. Bringing 10
presidents from international sports federations on to the IOC gives Nebiolo
an additional voting bloc.
Samaranch is 74, three years older than the Italian. He will almost
certainly leave it to ASOIF, the association of 27 summer Olympic sports, to
choose the nominees. Nebiolo, also President of ASOIF, has controlled this
organisation ruthlessly for a decade. His power is both patronage and the
allocation to individual sports of millions of dollars in revenues trickling
down from Olympic headquarters in Lausanne.
'Primo will do anything to ensure that these men owe their place on the IOC
to him and no other factor,' said one administrator who has known Nebiolo
for 20 years. 'When he gets them the job he'll give them the speech. 'I want
one thing in return, my dear friend, your total loyalty. When I come to you
in need, then you must help me.''
Those two phrases, 'my dear friend' and 'help me', uttered in an accent
horribly reminiscent of Marlon Brando in The Godfather, chill anyone who has
had dealings with Nebiolo. In the 1987 Rome scandal over the cheating
Italian long-jumper Giovanni Evangalista, Nebiolo was able to draw on the
support of three IAAF council members who owed their President everything.
'He has an executive council of trembling puppets. He is a powerful man who
gets his own way, superficially similar to Samaranch, so it is natural for
Nebiolo to see himself as a logical successor,' said the source.
Within the world of Grand Prix athletics, Nebiolo is acknowledged as having
been an effective bulldozer, changing a landscape ripe for redevelopment.
'As president of the IAAF he has been a fresh wind. Primo has consistently
removed or surmounted many barriers. A considerate manager, a gentleman,
would not have managed it,' said Res Brugger, organiser of the Zurich Grand
Prix meeting, in a recent interview with Sportinformationsdienst.
Yet comparisons with Samaranch, unparalleled moderniser of the Olympic
movement, are misleading. 'Measured against Samaranch, he is completely
unsuited to be President,' the source said. 'Primo's motives are totally
selfish and self-seeking. Samaranch may occasionally sup with the devil but
always for the good of the cause.'
The British have always been Nebiolo's particular phobia. Whether it is
their peculiar insistence on rules and transparent administration or
individual frictions (IOC member Princess Anne treated him with Arctic
disdain), his instinct for deals has repeatedly clashed with London's world
view. Nebiolo was in a carpet-biting rage over the British Athletic
Federation's decision not to withdraw its women's team from this weekend's
World Cup after the positive (IAAF-administered) drug test on 800m runner
Diane Modahl.
When the IOC in Paris elected Craig Reedie, chairman of the British Olympic
Association, to one of 12 new seats on the committee they may have been
bestowing more than an individual honour. If anyone has the instincts to
fight the tendencies Nebiolo represents, then it would be Reedie.
'He is one of the very few men who has always been firm with Nebiolo and
stood his ground whatever the pressure,' said John Holt, a former secretary
of the IAAF who worked with Reedie on Manchester's bid for the 2000
Olympics.
Reedie, a former president of the badminton federation, works as a director
of a Glasgow pensions company. He is the kind of Scotsman who would have
held out his fare as he stepped on to the Glasgow tram. Also with Reedie in
the new IOC intake are Gerhard Heiberg of Norway, Arne Ljungquist of Sweden
and Alex Gilady, an Israeli who, when he lived in the US, was a
vice-president of NBC television.
Since the mid-1980s it has been received wisdom among the savants of the
Olympic movement that this was an era dominated by Latin and Hispanic
interests. Barcelona received the 1992 Games from Samaranch (a Spaniard).
Mario Vasquez Rana (the Mexican IOC member) rose rapidly to huge influence
with southern hemisphere members. Primo Nebiolo built his long march on the
careful cultivation of personal contacts with Latin American and African
sports administrators. The arrogant, corinthian, Anglo-Saxon, attitudes of
Averey Brundage and Lord Exeter seemed to have been consigned to a
quasi-colonial past.
Yet no political situation or movement is ever static. Richard Pound, the
Toronto lawyer who is the most powerful member of the IOC after Samaranch,
and Dick Gosper, the Australian vice-president who has just retired after a
glittering career with Shell, now have powerful newly-elected allies who are
likely to see the world more from their perspective than Nebiolo's.
The next two Olympics, Atlanta in 1996 and Sydney in 2000, are both in
venues which, although famously multi-cultural, possess predominantly
Anglo-Saxon business cultures. Although the media largely greeted the Paris
changes as an open door for Nebiolo, it may prove to be one which slams in
his face.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Motoring: Urbane additions to the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The competition is going to be red-hot in Britain's luxury car market this
autumn. Four new models from Audi, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover will slug it
out with the well established Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Lexus LS400.
I have driven all the newcomers but cannot yet write about the Jaguar and
Land Rover - even though security surrounding the latest Jaguar XJ Series
and the first completely new Range Rover for 24 years has been less than
cast iron. Sneak pictures and descriptions of their features have been
appearing in enthusiast magazines for a year or more. But accepting
invitations to official launches, which may run for several weeks, means one
is honour bound to observe an embargo against publishing before the last of
the international motoring writers has flown home.
So, although my lips may be sealed until the end of this month so far as
Jaguar and Range Rover are concerned, I will say this. Jaguar already sells
twice as many luxury cars in Britain as its nearest rival, BMW. The new XJ
models can only put it still further ahead.
I do not go along with Land Rover's claim that the Range Rover is a direct
competitor with the likes of the BMW 7-Series, Audi A8, Mercedes-Benz
S-Class, Jaguar and Lexus. But if you insist that your luxury car must be
able to ford rivers, cross deserts or climb mountains, even if you have no
plans to take it off the tarmac, then the latest Range Rover reigns supreme.
Which leaves us with the new Audi A8 and BMW 7-Series, because both the
Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Lexus LS400 have been around in their present form
for some time.
Although the A8 4.2 quattro looks a fairly conventional large saloon car, it
is anything but. This is because it is made largely from aluminium and
weighs around 140kg less than its sheet steel rivals. This, Audi says, makes
it more crash-resistant and friendlier to the environment. Fuel consumption
is reduced and, at the end of its life, the vehicle will be easier to
recycle. Whether this will cut much ice with the customers remains to be
seen.
The A8 quattro, priced at Pounds 46,699, puts its V8's 300 horsepower on the
road through all four wheels via a Tiptronic gearbox which lets a driver
choose fully automatic transmission or manual gear selection according to
mood.
On the German autobahn, the quattro reached its governed 155mph (250kph)
maximum in eerie silence and treated curving mountain roads with nimble
indifference. It is a brilliant performer - but, like Lexus, the Audi marque
lacks the charisma of BMW, Mercedes-Benz or Jaguar in Britain. Audi hopes to
sell up to 500 A8s in 1995 and expects 80 per cent of them will be the
cheaper version - Pounds 34,499 with front-wheel drive, and 174hp,
2.8-litre, V6-engine. But BMW GB aims to get at least four times that number
of customers into its new V8-engined 730 and 740 saloons. They replace an
eight-year-old 7-Series which was second best-seller in the luxury market
after Jaguar.
Standards in this class are so high that it is difficult to find any fault
with cars such as the BMW 730 and 740 (or, for that matter, the Audi A8). It
came almost as a relief to note that the 7-Series' screen-wipers were a bit
noisy. In any case, most users choose them not for sheer performance
(legally unusable, anyway) or refinement (all are utterly urbane) but for
less easily defined qualities such as status and image.
The new BMWs look little different from the old ones and retain the classic
rear-wheel drive layout. At Pounds 39,800 (the 730) and Pounds 46,700 (740),
they cost no more if specifications are taken into account.
They cruised in silence equal to the Audi A8 when I tried them some time ago
on the autobahn. More recently, they were no less impressive at far lower
cruising speeds on UK motorways.
How do the BMWs and Audi A8 rate against the new Jaguar XJ models and the
latest luxury Range Rover? All will be revealed at the end of this month.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Travel: A land of cottages, peat smoke and pubs - Adrian
Gardiner travels from the east coast of Ulster to the west coast of the
Irish Republic. Destination: Holy Mountain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN GARDINER

<TEXT>
Even before the IRA's ceasefire, the 'troubles' in Northern Ireland should
not have deterred visitors. The strife was about money, about discrimination
and relative standards of living. Political mistakes have been made in
Ireland since Tudor times and the British taxpayer is still footing the
bill.
Statistically, the tourist is less at risk in Ulster than in New York or
South America, though some find the rampant jingoism unacceptable. Leaving
Newry, we skirted beautiful Carlingford Loch to Annalong, where sections of
the pavement are painted unionist red, white and blue. In the next town
along the coast a banner proclaimed: 'Kilkeel says No]' presumably to the
Anglo-Irish agreement. Farther on, a roadsign pleaded: 'Our only crime is
loyalty.'
In contrast is the legendary friendliness of Ulster's people and the
wonderfully picturesque land and seascapes. The Mountains of Mourne really
do sweep down to the sea, which washes over miles of deserted white sands.
Newcastle, the chief coastal resort, was anything but deserted. An hour's
drive from Belfast, it is popular day-trip territory and the main street has
more fast-food outlets to the mile than any town in Britain except
Blackpool. As dusk falls, a riot of neon advertises pizza, kebabs, fried
chicken and every other kind of carry-out devised. Amid the sleaze, one
elegant and sophisticated beacon shines out: a restaurant called the Percy
French.
William Percy French led an extraordinary life. He was born in Roscommon in
1854 and went to Trinity College, Dublin, to study engineering, but spent
most of his time learning to paint and play the banjo. For a while he was
inspector of drains in Cavan and in his spare time wrote songs - The
Mountains of Mourne is the best known - which made money which he invested
in a distillery.
It went bankrupt. He lost his job with the Board of Works, went to Dublin
and became editor of the Jarvey, the Irish Punch. When that folded he wrote
the first successful Irish musical, The Knight of the Road. His wife died in
childbirth on their first wedding anniversary and French moved to London
where he became established as a music hall entertainer, touring America and
satisfying the thirst for Irish pop culture.
He died in 1920, just as the era of the music hall was ending - and Ireland
was dividing - and is best remembered as the man who, in the words of one
biographer, 'captured the Irish spirit better than anyone of his time'.
The Mournes are granite. Slieve Donard offers great panoramas: the Isle of
Man is clearly visible. Wedged into these hills, the Silent Valley holds
Belfast's water supply. Three feet wide, 8ft high, 22 miles long and
connecting 15 mountain summits, the Mourne Wall protects the catchment area.
No farming or habitation is allowed within its boundary. It is great walking
country, and still relatively undiscovered.
We left the Mournes, my wild rose and I, and journeyed west across the
Republic in search of the Holy Mountain. Middle Ireland is little-visited by
tourists, but the clear lakes and tumbling streams of County Cavan are an
angler's paradise. We passed the town of Cavan, where Percy French's house
is now open to the public, and travelled the roads French travelled, easel
under his arm, for he loved this scenery, 'unique in its combination of
sun-stricken mist, brown bogland and green pasturage, solitary trees and
far-off visionary mountains'.
Rural Ireland is still a land that time forgot, a land of tumble-down
cottages, donkey carts and peat smoke, of pubs where the choice is Guinness
or Guinness.
At Carrick we were back briefly in the 20th century. Wine bars and bistros
jostle with chandlers and marine engineers, for here the broad Shannon
attracts people who like to mess about in boats.
We continued west towards Atlantic shores, through the Ox Mountains on
lonely roads, the landscape becoming increasingly wild. The northern edge of
County Mayo is the Barony of Erris and part of the Gaeltach, the
Irish-speaking fringe which runs down the west coast from Donegal to County
Cork.
Always there is restless sea and changing light. Along the northern
headlands of Erris, the Atlantic, untamed for 3,000 miles, crashes in on the
1,000ft cliffs of Glinsk and Benwee Head. Gulls circled far below us. Small
wonder that several ships of the Spanish Armada lie beneath these waves.
Halfway down the Mullet peninsula we turned for the ruins of Cross Abbey and
its dramatic hillside of Celtic crosses. Far out to sea was the island of
Inishglora where the Swan Children of Lyr served out the last third of their
900-year curse. (The wicked stepmother story is familiar to Irish children.)
From Blacksod Point, most southerly on the Mullet, the twin peaks of Achill
Island lie just four miles south, though it takes two hours by road to get
there. Above Blacksod on the headland is a henge of standing stones erected
last year as an exhibit on the Mayo sculpture trail: a dozen outdoor
structures by local and invited foreign artists. The setting is superb.
South of Achill is Westport, a Georgian town of wood-panelled pubs and smart
craft and jewellery shops, while nearby Westport House is one of Ireland's
best-known stately homes. Down the hill is Westport Harbour, a cluster of
authentic fishing taverns, and a few miles west is our 'far-off visionary
mountain': the 2,500ft sheer cone of Croagh Patrick, the Holy Mountain.
St Patrick, fresh from driving the snakes out of Ireland, fasted here one
Lent; every year on the last Sunday in July 60,000 pilgrims follow in his
footsteps to the top. You have to be dedicated because the path becomes
increasingly steep and is composed of rounded pebbles.
Two hours later and 300 yards from the summit I nearly gave up. I was glad I
did not. No superlatives could describe the view as half of the Emerald Isle
unfolded beneath our feet. To the north is Achill's brooding bulk shrouded
in aureoles of mist. To the south: the Maamturk Mountains of Connemara.
Below: the thousand islands of Clew Bay, described by Thackeray as like 'so
many dolphins and whales basking'.
Out in the Atlantic, the sun began to set behind Clare Island, where the
16th-century pirate queen Grace O'Malley built her castle. Perhaps Grace was
the first Irish rebel, for when she was captured and brought before
Elizabeth I she insisted on equal status as Queen of Ireland. It was during
Elizabeth's reign that the seeds of the present troubles were sown. But from
the holy heights of Croagh Patrick, Belfast and bombs seem to belong to a
different world.
We sailed from Stranraer to Belfast on the Seacat, a state-of-the-art
catamaran which does twice the speed of conventional ferries. It does not
carry freight, so loading and unloading is rapid. Sealink operate ferries
from Holyhead (Anglesey) to Dun Laoghaire (near Dublin). Contact a travel
agent or book the Seacat direct: tel: 0232-310910. The Northern Ireland
Tourist Board is at 11 Berkeley St, London W1X 5AD. The Bord Failte Eireann
is at Baggot St Bridge, Dublin 2.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Travel: Chasing a tail shot - Practical Traveller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WESTBROOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first sight whale-watchers have of their quarry is likely to be the
mixture of carbon dioxide and water the whales huff into the air through
their blowholes. Boatmen should cry 'Thar she blows]' What the ones at
Kaikoura, in New Zealand, actually say is: 'Get your cameras ready for tail
shots, folks]'
Sure enough, once refreshed, the great sperm whales lift their tails slowly
into the air against a background of snow-capped coastal mountains, and
silently vanish underwater while 100 shutters click. When they resurface,
more tourist boats, alerted by underwater sonar gear, will be waiting.
Whale-watching has burgeoned in the last decade. You can visit feeding,
breeding and migrating grounds round the world on small local fishing boats,
or lengthy scientific research cruises led by qualified naturalists.
Though people join in for much the same reason they go on safari, whales
evoke a visceral awe which not even lions can produce: whales are big. But
the sea is so wide that you do not feel you are getting in the way.
Off the British coast, there are trips run by Sea Life Surveys from the Isle
of Mull (tel: 06-884 223), from April to October. You can have four hours
for Pounds 26, seven days for Pounds 470, or a variety of excursions in
between. The most likely sightings are small - 25ft minke whales, target of
Norwegian harpoonists, but orcas ('killer whales') and dolphins can also be
spotted.
Coastal New England was among the first regions to turn from catching to
watching. Off Cape Cod, for instance, you can see humpbacks, right whales
(so called because, swimming slowly, they were the right whales to hunt),
finbacks, minkes and sei whales.
They eat enough from April to October to fill them for the rest of the year,
which they sensibly spend in the Caribbean. Whale Watcher of Provincetown
(tel: 508-362 6088) is among the many organisations to run day trips: 3 1/2
hours for Dollars 22. In Boston, call New England Aquarium for details of
trips (617-973 5277).
Off the US West Coast, grey whales migrate south from Alaska to Baja
California from December to March, and back again until May. Monterey Sport
Fishing (tel: 408-372 2203) of Monterey Bay offers two-hour trips for
Dollars 15 until March, on which you may see as many as 60 sailing by.
From July to October, longer trips (Dollars 30) go further out to watch
humpback, blue and minke whales which summer there, though not as many as
the greys. Similar trips are available from San Diego; try Mariposa (tel:
619-542 0646).
Those who want to become more deeply involved could try Monterey Bay Whale
Watch (tel: 408-372 0671). For Dollars 43 from June to November you can go
on six-hour cruises helping to identify humpbacks' migratory patterns.
Oceanic Society Expeditions of San Francisco (tel: 415-474 3785) offers
everything from winter half-day trips to see the greys to 12-day cruises in
March.
Most far-flung of all is Kaikoura. A cold current meets a warm one,
attracting food (squid, mostly), so male sperm whales are here all the time
and trips run year-round unless bad weather stops them. Summer and autumn
mornings are best. Whale Watch Kaikoura (tel: 03-195 045) trips leave from
the Whaleway station and cost NZDollars 95. Expect to see up to five whales
in a 2 1/2 -hour trip five miles offshore; the guides know most of them by
name.
There are other places to look at whales: Dingle in the Irish Republic; the
Azores; Maui in Hawaii; Vancouver Island in Canada; Anchorage in Alaska;
Perth and south-east Australia; Peninsula Valdes in Argentina; Samana in the
Dominican Republic; and many more.
It is also possible to book from Britain. Twickers World (tel: 081-892
8164), for instance, offers 10-day packages to Mexico, including eight days
afloat, from Pounds 2,200.
With minimal regulation, whale-watching is ecologically sound: once whales
generate more money being watched than killed, they will live longer,
possibly for ever.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Books: Balancing Terry Maher's books - The rise and fall of
the man who built Pentos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AC GRAYLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGEMENT by Terry Maher Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 15, 222
pages
A balance sheet on Terry Maher - founder of Pentos, iconoclastic creator of
Dillons Bookstores and now autobiographer - might read somewhat as follows.
On the credit side, Maher merits respect as a high-flyer propelled by sheer
talent. He is the classic poor boy made good: humble beginnings in
Manchester, compounded by childhood TB, offered an unpromising start, but
once his foot was on the business ladder he climbed fast - and would have
done so in politics too, except that he chose the Liberals. Two unsuccessful
efforts as a parliamentary candidate inclined him to accept a head-hunter's
offer in the City; in two years he had launched Pentos.
Daring and finesse helped Pentos's success but there were ups and downs, the
latter mainly associated with recessions. Pentos evolved from an eclectic
holding company into a specialist retailer, with Dillons Bookstores as its
jewel. The growth of Dillons from a single university bookshop to a highly
visible nationwide chain was spectacular. In much of this there was high
skill on Maher's part, especially in brilliant marketing and some novelties
of financial management, justifying his colourful reputation.
Experience has given Maher a sharp eye. Many will applaud his comments about
the unhelpfulness of banks, City short-termism, inflated commercial rent
levels, and the fact that too much money channels into pension funds,
starving smaller companies of investment.
The debit side brings more recent events into focus. In September last year
Maher was forced out of Pentos with a handshake of Pounds 392,000. The
recession had hit Pentos hard, and although Maher thought the company was
roughly at break-even point ('accounting,' he wistfully remarks, 'is not an
exact science') his colleagues on the board reckoned otherwise: Pentos was
facing a Pounds 70m loss.
Maher had over-reached. Dillons' expansion went too far and fast in a race
for market share against WH Smiths-Waterstones. The fate of overblown
companies - dismemberment and dispersal - threatens Maher's life-work.
The story Maher tells is austerely a business autobiography - there is
barely anything of his personal life in it - and although its aim is to
vindicate the Maher side of the Pentos saga, it is agreeably less vaunting
in one direction, and less bitter in the other, than it might be. After all,
there are Shakespearean elements here: ambition, success, hubris, betrayal
by friends, failure.
Others can judge Maher's business adventures, but a book reviewer must be
forgiven for concentrating on what he takes to be the largest item in the
debit column: Maher's attack on the Net Book Agreement, the arrangement by
which booksellers charge no less than the publisher's cover price.
Some markets benefit from constraint, and some are better without. In
Maher's opinion the book trade falls into the second category. 'The NBA,' he
argues, 'prevents us from exploiting the full potential from expanding book
sales; has kept book prices unnecessarily high; and has propped up
inefficiencies in the book trade.' He wants to pile 'em high, as the phrase
has it, and sell 'em cheap.
Defenders argue that if the NBA goes, price-cutting retail superstores of
the kind invented by Maher will undercut small bookshops. The range of books
will narrow into the bonkbuster and cookery parts of the spectrum, and there
will be fewer titles ('a good thing,' Maher opines). Small publishers and
small-circulation, specialist, literary and recondite books will be squeezed
to vanishing.
The NBA maximises choice by maximising the number of books, publishers and
book shops available, which is why almost all authors, publishers,
booksellers and - when informed - readers agree with the 1964 decision of a
restrictive practices court that the NBA serves the public interest. If it
goes, impoverishment of the book world will result, and not even the
superstores will benefit for long.
The French abandoned their version of the NBA in 1979, only to restore it in
1981, aghast at the effects. In the US there is no NBA, with stark results:
only big second-hand city shops give genuine range, while university
bookstores are echoing halls stacked with teetering piles of pre-ordered
textbooks. Thirty per cent fewer books are published in the US annually than
in the UK, in spite of its vastly larger domestic market; and the UK exports
more.
To their immense credit WH Smiths-Waterstones supports the NBA because it
recognises that it keeps diversity in books and bookselling alive. But
Maher, alas, might have done enough to take the book world down with him in
his own plunge from the heights.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Books: The badger in his sett - Malcolm Rutherford reviews
the writings of Brian Redhead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSONAL PERSPECTIVES by Brian Redhead Andre Deutsch Pounds 14.99, 244 pages
Brian Redhead may have been a radical broadcaster; he was a very
conservative man. For long the unmistakable anchor of the BBC Radio 4
programme Today, he helped to instil badgering as an accepted way of asking
questions. Yet, as badgers go, he was a friendly beast and, as we now
discover, he put a lot of his thoughts on paper.
Redhead died early this year. Instead of a formal biography, his family has
put together a series of articles which he produced over the last decade for
the relatively obscure magazine, Saga, a monthly for elderly people.
One point about him in Personal Perspectives comes out immediately: his
Englishness, and the regionalness within it. 'We are a mixed lot,' he wrote,
'Celts, Romans, Saxons, Danes, who have managed to get along over the
centuries. When the Normans came, imagining that they had conquered, they
were simply absorbed.' And again, in a perceptive remark, 'history is what
people make of their geography'.
Redhead was fascinated by everything to do with English history: to some
extent the more remote the better. He has a charmingly erudite piece on
whether or not his adopted home of Macclesfield was part of Mercia, in other
words, which came first, Mercia or Macclesfield?
He was equally at home in the 19th century partly because it brought the
development of the railways. If you want an account of how the president of
the board of trade, William Huskisson, was killed while opening the
Liverpool-Manchester line in 1830, here is a source. On the other hand, even
Redhead was not quite sure of the first genuine passenger line:
Stockton-Darlington or Merseyside? Passengers from Stockton, he thinks, were
initially drawn by horses.
Redhead liked Crewe Junction, where at one stage you could get a train to
every part of the kingdom. Some of his best stories were told on the rails.
On the way to Macclesfield he gave a young man the history of Cheshire which
ultimately - because of the county's salt deposits - led to the founding of
ICI. The man turned out to be an ICI recruit.
Why Redhead forsook his native north east, where as he describes, he had an
excellent education at Newcastle Royal Grammar School and was put on the
fast track to read history at Cambridge, for the north west is never fully
explained.
Yet it was the north west that held him. In terms of journalism Manchester
was, in Redhead's words, 'for 90 years the other end of Fleet Street'. He
liked the cheeky northern editors who could tell the London men where to get
off and what was front page news in the real world.
So it remained on the Today programme. Redhead never really liked the south.
Abroad, even Scotland, was foreign to him, though he did go to Beijing and
hired a bicycle and was much taken by Virginia in the US.
Possibly some of that plain blunt man stuff was affectation. At times he
could be a trifle pompous: 'I received a letter from a friend who is a
historian at Oxford. His father was a historian at Cambridge and taught me'.
It contained some esoteric fact about the monarchy which Redhead did not
know: 'So I instantly informed the nation'.
Yet he could also be humble, as when he recalls Mark Twain's remark on April
Fool's Day: 'This is the day upon which we are reminded of what we are on
the other 364.' Here is a delightful collection of essays.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Books: Flashes of sunlight from America's finest novelist -
JDF Jones reviews Saul Bellow's non-fiction work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JDF  JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT ALL ADDS UP by Saul Bellow Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 20, 327 pages
We can take it, I assume, that Saul Bellow is the finest living American
novelist. (A colleague has just said to me, 'I simply can't read him'. Fair
enough. We can agree, nevertheless, that Saul Bellow is the finest living
American novelist.) He's getting old, of course, and there's a whiff of
farewell in this - first - collection of his non-fiction writing.
The selection of pieces in It All Adds Up, which their begetter says is 'not
a reliquary but a gathering' of 'the trifles I wrote to support myself', is
rather odd. Why, for instance, has he chosen to start with what are surely
the less impressive essays? We have a chat about Mozart, some memories of
Chicago in the Roosevelt era, a few thoughts about Khruschev in New York, a
recollection of Paris in 1948, a portrait of an elderly Mid-West con-man, an
interview with himself (never a good idea), the necessarily high-minded
Nobel Prize lecture of 1976, and some more memories of pre-war Chicago,
including the surprising news that Bellow was in Taxco when Trotsky was
assassinated, with an appointment to see him the next day, instead of which
he went to see the bloodied body. I was beginning to think my colleague
might be right about the non-fiction.
Then, suddenly, the sun breaks through with the Jefferson Lectures of 1977,
and all is well. Here the combination of memory and reflection works
triumphantly. Like this, for example: 'On winter afternoons when the soil
was frozen to a depth of five feet and the Chicago cold seemed to have the
headhunter's power of shrinking your face, you felt in the salt-whitened
streets and amid the spattered car bodies the characteristic mixture of
tedium and excitement, of narrowness of life together with a strong
intimation of scope, a simultaneous expansion and constriction in the soul,
a clumsy sense of inadequacy, poverty of means, desperate limitation, and,
at the same time, a craving for more, which demanded that 'impractical'
measures be taken. There was literally nothing to be done about this . . .
The only remedy for it was to read and write stories and novels . . .'
From which it is a short step to Bellow's conclusions about the role of the
writer and artist in America today, where the degradation of modern urban
society, the abasement of man, is the price paid for the economic and
technical success story of the century. On the way we get a glancing
rebuttal of Hemingway and what John Berryman called his 'moral vacancy' -
'Hemingway's dignity in the face of nothingness is not a negligible
conception . . . But 'moral vacancy' is nihilism, and nihilism acknowledges
the victory of the bourgeois outlook . . . Other responses may be possible.'
Bellow goes on: 'There is no human life without the attachments that we
express in words like 'good', 'moral', 'just', 'beautiful'. The restoration
of these connections is to be undertaken only out of the soul's recognition
of their necessity . . . It will begin when the intellect confirms what the
soul desires . . .' There speaks the creator of Herzog, Henderson, Mr
Sammler and the rest.
Now at last we get Bellow the reporter and traveller. Spain in 1948 where he
witnessed a political trial, Paris (and Hemingway again - 'Hemingway the
writer I admired without limits; Hemingway the figure was to my mind the
quintessential tourist'), the Six-Day War, Vermont and Illinois, obituaries
of friends such as John Cheever.
And finally, a good and long interview from Bostonia magazine in 1990, full
of fascinating autobiographical revelation and quick, flashing insights, as
Bellow the young Marxist begins to see his life as 'a process of revision,
of the correction of errors' - a process, he assures us in the preface,
which is still going on. This interview serves to draw proper attention to
the importance of The Adventures of Augie Marsh, and Bellow's discovery that
it was necessary to move on from the English mandarin model - 'I wanted to
invent a new sort of American sentence. Something like a fusion of
colloquialism and elegance . . . Street language combined with high style'.
There is nothing in this volume to convey to the stranger, or the sceptical
colleague, the magnificence of Bellow the Novelist's portrait gallery of
characters, but for the initiate it will be a necessary addition to the
bookshelf.

HISTORY: THE HOME MOVIE by Craig Raine Penguin, Pounds 9.99 paperback,
Pounds 18 hdbk
In this volume Craig Raine transforms within his three-line stanzas scenes
of modern life - at its most public as well as its most private  - which may
at first sight seem among the most grittily anti-poetic material of the 20th
century.
In what his publishers describe as 'an epic history of Europe from 1905 to
1984,' milestones of history running through geography from Moscow to Oxford
by way of Berlin, mark the converging relationships between the families of
two poets - the Russian Pasternaks and the English Raines. Their private -
often very private - histories are conveyed in scenes dramatised - or should
I say 'turned into home movies' - at points where these overlap with
historic events; the first world war, the post-war era, the Russian
Revolution, the second world war.
Craig Raine seems to have a setter's instinct for discovering points at
which the public events in public lives strike home into the private lives
of contemporaries and become elements in a mythology of modern history.
These occasions of public historic significance are brilliantly selected by
Raine and they retain the immediacy - indeed the intimacy - of the moment.
Here is the artist Leonid Pasternak, father of the poet Boris Pasternak,
drawing Lenin as Lenin addresses a meeting - 1919 The Comintern, Moscow:
'How Leonid's pencil hovers
and settles and hovers again,
until slowly the head,
seeps out of the paper
bearded, bald as an acorn,
chin strained out like a
sprinter,
Touching, then taking off
until VI Lenin is there
and there on the page,
brass-rubbed rather than
drawn.
At first, the accumulation of such precisely drawn observations may seem too
crammed with facts, too grittily resistant to any escape into the purely
poetic. But reading on, one realises that these are the details of a mosaic,
the cumulative effect of which adds up to a large scale picture of the two
families concerned - and of other characters - against the geographical and
historical background of Europe in this century.
An epic is supposed to have a hero but the chief character here, Eliot
Raine, a doctor, interesting as he is, and masterly as is Raine's
translation of his medical skills into his poetic terminology, scarcely
strikes me as being on the heroic scale. Indeed a lesser, rather
inexplicable character called Roniger, who makes an adventurous and largely
disastrous journey from East to West and ends up dying in Oxford, seems to
me to have more the makings of a hero than any of the Pasternaks or the
Raines.
The poem does not quite establish members of these two families as being on
the epic scale. If Pasternak is accepted as such this is perhaps because
literary history has already perceived him as such. Yet out of this highly
personal material, Raine creates a fascinating world that I feel I will
return to again and again.

DAN LENO AND THE LIMEHOUSE GOLEM by Peter Ackroyd Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds
14.99, 282 pages
FELICIA'S JOURNEY by William Trevor Viking Pounds 15, 213 pages
The serial killer is rapidly becoming a new folk hero, a debased Robin Hood
for the fin-de-siecle. Popular culture got there first, with the American
thriller writer Thomas Harris cleverly exploiting the notion that it takes
one evil genius to catch another.
The serial killer has entered the echelons of literary fiction, popping up
in Peter Ackroyd's novel, Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem, and more
unexpectedly in Felicia's Journey by William Trevor.
Ackroyd's story is a deliberate shocker, as vulgar as the Victorian music
halls which he evokes with apparently effortless skill.
Trevor's offering is shabby genteel, set in a contemporary Britain which
eludes him so completely that the novel seems to be composed only in shades
of grey.
Felicia is a typical Trevor creation, a naive Irish girl whose credulity
tries the reader's patience. Trapped in a household which is itself mired in
the past, embodied by a bed-ridden greatgrandmother, Felicia runs away to
the English midlands in search of a man who has made her pregnant. All she
knows is his name, Johnny Lysaght, and his claim that he works in a
lawnmower factory.
Felicia's story is interwoven with that of Mr Hilditch, an obese catering
manager who lives alone in his dead mother's house. Mr Hilditch, whose
appearances in the novel are marked by lists of food, is an undetected
serial killer whose victims also come in lists: Beth, Jakki, Sharon, Bobbi,
Elsie and Gaye. Mr Hilditch fixes on the destitute and desperate Felicia as
his next victim.
What is so troubling about Felicia's Journey is not the banality of its
characters; serial killers often lead unhappy but otherwise unremarkable
lives, as do their victims. Its fault is transparency, a painful sense of
the novelist's imagination at work, struggling to convey characters whose
feelings elude him. Hence the lists, a device which seems intended to reveal
personality but in the end substitutes for it.
Trevor's fiction has increasingly moved in this direction, possibly because
the products of his imagination belong in the past and cannot comfortably
inhabit contemporary life. His fey Irish heroines are decades out of date
and in Felicia's Journey he falls back on repeating himself, introducing a
sub-plot and a set of minor characters uncomfortably similar to those in his
1971 novel Miss Gomez and the Brethren.
Where Felicia's Journey leaves an impression of surfaces barely touched,
Peter Ackroyd's new novel is a pyrotechnic display which delights in
tricking the reader into conflicting emotional responses.
Its apparently sombre opening, the hanging in Camberwell prison in 1881 of a
woman convicted of her husband's murder, is immediately undercut by a
macabre, pantomime detail: the prison governor takes home the dead woman's
gown and dresses up in it, presumably to aid masturbation.
Ackroyd's plot centres on a series of bizarre and brutal murders in the East
End of London, culminating in the slaughter of a family in the Ratcliffe
Highway. These final murders take place in the very house where, in 1812,
the real-life Marr family was attacked and killed. Ackroyd's sly mixing of
fact and fiction has an extra dimension if the reader knows that the
Ratcliffe Highway murders were the subject of a true crime book co-authored
by the novelist P D James.
Ackroyd's novel is brilliantly ventriloquial, taking the form of diaries,
court transcripts and fragments of autobiography. It is a performance in the
best sense of the word, an imagination so excited by its own confidence that
it dares go to the very limits. Ackroyd also understands a crucial point
about the serial killer in fiction, which is that in this genre Grand
Guignol works better than gritty realism. Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem
pokes fun at the stuffier conventions of the crime novel and creates a
murderer as mad, and bad, and as unlike real life, as Harris's Hannibal
Lecter.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Arts: Houghton Hall plans winter sale - Auction should raise
Pounds 25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Furniture, pictures, silver and other works of art from one of the grandest
houses in the country, Houghton Hall in Norfolk, will come under the hammer
at Christie's on the evening of December 8.
The Marquess of Cholmondeley is organising the greatest clear out from an
important stately home since 1984, when the Duke of Devonshire sold Old
Master drawings from Chatsworth for Pounds 21m.
Christie's estimates that 160-odd lots from Houghton will bring in at least
Pounds 15m. This is unnecessarily modest. The quality and provenance of the
goods, which include William Kent chairs, a conservation piece by the French
18th-century artist Jean-Francois de Troy - estimated at up to Pounds 5m -
and a pair of Queen Anne silver ambassadorial cups valued at Pounds 1m,
should ensure the total take reaches Pounds 25m.
It is believed that Lord Cholmondeley, who is 34 and unmarried, plans to
split the money raised equally between personal expenditure and trusts to
maintain and restore Houghton Hall and his other family seat, Cholmondeley
Castle in Cheshire.
Ironically he can only achieve this end by accumulating a tax debt. Since
inheriting his estates in 1990 he has been attempting to sort out the family
fortune.
He sold the greatest treasure of Houghton, a Holbein portrait of a lady with
a squirrel, to the National Gallery for Pounds 10m, and a Gainsborough
self-portrait to the same gallery for around Pounds 2m.
But Houghton costs perhaps Pounds 500,000 a year to run, and the Marquess
has been examining ways of cashing in on his greatest asset, the Hall, and
in particular its furniture, which was supplied by William Kent when
Houghton was built by Sir Robert Walpole in the 1720s.
The Marquess has attempted to set a precedent by offering the furnishings to
the nation for Pounds 10m. They would, of course, have remained in situ.
The Department of National Heritage would not bite, but it is believed to be
more interested in a deal whereby Lord Cholmondeley's tax liability on the
money raised from the December auction is taken care of through an
acceptance-in- lieu arrangement, which comes with a tax sweetener.
If after the sale the Marquess owes, say, Pounds 10m in tax, this could be
written off in return for at least some of the furniture at Houghton.
The charm of the idea is that not only will his home remain exquisitely
furnished but, by selling off two sets of two chairs from the original
furnishings at the auction, he will also have achieved a market value
(likely to be a high one) for the remainder.
Houghton Hall is one of the most outstanding houses in England. The
Treasury, always suspicious of deals in which works of art are accepted by
the nation to pay off tax, may buy this one. But it will not want all the
aristocrats in the land creating tax liabilities and then trying to force
the hand of the heritage department to accept the contents of their homes in
lieu.
In planning this move Lord Cholmondeley and Christie's have been shrewd.
Most of the antiques to be sold come from the collection of Sir Philip
Sassoon, who left them on his death in 1939 to his sister, the current
Marquess of Cholmondeley's great aunt. They are mainly 18th-century French
decorative items and never fitted comfortably into Houghton. Few were
displayed and they will not be missed by visitors.
The loss of more paintings is serious. Sir Robert's marvellous collection
was sold to Catherine of Russia in 1778 and Houghton has never had great
pictures since. But the best of the rest have been sold in recent years.
But at least Houghton will survive. Its existence has been parlous for
almost two centuries. The family did not live there and three times tried to
get rid of it - to the Duke of Wellington, at auction (when no one came to
bid), and to the future Edward VII, who rejected it because of its poor
shooting. The 3,000 acres of land surrounding it are also not rated highly.
Lord Cholmondeley's only asset is the house, designed by Colin Campbell and
James Gibbs, and the furniture. Through this auction he has enabled
Houghton, himself, and his sisters, to continue to live in some style.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Arts: Inspired by organised chaos - Venice Film Festival /
Nigel Andrews thoroughly enjoys the inspired madness embodied in this week's
on-screen offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Venice Film Festival has reached an alarming stage. Instead of feeling
as we critics should during these events - like hardworking martyrs to art
with subtitles permanently dancing before our eyes - we have been enjoying
almost every new movie.
From the latest Woody Allen comedy Bullets Over Broadway we jaunt over to a
midnight Harrison Ford romp, Clear And Present Danger. From a jolly Spanish
film about love and acrobatics, The Tit And The Moon, we proceed to a
nailbiting, inspired Danish TV series about a haunted hospital, The Kingdom,
before skipping over to Heavenly Creatures, a truth-based New Zealand black
comedy about two schoolgirls who murder for their friendship.
Jury president David Lynch was seen leaving this last in a glow of
approbation, so the Golden Lion may reach a long paw into the Antipodes next
Monday. Heavenly Creatures was co-written and directed by Peter Jackson,
best known for spoof splatter films like Brain Dead. Here he has held back
on the flying intestines but not the sense of camp hyperbole.
This 1950s Christchurch is awash with picket-fence prettiness and twittering
moral decency - Lynch territory par excellence - as Pauline (Melanie
Lynskey) and Juliet (Kate Winslet) form their fantasy-filled friendship.
This is fed by their own tales of castles and kings, and served by Jackson's
blithe camera arabesques and transformation scenes. Gasp at the Sound Of
Music-style helicopter shot of Juliet running over a hill; gasp again when
that landscape is metamorphosed into a lush palace garden. Unicorns,
fountains, butterflies large as hang-gliders ..
It all ends in blood and tears, as the two girls' parents, who condemn the
friendship as 'unhealthy' and 'unwholesome', predict it will. But for the
audience, what a movie ride before we hit the buffers.
The only other Venice movie on this scale of robust postmodernism - witty
exaggeration built into the po-faced melodrama - was Lars Von Trier's The
Kingdom.
This is not a movie at all but more a four-part, 4 1/2 -then-two-hour TV
series, shot with a handheld camera in poverty-row monochrome. But it proves
the Danish director of acclaimed style-pieces The Element Of Crime and
Europa can turn on the magic without tricksy optical effects.
In this Lynch-lore festival you could call The Kingdom 'Twin Peaks in a
hospital': teasingly quotidian setting; weirder and weirder characters;
emergency outbreaks of non-sequitur; the apocalypse of ghosts and guilty
secrets.
But Trier and Niels Vorsel's script has a start-to-finish logic that Peaks
never quite had. Its perfectly meshed characters - the sarcastic Swedish
neuro-consultant, the solemnly deranged anatomy lecturer, the
hypochondriacal old lady who hears 'voices' in the lift shaft - give the
story a strong, even Ibsenite, vertebra, while the wacky toll of severed
heads, masonic rituals and self-destruct surgery provides the gymnastic
freedom of narrative.
In the vain quest for a dud film at this festival we critics tried
everything. A Woody Allen film without Woody? That might be a trial. But no
 -it was Bullets Over Broadway, a sparkling comedy of theatre manners, with
gangsters, gags and the funniest not-by-Woody performance in the entire
Allen cannon. This was Dianne Wiest's vainglorious actress: sighing,
soaring, scatterbrained, Gloria Swanson crossed with Margaret Dumont.
Then there was the movie from Spain's Bigas Luna, late of Goldenballs, about
the little boy, his older pal and the big-breasted circus ballerina they
fight over. Tiresome Fellini rip-off? No. Charming, stylish and funny.
How about Jefery Levy's SFW? This rock-scored, kaleidoscopic US movie is
about a young hostage-crisis survivor (Backbeat's Stephen Dorff), who after
36 days in a convenience store at the mercy of a lunatic's video-camera
whose images were broadcast 'live' across the nation, tries to adjust to the
vulgar glare of media heroism. It threatens to be a glib, easy-target
topical melodrama but gains in wit and bite as it goes on.
The only undisputed flops have been Alexandre Rockwell's Somebody To Love -
a drippy New York love story set among what seem to be the underworld folk
left over from Woody Allen's film - and Ermanno Olmi's The Bible Part 1.
This is subtitled Genesis: Creation And Flood - and yes, Olmi plans to film
the entire Good Book.
Not like this, we hope. The Noah sequence aside, with its eye-catching ark
and brief warmth of human detail, the film is no more than a glorified
nature documentary set to a maunderingly 'prophetic' voice-over.
The Olmi style seems even more ossified in a festival that has just produced
Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers. Some people loved this film, some hated
it. The only sane response is to do both.
Based on a story by Hollywood's favourite enfant terrible Quentin Tarantino
(Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction), the movie is a two-hour bloodbath. The main
terrorists are a young couple (Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis) who, after a
cross-country murder spree in the film's first half, repeat the mayhem when
they break out of jail in the second.
That Oliver Stone was becoming an eccentric film-maker we knew from the St
Vitus style of JFK. But even that seems measured beside the poetic epilepsy
of this film. Manic jump-cuts; topsy-turvy angles; high-speed alternations
between black-and-white and colour, film and video, reality and
hallucination; split-second bits of newsreel, animation.
Since the soundtrack also bawls out rock music, some have called the whole
thing a feature-length pop promo. But it is much more. Despite the suspect
encouragement it might offer susceptible filmgoers - that killing is
exhilarating - it is inspired.
The fragmented approach is not arbitrary. Stone offers us different ways of
viewing the same story at the same time: documentary, fantasy, home movie,
even sitcom. Scenes from the girl's childhood are enacted as clips from a TV
comedy series, with comic Rodney Dangerfield as Dad and canned laughter
greeting each dialogue exchange. Later, Stone derides the couch potato
culture again in the figure of an Aussie-accented tabloid-TV interviewer
(Robert Downey Jr, very funny) who follows the couple's jailbreak live.
Natural Born Killers is an alarming work, and for some a demented one.
(Tarantino himself has disowned the movie). But you cannot expect tranquil
responses to a film that proposes a whole new direction for film-making
itself - and that never offers spectators the soft option of a single,
moralising perspective on its bloody subject.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Arts: Delightful Mr Shaw - Alastair Macaulay reviews The
Devil's Disciple
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The greatest pleasure of the National Theatre's new production of George
Bernard Shaw's 1897 play The Devil's Disciple is that it puts us for over
two hours in the company of Shaw himself. Who, we soon feel, is the best
company in the world. In life-and-death situations, he never loses his sense
of humour; amid busy narrative passages, he never loses an opportunity to
throw in serious points. The play never stagnates into sheer dialectic;
about every five minutes, Shaw adds some new twist to the plot that takes us
by surprise. A pity that this staging is not a lot better - but it does
nothing to get in Shaw's way.
The Devil's Disciple, set in New England during the American War of
Independence, contains three archetypal Shaw male characters. The first is
Dick Dudgeon, a charming buccaneer, so fiercely determined to reject Puritan
repression that he is content to be known as 'the devil's disciple'. The
second is Anthony Anderson, a Presbyterian minister and also a man of action
committed to the American cause. The third is the British general John
Burgoyne, a leader who can survey both minor incidents and the vast pattern
of history with an endless supply of sardonic humour. Though they are
utterly distinct characters, you can hear in all three Shaw's own voice -
irreverent, audacious, authoritative, ironic, wonderfully funny.
Amid these three humorous heroes is a humourless heroine, as urgent and
complex and fresh as Shaw loved his heroines to be. She is Anderson's wife
Judith, who finds herself in more than one extraordinary dilemma. Should she
let one man go to his death to save another? Should she follow the dictates
of her heart or her duty?
Shaw called his play 'a melodrama'. Would that Christopher Morahan, the
director, had a higher conception - a more dramatic conception - of what
melodrama can be. And would that British actors today had a surer sense of
how deadly seriousness and ironic humour can co-exist in the same person at
the same time. Richard Bonneville is an amiable actor, but he has neither
the devil-may-care freedom of spirit (and body) nor the appealing glamour to
make Dick a hero. His most original effect - to have the jitters just before
mounting the gallows - is a mistake. Like Paul Jesson, who plays Anderson,
he fails to press home the character's moments of terrible seriousness.
Jesson's transformation from a quiet priest into a passionate man of action
is funnier than I had realised it could be, but it carries little
conviction.
Daniel Massey by contrast, plays General Burgoyne as easily as falling off a
log. He can switch - even during the course of a sentence - from languid
irony to vehement urgency. If anything, he overdoes this relaxation of
manner, but that is an error on the right side. To turn from him to the
younger Bonneville and Jesson is to be alarmed: perhaps only actors who grew
up in days of empire can know how to blend commanding power with casual
impishness?
What is good about Helen McCrory's Judith is so good and so right that you
wonder why she leaves parts of the role so tepid. She has the
self-consciously erect Puritan carriage, the mixture of moral probity and
emotional vulnerability, and also the inquiring freshness. In some scenes,
it is she who turns up the dramatic tension in an instant. So why is she so
subdued in the scene of Dick's arrest?
Morahan and his set designer, John Gunter, place the action very much to the
front of the Olivier stage, with the result that when the actors are turned
to speak to each other across its wide expanse, not all of them are always
perfectly audible. But it is easy to find this kind of fault. The evening
belongs to Shaw, and the production does not steal it from him.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Arts: The rhythm of life after Stalin - A finely written but
overly-cosy play about genius
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ice on the Neva cracks with the resonance of fine writing - French
writing, to boot, than which there is none finer. The poetics come up like
thunder.
Black Sail White Sail, playing at the Gate in London's Notting Hill, is that
tricky thing, a play about intellectuals written by a cosmopolitan
Francophone with a thing about 'feminine writing'. Not feminist, mind you,
but something subtler and deeper, to do with basic rhythms.
It is also about genius - another trap for the over-confident writer. How do
you express genius without sounding like a press release, a book-jacket
blurb or a Reader's Digest 'Most unforgettable character I ever met'
article?
You could do worse than get Donald Watson to translate from the French.
Tact, sensitivity, and extensive practical experience of the theatre mark
his version of Helene Cixous' play. This does not, however, quite efface the
impression of self-conscious monologues, or negate the slightly laboured
superimposition of the heroine's poetic gifts on to an everyday story of
post-Stalinist folk.
The play deals with the poet Anna Akhmatova (1889-1966), for many years an
unpublished cultural outsider, two of whose husbands disappeared and whose
son was interned in a labour camp.
After Stalin's death came the thaw - of a sort. Significantly the play
begins with Anna, played by Kika Markham, gathering firewood with Nadezhda,
widow of the writer Osip Mandelstam, as the frozen river splits with the
onset of spring.
Disappointments and frustrations await her before some semblance of
recognition and restitution, due not least to her own stubborn refusal to
compromise with the literary authorities' required cuts, omissions and
general censorship of her poetry.
The play is a hymn to endurance in apparently hopeless conditions, to a
struggle for survival so basic as to be barely distinguishable from death:
'Committing suicide to live,' as Anna puts it.
The light it casts on the old regime in Russia is fascinating: the pervasive
paranoia that prevented poets from writing down their works, instead
enlisting friends to memorise them - and the funny, sad dismay when author
and confidante find they have forgotten lines, like failing to remember what
a loved one looks like after a long absence.
Anna lives in a room separated from a communal cooking area only by a
curtain, behind which sits a nosey neighbour (aptly nicknamed Polonius) who
eavesdrops, goes through Anna's things, dabbles in the black market and
eventually becomes something of an ally.
The poet's chief friends are Lydia, an eagerly helpful go-between with
contacts, who spends her time championing Anna's cause with publishers, and
Nadezhda, with whom she argues over the authorship of some poems - did Anna
write them, or the late Osip? The puzzlement seems genuine in this shadowy
world of disowning one's creative progeny for its own good.
Mia Soteriou makes Lydia rather touching, not least when, loyalty strained,
she rebels against Anna's imperious demands. No genius, as she admits, Lydia
still 'in her small corner needs a life of her own'. Her revolt fails to
ring entirely true, since Markham's Anna is simply too nice for the
cantankerous unreasonableness of genius depicted. A woman as pleasantly
straightforward as this would have lacked the resilience to survive in a
world where she had to resort to placing the odd hair in a book to tell
whether her private possessions had been disturbed by a stranger.
Sue Parrish's direction makes this a soft-centred, almost cosy world, surely
the last thing intended - though the author's prolixity, more intellectual
than theatrical, must take much of the blame. The curtains of Iona McLeish's
set, white with slashes of black, evoke the birches of Mother Russia -
hinting at a prison-camp palisade as much as a lyrical backdrop.
Gate Theatre, Notting Hill until October 1

FT  10 SEP 94 / Arts: Excellence is the only criterion - A prize like the
Jerwood was long overdue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yet another prize for artists may seem old hat, but the institution of the
Jerwood Painting Prize is something of an event.
In the first place, an award of Pounds 30,000, winner takes all, ups the
ante quite a bit. Outstripping the Turner Prize by 50 per cent, this has
persuaded an extremely strong field to declare itself.
Unlike the Turner there is no waiting upon nomination by the art world's
great and good - if you think you are up to it, you can have a go. Nor is
there any nonsense about age limits; not least of the Turner's present
failings, some would say, is its high-minded commitment to artists under 40
 -as though they need encouragement. With the Jerwood Prize, the only rule
is that entrants must have been working in the UK for the past 10 years.
But what really makes the Jerwood special is that it is a painting prize,
its criterion the simple rubric of 'excellence in modern British painting'.
The Turner Prize, on the other hand, has in recent years so apparently
become the preserve of the sculptural and conceptual avant garde - this year
the shortlist features two sculptors, a video-installation artist and one
painter. The UK has as varied and vigorous, serious and mature a community
of painters as any in the world, but to see what is shown of it abroad, you
would hardly know.
There are, of course, several other well-established open-submission awards
for painting, such as the John Moores and the Hunting Prize. However, being
based on the principle of selecting an exhibition first and then finding a
winner, they are very different.
In contrast, it really seems that the Jerwood is setting out to select a
single painter from among his or her peers as the most distinguished in any
year by virtue of sustained achievement and a substantial body of work. The
nettle has been grasped at last.
The 250 entrants were reduced by the jury to 12, each of whom was visited
before the final shortlist of six was established. Those six supply the
Prize Exhibition, which was shown at the Royal Scottish Academy during the
Edinburgh Festival, and opens on Monday at the Royal Academy in London. The
winner will be announced on September 21.
Together the six artists embrace a range of what, without any condescension,
we can call current mainstream modern painting. There is no conceptualism,
nothing programmatic or polemical. It is work that by not being
self-consciously avant garde, does not readily receive its critical due.
One of the painters is still young, three are middle-aged, a couple are
getting on a bit. Two are abstract - John Hoyland with his expansive
expressionism, Yuko Shiraishi with her restrained, minimal colour-fields.
Maurice Cockrill is an expressionist too, but one whose work is abstracted
rather than abstract, his figures now subsumed within an organic, invented
landscape.
The other three are out-and-out figurative painters, but of very different
sorts. John Lessore creates low-key and loosely stated figures and
interiors. Craigie Aitchison's colour is pitched high and decorative, his
figures schematised and symbolic. Euan Uglow, is committed to an exact and
disciplined scrutiny of the model.
Had I been on the jury, I may have chosen others from the 12, but only one
or two. I have to say what a relief it is to confront a shortlist that is
entirely acceptable. There is no token presence and each artist has a chance
of winning - well worth a punt.
Shall I mark your card? Cockrill started his career late and has finally
emerged as a mature and significant painter, which he has been threatening
to do for some years now. He is certainly in the frame. But Euan Uglow must
be the clear favourite. Why he does not have an international reputation is
no mystery, but it is a scandal. Though an artist of a very different kind,
he is the one painter of the figure working today who can match Lucian Freud
in measuring himself, beyond mere modernism, against the great European
figurative tradition.
The Jerwood Prize Exhibition: Royal Academy, Piccadilly W1, until September
28; Prize sponsored by The Jerwood Foundation and the Sunday Telegraph in
association with Modern Painters.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Collecting: Cotswold dealers see the light - After four hard
years, Antony Thorncroft finds that optimism is returning to the antiques
trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After four years of chill winds and battened down hatches, the first rays of
sunshine are brightening the lives of the Cotswolds' 60 or so serious
antique dealers. The recovery in demand is still described as 'spasmodic'
but most dealers are more relaxed about the future. One of the largest, Jack
Baggott of Woolcomber House, Stow-on-the-Wold, says: 'I will be making my
first profit for three years.'
The Cotswolds is easily the biggest antiques centre in the country outside
London. It is also the pleasantest to visit. The charm of the country is a
big factor in persuading dealers to set up shop there and customers, both
dealers and private collectors, to trawl around the clusters of shops in
Stow and Burford, and the good showings in Broadway, Cirencester, Witney,
Moreton-in-Marsh and the smaller villages.
In some sectors, such as oak furniture, there are probably more fine pieces
on offer than in London. And because the operating costs of Cotswold dealers
are lower than their London rivals, their prices tend to be more attractive.
Anyone interested in antiques, especially for home decoration, but over-awed
by London dealers and the auction rooms, can find a wide range of antiques,
mostly costing less than Pounds 5,000, in the Cotswolds. Most dealers will
also negotiate on marked prices, but only within 10 per cent.
This year demand has picked up, even in July and August - usually quiet
months when the towns and villages are crawling with tourists who clutter
the shops but usually do little more than browse. This year, though, some
actually bought.
Private collectors, who in the past decade have replaced dealers as the main
customers, have recovered their confidence. An important factor has been the
increase in house sales in the region, particularly in the upper price
range. People buying a new home tend to refurbish, and they like the country
furniture which is available readily in many shops.
Some of the houses will have been sold by hard-hit Lloyd's Names, but
expectations that these would dispose of their art and antiques to a trade
desperately short of fine items have not materialised. Lloyd's has hit the
Cotswolds mainly by depriving dealers of regular buyers.
Of course, many dealers like a moan and, with trade improving, their
grievances are directed now at grasping and unsupportive bank managers who
continue to raise charges; spiralling business rates; and the shortage of
good stock. Certainly, dealers must work harder - by touring the UK and
abroad; by cultivating clients in the hope these will sell back items; and
by attending obscure auctions - to ensure that they can re-stock with
quality goods.
It is not surprising that, with real incomes rising, there should be an
improvement in demand. But many dealers are sounder financially because of
their success in cutting costs. Stephen Jarrett of Witney Antiques, who has
one of the finest stocks of 18th century (and later) furniture in the area,
has managed to reduce operating expenses from Pounds 280,000 a year to
Pounds 190,000.
Others, like Robin Shield, have given up their shops (he used to operate in
Burford) to trade from home - in his case, Cricklade. But dealers are still
attracted to the Cotswolds. In Stow, which has more than 20 antique shops,
numbers have been swelled recently by the arrival from London of Arthur
Seager, who concentrates on pre-1800 furniture and carvings, and Roger Lamb,
who covers the field of decorative items.
Both are delighted with their move. Seager swopped a Kensington lease for a
Stow freehold and saw his costs fall 20 per cent. He is one of the dealers
who locks his door against casual callers: he relies on his regulars, many
of whom are American collectors who appreciate a pair of 16th century carved
wooden heads for Pounds 2,200; an early-18th century tavern settle for
Pounds 1,250; and a cosy Elizabethan farmer's chair for about Pounds 13,500.
Lamb has turned over his stock since February. He concentrates on small,
decorative antiques, all priced below Pounds 5,000, such as a Regency
chiffonier for Pounds 3,000 and a games table at the same price. Both show
off well in the homes of his principal customers, the weekend country
cottages of the wealthy.
Costs apart, the Cotswold dealers have survived better than London during
the recession partly because they are happy with more modest margins (30 per
cent and sometimes less) and partly because many concentrate on furniture.
'Demand is still out-stripping supply in English furniture,' says Baggott,
although it is only the finest pieces which command the premiums. Even so,
he reckons prices have not moved up in the past year.
Baggott has a huge stock, of almost 5,000 items, mainly priced between
Pounds 1,000-Pounds 5,000. At the moment buyers want useful furniture, like
the Gillow pedestal desk priced at Pounds 2,850, and the circular,
Coalbrookdale garden seat, which rings a tree, priced at Pounds 3,450.
Like many dealers, he regrets the disappearance of good 18th century walnut
and Chippendale pieces. Prices for them at auction can be so high that, by
the time a dealer has smartened up an item, there is no profit in it. Few
local buyers like to venture above Pounds 10,000.
Those that do, end up at Witney Antiques, which carries a stock that rivals
London's Bond Street. On offer now are a magisterial pair of Regency desks
made by Gillow, priced at Pounds 58,000. This is exceptional, though. As a
sign of the times, Witney Antiques is seeking a wider market, and most items
now cost less than Pounds 25,000, such as an attractive group of four tables
that slip beneath each other and carry a Pounds 5,500 tag.
Among the specialist Cotswold shops, Manfred Schotten in Burton has one of
the widest ranges of sporting antiques in the UK. One of the smallest items
for sale at present, a feather golf ball of around 1940 made by James
Gourlay, is one of the most expensive in the shop at Pounds 7,500; while one
of the largest items, a late-19th century full-sized snooker table, is
priced at Pounds 3,000. Here, you can find enticing presents for sports-mad
partners: late-Victorian golf clubs at Pounds 185 (and Edwardian at Pounds
95); Victorian tennis rackets for Pounds 145; and 1930s' cricket bats for
just Pounds 45.
Across the road is another specialist, Richard Purdon, who sells rugs and
carpets - the genuine, pre-1900 articles, not modern substitutes. This
market has received a new lease of life with the disappearance of the Soviet
Union. Many fine rugs and textiles are now coming out of places like
Uzbekistan. Purdon is offering a fine, colourful Uzbek coat for Pounds 350:
he sold an even better one to the US for Pounds 3,000.
Purdon goes for a small profit and a quick turnover and his prices rarely
climb above Pounds 10,000. An exception is a fine Bijar carpet on offer at
Pounds 14,500: he bought it from a local family which had acquired it in
1979 for Pounds 4,000 - so proving that many antiques, even those you walk
over, appreciate in price.
There are not many specialist picture dealers in the Cotswolds but, just
outside Cheltenham, The Priory offers decorative late-19th and early-20th
century art, while John Noot and Richard Hagen of Broadway trade in
similarly popular works. Noot has just opened a third outlet inside the
Lygon Arms hotel.
In Stow, the biggest gallery belongs to John Davies. He has adapted to the
more selective market by adding limited edition prints to his stock
alongside works by Dorothea Sharp and Harold Harvey, now on offer well below
their 1989 saleroom peaks of Pounds 60,000 or so.
On October 19, Davies is showing watercolours of Venice by two respected
artists, David Gluck and John Linfield, priced between Pounds 350 and Pounds
2,500.
Typical of Cotswold premises overflowing with every conceivable antique,
from Victorian snuff boxes to Georgian dressers, are Rankin Taylor in
Cirencester and Jonathan Fyson at Burton. Leslie Taylor has crammed her shop
with items she likes, ranging between early glasses from Pounds 8 to a
leather-covered chair of around 1680 priced at Pounds 1,250. Fyson likes to
turn over his stock four times a year. Among his curiosities is a
collapsible teak table of around 1800 used aboard ship: price Pounds 3,000.
Other shops are more severe. Keith Hockin in Stow loves early oak, and here
you can buy 18th century candle boxes for Pounds 300 or less; large pewter
flagons for Pounds 2,000, and an 18th century wine bottle from All Souls'
common room for Pounds 95. And back in Cirencester, at William H. Stokes,
you get equally early items aimed at the higher end of the market. He is
offering, for Pounds 22,500, a 1580 table which he sold 25 years ago for
Pounds 1,900.
People now know that antiques can be a good investment. But their real
attractions are that they are beautiful, often useful, and cheer up a home.
Equally pleasurable is hunting for them in a region as quintessentially
English as the Cotswolds.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Ready roses - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON, JILL JAMES and LUCINDA DE LA RUE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some roses for immediate drinking (I have yet to encounter a rose which
improves with age): Cotes du Luberon Rose 1993, Pounds 3.29 Safeway only, is
a Hugh Ryman creation, and very successful too, with attractive Grenache
fruitiness, appetising weight and a really dry finish. Bordeaux Rose 1993
Francois de Lorgeac, Pounds 3.49 Waitrose, has attractive bite, and is just
off-dry. It would make a perfectly respectable lunch wine.
A chance to savour Rajasthani cuisine at The Red Fort, in Dean Street,
London, until October 23. Dishes include safed maas, lamb marinated in
yoghurt and cooked with almonds, coconut and chillies to a white finish, and
dal batti churma, a meal of mixed lentils, hard bread soaked in clarified
butter and sweet, whole wheat marbles. A typical three-course meal will cost
around Pounds 25, excluding drinks. Tel: 071-437 2115 or 2525. Fax: 071-434
0721.
As is so often the case, for entirely unmerited reasons, the most memorable
bottle drunk during a recent visit to Champagne was a still red, a 1987
Mondavi Reserve Pinot Noir from a champagne maker's personal cellar.
Waitrose sells the regular Robert Mondavi Pinot Noir 1991 for Pounds 8.95.
It should age every bit as well, although can now offer essence of true
Pinot fruit - and is earthier, somehow more ambitiously 'Burgundian' than
the Faiveley Mercurey La Framboisiere 1992 at Pounds 7.95 which is
super-fruity, not to say super-raspberry-like. But since it is Faiveley,
which is suing the American wine critic Robert Parker for his comments on
their winemaking practices, I would like to make it clear that I very much
enjoyed this splendid wine.
Well worth a visit if you are in south-west London, is Sonny's at 92 Church
Road, Barnes. The shop - more like a French traiteur than an English deli -
and adjacent cafe are open Monday to Saturday, 10am to 6pm. Dishes such as
chicken and choroso gumbo, char-grilled vegetables, and bread and butter
pudding are on sale. Rebecca Mascarenhas stocks the best of everything that
is homemade. It makes a handy one-stop-shop for a dinner party. If you are
pressed for time, Mascarenhas will plan a menu for you over the 'phone and
then taxi it to your home (and send a chef and waiter too, should you need
them). Tel: 081-741 8451.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Swimming against the tide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN HALLIDAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why am I standing in Berkhamsted High Street at 2.30am in a thunderstorm,
when sensible people are asleep? In a rash moment I have arranged to spend a
day working with my local fishmonger, Wayne Slessor, owner of Aylesbury
Fisheries, to find out how he makes such a success of a business in which
many of his competitors have been closing down.
Superstores, which concentrate on a limited range of fresh fish, have
increased their share of the market and independent fishmongers have found
it hard to compete.
Yet in the last 15 years Slessor, who is 35, and his family have created a
business which now has three shops, seven market stalls and a steady
business in special orders for customers such as Champneys health farm.
Sales are more than Pounds 1m a year.
I want to know how he has done it. I am also curious about how hard he has
to work to afford the new Lamborghini for which he has just traded in his
two-year-old Ferrari.
We set out in his van at 2.45am, making brief calls at two of his shops and
at his depot to check that the ice-making machines have been working
effectively overnight.
At 3.30 we call at Nat Jacobs of Edgware, a Kosher shop he has recently
bought, to check that the overnight deliveries have arrived from the ports
and that the shop has been thoroughly cleaned. This shop is run separately
from the others, to conform to strict Jewish dietary laws. No shellfish may
be stocked and a skilled 'blockman' is employed to fillet and prepare fish
while customers wait.
The shop, like Slessor's other outlets, has been re-fitted with white,
decorative tiling and stainless steel units to display the fish in ice. It
is attractively decorated with preserved fish. It costs about Pounds 30,000
to fit out a shop in this way.
It is now 4am and we set off for Billingsgate, arriving at 4.40. The new
Billingsgate is in the shadow of Canary Wharf. It is a modern complex with a
trading floor of about 40,000 sq ft. The first impression I get is of
whiteness. The tiles are white; the polystyrene boxes containing the fish
are white; much of the fish is white; and the overalls of the market traders
and porters are white - though by the end of trading they are stained grey.
The only incongruous note is struck by the Harrods buyer, dressed in a black
banker's jacket and black striped trousers. He looks as if he has stopped
off on the way to a wedding. But there are no representatives from the
superstores at Billingsgate looking for anything out of the ordinary this
morning. The second impression is that there is hardly any smell of fish:
the ice that keeps the fish fresh and the ventilation system are responsible
for that.
At 5am a bell rings and trading begins. Slessor makes his way from one
trader to another, checking the quality of the fish and haggling over
prices. He can tell, from handling a fish, how long has passed since it was
caught, from the degree of rigor mortis.
Crabs are rejected because today they weigh too little in relation to their
size. He shows me how to tell a wild salmon from a farm salmon.
Much friendly, loud abuse is exchanged between buyers and sellers before
prices and quantities are agreed. Each makes a note in his own book (or
occasionally on his sleeve) about the bargain struck. No signatures are
exchanged. The speed and informality remind me of the old trading floor of
the Stock Exchange.
Slessor also distributes cheques in payment for fish bought the previous
week. In 45 minutes he spends Pounds 15,000. Half of his produce comes from
Billingsgate, the remainder direct from the ports - much of the latter being
for his Kosher outlet.
By the time we return to his van, much of the fish has been brought by
porters to the rear of the vehicle. We start to load it and, while we do so,
further deliveries arrive. It is hard, physical work, lifting boxes which
can weigh more than 80lbs - a fully grown tuna is longer than a small car.
It is now 6.30, about the time I would normally be waking up. We make
deliveries to the shops, the managers having arrived by 6.30. By 9.30 the
shops have received their deliveries and I am exhausted. Slessor heads off
to make deliveries to two of his stalls.
He has built an expanding, profitable business in the face of supermarket
competition and has made a substantial fortune. How has he done it?
First, through hard work. He first began to sell fish (and meat) in his
teens, putting in a full day as an engineering apprentice at Vauxhall,
selling his produce in the evenings and at weekends. He also attended
evening classes to learn about retailing fresh produce. Now that he works
for himself he leaves home at 2am three days a week. On those days it is
normal for him to work a 15-hour day.
Secondly, he knows his customers. No two shops or stalls have the same mix
of products. Some sell mostly cod and plaice, some do better with exotic
species.
By judging his markets carefully sells up to 75 per cent of his produce on
the day of purchase. He therefore has no money tied up in stock and has
never needed a bank loan.
Finally, he emphasises the importance of his family to the enterprise. His
wife, Michelle, has worked with him since they were both in their teens. Of
the 10 people employed in the business, six are close relatives who, like
him, are prepared to work unsocial hours and can be trusted not to pocket
the takings in what is almost entirely a cash business. He is also fortunate
in having secured the services of experienced staff from businesses he has
bought.
The biggest single constraint on the expansion of the business is likely to
be difficulty in recruiting staff with the knowledge and commitment required
to work in a rewarding but tough business.
In the 15 years Slessor has been in business 10 per cent of fishmongers have
closed. Slessor has bucked the trend towards superstores and is seeking
further sites from which to trade. He has certainly earned his Lamborghini
in my book though I cannot imagine when he finds time to drive it.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Exciting and under Pounds 4 a bottle - Wine /
Wine merchants and consumers should sniff out the south of France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The south of France is making the best value wines in the world today.
Discuss.
Well, where else can you find varied wines with real character and a sense
of provenance for less than Pounds 4 a bottle? And the exciting thing is
that the south of France produces such a large quantity of wine - more than
any other wine region in the world - that the number of interesting bottles
is substantial, and the potential is enormous.
Take, for example, the two most fashionable white varietal wines, solid
Chardonnay and modish Viognier. The Midi may not be able to offer anything
with the concentration of a Corton-Charlemagne (Coche-Dury's 1991 is
stunning) or the best Condrieu, but it can field some of the world's
better-made examples at the blunt end of wine pricing.
Domaine St Hilaire's Chardonnay 1993, Vin de Pays d'Oc at Oddbins and Le
Gineste at Waitrose can offer full, round Chardonnay fruit with a distinct
suggestion of the added interest accrued by stirring the lees after
fermentation. Not bad for Pounds 3.99, although I suspect these wines are
best drunk straight off the bottling line.
Viognier 1993 Resplandy, Pounds 3.95 from Sainsbury's and another Vin de
Pays d'Oc, has, like so many cheaper Viogniers, more than a whiff of air
freshener about it, but it has very lively acidity, lots of fruit, and is
generally a better bet than the vapid market average with this variety.
Perhaps the interest for serious wine lovers is the Midi's ability to
provide carefully made, small domaine, appellation controlee wines at rock
bottom prices. Ch de Cabriac Corbieres 1991, Pounds 3.45 at Asda, is a good
example. Round, full, and generous, it is a fitting memorial to the
winemaking skills of the late Bernadette Villars who was consultant there.
Sainsbury's Ch La Voulte Gasparets 1990 at Pounds 4.75 comes from one of
Corbieres' most respected domaines, run by a former plumber with suitably
fastidious attention to detail. Full, herby and chewy, the wine is truly
representative of this beautiful region, and the 1991 vintage will be a
worthy successor.
Faugeres 1991, Domaine Marbrieres, Pounds 4.19 Safeway, is another
excellent, deep draught of oak-aged wine from the ambitious Laurens
co-operative in the rocky Faugeres zone.
There is no shortage of serious estates in the Minervois appellation making
sleek reds and increasingly sophisticated whites on a shoestring. Oddbins
has invested in one of the Languedoc's most polished bottlings, Cuvee
Trianon 1991 Villerambert-Julien, which can provide that rather nouveau
bordeaux mixture of density and structure with fruit ripe enough to enjoy
now that is difficult to find in a red bordeaux selling at Pounds 6.99.
Both Adnams, of Southwold, Suffolk and the Thresher/Bottoms Up/Wine Rack
group have taken a particularly good look at what the Midi has to offer and
both the Adnams and Bottoms Up lists are worthy of serious study. Domaine
l'Hortus makes some excellent red and rose, and Fitou is once more a
potentially interesting proposition. La Vigneronne, of London SW7, also has
a fine collection of some of the more obscure southern French wines.
Further east the Grenache grape starts to dominate and many of the reds are
a little sweeter and more alcoholic. Grenache Le Radical 1993 Vin de Pays de
Vaucluse, Pounds 3.25 Oddbins, is a new wave Grenache made in Cotes de
Ventoux country just north of Mayle country by an incomer. Full, fruity with
high acidity, it is certainly good value, if far less exciting than, say,
the dense, Chateauneuf-like wines of Ch de Fonsalette from OW Loeb, London
SE1.
A fair stab at this hefty style for under a fiver can be found at Waitrose
in the form of Cairanne 1990 Domaine de la Presidente Pounds 4.99. This is
absolutely correct Cotes-du- Rhone-Villages with real density, roundness,
and lovely, spicy Grenache fruit from the village of Ste Cecile des Vignes.
Meanwhile, Provence is producing more and more interesting red wine, often
from blends of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. Domaine de Trevallon, from Yapp
Bros of Mere, Wiltshire, showed the way and has yet to disappoint this
palate. Now Coteaux Varois wines such as Routas, from Adnams and Morris &amp;
Verdin and Domaine du Deffends are worthy of serious consideration by any
serious wine enthusiast, if that is not an oxymoron.
Domaine de Triennes, Les Aureliens Vin de Pays du Var 1992 is Pounds 5.99 at
Oddbins and the most impressive Provencal red so far from this new
enterprise undertaken by two of Burgundy's most admired winemakers.
It is full, rich, dense yet supple and, while not being under Pounds 4,
certainly does nothing to disprove my thesis that the south of France is
where any wine merchant worth his salt should be sniffing most keenly.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Simple and special ingredients - Nicholas
Lander finds shelf space for Richard Olney's new book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No enthusiastic cook with limited space on the kitchen bookshelf will
welcome yet another book extolling the virtues of Provencal cooking. Almost
every cookery book written today, regardless of the author's birthplace,
seems to include a recipe for aioli, grilled vegetables or a daube of beef.
Lulu's Provencal Table by Richard Olney (Harper Collins, Dollars 30, 364
pages - soon to be available in the UK), is different.
It begins romantically in 1935 when Lucien Peyraud met Lucie (known as Lulu)
Tempier in Aix-en-Provence and recounts their subsequent marriage in 1937.
In 1940 they took over her family's wine property, Domaine Tempier, in
Bandol, but the second world war imposed its harsh reality. The only food
available in any quantity was Jerusalem artichokes and, unsurprisingly, they
do not feature in any of Lulu's recipes.
The book describes Lucien's dedication to improving the quality of his
wines, now sold around the world, and Lulu's dedication to cooking for
family, friends and those fortunate to have found their way to the Peyraud's
table.
Lulu's recipes exude an air of simplicity because she is a domestic, rather
than a professional, cook. Her leg of lamb on a bed of thyme is stunning but
very easy (even if you are cooking on a small oven in your holiday gite) and
her recipes for flat vegetable omelettes will please a single diner or a
large gathering.
Behind all the menus lies a consistency of method and balance: a
thoughtfully prepared amuse- gueule, a main course that is there to impress
as much with its taste as with the care with which it has been prepared, a
well-chosen cheese and/or a light dessert, usually incorporating the
freshest fruit.
This book excites on several other levels too. It is fastidiously written by
Olney, an American who has lived in Provence for many years and has become a
close friend of the Peyrauds.
Gail Skoff has not only taken some inspirational colour photographs but has
lovingly resuscitated some black and white pictures from the Peyraud family
album. The book has also been edited thoughtfully.
Many cookery tomes are annoying because the recipes end mid-page. The editor
has avoided this and skilfully used a series of woodcuts from Le Tresor de
la Cuisine du Bassin Mediterranean, published in 1930, to add to its
variety. These provide the final special ingredient to a book which should
find a place in any kitchen.

FT  10 SEP 94 / FT Ski Expedition: Caught on the hop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker have reached the Australasian stage of their
round-the-world expedition, on which they are trying to ski every day of
1994.
In the Australian Alps, where the pied currawong gargles and warbles and
crimson rosellas dart through the snow-gums, they worry a lot about your
welfare. 'If you drink and then drive, you are an idiot,' is a common road
sign. So is 'buckle up in the Bush' and 'Drive to Survive'.
My main survival problem is driving on the left. After eight months and
23,000 miles of driving on the right, I am finding it difficult to adjust
back and we have already had one near-miss.
In Mount Buller we were urged not to forget the 'slip slap slop' (suncream).
It is unseasonably warm and the snow is suffering. Appropriately in the land
of the kangaroo, what is required for the kind of snow conditions we have
here in Mount Hotham (slushy moguls) is 'the hop'.
'There is absolutely no doubt about it,' said Norman Wilson, one-time
designer of Formula One engines, 'you have just got to get the tails of your
skis out of the snow'.
He went on: 'We were taught the hop by Peter Zirknitzer, one of the first
ski instructors in the resort in the early 1960s.'
Wilson and his wife Liz put this technique to good use on a recent visit to
Stuben, Austria. 'There were some excellent German skiers in our class,' he
says. 'Liz and I were content to bring up the rear on the first day. Then
next day the sun had got at the snow and we were skiing in the kind of slush
you sometimes get in the Victoria Alps at the end of the season. This time,
Liz and I were right behind the instructor and the rest were falling like
ninepins.'
Zirknitzer - a boyish-looking 61 who can still ski the pants off most of the
locals - runs Zirky's, one of Mount Hotham's ski lodges that combines
accommodation with a restaurant and ski hire. Peter Malkin, probably the
most laid-back man in town, if not Australia, runs another, called Jack
Frost, where we have been staying. In his spare time he runs a gold mine.
Zirknitzer is one of many Europeans in the mountains of Victoria and New
South Wales. At Mount Buller, we skied with Paul Romagna, the newly
appointed director of St Anton's Bundessportheim ski school for Austrian ski
instructors at St Christoph.
He is about to complete 21 double winters as ski school director in Mount
Buller and Schruns. Why does he keep coming back to Victoria?
'It's the scenery,' he said. 'At the end of a day's skiing I like to gaze
across the mountains as the sun sets. The different ranges change colour
from green to grey to blue. Even though I have a wonderful view of the
Montafon Valley back home, this is superb - and very different from
Austria.'
I notice that Romagna skis sublimely, but with his legs bolted together.
Surely this style is very passe.
He replies: 'It is not a question of skiing with either legs together or
apart. One is functional, the other aesthetic.
'When you are being watched and want to look good, you should ski with your
legs together, although it has to be said your balance is more fragile. When
you are skiing faster, then you gradually adopt a more functional stance
with your legs a little further apart.'
Our last Victorian ski area was Falls Creek. Some still sneer at the idea of
skiing in Australia, but Falls Creek, like Mount Buller and Mount Hotham,
has a vertical drop of 1,181ft, considerably more than most resorts east of
the Mississippi, and 22 lifts. Australia's top six resorts - Thredbo,
Perisher Valley, Buller, Hotham, Falls Creek and Blue Cow - have more than
100 lifts between them and an average vertical drop of 1,430ft.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Outdoors: Russia's river of high returns - Angling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
East of Murmansk, a large snout of taiga called the Kola Peninsular noses
into the Barents Sea. Its few inhabitants, famed for their extremes of
inebriation, herd reindeer. It used to be one of the world's more forgotten
places.
All this changed in 1990, however. That was when an American sporting
outfitter called Frontiers discovered that the rivers on the near-deserted
Russian peninsular supported stocks of Atlantic salmon in numbers not seen
in Europe or America for more than a century.
Most of the waters meander through trackless wastes, cuckoo-haunted forests
and immense, glacially-scoured plains largely untouched by man.
When the salmon smolt heads for salt water, it finds unobstructed passage to
the wintering grounds, patrolled comfortingly by the Russian navy. It is all
quite a change from the mayhem of the EU-regulated North Sea.
This has led to big changes. The shacks of Murmansk airport are now full of
colourfully-clad fly-rodders - an international coterie of fishing
enthusiasts who will do almost anything to make contact with their premier
game fish.
From a battered Russian airport bus, they creep into the cavernous holds of
even more battered Russian helicopters. These huge ironclads thud over the
taiga, depositing their human cargoes at camps newly constructed in the
forest. Polystyrene igloos, tents, anything will do. Nothing like this
invasion of fly-pole artists has been seen before.
The river to which I went is 260 miles long and queen of the lot. Of the
11,000 fish caught by rod annually on the Kola Peninsular, 7,000 come from
the Ponoi during a season that lasts four months starting in June. It is
remarkably consis-tent.
Two camps operate over a fishing concession from the Russian government that
covers 80 of the prime 120 miles that are suited to fly fishing. The
luxurious Upper Ponoi camp, my abode for a week, not only has a stretch of
this great salmon river but also flies devotees out daily to two dreamily
beautiful tributaries, the Aacheriyok and the Pournache.
When salmon are encountered in these rivers, they can be blissfully
forgiving. After a botched cast and a poor strike, even after having been
hooked and lost, they return to the attack with an aggression that usually
occurs only in fishermen's wilder fantasies.
Statistics may be inconclusive, but salmon talk is rarely devoid of them for
long. One British woman landed 42 salmon in a day from the upper Ponoi.
My own fishing partner found creative embellishment of the day's proceedings
unnecessary - he hooked and landed nine salmon in two hours in a pool
requiring only half a cast. Three years ago, 12 rods on Lower Ponoi camp
averaged 66 fish apiece for each of their two weeks there.
Contrary to expectations, I found that the fishing was usually sporty
despite the occasional 'taking frenzies'. Pound for pound, these Russian
fish punch above their weight. Indeed, much Stolichnaya has been sunk in
sorrowful meditation on their breakaway powers. I found unshaven,
bleary-looking men slumped in the airport reflecting ruefully on the
inadequacies of their tackle and competence.
On the Kola, the accent might be mainly on salmon - but you can never quite
forget the stories of Stalin's extermination of the Lapps, or overlook the
feeling of history that permeates all Russian soil. Together, all these
things make this migration of western sportsmen a particularly interesting
one in which to take part.
Michael Wigan flew Finnair to Murmansk. The trip was organised by Frontiers'
London office at 14 Old Bond St, WIX 3DB, tel: 071-493 0798. Prices for a
Ponoi package run between Dollars 5,650 and Dollars 7,500, starting from
Murmansk.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Outdoors: A gentle end to scorching summer - Gardening /
Robin Lane-Fox contemplates clipping his blooming magnolia and healing yew
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE-FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mother Nature has scorched her poor gardeners all summer and, as the end of
the season approaches, she is now softening them up with a kinder
postscript.
Gentle rain and intermittent sunshine show September at its best. They also
give us a chance for useful action, while enjoying the one high-class
performer in this testing year.
Perhaps it has been the heat, perhaps it is the passing of its seventh year,
but my evergreen magnolia Grandiflora, planted in 1987, has at last put
lesser companions to shame.
Never be shy of planting these heroic trees against a sunny wall when you
start a garden. Mine has had 14 flowers this summer, four of them open
simultaneously as I write.
The myth that they need 10 years to flower in Britain is irrelevant. Better
forms have speeded the process.
As yet, The Plant Finder, the Hardy Plant Society's list of more than 55,000
plants, lists only one source for the Maryland cross, which will flower in
its third year; experts now speak equally well of Saint Mary, but I am happy
with my usual Exmouth variety which is recognisable by its narrow leaves and
flowers with smaller, more widely-spaced, white petals.
They last for a long weekend and then the lemon-scented flowers turn brown
like suede and start to drop. Blame their fall on the beetles who find their
way into the flowers and pollinate them, their primeval duty since the years
before the earth's last ice age. Who can be cross with the beetles when the
slightest cooling on a September evening releases the scent which draws
everyone to it?
Grandiflora owners must soon decide whether to choose clear daylight through
their ground-floor windows or whether to leave their magnolia to grow
sideways on the wall outside and obscure the light. These magnolias grow
furiously and I will soon be hidden behind evergreens, lost to the world
beneath a pre-glacial canopy.
Next spring, the magnolia will have to be pruned. Meanwhile, we should all
be using the weekend on our evergreen backbones: those hedges and shapes of
yew and box. Now is exactly the right moment to clip and train them because
their sap is running less freely and their growth will be less delayed by
being stopped.
Arm yourself with some bamboo canes, a ball of string and a sharp pair of
hand shears. Fix the canes at intervals down the front of a young hedge,
tapering them inwards slightly to give the slope, or batter, of a
well-groomed hedge. Traditionally you should allow an inward slope of one
inch to each foot of height. Stretch lengths of string along the canes and
then cut the hedging back to its line, striking firmly so that you do not
leave split ends.
I hate cutting anything and would have disappeared by now in an undisturbed
jungle if visitors' expectations did not force me to give hedges a shape.
This year, the clipping of yew has taken on a new attraction: it is our
chance to be useful and contribute to the nation's health.
You probably know the feeling of wistful waste when you are left with piles
of green yew clippings, too early in the autumn to be used in winter
decorations. It always seems sad to cremate them, but now you can send them
off for research.
At Old House Farm, Stubbs Walden, Doncaster, Yorkshire, John Cook and his
family have been farming 1,200 acres for nearly 40 years.
Since 1991, their company, Friendship Estates, has branched out from green
herbs into yew clippings: they travel all over Britain to collect them,
blow-dry them and send them to be milked for their vital extract, known as
10-DAB III.
When purified, this extract becomes docetaxel, a current favourite in cancer
research, where high hopes are held for its medical worth.
Friendship Estates will come to your garden for the clippings of at least 50
yards of yew hedging. It has 300 customers already and, in its third year,
is collecting more than 100 tonnes of yew clippings. Fax on 0302-700958 or
telephone on 0302-700200 if you have enough yew to help. It is a prompt
collector and has swept up the crumbs from the academic yews in a nearby
Oxford college already.
One hope for docetaxel is in the treatment of breast cancers, among others.
Clippings should be stored in a cool and shady place to a maximum depth of
9in until they are collected. Friendship Estates will lend appropriate bags
and cool air fans to customers with a serious length of yew on offer.
It has been an awful year for hedge funds, but I feel it is up to the
gardening column to name one which will actually turn out to have some
value.
If only the doctors would come up with a use for the leaves of my magnolias.
Then it would not be so hard to cut them, too, let in the daylight and tell
myself that I was striking a blow for a longer life.

FT  10 SEP 94 / As They Say in Europe: The Swiss corner of Chinatown - James
Morgan foresees a cultural melting pot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the north-west corner of Leicester Square in London stands the Swiss
Centre. It was originally planned as a cultural site to be called 'Forum of
Switzerland'. That failed to take off because, characteristically, no Swiss
was prepared to offer a guarantee to cover any deficits.
Today, it houses a Swiss watch shop and the Swiss National Tourist Office
('the oldest such foreign travel office in the world'). Outside stands a 10m
pole emblazoned with the arms of the 26 cantons.
To coincide with the Swiss millennium in 1991, Westminster city council
renamed the bit of street next to it Swiss Court. There is not a single
facet of Swiss culture that goes unrepresented on the facade or in the
environs: flags, cuckoo clocks, Swatches, coats of arms.
Since it was established in 1965, the centre has been, what it was once for
me, a leading trysting spot. It symbolises romantic hopes, shattered dreams
and broken hearts. It is unfortunate, therefore, that it should now be at
the heart of three complex problems - commercial, racial and political.
'Uncertain fate of the Swiss centre in London,' ran the headline in the Neue
Zurcher Zeitung, followed by 'Tempting offers and contractual hurdles'. It
emerged that the centre was transferred in 1986, in an in-house deal, to a
holding company, the Swiss Centre Ltd, for a mere Pounds 3.2m. Its
shareholders are the Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) with 51 per cent, and two
largely state-owned enterprises, Swissair and the Swiss Travel Office,
dividing up the rest.
But, 'the structural circumstances of the building make reconstruction
necessary'. That will cost an estimated Pounds 45m. Now, last year the Swiss
Centre was valued at Pounds 14m but today, says the paper with heavy use of
italics, Pounds 30m has been offered for the present structure. The SBC is,
says the NZZ, anxious to sell but its minority partners have the right to
first refusal. The Travel Office in particular, as a government agency,
'does not wish this successful shop window to give way surreptitiously to an
'exotic funfair'.'
This needs some explanation: the Bank Corporation says it is going ahead
with the sale but the NZZ says there is a catch in the articles of
agreement. It alleges there is a clause saying that any buyer has to
guarantee the Swiss character of the building.
Now it will not take any observer of the London scene long to realise there
might be a problem if that is so. The offers made up to now are hardly
reassuring: the Swiss Centre stands at the edge of Chinatown. 'Chinese
investors are apparently ready to pay practically any price for this
building.' But they are not prepared to accept any 'Swiss' condition.
It is evident that this problem cannot be resolved by some superficial,
papering-over-the-cracks solution such as turning the Movenpick restaurant
into a Swiss-style chow mein centre. It is also evident that it is too late
to offer Hong Kong as the 27th canton. But it does seem that both sides are
unnecessarily overwhelmed by an assumption that there is some kind of
incompatibility between them. This should not be so.
In Chinese, 'Switzerland' is made up of characters pronounced 'Rui Shi,'
which are considered auspicious by the Chinese. Then again, some Germans
refer to the form of their language spoken in most of the Swiss cantons as
'Cantonese'.
The two peoples share many characteristics: both seem able to accept iron
rules in order to avoid anything resembling anarchy, or even excessive
personal freedom. Both put a firm emphasis on family values while allowing
considerable latitude to those who fail to stick closely to the more
demanding of their marriage vows. And one of the sub-headings in the NZZ in
covering this story was, 'What's a promise worth?' Just the kind of question
a Chinese businessman might ask. A pragmatic approach to resolving such
riddles is a shared quality so some kind of deal should be possible.
But the NZZ which emerges as a leader of the pro-Swiss faction, says a
face-saving solution is out of the question: 'The meaning of the contractual
obligations of the three partners is clear.' A proposition SBC denies.
There seems to be nothing for it but the creation of a Sino-Swiss Centre
which would certainly add a touch of the unusual to the anonymous feel of
Leicester Square today. I like the idea of buxom Swiss girls clad in
cheong-sams serving up lashings of sweet-and-sour Rosti every August 1,
Swiss national day. And alpenhorns would add to the festivity of the local
Chinese New Year celebrations in February.
With any luck, in years to come, a young man will be standing outside the
centre, in the rain, clutching a bouquet of etiolated Taiwan edelweiss in
his right hand and, in his left, a box of Madame Choy's Lucky Cuckoo
Chocolate Mooncakes.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Property: Mackintosh lives again - Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An extraordinary house is for sale near Inverness. The Artist's Cottage at
Farr was built in 1992 from plans and elevations prepared by Charles Rennie
Mackintosh in 1900 for an artist's cottage and studio that never went ahead.
Architect Robert Hamilton Macintyre, of Keppie, Henderson &amp; Partners,
adapted the Mackintosh plans (kept in the Hunterian Gallery in Glasgow) to
modern technology. The result is a stunning, white-rendered piece of the
Mediterranean - almost mud-brick architecture in its rounded parapets - set
in the heart of Scotland. But I am not sure Mackintosh would have approved
of so much fitted carpeting or of five showers and only one bath.
The leaded glass windows use Mackintosh designs, and the wing which he
intended for servants will now take children or visitors. Bidwells in Perth
(0738-630666) seeks offers over Pounds 250,000.
Average rents have risen 67 per cent between 1991 and 1994, according to a
new survey by Strutt &amp; Parker, while inflation between May 1991 and May 1994
was only 8.38 per cent.
This is certainly a very large increase but Ann Sugden of the Newbury
office, who compiled the survey, points out it is based on S&amp;P properties
outside London - mostly houses of farmhouse/old rectory size, cottages on
estates or farms, or executive homes.
The prime reason for the increase is assured shorthold tenancies (ASTs),
which form 94 per cent of these lettings. Although ASTs began in 1989, it
took time for owners to understand that they really could regain possession
when the terms ended. So, rents in 1991 were lower than they might have
been, reflecting the uncertainty of the landlords as well as the recession.
The survey shows that rents now are highest for detached houses in East
Anglia (averaging Pounds 700 a month) and the west country (Pounds 768), and
for semi-detached houses and flats in the south-east (Pounds 432 and Pounds
450).
Rents for pre-1700 properties are almost twice as high as for post-1950.
Detached houses rose the most (72 per cent) since 1991 and flats the least
(22 per cent).
At Warham, on the Holkham estate in Norfolk, Savills in Norwich
(0603-612211) is offering two solid, late-Georgian box houses on five-year
ASTs for Pounds 12,000 a year: the old rectory and Chalk Hill farmhouse.
In Staffordshire, the West Midlands office (0902-851347) has Somerford
Grange for Pounds 150 week. This is a farmhouse given a castellated
Georgian-Gothic facade around 1770 to improve the view across the park of
Somerford Hall.
Nettleden House, built in 1856 on the Ashridge estate in Hertfordshire, is
available furnished for Pounds 3,950 a month from Hamptons (071-493 8222).
The house has 11 acres, stables and tennis court - and the gardener's wages
are included. Pay more to use the owner's Rolls-Royce or his cellar (charged
by the bottle).
Slightly cheaper, at around Pounds 3,500 furnished, is Tilbury Hall at
Tilbury-juxta-Clare in east Suffolk. This is a Tudor house owned by Edward
de Vere, an earl of Oxford and favourite of Queen Elizabeth. It, too, comes
with a gardener and 80 acres (from Bidwells in Cambridge: 0223-841841).
Edwin Lutyens designed the red-brick Beacon House at Knebworth,
Hertfordshire. Bryan Bishop in Welwyn (0438-718877) is asking Pounds 475,000
(down from Pounds 497,000).
A Norman Shaw house is for sale at Groombridge, Kent, where he designed
several properties. Set in three acres near Tunbridge Wells, Hillside
respects the Wealden tradition of building with half-timbered gables and
tile-hung upper walls. Savills in Sevenoaks (0732-455551) seeks Pounds
750,000 for it.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Message of hope and fellowship: The IRA's declaration of a
ceasefire and the prospects of peace are important to many Americans.
Nicholas Woodsworth visited an Irish society in Boston to see how the news
was received
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Walk into the headquarters of the Emerald Society in a suburb of Boston,
Massachusetts, and you will start to understand why the US president, Bill
Clinton is so exercised about Ireland. This is a hall, soaked in Liffey-side
nostalgia, with shamrocks and bright Kelly green curtains. It is the meeting
place for one of the 4,000 Irish-American organisations. The number of US
citizens claiming Irish descent has been growing rapidly and is now thought
to have reached 44m.
The sense of fellowship with their compatriots across the water has been a
great source of strength for the republican cause in Northern Ireland - and
a source of cash to arm the IRA terrorists. So the IRA's declaration of a
ceasefire and the prospects of peace are a matter of some importance to a
very large body of Americans.
In Boston's Emerald Society hall they are men of substance: large of girth,
loud of voice and confident of manner - the patrolmen, deputies, sheriffs
and constables of the Boston city police force.
They meet under an Irish flag at the front of the hall. A mural of the Irish
Dail decorates one wall, the blazons of Ulster, Leinster, Munster and
Connacht the other.
But when at the society's meeting this week Constable Tom Brown made his way
round the hall with copies of the US-published Irish Echo, the glow was
dimmed. It was not that anyone present was unhappy with news of the IRA
ceasefire but, if violence has come to a halt across the water, it has not
stopped in Boston. Some officers were still in the ceremonial kilts, spats
and argyll socks of the Boston Police's Gaelic Column, after the the funeral
of a slain Boston policeman, the third to be killed in as many weeks.
'We are absolutely sick of violence,' said Brown. 'We have seen too much of
it ourselves. It doesn't matter where policemen and innocent civilians are
being killed. It must be stopped in Ireland, and at any cost.'
Had Brown's views on the IRA been sounded out a decade ago his response, he
admits, would have been very different. For many years he has been a member
of Noraid, the Irish-American organisation responsible for much of the
funding of IRA activities. Still a Noraid member, he acknowledges that
Irish-American support for IRA violence has dwindled sharply, both
emotionally and financially, in the last two or three years.
Noraid, Brown says, now supports the ceasefire and will work for a
negotiated settlement. If the price of peace is the Irish Republic's
relinquishment of its territorial claim to Ulster, that, as far as Brown is
concerned, is acceptable. 'Compromise is what it is all about,' he affirms.
'Both sides are going to have to bend.'
The vast majority of policemen in the Emerald Society feel as Brown does -
they have as much fear as any Americans of growing levels of violence, and
no illusions as to its romance or benefits.
'I admit it, I was a Republican punk,' smiles policeman Dan Ring. 'I used to
be a member of the Charlestown (a Boston suburb) Liberation Army. The CLA
would go around spray-painting 'Kill the Brits' and persuading, more or less
politely, local residents to contribute to the cause. That's all over - I
grew up and became a cop. In 1992 I was on holiday in London when the IRA
Christmas bombing campaign began. I was worried for the bobbies, for
chrissake. Me, Irish Dan Ring] But a cop's a cop whoever and wherever he is.
I still believe in uniting Ireland, but not by the gun.'
If Irish-Americans have any hesitancy about the ceasefire, it is not
generally based on any clear appreciation of the complexities of
contemporary Irish economics or politics. They are instead felt at gut
level, and are old ingrained views inherited over generations from forbears
forced to emigrate from Ireland a century ago. Most reservations are
expressed, now as they were then, in terms of mistrust of British
intentions; as Americans the policemen of the Emerald Society freely admit
that they wholly fail to understand religious division within the same
ethnic community.
But, as Americans, they are quick to come up with a simple solution that is
neither political nor religious - most Emerald Society policemen believe,
perhaps rightly, that a quick, large fix of money would do wonders for the
old country.
'Ireland needs money, but it shouldn't come from the US tax-payer's pocket,'
said 'Dapper' O'Neil, the conservative Tammany Hall-style Boston city
councillor who, as the city's chairman of the committee on public safety,
had come to address the Emerald Society after the funeral. 'We've got too
many problems here and too many social programmes that are ruining the
country.'
Affirmative Action, the social programme that gives a head-start to
disadvantaged minorities in the US, is not the way to go in Northern
Ireland, Emerald Society members believe. They have seen it create too much
bitterness against blacks in their own community. Nor is any other social
aid programme likely to succeed. Instead, it is good old-fashioned private
enterprise and investment that they believe offers Ulster its greatest
chance.
'Look at the thousands of Americans who visit the Republic every year',
notes policeman Jack Sheridan. 'Bill Clinton can't change Ireland. What will
change Ireland is if there is a peace long enough to bring tourism,
investment, jobs and prosperity.'
Miles away, in downtown Boston, Irish-American businessmen seem to agree. At
the Irish-American Partnership, a non-sectarian organisation claiming 7,500
US members and promoting employment and economic growth on both sides of the
Irish border, Joseph Leary speaks enthusiastically of the 375 US company
subsidiaries based in the Irish Republic; less than 40, on the other hand,
are to be found in Ulster. That imbalance would change radically, he feels,
if a stable political environment developed in the future.
Will it? Most Irish Americans, given the enchantment lent by distance,
believe some sort of point-of-no-return has been crossed. But the biggest
problem, in former Charlestown Liberation Army policeman Dan Ring's view, is
not international negotiation, US funding or British recalcitrance or any
other external factor. 'It's the Irish themselves. I should know. We hate to
give way. We are the stubbornest bastards in the world.'

FT  10 SEP 94 / The windmills of your mind: The Nature of Things
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is it about drugs that allow them to alter the workings of the mind,
manipulating moods and perceptions, lifting depression, even enhancing
memory?
According to neuroscientists, these mental phenomena result from the
electrical activity in the circuits of the neural computer between our ears.
How then, do drugs cause selective changes in the activity in these
circuits? What gives the neural computer its chemical dimension?
These questions have been thrown into sharp relief by the reported deaths of
night club revellers, thought to be caused by the drug Ecstasy. And although
neuroscientists can answer them, and can even explain why Ecstasy has such
dangerous side-effects, it is still impossible to predict either the
efficacy or the side- effects of new drugs.
The chemical dimension of neural activity starts from the fact that the
electrical currents in neurones (nerve cells) are carried not by electrons,
as in a computer, but by ions (electrically charged particles produced when
salts dissolve in water).
Ions carry electric current much less efficiently than electrons because
they are bigger and heavier, but they have the advantage that ionic currents
can be switched on and off by chemical switches.
The brain compensates for the inefficiency of ions as current carriers by
using the same technique as modern communication engineers, digital
transmission. Information is coded and transmitted by neurones in the form
of a stream of identical pulses, called action potentials.
Action potentials are electrical pulses controlled by chemical switches. The
chemical switches are operated by changes in voltage (voltage-gated). The
action potential travels down a neurone by operating the voltage-gated
switches just ahead of it, and 'switching on' an action potential there,
which then repeats the process. This is exactly the way that relays enable
man-made cables to transmit long distances without losing signal strength.
Drugs that impair the actions of the switches can suppress the transmission
of information. This is how some nerve poisons, such as tetrodotoxin which
is secreted by the Japanese puffer fish, and anaesthetics work.
Any drug that acts on the voltage-gated switches that control the action
potential will affect the whole brain. To affect our moods a drug must
modulate the activity of different brain circuits selectively. It must act
on a process that works differently in brain circuits controlling different
functions.
The synapse, which is the device that transmits information between
neurones, is a promising target for selective drug action. When an action
potential arrives at a synapse, it releases a minute quantity of a chemical
called a neurotransmitter. The neurotransmitter acts on the next cell in the
chain by reacting with a special molecule, a receptor, to operate a chemical
switch and turn an ionic current on or off.
There are many different neurotransmitters, and each may act on several
different types of receptor. Different brain circuits differ in the
transmitters they use. The same transmitter may also differ from circuit to
circuit. This gives drug designers an opportunity to devise chemicals that
will have very specific effects on the brain.
Chemicals that influence the interactions of neurotransmitters with their
receptors, for example by altering the amount of transmitter released or the
duration of its interaction with the receptor, have the potential to alter
the operation of specific brain circuits. This is the way drugs alter the
workings of the mind.
Drugs can also affect the function of other brain circuits, and of cells
throughout the whole body, causing side-effects.
Unfortunately there is much, not only about transmitters, receptors and
brain circuitry, but also about general physiology that is not understood.
It is impossible to predict the effect of new drugs either on the body or on
the brain. Potential drugs still have to be identified by trial and error,
and rigorously tested for safety.
Ecstasy is the classic case of a drug with a wide range of effects. It acts
by suddenly increasing the release of the neurotransmitter Serotonin, which
is used by neurones in circuits controlling mood, particularly reactions to
unpleasant stimuli. Serotonin is also associated with the brain circuits
that control body temperature, and those that select which of the millions
of sensory signals available at any one time we attend to.
Ecstasy's popularity as a dance drug stems partly from its effect on mood,
but also from the fact that serotonin shuts out unpleasant sensory signals
caused by thirst and high body temperature. It enables people to dance until
they collapse from heatstroke.
Tragically, this effect of serotonin is compounded by the way it acts
outside the brain. It causes massive and widespread blood-clotting, which
could be fatal even in people not suffering from heatstroke.
Thus Ecstasy (3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine), which was originally
patented for use as an appetite suppressant, is an object-lesson in the
difficulties that face the pharmaceutical industry in their search for new
drugs.

FT  10 SEP 94 / How to Spend It: Starck naked and simply stylish - A bidet
based on the design of a bucket, and a bath costing more than Pounds 4,300
are part of a new collection admired by Lucia van der Post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There seems no end to the inventiveness of Philippe Starck. He is, for those
whose minds have been on higher things these last many years, the famously
shabby and cuddly Frenchman who speaks English with a Peter Sellers French
accent and who made a lavatory (the one with mirrors in the Cafe Costes in
the Place des Innocents) one of the most visited sites in Paris.
He is, just in case that has not made it clear, a designer. Or rather he is
what most of us would call a designer but he, in his playful, provocative
way denies it hotly. He is, he insists, a political activist, a radical
changer of the way people live.
Be that as it may, the man who gave us the ultimate lavatory brush, the most
expensive lemon squeezer in the world, the most eccentric kettle and the
most uncomfortable chairs in Paris is in designing mode again and this time
he has turned his attention to bathrooms.
As you can see from the photographs, he has managed, as with almost
everything he touches, to give the standard components that we all know and
use, baths, basins, lavatories and bidets, a fresh look. It is a look that,
alas, comes with a hefty price tag - but being at the cutting edge of design
never did come cheap.
Commissioned by Duravit, a German manufacturing company, to produce his own
vision of contemporary bath-ware, Philippe Starck went back to basics. How,
he asked himself, did early man wash and keep himself clean? He would scoop
water from streams and lakes by cupping his hands.
Later, as he provided himself with a few comforts and artefacts, he built
round washing bowls (all those heavily decorated Victorian bowls were almost
all perfectly round) based on the simple round shape of cupped hands.
Water in primitive communities was (and sometimes still is) collected by
hand-pump and he has used this shape as the inspiration for the wash-basin
mixer.
The lavatory and bidet are based on old buckets. The bath, a simple
free-standing oval, is modelled from the old-fashioned tub, rather like the
ones we see in old Westerns or nostalgic photographic essays of vanished
working-class life.
But do not be fooled by this artless vision - the inspiration may go back to
early Arcadian days but the technology, of course, is white-hot new. The
lavatory, for instance, in true eco-chic style, flushes properly with only
six litres of water - most, it seems, need nine and even the newer more
conservation-conscious models need 7 1/2 .
The manufacturers are excited by the tap on the basin. This is based on the
lever action of the hand-pump which means flow and temperature can be
operated with one-hand but it required the development of a new small
mechanism to make it work efficiently.
The bath, too, sitting serenely in the middle of the room, required some new
technology to enable the taps to fit neatly on to its rim. For those who
like their baths to do fancy things it is possible to have Venturi massage
jets, an air injection system or a combination of the two.
The bath itself is made from reinforced acrylic, the rest of the equipment
from ceramic, but where wood is used (as in the basin with cupboards below)
it has a pearwood veneer and a black melamine interior.
What appeals to me is the simplicity of the aesthetic - it is cool, clean,
tranquil, with nothing pushy or aggressive to disturb the eye. When properly
installed not a vestige of plumbing is to be seen.
Yet it is clearly practical - for instance, around the oval bath runs a
polished chrome rail so that a towel or even clothes are always at hand.
For those whose notions of a proper bath include the possibility of drinking
the odd glass of champagne, there is a broad ledge.
If you like to buy a bathroom as a package, there is a range of accessories
 -everything from simple hooks and a sleek toothbrush holder, to towel
rails, lavatory paper holders and a mirror.
The collection, as I have already intimated, is not cheap. The bath, being
the most innovative technically and, of course, the largest piece of
equipment, is the most expensive at Pounds 4,361.60.
The floor-standing (there are also wall-mounted versions) bidet and lavatory
together are Pounds 1,024. The wash-basin is Pounds 529.93 and there is a
shower tray at Pounds 1,314.82.
The complete range can be seen at CP Hart, Newnham Terrace, Hercules Road,
London SE1 7DR. The range is new and is available to order only - currently
the waiting time is 12 weeks but CP Hart hopes to get this down to more like
six weeks shortly.
Later in the year it will also be available from other bathroom suppliers.

Cobra &amp; Bellamy has always been one of those small London shops that had a
reputation and an influence out of all proportion to its size.
Its two partners and owners, Veronica Manussis and Tania Hunter, have had a
way of sensing the mood of a moment almost before it arrived and offering a
growing band of aficionados the jewellery they did not know they wanted
until they saw it.
On Monday there is a big milestone in the development of the company - it
opens a large and lavish new branch in the newly glamorised Dickins &amp; Jones
store in London's Regent Street and it launches its first ever mail order
brochure.
For those unfamiliar with Cobra &amp; Bellamy, it started by selling period
costume jewellery, then moved on to popularising Art Deco pieces.
Today it still sells Art Deco inspired pieces but it is better known for an
interesting partnership with the Italian jewellery designer Barbara
Bertagnolli, who designs intricately interesting pieces for them in 24-carat
gold with richly coloured gemstones.
Their glass-based strings of pearls, using original 1920s and 1930s clasps,
are always a huge success with those who cannot afford the real thing.
Now, with the new shop to supply and mail order customers to keep happy,
Manussis and Hunter have introduced a special Cobra &amp; Bellamy line of their
own, mostly very well-priced, very strong and simple pieces in either
hallmarked silver or 22-carat gold-plated silver. Amber is a big new
development, too.
For chaps there are some elegant cufflinks and retro watches sell between a
very reasonably-priced Pounds 26 and Pounds 37 (but hurry, each Friday's
consignment sells out before the following Friday).
For a mail-order brochure ring 071-730 9993. It costs Pounds 5 which is
refundable on the first Pounds 50 order.
Otherwise visit the shops either in Dickins &amp; Jones or the original branch
at 149 Sloane Street, London, SW1X 9BZ.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Fashion: The long, hard road to a couturier's heart - It's
tough if you are a textile artist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Textile artists are the unsung heroes of fashion - vital to the finished
product, yet often unknown and unacknowledged.
One has only to remember Paul Poiret's orientalism, for instance, which owed
much to Raoul Duffy's painterly depictions of the Levant on cloth, and Keith
Haring's graffiti, lifted straight from a Bronx subway which lent street
credibility to Vivienne Westwood's sportswear.
But for the would-be supplier of textiles to the Parisian fashion houses the
road is long and hard.
The back door of most Parisian couture houses is fiercely guarded by a
manutentionaire or storekeeper, typically a woman with a Napoleon complex
who will fob off any hopeful talent with a sharp, 'We have our suppliers.'
If you do not happen to be French the rebuff will be even more crushing.
In the 1960s, when the Azzarios, textile suppliers from Italy, approached
the couture houses, they sensibly hid their origins behind the name
'Nattier', taken from the French painter whose favourite blue was a mainstay
in their collection.
They introduced their cardboard-stiff triple gabardine to Courreges,
enabling him to carve his board-flat, space-age tunics. Without this French
pseudonym, Courreges would probably never even have looked at their new
fabric.
Zika Ascher, a Czechoslovakian Jew who mixed mohair with nylon to give it
stability and create new textural possibilities, became so desperate that he
introduced himself to the world of couture by pushing fabric samples through
the open window of Christian Dior's car.
Sabina Fay Braxton, a 30-year-old Englishwoman, is the couture world's
latest textile darling, but it took her three years to wheedle her way in.
Her 'vintage' effects on modern fabrics, be it medieval alto-basso
(varyingly cut) velvets, early 18th century Venetian and Lyon 'Bazaar'
prints, or a pastiche of a Gericault equestrian scene, have been seized on
by couturiers because of their passing resemblance to rich embroideries, at
a third of the price.
Braxton grew up in the Middle and Far East. Her mother was a painter and her
father a writer and collector of ethnic costumes. She studied film and
costume design in Nice and, while helping to restore a medieval hunting
lodge in the south of France and the Provencal house of a Renaissance and
Baroque art collector, she created mock-period fabrics for both.
In 1990 she began supplying Christian Lacroix and, later, Emanuel Ungaro,
Olivier Lapidus, Louis Feraud and Chanel in Paris, and Bill Blass in New
York with her shimmeringly ornate renditions of historical fabrics.
Indeed, she almost single-handedly diverted Ungaro from splashy, bright,
geometric prints to muted and layered chiffons and velvets which evoke the
Levantine concubines in Tales of Hoffman.
Her signature is gaufrage or embossed velvets. The deep pile is stamped
under heat with carved wooden blocks, invariably with silver or gold-leaf or
bronze filings to accentuate the motif.
The result is embellished with paint to give it the appearance of a
splinter-cracked fresco that has been scattered with moondust.
Christian Lacroix spotted Braxton's patinated velvets in Verseta, an
interior design shop in Paris, and saw their potential at once. But Braxton
had never intended to work in high fashion: 'I never thought there would be
any money in it, for some of my fabrics cost up to FFr4,000 (about Pounds
480) a metre and much more for a one-off piece which is more like a
painting.' However, it was too good a chance to miss.
Together with Lesage, the master embroiderer, Lacroix and Braxton
collaborated to create the most successful jacket of his spring and summer
1991 couture collection: a Chinese-yellow velvet embossed with a silver-leaf
motif made up of griffins and gazelles, Byzantine squares, ultra-modern
cubist flowers and a Moorish tile pattern.
One would imagine that her path into haute couture was then assured but, in
spite of congratulatory telephone calls from Lesage, the manutentionaires at
Jean-Louis Scherrer were as obstinate as ever.
'They don't want to see anyone new . . . they wield a weird sort of power
and if you can't get passed them you're sunk.' But Braxton persisted and was
eventually granted an audience. Scherrer ordered immediately.
Many couturiers live rather like renaissance princes, isolated from daily
trivialities. A couturier's brief is passed down the line, like a Chinese
whisper, from maestro to studio director to supplier, so it is not
surprising that the end result is either vague, or distorted.
At Ungaro, Braxton's brief was that the couturier was interested in
'patterns like a Persian miniature with striped borders'. That was it. No
colour, motif, size or fabric instructions. And all to be delivered in 24
hours. 'Fortunately, I was very familiar with these miniatures from my
childhood, so I went ahead,' she recounts.
The studio is based in a quiet side street of the 14th arrondissement where,
surrounded by paint pots, carved blocks and art books, Braxton conjures new
processes. Her latest inventions are photo-printed suedes and fake furs
embossed with tracery. Some of her specialist pieces can take as many as 120
hours a metre to create.
What is maddening is that couture studios may prevaricate for weeks, holding
on to a precious sample and then at the last minute rejecting it or, worse,
ordering several metres for a couture show in a few days' time. To survive
as a handmaid to French couture it pays to be unflappable and to require
just snatches of sleep.
Her insight into couture has led her to question its time-consuming methods:
often the same effect could also be achieved by printing or using a machine,
but the kudos of 'hand-made' means they often insist on unnecessary and
expensive handwork.
Braxton has used her partnership with couture as a means of promoting her
own range of accessory clothing to be launched in September. It will be sold
in department stores and boutiques in London and New York.
It includes scarves, stoles, waistcoats, body suits and loose tunics and
pants for women, and waistcoats, ties, scarves and handkerchiefs for men.
She will also offer a small range of embossed leather accessories. Prices
start at Pounds 20.
They will be on sale in Harrods of Knightsbridge, London SW1 in time for
Christmas and in the US at Barneys, Bergdoff Goodman, Neiman Marcus and I.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Fashion: Suit yourself carefully in your first job - A sober
working environment is simply no place for making fashion statements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATH BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You have landed your first job. Day one in the office looms. Your wardrobe
seems to consist of little more than jeans and sweatshirts. What on earth do
you do?
No matter how fashionable you may be in your private life the sad truth is
that if you are starting work in a sober city or business environment it is
not a time for fashion statements.
Greys, blacks and blues set the tone in business and conservative suits rule
the day. No, this is not some youthful homage to prime minister John Major
but the realities of the need for no- fuss, simple clothing on the first
rung of the career ladder. Simplicity is the key and a crisp, efficient
appearance will compensate for fashion fripperies and style statements.
'If you're serious about your first job you do not wear clothes that will
attract too much attention,' says Stephen Ibrahim, men's tailoring expert at
Simpsons of Piccadilly.
Flashy shows of individuality would create the wrong impression to those
higher up as well as to your peers and perhaps promote resentment.
Few companies issue strict guidelines but most expect an unwritten dress
code to be followed. The more successful you become the more flamboyant and
noticeable your clothes are allowed to be. Bold chalk stripes and vivid pink
shirts are not for the new boy on the block. Expensive Chanel earrings and
flame-red suits are reserved for high-flying women who have made it already.
The golden rule is: do not dress above your station. Brassy shows of
aspiration are considered vulgar (although the older hands are excused).
Your work must seem to come first, not your image.
Even Lowri Turner, an outspoken television fashion critic, advocates the
subdued look for that first, probationary year - 'neither too severe nor too
sexy', says she, who has progressed from a raincoat and pumps to her current
dressed-for-success image in spiky Manolo Blahnik heels and Calvin Klein
suit. 'But there is no need to look boring,' says Turner. 'We all want to
look good.' And this can be done if the style is kept subdued.
One tip, if a restricted dress code operates, is to spend as much as you can
afford on your first sober suit. Good cut and fabric really matter - they
last longer and look better.
Susie Faux, who has built a name as the working woman's sartorial
psychologist, and is the owner of Wardrobe, a fashion consultancy, feels
strongly that the most important thing is to 'love your suit' - not only
will you be seeing a lot of it but this will give you tremendous
confidence'.
Although all this may seem a bit like reverting to school uniform, it is not
as grim as it sounds - and there is no need to look dowdy.
Just as chaps should avoid, at least to begin with, shirts with stripes, so
women should beware of loudly-striped suits. At the next stage of your
career, you could introduce stripes as well as bold, colourful ties and, for
women, scarves and more expensive jewellery.
Grey outfits often look better than navy. Inexpensive navy clothes often
tend to become shiny more quickly. Remember this suit should take you from
your first interview to your first pay rise.
For men's suits, medium 13oz hard-wearing hopsack is best. Single-breasted,
three-buttoned jackets can introduce an acceptable fashion element and
flat-fronted trousers are flattering to a youthful frame. If you prefer
double-breasted jackets choose the traditional six-button/two-fastening
combination, which is more classic than the continental-style
single-fastening as this can hint at a wide-boy, 1980s-salesman, style.
Women's suits, although they should be dark, can be more adventurous with
fabric, textures and weave. If you cannot afford a really good suit, try and
spend as much as you can on a quality jacket and team it with a cheaper
black skirt or some good chain-store trousers (Marks and Spencer usually has
excellent ones). Skirts should not be too short and, in most city offices
long ones are frowned upon. The best length for the moment is a couple of
inches above the knee.
A mid-sized heel is good for women's shoes which must have the minimum of
detailing. For the men, Lowri Turner thinks they should invest in one pair
of well-made shoes. 'A good pair of Church's will see you through to
promotion and beyond.' Plain brogues or Oxfords seem to be the only choices
 -certainly no loafers and, of course, they should, above all, be
immaculately clean.
Once you have chosen your suit, think about your appearance. Clean-cut and
groomed is how employers prefer it. Susie Faux thinks a good hair cut is
where it all begins and advocates regular manicures for both men and women.
When it comes to make-up she thankfully excludes men but believes women must
use the right amount: 'Not too much - but they must use some.'
Soon the days of the first and only suit will be behind you as you head for
the Versace ties and your skirt can be as sexy as you like. After all, when
you are the boss, anything goes.
To find affordable ranges of 'first suits' for men and women it is worth
looking at smaller department stores, such as Kendal Milne in Manchester or
Dickins &amp; Jones in London, and specialist shops, such as the Norton Barrie
chain of shops in Northern England (mainly men) or, if you can persuade a
parent or godparent to fund it, Wardrobe in Brook Street, London, W1.
For a slightly less attentive service, but with suits that are good value,
chain stores Next, M&amp;S and Principles have intermittently excellent ranges
while on the slightly more expensive side Jaeger, Austin Reed, Hackett and
Daks Simpsons offer mid-range suits that are true investments in your
career.
Other shops to check out are Jigsaw, Whistles and Selfridges and Dorothy
Perkins which has invested heavily in upgrading the design content without
pushing up the prices.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Should we insure for old age? - More
people are living longer. Bethan Hutton explores the case for compulsory
cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insurance to pay for the cost of care in old age could become compulsory,
according to A Crisis in Care?, a report published this week by the Family
Policy Studies Centre and the Centre for Policy on Ageing.
It says longer life spans will lead to much larger numbers of very old
people, a possible 40 per cent increase in dementia cases by the year 2020,
and a much smaller proportion of working people to pay for the older
generation's care.
According to the report, traditional patterns of care are changing, too. At
the moment, family members - mainly middle-aged female relatives - provide
more than two-thirds of care for the elderly.
Already, though, the number of women aged 45-69 for each person over 70 in
Europe has fallen from 2.4 in 1960 to 1.6 now, and will drop much further.
Higher divorce rates and more working women also will reduce the number of
potential carers.
Perhaps surprisingly, the report found that an increasing number of elderly
people expressed a preference for professional rather than family care. But
it notes: 'Despite the evidence that the family may not be there to care for
Europe's ageing population, member states are increasingly stressing family
care over state care.'
One possible exception is Germany, which recently introduced a compulsory
insurance scheme under which employers and staff share a 1 per cent tax on
gross earnings to pay for long-term care. Francis McGlone, one of the
report's authors, says: 'Germany's new legislation . . . is something we
should consider. It would not only meet the financial cost of long-term
care, but would also help to ensure that older people no longer became
dependent on their families or means-tested benefits.'
In the UK, the state health-care system no longer covers care of the elderly
automatically. Anyone with assets of more than Pounds 8,000 has to meet the
full cost of their own care. And although private insurance to cover
long-term care has been available in the UK for several years, only a few
thousand policies have been sold.
The cost can be a deterrent, particularly as the people most likely to
consider long-term care insurance are around retirement age. For a man aged
65, wanting cover for nursing home fees of Pounds 300 a week, PPP Lifetime
charges Pounds 117 a month for its most comprehensive policy. Alternatively,
it would cost another Pounds 39 for a top-up policy to cover a Pounds 100
weekly short-fall between pension income and nursing home fees.
Unlike private medical insurance, there are no automatic age-related
increases once the policy is in force. But premiums usually can be reviewed
at any time if the insurance company finds claim levels are greater than it
expected.
PPP has just introduced a guarantee promising that premium and benefit
levels will not be altered for the first 10 years, no matter what the claims
experience turns out to be. Commercial Union, the other main provider of
long-term care insurance, offers a five-year guarantee.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Short and sweet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BAYLISS, Moneyfacts
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Because of recent speculation about possible base rate increases, investors
have become wary of buying into long-term, fixed-rate products. Building
societies have responded by offering much more attractive short-term
investments.
Halifax raised its Guaranteed Reserve fixed rates by half a percentage point
on average last week. New three-year fixed products were introduced this
week by Northern Rock, Dunfermline and Coventry.
Dunfermline has launched a three-year Caledonia bond to coincide with its
move to a new head office. It pays 8 per cent gross on Pounds 5,000 and
above. Northern Rock, which issued its new three-year fixed account earlier
in the week at 8.75 per cent from Pounds 2,500, has been leapfrogged by
Coventry, which is paying 8.80 per cent on Pounds 5,000 with a monthly
option at 8.45 per cent.
Escalator bonds continue to flourish. Barclays has launched its own version,
with rates starting at 6 per cent for the first year and rising to 12 in the
fifth. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.
The market leader, however, is the new Step-Up bond from Portman. On a
minimum balance of only Pounds 500, it pays yearly interest of 7 per cent in
year one, rising to 8 in year two, 9 in year three, 10 in year four and 12
in year five.
Halifax International in Jersey has increased all rates on its Fixed Rate
International account by up to 1.1 percentage points, making it the offshore
market leader in terms of one to five years. The highest rate now available
is 8.7 per cent annually for five years on Pounds 50,000.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: When life is a lottery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have several thousand pounds worth of National Savings premium bonds as
well as a few hundred pounds worth of prize bonds issued by the Prize Bond
company of Dublin.
I like the idea of having a cash deposit linked to a regular, lottery-like
chance of winning large cash prizes - and tax-free at that.
Are there are any other countries with reliable economies and currencies
(such as Germany, the US, Canada, Australia and Switzerland) that issue
similar 'lottery bonds'?
As far as we are aware, the National Savings premium bonds in the UK and the
prize bonds issued by the Republic of Ireland are the only type of deposit
schemes which link you to a regular possibility of receiving tax-free cash
prizes.
Of course, simple lotteries are well established in many countries and,
indeed, one is soon to begin in the United Kingdom. They depend, however, on
buying tickets and your stake is lost rather than deposited. (Answer by
Murray Johnstone Personal Asset Management).

FT  10 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: An unexpected bill for extra tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I recently sold some insurance bonds (a mix of managed and international
units) bought some years ago for a useful capital gain.
I declared this gain on my tax return but, in his wisdom, my accountant
decided that the sale should be declared under 'all other income or profits'
as a 'chargeable event'.
The Inland Revenue has now added the full amount of the profit realised on
the sale to my taxable income and requested payment at the 40 per cent rate.
As a result, I am now faced with an addition to my tax approaching Pounds
2,000 instead of enjoying what I expected to be a tax-free gain.
The bonds - from which I have drawn no income - are, in effect, an
investment in unit trusts and, to my mind, should be treated as such for
capital gains tax purposes.
Are my accountant and the Revenue correct, or do I have a case?
When you say that you 'sold some insurance bonds', we take it that what
actually happened was that you surrendered a unit-linked, single-premium
life assurance policy, or perhaps more than one such policy.
That being so (and assuming that no top-slicing relief is available under
section 550 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, which we cannot
tell from the limited data), the gain will be taxable at 15 per cent by
virtue of section 547 (5) of the Taxes Act.
Only your accountant has enough precise background facts, figures and dates
to say exactly what your tax bill should be.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Inside the world of the money
hunters - If divorce looks inevitable, some people call for their lawyers
first - and a forensic accountant next. Barbara Ellis examines their role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lawyers are usually the first professionals to be called in by a divorcing
couple but, in some instances, forensic accountants - who carry out
specialised work for court cases - may be consulted almost as quickly.
Indeed, clients - particularly those involved in divorce actions - often put
lawyers under pressure to bring in a forensic accountant, according to
Pauline Walker, a family law specialist with London solicitor Baileys, Shaw
&amp; Gillett.
'It was awfully fashionable in the late '80s,' she says, 'but not so much
now, though. This is partly because the courts have come down heavily on
spending large sums of money on investigations.' Walker adds that most wives
and husbands with business interests will always accuse the other partner of
having money secretly tucked away.
She cautions, however: 'Little chunks of Pounds 3,000 or Pounds 4,000 don't
matter. With forensic accountants on the same rates as central London
lawyers, you need to be finding Pounds 50,000 or Pounds 100,000 to make an
investigation worthwhile.'
Accountants see their main work in divorce cases as injecting some detached
financial objectivity into what can be an emotional minefield.
In practical terms, this usually means running a check on the affidavit of
means sworn by each party in the divorce (these are used as the basis of the
financial settlement).
Chartered accountant Peter Lobbenberg, a specialist in the forensic side,
says about 75 per cent of the divorce cases with which he deals involve
women tracking down a husband's money, and 25 per cent men defending
themselves - 'probably because a man usually has his own accountant and
financial set-up'.
Among the typical questions the accountant is asked, Lobbenberg cites:
How much is my husband worth?
Where has he hidden it?
How can he raise the money?
How much does my wife really need?
Checking past life-style against declared income is routine. Lobbenberg says
it is probably easier for a sole trader or individual to hide assets than
for someone owning a company, but easiest for someone in a cash business.
'Sometimes,' he adds, 'part of my responsibility is having to tell
over-optimistic clients either that the crock of gold at the end of the
rainbow doesn't exist or that the chances of finding it won't justify the
cost.'
Lobbenberg charges Pounds 200 an hour plus value added tax, and says his
cases are typically in the Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 3,000 fee range (although
some end up in five figures while others are much lower).
In common with other accountants in this field, he has a computer programme
and a standard charge of Pounds 400 plus VAT for so-called Duxbury
calculations. These are based on the 1987 case of Duxbury v Duxbury when the
former wife of a millionaire was awarded sufficient income to satisfy her
reasonable requirements, but also take into account the amount of income to
be received each year, inflation, tax rates and allowances.
Many City accountants charge around Pounds 200 an hour for their services.
At Touche Ross, Mike Barford estimates that divorce makes up about 5 or 10
per cent of the work of the forensic department. He says many divorce cases
would involve total accounting costs of between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds
5,000, although the bill would be greater for a case that was large or
complicated.
Touche Ross charges Pounds 300 for its Duxbury programme, but Barford points
out that this is used less often now that lawyers have access to handbooks
detailing the same information.
Barford says divorce candidates sometimes overlook the importance of taking
care over the affidavit of means. 'People are feeling very bitter and
emotional and, if one party misses things out, there is often a tendency for
the other to assume it is deliberate.'
Another aspect of divorce cases often misunderstood is what a court can
award. 'Matrimonial cases are different from other litigation because the
judge can split only the assets there are,' says Barford. 'A judge will
never say the husband has behaved appallingly so he has to find the money.'
Costs run up by each side will deplete the amount available to be split.
Barford recalls a case where one party was convinced that the other was
extremely wealthy. 'By the time it was discovered he was not, over half the
joint assets had been spent on the investigation.'
Barford adds: 'If the husband is hugely wealthy, the award to the wife will
broadly be based on her life-style. If she has been used to spending Pounds
100,000 and that is well within his capacity, then, broadly speaking, that
is what she will get.
'If he declares Pounds 10m and the wife says he is lying and that he has
Pounds 20m, it doesn't matter. If there are more assets than are needed to
pay the wife, you don't need to investigate.'
On the other hand, Barford stresses there is no point in spending money to
prove that someone is used to a certain life-style if there are no assets
left to maintain it.
As he explains: 'A typical situation might be the wife of a Lloyd's Name who
has led an expansive life-style and might feel entitled to it. But
circumstances have changed. He is about to go bust and there is simply not
the money available. You can only have what there is.'

FT  10 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Thumbs up for disclosure - More
insurers are accepting the new rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are signs that life companies are beginning to accept, however
reluctantly, that they should introduce the new disclosure rules for the
financial services industry before January 1 - the mandatory deadline for
the first tranche of changes. All of them must be in place by June.
The rules, which require sales agents to provide customers with more
information about products and charges, have been resisted fiercely by the
industry but are now seen as inevitable.
The TSB group has just become the first mass market life insurer to announce
that it will introduce the full system from November 1. Until then,
Equitable Life had been the only life insurer to break ranks and implement
the rules ahead of deadline.
Now Scottish Widows, a mutual life insurer, plans to join in. Over the
autumn, it will introduce disclosure for one product range at a time. The
first, probably from October, is likely to be a mortgage endowment policy
with critical illness cover.
The TSB announcement is particularly significant because it is accompanied
by other changes which also will affect customers who go to the bank for
financial services. First, financial services staff who have been paid
commission only will get a mix of commission and salary. John Elbourne,
TSB's head of retail banking, says this shift will be accompanied by an
integration of the bank and financial services staff into a single sales
force divided into four tiers.
Staff at the first level will be paid a basic salary of Pounds 9,000 to
Pounds 9,500 while those at the most highly-qualified level - who will be
able to advise on anything from personal pensions to offshore funds - will
get a basic Pounds 17,000 to Pounds 25,000. Only staff at the top two levels
will be authorised to sell financial services products.
Beyond the salaries, there will be bonuses for branches which meet certain
customer service standards and attain certain sales' levels. Individual
bonuses also will be paid for staff who sell more than a certain figure over
a quarter.
Although payment by commission has been attacked widely as encouraging sales
of inappropriate products, Elbourne denies that customers would have been
sold unsuitable policies by staff because of the existing pay arrangements.
He says the alteration in pay structures will not make much difference to
the figures provided to customers in terms of the incentive to sell and the
charges which must be disclosed.
In a further shift, TSB is to introduce new product ranges, also to coincide
with the start of its financial year at the beginning of November. The
emphasis will be on making them simple and straightforward, and one
possibility would be a move towards 'unbundling' - the separation into two
distinct, but complementary, products of the protection and investment
elements that make up packaged life insurance products.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of the Rank Organisation, the leisure giant, are not among the
most active traders on the market but James Daly, director of the television
and film division, has sold almost two-thirds of his stake at a price of
424p.
Brandon Hire rents out all manner of tools and equipment, ranging from power
tools to marquees. The share price has been an outstanding performer over
the past year, growing from about 28p some 18 months ago to trade now around
77p.
Brian Nathan, the chairman, is one of the largest shareholders with a stake
of more than 14 per cent. His recent sale of 39,000 shares at 80p must
represent a little profit taking.
Keith Carnelly, the chairman and chief executive of Polar, an electronics
outfit, is another director with a considerable stake in his company. His
recent sale of 50,000 shares still leaves him with a holding of more than
3m.
By the end of August, we had recorded a ratio of 3.5 buys to every sell over
the course of the month.
The figure for July was 4.2 buys for every sale, suggesting there has been
some slow-down in directors' enthusiasm for the market.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Time, gents - to invest - Bethan
Hutton drinks in the news of a trust aimed at breweries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One well-known brewer calls its product 'amber nectar' - and, to drinkers
the world over, that describes beer perfectly. But actually putting money
where their mouths are, and buying into a brewery, is something else.
Now, though, one sober City firm is offering small investors an easy way to
do just that. Lazard Investors believes the UK's regional brewing companies
are set to prosper. So, it has taken the unusual step of launching an
investment trust to specialise in these, along with pub companies and others
producing or selling drinks. It aims to raise at least Pounds 50m from
individuals and institutions.
The trust is to be managed by Billy Whitbread, a member of the brewing
family and formerly manager of the Whitbread Investment Company, a trust set
up to hold shares mainly in regional brewers. It was bought back by the
parent company at the end of last year.
The Lazard trust will invest mostly in regional brewers listed on the main
London Stock Exchange - such as Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley, Marston Thompson and
Mansfield Brewery - and will look also at companies on the Unlisted
Securities Market and elsewhere.
At the start, it might buy shares in the large national brewers as well; but
as opportunities arise to invest in the smaller companies, shares in the big
ones will be sold. Investment of small amounts in unquoted and overseas
companies which fit the trust's criteria will be considered, too.
Analyst Martin Hawkins, of Greig Middleton, says the one-time trend for
shares in the regional brewers to trade at a premium to the market has been
absent since 1990. This is because brewing companies generally have not been
popular with investors after the industry shake-up caused by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
Hawkins adds, however: 'With a more favourable trading outlook now for the
regional brewer than has been evident for some time, we feel that this
prolonged period of discount to the market is likely to be nearing an end.'
Most of the regional brewers concentrate on producing beers with a strong
local following rather than developing national brands. Recent government
rules forcing the large national brewers to allow their tied pubs to stock
'guest beers' have helped the smaller regional brewers, too.
The proportion of beer drunk at home has been increasing for some time and,
initially, this favoured the mainstream beers and lagers stocked by
supermarkets. But the growing popularity of bottled traditional English
beers means that a variety of brands is now stocked by many of the main
off-licence and supermarket chains - which also is good news for the
regionals.
Any fund which invests in such a narrow range of companies has a higher risk
profile than more diversified funds. But Whitbread says brewing shares
actually are comparatively low risk as the sector is less volatile than many
others. He adds, however, that the trust is really suitable only for
shareholders with a relatively large and diversified portfolio.
One drawback for small investors who choose to invest in brewers via a trust
is that only direct shareholders are entitled to the perks offered by some
of the companies. Burtonwood Brewery, for example, gives shareholders
discount vouchers for bar snacks and meals at its pubs. The Vaux Group also
offers discounts on meals, drinks and accommodation and provides a buffet
lunch at its annual general meeting, while Greene King shareholders can get
discounts on cases of fine wine.
In a similarly alcoholic vein, Neill Clerk Capital is looking for up to
Pounds 3m for three new companies being set up under the enterprise
investment scheme (EIS), successor to the business expansion scheme. The
Unchained Growth Pub Companies I to III will buy pubs in and around London
to be managed by the recently floated Regent Inns group, which itself is a
former BES company.
The scheme offers investors a limited guarantee which promises that if,
after five years, the asset value of the Pounds 1 shares has not grown to at
least Pounds 1.40, Regent Inns will contribute up to 40p a share to make
them up to that level.
Losses on EIS schemes can be offset against tax and individuals, who can
invest up to Pounds 100,000 in EIS companies each year, are entitled to 20
per cent tax relief on the initial investment. Minimum investment in
Unchained Growth is Pounds 500.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: P&amp;O profits from cruising - The Week
Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY: Dalgety is expected to produce a modest increase in pre-tax profits
for the year to June, from Pounds 112.2m to about Pounds 121m. But the
result will be essentially flat, excluding gains a year earlier. Progress in
food ingredients and animal feeds will be offset by flat results from
consumer businesses such as snacks, sauce and pet foods. Dividend for the
year should be up 2 per cent to 21p.
TUESDAY: Half-time results from Caradon, the building products and printing
group, are expected to produce profits in a range of Pounds 85-100m against
a stripped-out Pounds 59.5m last time. Earnings are forecast at 9p, with the
dividend inched up to around 3p (2.8p).
Integration of the Pillar acquisition and the performance of the UK products
division will be high on observers' agendas.
TUESDAY: A good half for the cruise industry is expected to have helped P&amp;O,
the shipping, construction and property group, lift pre-tax profits to
between Pounds 100 and Pounds 130m, against Pounds 80.1m. Analysts reckon
that volume growth in ferries will have offset the price war and that
profits from house-building and investment property will be flat. They
anticipate a dividend of 13.5p, against last time's 24p, which was higher
due to the enhanced scrip alternative.
TUESDAY: Interim results from pharmaceutical group Fisons are expected to
come in at under Pounds 40m, with most analysts clustered around the Pounds
35m mark. The progress of Intal, the anti-asthma treatment, will be of
particular interest, especially given the threat of generic alternatives and
the performance of the US market. Restructuring at the group's scientific
instruments business will also be the focus of some interest.
TUESDAY: An increase in first-half pre-tax profits from Pounds 82m to about
Pounds 93m at Kingfisher, the retailing group, is not expected to lift the
gloom surrounding the stock, which has fallen from a high of 778p last
December to 488p yesterday.
The results will include a full contribution for the first time from Darty,
the French electrical retailer. Stripping out the increase from Darty, the
underlying result is forecast to be down on last year.
WEDNESDAY: Lasmo, the oil explorer, is expected to announce interim net
losses of Pounds 20m, excluding exceptionals, against net profits last year
of Pounds 20m. Few surprises are expected after the barrage of information
delivered in its defence from the Pounds 1.6bn hostile bid by Enterprise Oil
this summer. But investors who backed Lasmo widely in the battle will want
clearer indications of when the losses will come to an end.
WEDNESDAY: Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurance company,
reports its interim results. Analysts' forecasts for pre-tax profits range
from Pounds 243m to Pounds 283m. This compares with Pounds 242m last time
and is expected to include a significant recovery in the general insurance
business.
THURSDAY: Legal &amp; General, another of the UK's larger proprietary insurance
groups, reports interim results. Like Guardian Royal Exchange, the composite
insurance group, L&amp;G accounts for realised and unrealised capital gains and
losses in its profit and loss account, and analysts expect this to produce a
profit fall from Pounds 75m, to Pounds 48m-Pounds 58m in the first six
months of the year.
THURSDAY: United Biscuits is likely to report interim pre-tax profits of
about Pounds 75m, against Pounds 70.8m a year earlier before a Pounds 62.7m
gain on disposals. A dividend increase is unlikely. UB's business might have
slowed a little since the AGM with, for example, a price war in crisps.
THURSDAY: Booker's interim pre-tax profits are likely to be down by about 5
per cent at Pounds 28.5m, with an unchanged dividend. New management is
still retrenching and its cash and carry business remains tough.
FRIDAY: Next, the fashion retailer, is expected to provide evidence of its
continuing recovery, with interim pre-tax profits up from Pounds 23m to
about Pounds 32m. Although sales are thought to have been hit by the very
hot weather in July, the company is expected to report a return to strong
sales growth since then.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: A success story of swings and
roundabouts - The world's emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emerging markets were the success story of 1993. They not only captured the
investor's imagination with their exoticism; they also delivered in terms of
performance. The emerging markets index of the International Finance
Corporation, a subsidiary of the World Bank, doubled between the beginning
of 1993 and 1994.
This year, though, investors also got a taste of the volatility which is a
feature of these markets - the index fell by 14 per cent in the three months
between February and May. It has, however, bounced back and now stands 8 per
cent higher than at the start of the year.
Rachael Maunders, of Govett Emerging Markets, says: 'Certain markets have
bounced back more sharply than others. Some may only have 5 per cent more to
go; but others like Argentina, Taiwan and Korea have more scope - possibly
15 per cent or more.'
Why invest?
A portfolio of emerging markets is not an alternative to investment in more
mature markets but, as emerging markets are expected to have far higher
growth rates than the OECD countries, a holding is essential for a
well-spread portfolio.
Emerging markets are more volatile than others, as the chart shows. But
Barings (which also has an emerging markets index) has figures to show that
not only will a holding of between 10 and 30 per cent, added to a portfolio
of FT-A All-Share stocks, increase the return to the investor  - it will
actually reduce risk as well.
This is because emerging markets tend to behave very differently from each
other - when one falls 10 per cent in a week, another will probably be
rising just as fast or faster to compensate. Last year, when all the markets
seemed to be heading in the same direction - upwards - there were worries
that the lack of correlation was disappearing. This year, they have returned
to unrelated form: Brazil is up 80 per cent; Turkey is down by two-thirds.
Which markets?
Emerging markets tend to be categorised according to three main groupings:
the Far East, Latin America, and the rest. For many fund managers, the
region itself is less important than the quality and tradeability of stocks.
Some may also invest on the basis of a certain country's anticipated growth
rate.
Richard Bade, of Commercial Union, manages the Prosperity emerging markets
unit trust and believes that a lot of the uncertainty, which caused the
markets to fall earlier this year after the US Federal Reserve bank first
raised interest rates, has now gone. 'The sudden reversal in US policy
affected capital flows to emerging markets, but the last interest rate move
should have been sufficient to satisfy the markets.'
His fund is 50 per cent invested in the Far East with a lot of exposure to
China, which Bade favours for its culture of entrepreneurship.
Some funds also look closer to home. Steve Bates, of Flemings, is positive
about eastern Europe, principally Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
'We think there is a cyclical reason to be exposed there because of the
leverage to the European recovery, but also for the long-term reason that
those economies are starting to grow under their own steam.' Even so,
eastern Europe accounts for less than 5 per cent of the fund because the
markets are still so small.
Arnab Banerji, of Foreign &amp; Colonial, has high hopes for some of the larger
markets, particularly Brazil, Mexico, India and South Korea, but he is also
keeping a close eye on a few of the relative minnows such as Peru,
Bangladesh and Morocco. 'Bangladesh is about the best-performing market in
the world this year,' Banerji says. The problem for would-be investors is
that it is tiny, with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 1bn.
How do you invest?
Direct investment in emerging markets is only for the professionals - and
even they can find it taxing at times, since these markets tend to be
relatively illiquid.
The simplest way for UK-based investors to gain exposure is through a unit
or investment trust. Since unit trusts are open-ended, the fund manager
faces the problem of having to sell holdings quickly to meet redemptions if
panic sets in and investors want to liquidate their holdings.
Investment trusts, which are closed-end funds, do not have this problem but,
instead, might fall to a deep discount if the fund or the countries in which
it invests become unpopular.
A global fund is less risky than a regional fund because of its wider
spread; single-country funds are likely to be more volatile than either.
Some global funds are more diversified than others. If a manager takes a big
bet on an individual market, and invests a quarter of his fund in it, the
fund should outperform its peers if the bet pays off. But if, rather than
rising, the market collapses, the fund could lose a large chunk of its
assets.
Kenneth King, head of emerging markets at Kleinwort Benson, imposes strict
asset allocation rules in order to reduce risk. No more than 10 per cent of
the fund is ever invested in any single market.
If a market has risen more than 50 per cent over a year, the maximum holding
is cut to 7.5 per cent. If a market has halved in 12 months, the fund must
have 2.5 per cent in it.
This approach means that the Kleinwort fund is never affected too badly by
the swings in individual markets, which can be extreme: since 1987, Turkey
has been the world's best-performing stock market for three one-year periods
 -but has also been the worst performer three times.
Funds investing solely in emerging markets are relatively recent; few have a
track record even of three years. The tables list the performance of those
that have more than a one-year record.
A number of funds have been launched in the past year. Portfolio's Fund of
Emerging Markets fund is a unit trust investing in closed end funds. It
picks the funds according to a combination of asset allocation, management
quality, size of discount and redemption terms.
City of London Emerging Markets - a unit trust which also invests in
closed-end funds - this year acquired a twin in the form of the Emerging
Markets Country investment trust. Another investment trust too new to be
included in the table is Abtrust's Emerging Economies fund, which is the
second best-performing in the sector over six months.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Markets: Inflation sours the mood at bulls' party - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Put the bubbly back on ice, deflate the balloons and cancel the catering: it
looks as if Wall Street's late-summer / early-autumn market rally may never
materialise.
Two weeks ago, share prices began an ascent which took the Dow Jones
Industrial Average up from around 3,750 to over 3,900 in eight trading days.
Although stocks subsequently stumbled, they rebounded nicely this Thursday
as the Dow again climbed above 3,900.
With mutual funds reporting rising cash inflows, bond prices seemingly
stable, and Federal Reserve monetary policy possibly on hold until the end
of the year, there was a spring in the step of investors and traders not
seen since early February.
Now, however, any optimistic thoughts Wall Street might have had about a
sustained rally in share prices may have to be shelved. Yesterday, following
disturbing inflation news, bond prices plummeted - pushing the yield on the
benchmark 30-year government bond up to 7.68 per cent - and stocks dropped
sharply. In the first half-hour of trading, the Dow fell more than 40
points, and although the average recovered slightly later in the morning,
the damage to the market's psyche had been done.
The cause of the stock and bond markets' losses was the producer prices
index, which the Labor department said yesterday had climbed 0.6 per cent in
August. That was the biggest increase in the PPI in four years, and well
above the 0.4 per cent forecast by most analysts. Just as troubling, the
'core' PPI (a measure which excludes the volatile food and energy prices)
rose by 0.4 per cent, again more than expected.
For an inflation-sensitive bond market, the August PPI - which put the
annual rate of producer price inflation at 2.9 per cent - was too much to
bear. Inflation has remained relatively low throughout this year, and some
analysts had expressed confidence that the Fed's five policy tightenings
would ensure it remained that way, but fixed-income investors have been
unable to shake their concern that at some point, economic growth would feed
through into higher prices. Consequently, they have been ready to sell bonds
at the first hint of rising inflation.
To the inflation-fixated, yesterday's PPI report was more than just a hint.
As James Solloway, chief analyst at Argus Research in New York, put it:
'This should again raise fears that the Fed has not done enough to nip
inflation in the bud. Inflation is not dead by any stretch of the
imagination.'
The breakdown of the PPI data was particularly disturbing, as it showed
rising prices across a range of goods. Coffee prices soared 12 per cent,
tobacco climbed 1.4 per cent, energy 1.7 per cent, and cars and food prices
both rose 0.7 per cent. Analysts can explain away the occasional jump in a
PPI component, but when a broad group of prices are rising, it becomes more
difficult to ignore.
David Jones, an economist at Aubrey Langston, said yesterday that inflation
was 'certainly building up in the goods production chain. We saw it a year
or so ago in commodities and now it's worked its way down to the finished
goods level, and we still see inflation in in the pipeline at the crude and
intermediate goods level.'
What this means for the stock market is that investors cannot relax their
guard against further increases in short-term and long-term interest rates.
If next week's August consumer prices index is anything like as worrisome as
the PPI was, then bond prices could tumble further, and the Fed could
quickly be forced to break its current holding pattern on monetary policy.
That would spell trouble for share prices.
There is a possibility, however, that the Fed will not make another move on
interest rates soon because the increase in the PPI may have been exactly
what it was expecting.
The central bank has raised short-term rates five times in the past six
months in what has become a sustained round of policy tightening. Although
it drew fire for its actions - most notably from politicians worried the
rate increases will reverse the recovery which began in 1992 - the Fed may
have known, or at least suspected, all along that the economy was growing to
fast for inflation to remain dormant forever.
Given that interest rate increases do not have an immediate effect upon
economic growth - the time-lag is variously judged to be between six to nine
months, depending upon the vigour of the economy - the Fed may well be
untroubled by yesterday's disturbing PPI data, secure in the knowledge that
this year's policy tightenings will soon begin to take its toll on the
economy and inflation.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Boost in demand for metals - At a
Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The encouraging growth in world economic activity is boosting demand for
metals such as copper, aluminium, lead and zinc, and minerals such as coal
and titanium dioxide - which gives the whiteness to paint, some plastics and
tiles.
All these are produced by RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, which
this week pleased the market by reporting interim profits at the top end of
analysts' expectations: a 30 per cent increase to Pounds 242m in earnings
adjusted to reflect the underlying business performance by excluding
exceptional items. The group, usually a conservative forecaster, also said
the global economic outlook had not looked as favourable since the 1980s.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Tokyo market hits oversupply snags -
At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tokyo stock exchange was hit this week by the listing of Japan Telecom,
the country's third largest telecommunications company. Rather than boosting
the market as had been expected, the flotation created an oversupply
problem, and shares in the newly-listed company fell, pulling other sectors
down too. On Thursday, the Nikkei index fell through the 20,000 level for
the first time in four months.
Traders are also worried that another big flotation next month - Japan
Tobacco - could futher depress the market. The Tokyo market had a good first
half of this year, helped by cash inflows from foreign investors, but has
stagnated in the 20,000 to 21,000 band since mid-summer.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Markets: Industrial shares wilt at the margins - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few companies are big enough to move the London market single-handed, but
BTR certainly achieved that dubious distinction this week. Unexpectedly low
interim profits from the industrial conglomerate helped tip the FT-SE 100
back through the 3,200 level it had been hanging on to since the summer
rally.
This is partly a question of scale: BTR is one of the UK's biggest
manufacturing group's, even after Thursday's sell-off cut its market market
value by Pounds 1.6bn to Pounds 12.2bn. Analysts estimated that the plunge
in BTR's share price alone accounted for nearly 10 points of the FT-SE's
100's 23.9 point decline on the day.
The main reason, however, was that a drop in BTR's profit margins confirmed
a concern over manufacturing shares which has been increasingly worrying
investors in recent weeks.
The growth in retail spending and consumer confidence remains subdued, as
demonstrated by the confirmation that last month's new car sales fell well
short of the industry's hopes and the modest level of new housing starts.
The Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey suggested
that retail sales in August were only slightly up on a year ago.
A good summer helped Cadbury Schweppes, the sweets and soft drinks group,
lift profits by 23 per cent. But the company, which bottles Coca-Cola,
admitted that sales of Coke in J. Sainsbury stores fell by 15 per cent after
the UK's largest supermarket chain launched its own-brand of cola.
Investors had responded to these pressures on the retail sector by moving
out of consumer-oriented companies and into industrial manufacturers, which
seemed better placed to benefit from increasing economic growth. The theory
was that manufacturers, having reduced their workforces during the downturn,
would be able to transform quickly any significant rise in demand into
increased profitability.
BTR's results highlighted the big flaw in this argument: manufacturers are
finding it difficult to pass on rising raw materials prices to their
customers, who are themselves struggling to sell goods to unenthusiastic
consumers.
BTR said the problem was particularly acute in the automotive industry. All
the big car groups are taking a leaf out of the book of Volkswagen, where
the Spanish executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua has cut costs by
putting pressure on suppliers.
Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, said his group would turn away some of
this automotive work, rather than lower its profitability. However, the
warning of margin pressure still caused dismay: BTR has a strong position in
many markets, and if it cannot resist being caught in this sort of squeeze,
then weaker manufacturers will have even less chance.
There was, consequently, a large switch of funds out of manufacturing
companies and into traditional safe havens such as utilities, which continue
to offer high dividend payments. British Gas held its dividend, in spite of
a slight drop in profits. The group confirmed that its reorganisation
programme was on schedule, and that an additional 3,000 people had been made
redundant in the first half, bringing the year-on-year total to 10,000 out
of a target total of 25,000 over the next three to four years.
Shares in Manweb also rose after the Cheshire-based regional electricity
distributor said it would cut 500 jobs, 11 per cent of its workforce. The
group is the second in the sector to respond to the regulator's recent price
review with job cuts and a wide-ranging restructuring. Most of the Recs are
expected to announce similar action to cut costs over the coming weeks.
Reducing the workforce seems a foolproof wheeze for making privatised
monopoly suppliers more profitable, and increasing their dividend streams,
but it also offers one clue as to why the recovery in consumer confidence
and retail spending remains fragile.
News of the slowdown in retail sales growth, combined with a marked
narrowing in Britain's visible trade deficit in June, at least raised hopes
that Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would hold back from an early rise in
interest rates. On the most optimistic view, these figures hold out the
prospect that UK recovery could be becoming more established without
threatening to push inflation higher or trigger a balance of payments
crisis.
SG Warburg, the investment bank, points out that, in spite of some
disappointments this week, most companies reporting in the current interim
results season have matched expectations, even if they have failed to
justify the upgrades in earnings forecasts which some had looked for.
Warburg says: 'In consequence a period of disappointment and nervousness may
be inevitable, not least while investors consider how generally applicable
BTR's talk of margin pressures as raw materials rise is.'
London equities were further unsettled yesterday, when news of unexpectedly
high US producer prices startled the bond market with the prospect of
another rise in US interest rates. Even if UK interest rates go up later
rather than sooner, no one in the market doubts that an increase is coming.
As the autumn progresses, we will also see increasing speculation over the
contents of the November Budget - particularly regarding the government's
intentions on the tax treatment of dividends.
One possible source of optimism came from BTR, which said it was on the
lookout for a large acquisition. The group's borrowings have fallen below
the level they were at before it paid Pounds 1.55bn in 1991 for Hawker
Siddeley, the aerospace and engineering group. BTR will certainly not just
consider on UK opportunities, but a well-judged large domestic deal could
both cheer the market and take the group out of the dog house.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Markets: Investments that spell danger - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American pundit Benjamin Graham compared the stock market to a manic
depressive. 'Mr Market' was always ready both to buy and sell, but his share
price quotes veered from the ridiculously high to the absurdly low as his
excessive optimism about company prospects gave way to equally exaggerated
gloom.
The chart on page III suggests that, if all markets have a touch of the
manic depressive about them, emerging markets are an extreme case.
This patient is highly unpredictable and dangerous to know. For the average
private investor, that means investing through a broadly-based fund and
staying aboard for the long term. Trying to take advantage of manic
depressive market swings is a mug's game.
Warrants were one of investors' favourite toys last year - but toys can be
dangerous. This week, the price of BTR's 93-94 warrants tumbled from 87p to
45p as bad results at the conglomerate knocked its ordinary shares back by
44p to 338p.
The fall in the price of the ordinary shares was only 11.5 per cent. So, why
did the warrants nearly halve?
These particular warrants give investors the right to buy ordinary shares in
BTR at 288p, but this right expires in October. The brevity of this
remaining period is the main reason the warrant price responded so
dramatically to the move in the underlying share price.
Add the warrant price (45p) to the subscription price (288p) and the
warrant-holder can buy BTR shares for an effective 333p, close to the
present share price.
When warrants get very near the end of their life, they tend to move penny
for penny with the share price - as the 93-94 BTR warrants did. But warrants
with longer to run normally sell for more than the conversion sums would
suggest. For the extra time itself is valuable, and this 'time value' tends
to act as a buffer to the warrant price.
Longer-dated warrants do not normally react as sharply to movements in the
underlying shares as ones near expiry.
Many people first get their warrants as an add-on to a new issue
(particularly investment trust issues) or as part-payment in a bid. What
they need to remember is that the riskiness of these warrants might well
increase as they age. All warrants are potentially dangerous.
Short-dated warrants are the most explosive, though. Selling your warrants
when they still have a couple of years left can prevent some last-minute
upsets.
Foreign income dividends (Fids) are a wet towel subject but they are getting
more popular with companies. The trail-blazer came from BAT in March; Coats
Viyella, Burmah Castrol and RTZ all joined in this week. So, it is worth
understanding the rules.
Fids are suitable only for companies getting a large proportion of profits
from overseas. Some such companies used to face an abnormally high tax
charge because their mainstream corporation tax liability did not suffice to
cover tax paid on dividends. A Fid carries a normal 20 per cent tax credit,
but tax-exempt shareholders cannot claim a rebate.
Very broadly, if a company paying a Fid pays the same net dividend as one
paying an ordinary dividend, investors paying tax get the same amount, but
tax-exempt shareholders get less from the Fid than they would from an
ordinary dividend. Tax-exempt shareholders include large investors such as
pension funds, private shareholders whose low income takes them out of the
income tax net, and personal equity plan-holders.
Companies are tending to increase their net Fid dividend payments by 25 per
cent in order to make good the cut in income of their tax-exempt
shareholders. This attempt to level the playing field in practice tilts it
in favour of tax-paying investors, for they actually benefit from the
dividend increase.
Shunting your holdings around to get potential Fid-payers outside your Pep
is a hassle. But the discrepancy could be worth bearing in mind when
deciding which companies to put into your Pep in the first place.
The sums, courtesy of BZW, are:
1. For a UK dividend received of 80p. A basic rate (20 per cent) tax-payer
gets 80p, a higher rate (40 per cent) tax-payer gets 60p, and a Pep-holder
gets 100p.
2. For a Fid received of 80p. A basic rate tax-payer gets 80p, a higher rate
tax-payer gets 60p, and a Pep-holder gets 80p.
3. If the company pays a Fid but increases it to 100p. A basic rate
tax-payer gets 100p, a higher rate tax-payer gets 75p, and a Pep-holder gets
100p.
Apologies for the headache.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Markets: Bowater's supermodel image - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The image of US supermodel Cindy Crawford, chosen to demonstrate Bowater's
media imaging technology at its interim results this week, was appropriate -
even if David Lyon, chief executive, looked somewhat bemused posing
alongside it for press photographs.
A 15 per cent increase in underlying profits for the six months to June 30
confirmed that the packaging, print and coated products group has become
something of a supermodel among companies. Few manufacturing businesses can
match its progress, even through the depths of recession, since new
management took over in 1987.
First-half profits, excluding exceptional items, have increased every year,
from Pounds 17.3m to Pounds 109m over the period; operating margins have
increased every first half except one, from 3.8 per cent to 9.2 per cent;
the interim dividend has grown at a compound rate of 15 per cent. The story
for the full-year results is similar.
In spite of this record, however, Bowater's shares had fallen after its two
previous results presentations, as it warned last autumn of falling demand
for packaging, and in spring this year of a possible squeeze on margins as
raw materials prices began to rise.
There was no such problem this time. Bowater said raw materials prices -
mainly paper and resin - had indeed risen about 20 per cent between April
and June, thanks to increasing demand in key markets. But the company had
passed on the rise to customers, and believed it could pass on the further
increase of up to 10 per cent expected by the end of the year. The shares
gained 19p on the day to 492p.
In 1987 Bowater was a ragbag of relatively unconnected paper and packaging
businesses. Through a series of acquisitions it has developed strengths in
three sophisticated, value-added sectors of packaging and printing - food
and drink, toiletries and cosmetics, and healthcare and pharmaceuticals, as
well as in the coated products sector.
It has operations in North America, Europe and Australasia. The
restructuring began in 1987 with the acquisition of Rexham Corporation, the
custom coatings and laminates group, followed in 1989 by Release
Technologies, the release films and papers manufacturer.
In 1992, Bowater bought DRG, a food and healthcare packaging supplier, and
Cope Allman, a cosmetics and pharmaceuticals packaging group. The buying
spree was completed last year, with Specialty Coatings International, the US
coated products group.
The most recent acquisitions were funded by two successful rights issues,
allowing Bowater to keep borrowings down - gearing is a moderate 43 per
cent.
Now, David Lyon says, Bowater is entering a new phase. Restructuring is
over, and the group plans to expand through organic growth, with some
'bolt-on' acquisitions to strengthen its position in certain markets.
It has formed a team of 'free spirits', roving senior executives who are
experts in particular technologies, to spot technological developments in
one part of the group that could be used in other parts, and merit
investment and joint development.
Capital spending this year is projected at a record Pounds 150m. One
important growth area is healthcare packaging, with Bowater building a new
Pounds 30m factory in Bristol and trying to establish joint ventures in
South America, India and Poland.
Bowater also wants to expand its share of the beauty packaging market
outside Europe, and parts of its coated products operations into the
Americas, Europe and East Asia. This week's results prompted analysts to
upgrade their profits forecasts for the full year from about Pounds 225m to
at least Pounds 230m.
That puts Bowater on a prospective price/earnings ratio of 13.8 - only a
small premium to the packaging sector. 'With Bowater's growth prospects, the
shares are looking quite cheap,' says David McCrossan, packaging analyst at
Kleinwort Benson. For investors, that could make it almost as attractive as
Cindy Crawford.

FT  10 SEP 94 / The Long View: A new phase of crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the German government can no longer easily sell its bonds you have to
start worrying. For decades German bunds set the standard for investment
quality among fixed-income securities but, this week, the yield on 10-year
D-Mark bonds rose to more than 7 1/2 per cent - significantly greater than
the yield on those by the US Treasury and denominated, of course, in the
dodgy dollar.
That old law of supply and demand is at work here. A reminder of the sheer
volume of supply of bonds around the world comes from the annual Salomon
Brothers estimation exercise, which has thrown up a figure of Dollars 16.3
trillion (1trn = 1,000bn) as the size of the world bond market by the end of
last year.
This covers the 21 leading currencies, although almost half the bonds are
denominated in US dollars and by the time you have added in Japanese,
German, Italian, French, British and Canadian paper you have covered 80 per
cent of the field.
Total outstanding debt rose 10 per cent in 1993, expressed in dollars. The
world's investors swallowed all the new issues greedily - a net total of
Dollars 1.6 trillion - then choked. They have spent 1994 regretting this
over-indulgence. The US 30-year Treasury bond yield at about 7.5 per cent is
slightly below the worst but is a long way above the 5.8 per cent at which
it troughed in the latter part of 1993.
Not only has the overall yield on bonds risen but there has been a widening
of differentials as investors have become more conscious of risk. Swedish,
Italian and Spanish 10-year government bond yields are running at more than
400 basis points over the corresponding US Treasury bond yields.
What are the risks? Firstly that the currency will depreciate but ultimately
that some country or other will get into such a mess that it will have to
restructure its debt. The sort of risks that used to be confined to the
third world are now beginning to trouble first world investors.
Old-fashioned fiscal discipline is right out of fashion. This week the
European Commission ticked off 10 out of 12 member states for running
excessive budget deficits.
In the bond market they particularly worry about elections. They were mildly
impressed by Silvio Berlusconi's victory in Italy but have lost faith
subsequently. Now there is an imminent poll in Sweden promising the return
of the social democrats and another in Denmark, although Denmark is a long
way from being on any critical list.
For obvious reasons electors do not tend to vote in a way that bond
investors would like. The man in the street likes public money to be spent
on health, education, social security and other benefits but hates the idea
of paying matching taxes. He also flirts with nationalism and ideas of
separation, a theme that has sent the Canadian bond market into a tizzy over
the imminent Quebec elections that may well restore a secessionist Parti
Quebecois to power.
That is not to say that the PQ could ever win a referendum on separation.
But the very possibility that particular regions of a troubled country might
try to walk away from responsibility for a large part of the national debt
is a bondholders' nightmare that may yet haunt creditors of the Belgian and
Italian governments, to name but two.
Oddly, unification can be fiscally dangerous too. Germany has accepted the
financial burden of its restored eastern provinces, but it would prefer not
to pay up right away. Hence, most of the debt problems.
Germany is also facing elections this autumn. It seems that Helmut Kohl is
likely to be returned to power, and policies will not change significantly.
But those policies have become notably slack - extraordinarily so by past
German standards - so that the money supply is rising strongly and
government borrowing is worryingly high.
Internationally, therefore, the problems in bonds are becoming focused in
public sector debt. A few years ago there was a flurry of private sector
problems, notably in US junk bonds, but such of the corporate indebtedness
has been refinanced through the booming equity markets, in emerging as well
as developed markets. Central government outstanding bonds rose by 12 per
cent last year as the fiscal deficits ballooned.
And whereas in 1980 the share of new bond finance raised from abroad ranged
from just about nil for France and Spain and up to 14 per cent for Germany
and the UK, by 1993 these countries were selling 25 per cent upwards to
foreigners.
In fact, Germany in recent years has often sold more than half its bunds to
international investors (although foreigners have now lost their appetite,
helping to explain the recent sharp rise in funding costs). The solution to
the bond market's woes is clear enough - governments must cut their spending
and encourage higher savings among their populations. But it is a deeply
unpopular message and not one that can be writ large on election manifestos,
even if the strategy will, perforce, have to be adopted eventually.
Hence the fear that the bond markets may have to choose a sacrificial
victim. Some unco-operative country or other in Europe will be declared a
pariah. Its debt spurned except perhaps by scavengers running vulture funds.
Would 15 or 20 per cent interest rates force such a country to reconsider.
It might simply declare a siege economy and restructure its liabilities, say
by converting its debt into 30-year bonds yielding a 'fair' 5 per cent. It
is not clear who would be teaching whom a lesson.
At any rate, we seem to be entering a new phase of the bond market crisis
that began last February, this time centred in Europe. Investors seem to
perceive that the risks have risen. Or maybe it is that the Japanese, with a
trade surplus, are hogging too much of the world's liquidity and, scarred by
losses, are refusing to recycle it into long-term markets. But those
elections won't be over a moment too soon.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Will they bid for peace?: The republicans say they have
given up violence. But are the unionists buying it? Christian Tyler went to
Northern Ireland and asked them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A woman in the little crowd outside the Orange Hall was shouting. 'Is Gerry
Adams in there? Is he hiding under Mayhew's raincoat?'
Inside the hall, Sir Patrick Mayhew, tall and grey-faced, was making his
most important public appearance since the IRA ceasefire. Alternately
flattering and firm - and with an apology for past misunderstanding - the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was trying to cajole the distrustful
ranks of Protestant brethren who remain convinced their British government
is selling out to Sinn Fein and the IRA gunmen after 25 years of bloodshed.
The hall was decked with the banners of the Orange lodges for an historic
encounter in the town of Comber, County Down, on Wednesday night. About 200
men - and half a dozen women - were packed into an airless upstairs room.
Arrayed in the orange stoles and insignia of their Order, they looked
honest, decent folk - but implacable. They declared their fears and
suppressed their anger as they respectfully applauded the first Secretary of
State to come down from Stormont Castle to face the rank and file of Orange
Protestant unionism.
Before Mayhew's ordeal a minister said prayers and read from St Paul's
epistle to the Thessalonians. The Grand Lodge chairman, the eloquent David
McNarry, warned against indiscipline on the floor. Sir Patrick was then
presented with a handsome bible: and for a moment it seemed he was expected
to take the oath on the spot: There Is No Secret Deal.
The unionist majority of northern Ireland feels itself the underdog these
days, the more so as Sinn Fein reaps the propaganda rewards of its
10-day-old initiative. For many unionist footsoldiers the IRA declaration is
a tactical sham, a con-trick. They are suspicious of the republicans,
suspicious of Westminster, afraid of being cast as the villains of the
piece, afraid of their own triumphalist paramilitaries, and afraid of
domination by Dublin - or Rome.
Can such people ever make peace?
In spite of the universal hope of peace, for many unionists the IRA
ceasefire has changed nothing. Asked whether he felt differently now, an old
farmer at the Saintfield weekly cattle auction winked roguishly and said:
'No. I had my hair cut last week. It's grown again this week.'
Farmers tend to be men of few words. But the buyers clustered at the
ringside this week, giving almost undetectable jerks of the thumb to
register their bids with the fast-talking auctioneer, constitute the
backbone of a dangerously aggrieved majority.
William Dick, a pleasant and articulate young beef farmer with 140 acres, is
a local councillor from the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party.
Speaking after Paisley's showdown with John Major at Number 10 this week, he
said mainlanders should not make the mistake of thinking that just because
Paisley had 'his own way of expressing himself' he did not correctly
represent the views of the community. Nor should they forget that in the
recent European elections, Paisley's party had topped the Ulster poll.
'We have made our views known, but the unionist viewpoint has been set
aside,' he said. 'For the English it is hard to perceive what is going on.
At local level we have no trouble getting on with the SDLP (the non-violent
republican party led by John Hume) but at national level their demands are
hardening all the time.' As for Gerry Adams and Sinn Fein, they had
sponsored butchery one week and been received by the Irish Prime Minister
the next. 'There has been no word of remorse, no apologies for the deaths.'
Even out in the rolling countryside of County Down, most people have been
touched by the violence. The last IRA victim before the ceasefire was a
friend of Councillor Dick, a part-time member of the Royal Irish Regiment
(formerly Ulster Defence Regiment) and church organist called Trelford
Withers who was shot at point-blank range in his shop in nearby Crossgar on
August 8.
Another friend of the murdered man said he belonged to no party but was
'disgusted' by the way the British prime minister had treated Paisley. The
rival Ulster Unionists under James Molyneaux were betraying the people, he
added, and Sir Patrick Mayhew talked down to them. Then he confessed: 'Our
worst enemies now are the loyalist paramilitaries.'
The map says Ireland should be one nation. But Protestants behind the
north-eastern partition feel different, part of another culture, another
history, another tribe. The evidence of their descent is everywhere: in the
Scottish names of families, villages and streets, in the Presbyterian
churches, in the notices clamped to street lamps which read 'Alcohol-free
area'. The people of north Antrim are physically closer to Glasgow than to
Dublin.
Gerald Douglas, an eighth-generation Scot, is a Toyota dealer under the
Mountains of Mourne in the south of Co Down where Catholics predominate. In
spite of the ceasefire, he keeps a gun beside his bed: his garage was blown
up 20 years ago and he has received death threats. Though he regards Paisley
as a destructive force and a retrogressive influence, he thinks Major this
week put himself in the wrong.
Douglas is a former police reservist, an Ulster Unionist councillor and a
Presbyterian who goes to church every week. He is also a deputy county
Master of the Orange Order, and was flying to New Zealand this week as a
delegate to the Orangemen's world council. His is the profile of the
hard-line 'prod'. Yet Douglas comes over as a humorous and tolerant man who
lives peaceably with his Catholic neighbours.
'My grandfather told me 'you can't trust Englishmen', he said. 'This
suspicion goes back to the days of Home Rule.' Why, then, cling to London
rule? 'Better the devil you know, I suppose.'
Protestants were afraid that union with the Irish Republic would bring
religious oppression, he said. They still regarded the Republic as a
priest-ridden state and Irish Catholicism as a 'more superstitious,
idolatrous faith'. Douglas himself went to a mixed-faith school. His
observation was that the Catholic children spent more time learning religion
and the Irish language while the Protestant kids got on with their maths and
English. Ulster Protestants were thrifty, industrious and more likely to
succeed.
Religion is a cultural identifier in northern Ireland, not the cause of the
conflict. Catholics and Protestants are not killing each other over the
theological doctrine of transubstantiation. It is all about sovereign
allegiances. As if to prove the point, opinion polls suggest a majority of
Catholics - certainly the expanding middle-class - would vote to stay in the
Union if a referendum were held tomorrow.
It is this fundamental question of sovereignty which makes Ulster politics
so polarised. The centre Alliance party is small and weak. In the face of
what they call the 'pan-nationalist front', unionists remain badly divided.
If the unionist leadership cannot break with the past, new voices and new
blood will be needed to turn a ceasefire - still not reciprocated by the
Loyalist terrorists - into a genuine peace.
This week the Belfast Telegraph published a letter from 'a group of business
and professional people from the Unionist tradition'. It called for 'a
pluralist society at ease with itself' and went on: 'We must convince our
fellow countrymen and women that there is a place for all of us in this new
society. We 'protest-ants' must also be the 'persuade-ants'.'
Where were these well-wishers when they were needed in the past? Roy
Bradford, a minister in the last northern Ireland executive and now mayor of
well-heeled Bangor, was scathing. 'It is the trahison des clercs,' he
sniffed. 'The letter was unsigned. They hadn't the courage to put their
names to it because they were afraid it would be bad for business. These
businessmen are doing all right, and they don't want to get their hands
dirty.
'For a professional to be publicly associated with the unionist position is
not good for him. He does not want to seem a bigoted anti-Catholic. In the
past, of course, a lot were afraid of being shot.'
The mayor and his chief executive, Adrian McDowell, sat puffing cigars over
a map of the town's yacht marina. This is one of the most prosperous parts
of the province, a dormitory town for Belfast with below-average
unemployment and above-average income. The plate-glass villas, with their
hydrangeas and pampas grass, gravel sweeps and baying guard-dogs along the
Gold Coast southern shore of Belfast Lough are enough to make the
stockbrokers of Surrey weep with envy. Here, it is said, you will find the
highest concentration of BMW owners in the UK. Even without the help of the
Province's net subsidy from Westminster of Pounds 3bn a year, this would be
a bourgeois paradise.
Unionist politicians admit the middle class has opted out. In one sense it
is not surprising: under direct rule from Westminster the powers of local
authorities in Ulster are derisory. 'Burials and refuse collection - and
that's about it,' said Sir Edward Archdale, a former borough councillor.
After a distinguished career in the British Navy, Sir Edward, who describes
himself as 'a loose cannon' in the unionist ship, retired to his homeland to
study politics. He is a baronet who lives in a bungalow. In religion, he is
a diehard traditionalist, in social affairs an anti-capitalist radical. His
long absence allowed him to escape the atmosphere of intransigence among
those whose lives have been shaped by the conflict. For Sir Edward the
political answer for Ulster is self-government under the Crown, a similar
status to that of the Isle of Man.
'We would rather be detached on our own than semi-detached with Dublin,' he
said. Sir Edward would like to reconstitute his party as a secular Ulster
National Party to appeal to unionists of all denominations.
The plans of such potential peacemakers among the besieged majority were
looking sadly premature this week. The IRA may have laid down its weapons
but the unionists - mentally at least - are re-arming. A father of four sons
asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals - all his boys are in the
police. 'I once hoped they would be my coffin-bearers,' he said as he
proudly showed a photograph. 'But all these years I have been afraid I would
find myself carrying theirs.' That is what peace in Ulster means: a man
whose last wish can be granted.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Asprey's shares dip as big spenders stay away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Asprey fell by more than a third yesterday after the exclusive
jewellery retailer gave a warning that the loss of a few big-spending
customers would severely depress its profits.
The shares closed 110p down at 200p down after dropping as low as 178p
during the day.
Mr Naim Attallah, chief executive, said sales in the core Asprey businesses
had fallen dramatically, with the biggest decline in high-value sales to
'certain customers in the export market'.
'Many heads of states are not spending the kind of money they used to,' he
said.
'We are still dependent on a few big accounts, and the volume of high-value
sales has been very low so far this year,' he said.
There were no signs of an upturn, he added, and the fall in sales would
significantly reduce profitability in the first half of the group's
financial year.
Asprey's Bond Street shop stocks items including a set of jewellery made
from diamonds and Burma rubies retailing for Pounds 2m and a pair of
life-sized panthers made from oxidised silver offered at Pounds 450,000.
The prices of commissioned items, which accounted for 10 per cent of
turnover last year, can be much higher.
Evidence during the recession suggested that even the super-rich had been
discouraged from buying luxury goods while prices in that sector of the
market were held steady by lack of demand.
Although Asprey has sought to expand its customer base through an aggressive
acquisition strategy, the core Asprey business contributed 75 per cent of
profits and 55 per cent of sales in the year to March 31. The company also
owns Mappin &amp; Webb, Garrard and Watches of Switzerland.
Mr Attallah also identified other areas of concern in the group. Garrard,
the crown jewellers, had suffered a fall in export sales that was 'likely to
eliminate its contribution to group profits in the first half'.
The contribution from Watches of Switzerland was also likely to be
depressed, as overhead spending had exceeded sales growth. The division has
opened 10 new outlets since its acquisition by Asprey in 1992. In an effort
to attract younger customers, it launched a subsidiary, Zeus, last year,
where watches cost hundreds rather than thousands of pounds.
In the year to March, Asprey reported an 18 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 25.4m and sales up 30 per cent from Pounds 144.7m to
Pounds 187.6m.

FT  10 SEP 94 / US and Cuba reach deal to halt flow of refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Cuba yesterday reached an agreement to halt the flow of Cuban
refugees to the Florida coast in a move that marks the first co-operation
between the two countries since a flood of migrants began last month.
The agreement, which could pave the way for a slow improvement in broader
US-Cuban relations, was agreed after over a week of meetings between the two
sides in New York. It was welcomed by President Bill Clinton as a measure
that 'will help ensure that the massive flow of dangerous and illegal
immigration will be replaced by a safer, legal and more orderly process'.
The US has agreed to admit at least 20,000 Cubans this year, in line with
the existing US immigration quota, and could grant visas to another
additional 6,000 Cubans currently on the waiting list.
Although fewer than 4,000 Cubans have entered the US through legal channels
in the past year, the immigration and naturalisation services set aside
27,835 visas for Cubans every year.
Cuba is understood to have promised to curb the exodus of refugees. This
would involve restoring the border patrols which prevent people from
attempting to leave by boat. The Castro government encouraged the migration
by allowing border guards to look the other way as rafts left Cuban shores.
Cuba was understood to have sought a commitment from the US side to future
talks on broader issues of the US-Cuba relationship, in particular the
32-year US trade embargo.
Before this week's meetings with Cuba, the Clinton administration insisted
that it would not discuss anything other than migration issues even if the
Cuban side raised broader questions.
However, evidence that the two countries can co-operate will have
strengthened the hands of those within the administration who wish to open
comprehensive talks with Havana.
More than 32,000 people have fled Cuba over the past month. Most are being
held at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and a detention centre
opened earlier this week in Panama.
The agreement did not include any provisions to allow them into the US and
the Clinton administration was not expected to reverse its decision to
interdict and detain rafters.
The US is likely to encourage detainees to return to Cuba to proceed with
legal immi-gration.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Gyllenhammar switches to banking after Volvo debacle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ten months after resigning in the aftermath of Europe's most spectacular
failed merger, Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, former chairman of Volvo, has emerged
in a new guise as investment banker.
The announcement that he is to move to London to set up an investment bank
with Hans-Jorg Rudloff, the Euromarkets pioneer, has settled the question of
what the former chief of Sweden's biggest manufacturing company would do
after the collapse last December of his plans to merge Volvo's car and truck
operations with Renault of France.
Mr Gyllenhammar said the bank would offer a traditional service - 'very
private, very discreet and very focused on the client' - which will operate
across Europe. Yesterday 'PG', as he is known in Sweden, was in ebullient
mood, full of enthusiasm for his new project and insisting that he harboured
no bitterness over the shareholder and management revolt that scuppered the
merger plan and prompted his resignation after two decades in charge at
Volvo.
Mr Gyllenhammar, 59, has avoided - and says he will continue to avoid -
talking in detail about the events of last winter. But he did not disguise
his criticism of Volvo's subsequent change of direction, nor did he make
much effort to dispel the impression he gave in a recent interview that he
believed he was the victim of a 'gigantic power play' by the Wallenberg
empire to cut Volvo down to size.
The Wallenbergs flatly deny the allegation, which Mr Gyllenhammar has not
substantiated.
Volvo has since decided to concentrate on its core business and sell SKr40bn
(Pounds 3.38bn) worth of non-core businesses built up by Mr Gyllenhammar. He
is adamant that his strategy of merging the vehicle operations with Renault
and diversifying Volvo into other industries was the best long-term
prospect. 'I haven't changed my mind. I stand by my conviction that the deal
we proposed was a good deal.'
Mr Gyllenhammar said he would spend four-fifths of his time working at the
as yet unnamed investment bank, which is to be backed by Belgium's Banque
Bruxelles Lambert and managed by Mr Rudloff and Mr Peter Ogden, a former
director at Morgan Stanley.

FT  10 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Art market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Art may not be a perfect indicator of where the world economy is heading,
but it is better than many. When people believe they have more disposable
income, they spend it on inconsequentials, such as antique toys and pretty
pictures. The art market is experiencing a recovery of sorts, but, as in the
broader economy, confidence remains fragile. Although Christies' auction
sales were up 19 per cent year on year during the first six months, they
were marginally down on the previous half year. Consumer confidence had been
hit by the collapse in the bond market, accounting for disappointing sales
of Impressionist and modern painting during May and June.
While Asprey complains that heads of state are spending less, Japanese
corporate buyers and Australian entrepreneurs also remain absent from the
art market. North American buyers have given few signs of purchasing works
as hedges against inflation.
As an indicator of global shifts in wealth, the art market is an even better
guide. Buyers are increasingly from the rapidly expanding far eastern
economies. The Asian region now accounts for 10 per cent of Christies'
auction sales. Although such buyers are purchasing local works - Christies'
sales of oriental works were up 25 per cent - they are also picking up
easy-on-the-eye Impressionist pictures. Whether they can drive prices to the
absurd levels of 1990 is highly unlikely.

FT  10 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Fids
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign income dividends, known to the cognoscenti as Fids, have begun to
catch on. This week Coats Viyella, BTR, RTZ and Burmah Castrol all announced
they were adopting this form of payout. Like last year's enhanced scrip
dividends, Fids reduce a company's liability to tax. By paying the dividend
out of foreign income which has been taxed abroad, a company can escape
advance corporation tax. The lower tax bill enhances its earnings. Fids are
a more welcome device than enhanced scrips, principally because they require
companies to pay cash dividends. At best enhanced scrips diluted an
investor's stake. At worst they were little more than rights issues in
disguise.
The impact of a Fid is neutral on tax-exempt investors provided - as has
happened in every case so far - the company grosses up the payment to
compensate them for their inability to claim an ACT credit. Tax-paying
investors then become the main beneficiaries, as they receive a higher
dividend than would otherwise have been the case. Tax-exempt investors may
grumble that others are receiving a larger slice of the cake than hitherto.
Yet even they should reap some indirect benefits.
The earnings enhancement that comes from Fids is somewhat illusory. The
company must pay extra dividends to reduce its tax bill, so its cash
position is unchanged at the end of the day. But though the benefits are
unequal, the fact that more cash is being distributed should push up share
prices and increase value for everybody. Moreover, the rules prevent any
scrip alternative or share issue in connection with Fids, which is one
reason BTR's results were notable for the absence of a warrant issue. To
benefit from the scheme, companies must ensure their subsidiaries abroad are
generating the cash to pay for it. There cannot be harm in that.

FT  10 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Costain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Costain continues to spring nasty surprises. Admittedly, its profits plunge
was not as bad as it looks since last year's Pounds 68.1m pre-tax result
benefited from a Pounds 68.5m profit on disposals. But the US mining
operations, which were supposed to be the engine of growth, are now in loss
 -and the decision to sell these businesses raises the question of where the
group goes next. Shareholders have stumped up Pounds 160m in rights issue
money over the last three years, but the group's market capitalisation is
not even worth that amount and the outlook remains glum.
On the positive side, the continuing disposals programme will finally end
fears that the group was in danger of being strangled by its debts. The
balance sheet is more or less repaired. Margins at the rump contracting
businesses are poor at 1.3 per cent, but Costain claims they are better than
most in the industry.
Nevertheless, the group does not have the scale or financial muscle to
participate in the high-margin lead-contracting business for large-scale
private finance initiatives. Elsewhere, the contracting market is unlikely
to improve for at least a couple of years. Probably the best option would be
for Costain to be absorbed by another construction company. Such deals do
not have a good record, but they can work if the differing cultures can be
successfully welded.

FT  10 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Running scared again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be nice to dismiss the violent market reaction to yesterday's US
producer price data as simply Friday afternoon excess. Excluding food and
energy, the August rise was only 0.4 per cent, but there are grounds for
concern. First, there is growing evidence that inflationary pressures are
building up. As productivity gains associated with the early stages of
recovery subside, input price rises may become harder for companies to
absorb and will thus feed through more easily to the retail level. Second,
yesterday's market reaction shows that European bond markets have still
failed to decouple from the US trend.
That is bad for equities, which have managed to advance ahead of bond
markets since mid-summer, leaving relative valuations looking stretched. In
the UK, for example, equities trade at a small discount to index-linked gilt
yields, while the gilt-equity yield ratio of around 2.3 times leaves little
room for comfort. However good the recovery story, it will be difficult for
European equity markets to ignore developments in bonds.
Nor is it easy to see how the US bond market can calm down if inflationary
pressures continue to surface even while the economy is cooling. That might
require a more aggressive tightening than the Federal Reserve has so far
undertaken, which would certainly choke off the recovery in a way that again
risks undermining Wall Street equities. Until that uncertainty is resolved,
other markets may be nervous too.

FT  10 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Ill-prepared Dow slumps on
PPI data
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks stumbled yesterday as news of a sharp increase in producer prices
rattled the bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 33.65 lower at 3,874.81, after
recovering somewhat from its worst level of the session. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 was down 4.96 at 468.18, reflecting the broad base of the
sell-off. Declining issues outnumbered advances on the Big Board, 1,652 to
570. Volume was moderate, with 293m shares traded by the close.
The American SE composite fared a little better, dipping 0.97 to 454.5. The
Nasdaq composite shed 4.96 to 763.76 as a two-day rally by technology stocks
sputtered out.
In spite of indications to the contrary, the market was ill prepared for the
bad news on inflation delivered by the Labor Department. Stocks across the
board went into a tail-spin as trading opened, with investors jolted by the
announcement of a 0.6 per cent increase in the August producer price index.
A 0.5 per cent gain had been forecast.
Before the session began, the strong reading set off alarm in the bond
market, where a wave of selling pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year
Treasury to over 7.70 per cent, its highest level since mid-July.
After sliding more than 40 points in the first hour, the Dow industrials
were able to stabilise and retrace some lost ground. A second downturn came
during the afternoon, but the blue chip battled back again. Still, as the
session closed, 23 out of the index's 30 components were showing losses,
three were unchanged and a six held slender gains.
Rate-sensitive stocks were among the hardest hit, as some investors feared
higher inflation would bring forward the Federal Reserve's next tightening
of monetary policy.
In banking, Bankers Trust dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 70, JP Morgan
retreated Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 63 1/2 and Wells Fargo shed Dollars 2 to
Dollars 154 5/8 . Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street securities house, lost
Dollars 2 to Dollars 65 7/8 .
In retailing, JP Penney slumped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 52 7/8 and Gap
Stores retreated Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 36 3/4 .
An 8 per cent decline in USAir's share valuation was unrelated to the day's
economic developments. The issue was marked down Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 6
1/8 after one of the carrier's domestic flights crashed near Pittsburgh,
killing 132 passengers and crew members.
Canada
Toronto stocks plunged to close sharply lower as US inflation data rocked
North American financial markets.
The TSE-300 index fell 25.24 at 4,329.14 in volume of 66.57m shares valued
at CDollars 715.9m. Advancing stocks led declines 344 to 411 with 305 issues
unchanged.
All of Toronto's 14 sub-sectors fell, except for precious metals which
bucked the TSE trend on an improving gold price. December gold on COMEX
closed USDollars 1.20 higher at USDollars 395.80 per ounce in heavy volume.
Brazil
Sao Paulo rallied for the third session in a row to close up 1.5 per cent in
heavy trade boosted by renewed confidence in Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
presidential candidacy.
The Bovespa index ended up 790 at 53,511 points. Stocks rose 11.4 per cent
over the last three days, shrugging off a 10.5 per cent plunge on Monday
sparked by the resignation of Mr Rubens Ricupero, the former economy
minister.
Turnover was RDollars 362.4m (Dollars 419m). Telebras TEL. SA preferred
closed up 0.4 per cent at 51.70 reais.

Share prices lost ground after a morning rally, and the Nikkei average
closed 3.7 per cent lower on the week after five consecutive days of losses,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index fell 19.90 to 19,897.88, the lowest close since May 9,
having recovered the 20,000 level during the morning session, with a day's
high of 20,150.93. However, late arbitrage selling and a fall in
telecommunication stocks depressed the index to a low of 19,853.17 in the
afternoon.
Volume totalled 585m shares against 304m. Activity surged at the outset due
to settlements for futures and options trading. The Topix index of all first
section stocks rose 4.29 to 1,586.60 and the Nikkei 300 added 0.79 to
288.88. Gainers led losers by 556 to 415 with 228 issues remaining
unchanged.
In London, thew ISE/Nikkei index fell 1.69 to 1,291.00.
Overseas investors were seen stepping up selling in the afternoon. Traders
said some foreigners, who bought Japanese shares earlier this year were
shifting their portfolios to the US and Hong Kong because of the lack of
movement in the Tokyo market.
Japan Telecom fell Y60,000 to Y4.4m. Other telecommunication sector shares
were also weak, with DDI down Y5,000 to Y907,000 and Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone losing Y1,000 to Y885,000.
Fuji Photo Film, the film maker, gained Y50 to Y2,230 on reports that the
company had developed a floppy disk with a large storage capacity.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 34.40 to 22,249.92 in volume of 26.6m shares.
Aoyama Trading, the men's suits maker, rose Y50 to Y3,750.
Roundup
Profit-taking was one reason why a number of the regions markets fell
yesterday. Bombay was closed for a public holiday.
SYDNEY, already weak, slipped further after the diversified manufacturer,
Pacific Dunlop, reported an annual profit at the lower end of market
expectations. The All Ordinaries index closed 18.6 lower at 2,070.6, 1.7 per
cent lower on the week.
Pacific Dunlop lost 12 cents at ADollars 4.10. Its results were coupled with
the continuing sell-off of BTR Nylex as major influences as the market
dipped near the close. BTR Nylex fell 21 cents to ADollars 2.67.
BANGKOK fell on selling by retail investors ahead of the reopening of
parliament next week, the SET index closing 16.71 lower at 1,508.85, 2 per
cent lower on the week, in turnover of Bt10.51bn.
The finance sector, which shed 0.5 per cent, was the most active in Bt1.6bn
billion baht. There was some talk of a possible interest rate rise by
commercial banks.
HONG KONG's Hang Seng index slipped 5.96 to 10,145.02, 2.5 per cent up on
the week, but the spotlight again focused on mainland Chinese companies. The
H share index tumbled 38.52, or 2.5 per cent to at 1,478.09, on
profit-taking. On the week, the index was up 8 per cent and brokers said
that they did not expect the consolidation period to last long. This week's
rises were attributed to buying by overseas funds, and a follow-through from
speculative demand.
SINGAPORE closed easier but off the day's lows, the Straits Times
Industrials Index ending 4.27 lower at 2,299.96, mainly on selling of
shipyard stocks. The index was 1.3 per cent down on the week.
SEOUL hit profit-taking and the composite index lost 6.64 to 984.80 after
peaking at 1,002.72 in early trade. The index still finished 4.3 per cent
better on the week.
TAIPEI was nervous because of confusion over government policy toward
liquidity, but the weighted index managed to close up 58.62 at 6,987.20 in
thin turnover, down 0.3 per cent on the week.

FT  10 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Shock leaves brokers
scrambling to unload
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shock delivered to currency and bond markets by the US PPI figures
reverberated through the continent's equity bourses, writes Our Markets
Staff. Brokers in Madrid, unhealthily sensitive to stimuli recently, may
have been glad that bourse was closed for a holiday.
FRANKFURT ignored a weak bond market during the session to close the Dax
index 12.78 higher at 2,185.15, just 0.9 per cent down on the week; after
the US PPI news, traders scrambled to unload positions ahead of the weekend
and the Ibis-indicated Dax dropped to 2,155.58, 2.7 per cent lower than it
was seven days earlier.
The afternoon's big falls came in the senior, most liquid blue chips:
Allianz ended at DM2,428 after a session rise of DM23 to DM2,480; Deutsche
Bank, at DM719.50 after DM9.20 to DM732; and Daimler, at DM825.10 after
DM840, up DM7. There were similar performances from Siemens and Volkswagen.
Variations on the theme included;
Metallgesellschaft, weak on the session on a newspaper report that
restructuring costs had eroded part of its capital, matching its year's low
of DM175 in the post-bourse before ending at DM179;
Lufthansa, losing its pre-privatisation support on the session to close DM9
lower at DM197, but actually recovering to DM200 after hours; and
SAP, the computer software group, soon to be traded on Ibis, up DM23 to
DM803 on the session on the strength of this but, fortunately, not traded in
yesterday's post-bourse.
PARIS peaked at 1,993.47 and when the CAC 40 index dropped an initial 1.5
per cent in mid-afternoon on the US data, the French market still tried to
run its winners.
However, the CAC 40 carried on down, closing 2.2 per cent off its peak and
34.57 down on the day at 1,948.83, 3.5 per cent lower on the week; and the
general run of its outperformers lost their early enthusiasm.
Retailers still had some steam in them. Docks de France, which had a flurry
10 days ago on renewed rumours of a takeover bid by Sainsbury, the UK
supermarketeer, climbed another FFr20 to FFr797 after a block trade took
300,000 shares, or 2.5 per cent of its capital, through the market at
FFr800.
What dealers described as an upbeat outlook for the retailing sector also
lifted Comptoirs Modernes by FFr35 to FFr1,475; after hours, it produced
half year results which seemed more or less as expected.
Turnover was FFr4.1bn. Of the CAC 40 stocks, 39 fell and one was unchanged.
One of the biggest losers was Schneider, the electrical group, which added
the Belgian legal tribulations of its chairman to the general malaise and
dropped FFr12.10 to FFr387.40.
AMSTERDAM turned lower as worries about higher inflation and interest rates
were revived. The AEX index fell 2.65 to 413.19, for a 1.8 per cent fall on
the week.
Heineken, the brewer, jumped Fl 7, or 2.9 per cent, to Fl 244.50 after its
first half figures came in above expectations and the group forecast higher
full year profits. However, analysts noted that the rise was exaggerated by
a shortage of sellers.
HBG, the construction group, added Fl 4.50 to Fl 300.00 after reporting
higher first half net profits.
Royal Dutch fell Fl 2.70 to Fl 194.90, dragged down by the lower dollar,
while Akzo, the chemical group, lost Fl 4.40 to Fl 212.70.
ZURICH turned back after a firmer start in growing turnover with investors
anxious to square positions ahead of a long holiday weekend. The SMI index
lost 22.0 to 2,642.1, for a 1.1 per cent fall on the week.
Roche certificates gave up SFr140, or 2.2 per cent, to SFr6,185 after their
firm performance earlier in the week, and Ciba was marked SFr14 lower to
SFr790.
Nestle, which is to buy Unilever's German ice cream business, lost SFr12 to
SFr1,217.
Against the trend, Ascom bearers built on Thursday's 5.3 per cent jump, in
the wake of results, with a further SFr55 or 3.5 per cent rise to SFr1,645.
MILAN saw early gains erased as the market took its cue from other bourses,
and with the absence of the prime minister from the day's cabinet meeting
adding to worries over the cabinet's cohesion, and its ability to act
decisively to cut the budget deficit.
The Comit index fell 2.63 to 662.53, for a 3.3 per cent fall on the week;
but the real-time Mibtel index, reflecting the market's late weakness, fell
1.8 per cent to 10,447 after a day's high of 10,700.
Olivetti group shares were under pressure after news that police had seized
documents from the treasury ministry relating to a bid made by the company
for the supply of computers. Olivetti was L81, or 3.9 per cent, lower at
L2,006 and Cir, the holding company, gave up L58 to L1,983.
Insurers contained losses on expectations that they will benefit from
government plans to reform pensions. Ras was L258 lower at L23,843 and
Generali was L431 down at L40,796.
BRUSSELS saw strong first half figures from Union Miniere and the
polyurethane foam maker, Recticel, and the broad market fared better than
most.
The Bel-20 index ended down 5.66 at 1,453.99, above its low of 1,449.28 and
down 1.9 per cent on the week, in turnover of about BFr1.20bn.

FT  10 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Telecom leaves Tokyo wary of
over-supply - The Japan Tobacco listing is likely to be another casualty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not only has last week's listing of Japan Telecom, the country's third
largest telecommunications operator, left investors sitting on losses, but
it has also triggered worries among investors towards future initial public
offerings.
As a result, the biggest casualty is likely to be Japan Tobacco, which
floats more than Y900bn worth of stock next month. What worries investors is
that together with Japan Telecom, the listing will inject more equity into
the market than investors can handle.
The concern is that the Telecom listing has come at a time when underlying
confidence has been weakened and the supply and demand situation has
deteriorated. Such worries stem from continuing sales of shares by companies
and banks, which want to spruce up their profits ahead of half year book
closing at the end of the month. Another concern is that overseas investors,
the biggest buyers in the stock market rally earlier this year, have started
to question valuations of Japanese shares.
Banks have been especially active in the half-year end selling spree this
year, partly due to recent weakness in the bond market. As fund procurement
rates have risen in tandem with the increase in long term interest rates,
profit margins have been squeezed. The stagnant demand for loans has also
prompted lower profit margins as some banks have been forced to 'dump' loans
to companies. The decline in profits from loans, as a result, has forced
financial institutions to turn to the stock market for profits.
On the demand side, domestic institutions, which were expected to come back
to the market earlier this year, have remained cautious, although public
pension and insurance funds have been pumped into the market by the
government to support prices. Some blame the high valuations of stock
prices, while others argue that the chances of a triple dip in the economy
are still high.
The reversal in sentiment among overseas investors has been the fundamental
factor in the weakness in demand. Foreigners were the main buyers of
Japanese stocks due to expectations of a recovery in earnings and the
economy. However, many fund managers have lost their patience over the lack
of movement in prices, especially with a price/earnings ratio of more than
90 times for the Nikkei.
'Foreigners who started buying shares around 16,000 are questioning the
extent of the recovery discounted into current share prices,' says Mr Jason
James, strategist at James Capel. He adds that European and US investors are
once again looking to shift to the US and markets in south east Asia.
While earlier this year many overseas investors were expecting a sharp
earnings recovery due to restructuring and the fall in depreciation costs,
opposition to this theory is asserting itself.
Mr Alexander Kinmont, strategist at Morgan Stanley who is forecasting a mere
8.3 per cent rise in profits for the current year to next March, argues that
the effects of cost cutting will be muted since Japanese style restructuring
still frowns on aggressively cutting overhead.
He maintains that since depreciation only accounted for 3.27 per cent of
non-financial companies' sales in 1987 and 3.60 per cent last year, it can
hardly be the main reason for the profits plunge, while a decline in
depreciation over the next few years does not necessarily point to a sharp
recovery in corporate earnings, as some foreigners had hoped.
However, analysts are divided on the outlook for corporate earnings. Mr
James sees a 15 per cent rise in consolidated pre-tax profits for the
current business year and expects companies to revise their profit
projections upward in the coming earnings announcement season in November.
Some investors seem to agree with such views and stocks that are usually
active at the start of the earnings cycle have started to move. Basic
materials such as steels, cement and paper have gained ground and could
receive a further boost later in the cycle as commodity prices rise.
Mr Alan Livsey, strategist at Kleinwort Benson, believes that foreigners,
many of whom made the mistake of selling their holdings last autumn, do not
want to take the risk of making the same mistake again.
He says there is a historical case for not selling now. Looking back a few
decades, investors in the Tokyo market who have bought in November and sold
in May have seen far higher profits than those who have bought in May and
sold in October.
Meanwhile, fears over Tobacco persist among many investors. The bear
argument over the negative impact of the two JTs triggering another downward
spiral is supported by Nikko Research Institute, which claims that share
prices are placed under extreme pressure when equity financing by listed
companies is greater than 15 times the average daily turnover. The extra
injection of funds from the two issues will raise a total Y5,700bn,
substantially more than 15 times the current daily activity.
Mr James says, however, that investors, who have learned their lesson from
the East Japan Railway fiasco last year, have been selling futures to hedge
their portfolios ahead of the Tobacco listings, prompting arbitrage
unwinding.
The Tobacco flotation on October 27 will not cause the market to plunge like
last year's JR East listing, and could eventually trigger a rally. Although
the Nikkei index is likely to move in the 19,000-20,000 range over the next
month, share prices are likely to recover in November, as hedging in the
futures is unwound by institutions and with the expected spate of upward
earnings revisions following the listing.

FT  10 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: ICI stand out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chemicals leader ICI was one of the few London stocks to avoid the impact of
yesterday's discouraging US statistics after receiving a push from a leading
US securities house.
Goldman Sachs had published a substantial research document regarding the
global pick-up in bulk chemicals prices. The house cited - among others -
ethylene which rose from 18.3 cents per pound in June to a prospective 22.5
cents for September.
The US investment bank's chemicals analyst highlighted ICI as the main UK
beneficiary of a price rise. The company generates around half of its
profits from bulk chemicals and has also underperformed against the broader
market recently.
Helped also by some takeover talk, ICI shares rose 20 at one point but fell
back with the market to close 7 1/2 stronger at 828p. Turnover hit 3.8m
shares, a high figure in comparison with recent trading sessions.
BTR continued to head up the market's list of active stocks with turnover
topping 24m shares as the stock price responded to a big two way pull after
Thursday's dismal interim figures.
A burst of buying early in the session drove the shares up to the day's high
of 342p around midday, with fund managers at some of the big income funds
taking a hard look at what could well be substantial returns in the stock on
a fifteen-month view. It was pointed out that over that period the company,
which nows yields around 5 per cent, would produce three dividends in two
sets of results. 'At the end of the day, BTR remains a quality company,'
said one analyst.
The subsequent steep fall in the market left the shares 9 lower at 329p at
the close. The warrants also attracted renewed selling, the 93/4s closing 8
1/2 off at 36 1/2 p.
Cookson, whose excellent figures were overlooked in the aftermath of the BTR
debacle on Thursday, jumped 5 more to 264p.
Pharmaceuticals group Fisons shed 3 to 151p ahead of interim figures on
Tuesday which are expected to produce profits of around Pounds 35m down from
Pounds 42.3m a year ago. Reorganisation costs and a low pollen season in
Japan - which cut demand for hay fever drugs - are expected to hit
pharmaceuticals profits while continuing losses are expected in scientific
instruments.
Continued bid speculation helped pharmaceuticals groups Wellcome and Zeneca
resist the market pressure. The former held its ground at 696p while the
latter slipped only 3 to 835p.
Tobacco to insurance conglomerate BAT Industries held firm as UBS reiterated
a buy recommendation and Smith New Court confirmed its bullish stance with
some rivals suggesting it had upgraded to a buy from a hold. The shares were
up 14 at best and ended the day one better at 434p.
Ulster Television added 15 at 685p after producing encouraging figures. The
television group announced a 24.5 per cent hike in interim profits to Pounds
2.4m.
A sharp increase in profits from market research group Taylor Nelson saw the
shares improve 2 1/2 to 38 1/2 p.
A follow-through from disappointing car registration figures in the UK saw
Inchcape fall 9 to 436p.
Costain shares dipped 3 to 24 1/2 p after the dismal figures and the
projected sale of its US coal mining interests which analysts said could
fetch between Pounds 150m and Pounds 180m.
Bank shares were badly affected by worries that UK interest rates may soon
be on the way up. Lloyds were given the roughest ride in the market, the
shares sliding 18 to 552p.
Royal Bank of Scotland lost 15 to 421p on big turnover of 5.3m with
sentiment affected by news that Mr Peter Woods, the head of Royal's hugely
successful Direct Line insurance subsidiary, had sold more than 600,000
shares.
Willis Corroon came in for strong institutional support after a recent bout
of selling pressure, the stock price moving up 2 to 155 1/2 p on turnover of
10m.
Jeweller Asprey plunged to 178p after warning that group results for the
half year to September 30 would be significantly below current market
expectations and those for the corresponding period last year. The shares
recovered slightlyto close 110p lower at 200p.
A cautious annual statement from Dixons prompted concern over forthcoming
figures from Woolworths parent Kingfisher. The market had anticipated a
pre-tax figure between Pounds 90m and Pounds 95m but the Dixons statement

the downside. The shares fell 16 to 488p.
Auctioneer Christie's International fell 4 to 175p after disappointing

FT  10 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP peak in heavy trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was heavy activity in BP shares, which outperformed the market
throughout the day to touch an all-time high of 429p in mid-session, before
settling 2 easier 418p as the market became increasingly excited about this
Thursday's presentation to analysts. Turnover reached 8.9m shares.
Dealers were said to be expecting plenty of good news from BP on the
exploration front, particularly regarding its recent drilling success in
Colombia, via the Cupiagua gas field discovery.
And there are high hopes for more positive news from BP's operations west of
the Shetlands, as well as from Vietnam and Azerbaijan. Further details from
the Ciusiana oil field in Colombia are awaited.
Helping the stock continue its recent good progress yesterday was a
suggestion that one of the UK market's leading securities houses, said to be
Smith New Court, had published a positive note on BP. Another story in the
market was that BP may be considering buying in some of its own shares, to
mop up its growing cash flow, although analysts tended to disregard that
theory.
It was also announced that US holdings in BP have fallen to 20.65 per cent,
or 1.13bn shares, down from the 26 per cent-plus figure of early 1993. 'The
Americans have found a ready market for BP stock in the UK where underweight
funds have had to pay up and, more to the point are still paying up,' said
one oil analyst.

FT  10 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: US producer price data hit bonds and
equities - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unexpectedly large jump in August producer prices in the US, raising the
spectre of further rises ahead in the Federal Reserve's key interest rates,
hit UK financial markets very hard yesterday afternoon. Short-dated
government bonds, those most closely linked to base rate prospects, fell by
a quarter of a point while the longer dates which reflect deeper inflation
worries, collapsed by more than 1 1/2 points.
Early confidence in the equity market was wiped out by the setback in
government bond prices. A gain of plus 12 on the FT-SE 100 Share Index in
early afternoon had been replaced by a net fall of 40.7 points at the
closing reading of 3,139.3. At the day's low, the Footsie touched 3,134. The
September futures contract on the Footsie closed at around 3,125, after
trading at a substantial discount to the stock market for most of the
afternoon. The Dow Industrial Average was more than 30 points off in New
York when London went home for the day.
Most analysts admitted that the Footsie 3,100 mark would be at hazard on
Monday morning, when the UK's producer price numbers are due. Next week also
brings further important challenges to market sensitivity to inflation
prospects in the form of the US Consumer price index, expected on Tuesday,
and the Britain's Retail price index, which is due on Thursday.
There was little time in London for any disciplined reaction to the news
from the US that the August Producer price index had risen by 0.6 per cent
overall, compared with market forecasts of around 0.4 per cent. Sellers
poured into London's stock index futures market, and there was a good deal
of technical activity between futures and cash equities, with some negative
arbitraging operations involving buying the futures and selling the
underlying stocks.
Substantial losses were suffered by the retail and consumer stocks which are
directly in line for the negative effects of higher interest rates. BTR lost
further ground as the market continued to react badly to the half time
trading report. Bank shares, too, suffered sharp losses as investors weighed
the prospects for their bad debt customers should domestic interest rates
begin to move higher. The picture was no better across the range of
industrial sectors, where building and construction issues also felt the
threat of higher base rates.
While the focus was on the blue chip stocks which make up the Footsie 100
list, the reverberations reached well down into the list of stocks in the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which closed 25.8 off at 3,736. Seaq-reported trading
volume of 642.3m shares compared with 668.5m on Thursday when retail
business returned a value total of Pounds 1.3bn.
The first half of the trading session appeared fairly confident. Market
analysts remained optimistic for a further rise in the stock market over the
medium term, although most agreed that UK base rates would rise well before
the end of the year.
The losses in US and in British government bonds yesterday afternoon hit
hard at a stock market where worries about inflation have increased over the
past week. The FT-SE 100 Index has fallen by nearly 2.6 per cent over the
week and appears likely to fall further. The loss on the FT-SE Mid 250 Index
was held to only 1.4 per cent, reflecting the focus on the blue chip stocks
which suffered from the fall-out in stock index futures.
However, not all the market specialists were negative. Some believe that,
while next week will inevitably bring further pain, the UK stock market may
still move higher before the end of the year. Base rate rises have been
built into market forecasts and, in spite of this week's shocks, company
earnings are still expected to continue rising until well into next year.

<TEXT>
The sharp rise in US producer prices brought widespread selling in the
London derivatives markets yesterday afternoon. The September contract on
the Footsie collapsed to show a discount of around 15 points to the cash
market for much of the afternoon - fair value premium is worth about three
points at present. And little recovery had been seen by the close when it
stood at 3,125. Heavy arbitrage business was reported. Of the 22,149 Footsie
contracts traded, around 600 represented roll-overs into the December
contract.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Dollar tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar fell over two pfennigs on foreign exchanges yesterday as August
PPI figures in the US renewed market worries about inflation, writes Philip
Gawith.
The 0.6 per cent rise in producer inflation, the largest rise since October
1990, was worse than market expectations. The dollar was sold on fears that
US interest rates would have to rise again, probably causing a fall in US
asset prices.
The dollar fell from DM1.5620 before the figures to a low of DM1.5345 during
New York trading. Against the yen it was more stable, closing at Y99.26
compared to a high before the figures of Y99.62.
Sterling finished higher against the weaker dollar, closing at Dollars
1.5509, up from Dollars 1.54 before the figures. It lost 1 1/2 pfennigs
against the stronger D-Mark, closing at DM2.3914
The D-Mark was generally firmer in Europe after the news, finishing against
the lira at L1,019 from L1,016.
The market's sharp reaction was partly explained by the fact that it had
spent most of the week waiting for the figure.
Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank in London, commented: 'It brings
back to the attention of the market whether the Fed is tightening quickly
enough to combat inflationary pressures.'
It also renewed attention, he said, on the question of relations between the
White House and the Fed. Clearly President Clinton does not want rates to be
raised before important mid-term congressional elections in November.
When the Fed raised the discount rate on August 16, by 50 basis points to 4
per cent, analysts took the Fed's comments at the time to mean that rates
would not need to be raised at least until November.
Should, however, the market take the PPI, and other indicators, to suggest
that earlier action from the Fed is required, the dollar could be heavily
sold if political constraints are seen as preventing this course. The next
FOMC meeting is on September 27.
Concern about the outlook for US rates spilled over into UK and European
markets with all maturities losing ground. Short sterling suffered a sharp
correction after the large gains on Thursday.
Although there seems little prospect of UK rates rising soon, interest rate
markets will find it difficult to flourish so long as US bonds remain under
a cloud.
The December short sterling contract lost six basis points to close at
93.67. The equivalent euromark contract fell by five basis points to finish
at 94.80.
In the UK money markets, three month sterling LIBOR was unchanged at 5 15/32
per cent. In its daily operations the Bank of England provided UK money
markets with Pounds 246m assistance at established rates, and Pounds 85m
late assistance, after forecasting a Pounds 400m shortage.
Elsewhere, trading in the Swedish krona was volatile, ranging between
SKr4.9255 and SKr4.8910 against the D-Mark. Early weakness flowed from
rating agency Moody's expressing concern about the speed of debt
accumulation.
In Germany Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, said the growth of
German M3 - down to an annualised rate of 9.8 per cent in July, from 20 per
cent earlier in the year - had slackened, but was still too high.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Economic confidence lifts
metals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The global economic outlook has not been so favourable since the 1980s, said
RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, this week. And metals prices are
certainly reflecting this view. Commodity and investment funds are piling
into the metals markets, often ignoring the fact that the fundamental
outlook for some materials - zinc and nickel for example - is not that
bright.
On the other hand, most analysts suggest that the present buoyancy in the
aluminium and lead prices can be justified.
Aluminium's price reached a fresh three and a half-year peak of USDollars
1,591 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange yesterday. Aluminium alloy, an
LME contract launched two years ago to provide material mainly for the car
manufacturers, reached a record level. Earlier in the week, lead moved to
its highest price for two years.
Buyers moved in for aluminium yesterday after the LME reported another
substantial fall in stocks: 17,000 tonnes. Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord
Minnett, pointed out that this followed a drop of 104,000 tonnes in July,
which was the biggest monthly fall since the LME started trading aluminium.
But he warned that the market continued to rely on producers keeping to the
output cuts made earlier this year and at present prices they were being
severely tempted to restore production. Aluminium for delivery in three
months closed last night on the LME at USDollars 1.586.75 a tonne, up
Dollars 22.25 compared with a week ago.
Lead, used mainly in batteries, also benefits from a healthy automotive
market. Already lead is the best-performing LME metal since the world
economic recovery began. Its price has risen by more than 70 per cent from
the bottom of the trough in October last year from USDollars 357 a tonne to
Dollars 625 at one point this week.
Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain &amp; Co., pointed out that seasonal demand
from the battery producers, who account for more than 70 per cent of lead
demand, was helping tighten the market, as was a fall in exports from China,
Russia and Kazakhstan.
Gold bulls had a good week. First, they pushed the price through tough
technical resistance at USDollars 390 a troy ounce and, after this gave way,
moved on to press against the barrier at Dollars 392. Gold closed in London
last night at Dollars 391.85, some Dollars 4.60 up from Friday's close last
week.
Meanwhile, the coffee market had a volatile week with prices rising close to
8 1/2 year highs set in July when Brazil's crop was damaged by frost.
The trigger for a surge in prices came on Wednesday from the Brazilian
government which hinted that it was reviewing its policy of auctioning off
government-held stocks. Brasilia has so far sold 2.7m bags by weekly auction
in order to dampen domestic prices and inflation.
However, the policy has failed to push down internal prices and, with 5m
bags of the stockpile still to sell, the government is expected to abandon
its plans. The abandonment of the auction is likely to be bullish for the
international coffee market as it will further restrict supply in an already
tight market.
Prices reacted by surging to Dollars 4,060 a tonne on Wednesday, but traders
felt the market had overreacted and prices dropped on Thursday to Dollars
3,920 a tonne before moving back to Dollars 3,955 by the close in London
last night, Dollars 115 up from the close on Friday last week.

FT  10 SEP 94 / International Company News: State calls halt to bid for BPA
</HEADLINE>

   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Portuguese government last night vetoed a Es132bn (Dollars 832m) hostile
bid for a controlling stake of 40 per cent of Banco Portugues do Atlantico
(BPA), the country's second largest bank, by Banco Comercial Portugues
(BCP).
The finance ministry said it blocked the bid partly because control of BPA
by BCP, the fifth biggest bank, could destabilise the financial system. The
new group would have controlled 24 per cent of Portugal's banking assets.
The takeover would have also interrupted the privatisation of BPA, according
to a government statement. The bank has been privatised in stages since 1990
but the state still holds 24.5 per cent.
The core shareholders of BPA, a group of 13 Portuguese companies which own
28.7 per cent, have said the government is committed to giving them
preferential treatment in the privatation process. But BCP has urged the
government to sell its holding to the highest bidder.
The government decision is expected to draw strong criticism from financial
circles for intervening in the free operation of the market. 'The government
is seeking to hold back a trend towards the merger of banking groups that is
already widespread in the rest of Europe,' said Mr Vitor Contancio, a former
governor of the Bank of Portugal and member of the opposition Socialist
Party.

Anglovaal Industries, the industrial arm of Anglovaal, the South African
mining house, increased attributable profit for the year to June by 18 per
cent to R407.1m (Dollars 110.6m) from R343.7m for the previous year.
Pre-tax profits rose 8 per cent to R763.8m from R704.4m, but an 8 per cent
decrease in tax paid to R220.3m from R238.8m helped to lift bottom-line
earnings.
Turnover rose 16 per cent to R9.67bn from R8.32bn, of which 5 per cent was
the result of acquisitions. The dividend was increased to 230 cents from 195
cents. However, due to reduced cash resources and additional borrowings, net
financing costs on the year were R14.4m, a sharp reversal from the previous
year's R18m in net interest income.

FT  10 SEP 94 / International Company News: Union Carbide severs Indian link
</HEADLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union Carbide, the US chemical company, is to cut its links with India 10
years after the world's worst industrial disaster at its pesticide plant in
Bhopal.
The group is selling its controlling 50.9 per cent stake in Union Carbide
India to McLeod Russell India, part of the Calcutta-based B. M. Khaitan tea
and engineering group, for Rs2.9bn (Dollars 92.3m).
Carbide, facing criminal proceedings in Indian courts for the disaster which
killed more than 2,500 people and seriously injured more than 30,000, had
been permitted by the Indian Supreme Court in February to sell its stake in
Union Carbide India to the highest bidder. McLeod Russell's bid of Rs175 per
share was the highest received.
The court said Rs650m of the sale would go to the Bhopal Hospital Trust for
the building of a hospital to treat the victims of the gas disaster. The
trust, headed by Sir Ian Percival, has received Rs188m from Union Carbide
India for the hospital. Another Rs500m would be due to the government as
capital gains tax. The rest of money would be held in an escrow account
until the criminal cases pending against Carbide were resolved.
The US parent was forced to sell some of its businesses worldwide to pay
Dollars 470m in compensation to the victims, after a settlement was reached
in 1989 between the company and the Indian government, following four years
of litigation.
The Carbide sale was negotiated by Bombay-based Creditcapital Finance
Corporation and the State Bank of India, India's largest nationalised bank.
Other bidders included Mr Nusli Wadia, head of Bombay Dyeing, the textiles
and chemicals group whose bid was made in conjunction with the UK-based
Eveready Battery company, a subsidiary of Ralston Purina, which bought
Carbide's battery business worldwide, except in India, after the gas
tragedy.

FT  10 SEP 94 / International Company News: Volvo finalising plans to cede
part of Renault stake

<TEXT>
Volvo, the Swedish motor group, is understood to be finalising plans to cede
almost half its 20 per cent stake in Renault as a precursor to the French
company's privatisation.
Renault, commenting on a report in yesterday's Le Figaro newspaper,
confirmed it was approaching the end of talks with Volvo over the
dismantling of their cross-shareholding agreement following the decision
late last year by the Swedish group's shareholders to block the merger of
the two companies.
However, it said the final details of the deal had not been agreed,
including how many Renault shares Volvo would sell.
'We both want to find a way of ending what's left of the old agreement,'
Renault said 'Discussions are continuing.'
An amicable divorce from Volvo is seen as an essential component of the
French government's plans to float a large part of its 80 per cent holding
in the motor group.
If Renault is privatised before November 30 - which looks unlikely - Volvo
has agreed to swap a 12 per cent stake in Renault for that company's 45 per
cent holding in Volvo Trucks.
If the privatisation takes place after that date, the Swedish company has
the option of buying back the Volvo Trucks stake for FFr4.5bn (Dollars 830m)
and disposing of its own Renault stake separately.
The French government is expected shortly to announce whether Renault or the
Assurances Generales de France (AGF) insurance group will be the next
candidate in its state asset sale programme. AGF's management has lobbied
hard for a speedy privatisation. But the consensus among analysts is that
Renault is likely to go first, provided the government can clarify the Volvo
issue.
Many observers expect an announcement to be made over the next few days as
Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, has just received the official
valuations of Renault.
The motor group is believed to be worth between FFr40bn and FFr44bn but,
given the fragile state of the French stock market, the authorities would be
expected to pitch the price of an eventual issue at the lower end of that
range.
Volvo declined to comment on the French press report. However, it noted that
if Renault was valued at more than FFr37.5bn it would be more advantageous
for it to sell its Renault shares separately than to agree to the fixed
exchange.

Australian Pay Television, the consortium of powerful media and
telecommunication interests which was formed to pursue pay-TV opportunities
in the country, is to be disbanded.
The consortium included Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Limited, Mr Kerry Packer's
Nine Network, and Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications group.
The Ten network, which runs Australia's other commercial channel, withdrew
from the grouping in July.
Yesterday, Mr Frank Blount, Telecom chief executive, said it had 'become
increasingly clear that the consortium, having failed to win a satellite
licence, has not reached consensus on a business plan for alternative
delivery for pay-TV services in Australia'.
Pay-TV is not yet available to Australian households. However, Australis,
holder of one of the satellite licences, has pledged to have a system ready
this year.

FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Virtuality sees 1995 profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Virtuality Group, the designer and manufacturer of virtual reality computer
games which floated in October, yesterday forecast that it would move into
profit next year.
In the six months to June it recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 695,000,
after spending Pounds 880,000 on development, compared with a profit of
Pounds 65,000.
But Mr David Payne, chairman, stated:'I am confident that the existing core
business and the signing of further licensing agreements will enable
Virtuality to report a profitable outcome for the 1995 financial year.'
First half sales jumped to Pounds 4.12m (Pounds 2.44m) as a result of unit
sales of entertainment systems more than doubling to 184, against 75 and a
total of 183 sold during 1993.
Mr Jon Waldern, chief executive, said sales of its second generation
machines, introduced in January, were on target. The second half should
benefit from the recent launch of its second generation seated machine and
from first sales of a low cost system developed with IBM for commercial
users of virtual reality.
Virtuality's shares, which were floated at 170p, reached a high of 364p
before falling back on worries about cheap competition. They slipped 2p to
197p yesterday.
Mr Waldern dismissed announcements by potential rivals as 'a lot of hot
air'.
'Nobody has brought together a whole product that matches our products in
the arcade market.'
He said Virtuality was also well-placed to take advantage of the potential
home market when the computer games manufacturers launched their new
generation of machines.

FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Packaging side helps Molins up to Pounds
8.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An improved performance by the packaging division and lower interest
payments helped Molins, the machinery group, to report a 10 per cent
increase for the first half, in spite of a fall in operating profit on the
core tobacco machinery side.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 8m to Pounds 8.8m for the six months
to end June, on turnover ahead at Pounds 98.6m (Pounds 85.2m).
Chinese demand for cigarette making equipment boosted the tobacco machinery
division's turnover from Pounds 52.2m to Pounds 61m. 'The engine of growth
has been the Chinese market,' said Mr Peter Greenwood, managing director,
'with continuing strong demand.'
Operating profits from tobacco machinery fell from Pounds 8.4m to Pounds
8.1m. This was partly because sales of spares declined as a result of the
cigarette price war in the US.
In addition the net pension credit, following a repayment to the group of
Pounds 11.8m last year, fell from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 1.4m.
The repayment helped the group to cut borrowings from Pounds 18.4m to Pounds
3.3m. Net interest payable for the half was down from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds
500,000.
The US based packaging machinery division, which concentrates on corrugated
board, lifted operating profits from Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 1.2m. Turnover
rose to Pounds 37.2m (Pounds 32.6m).
Mr Greenwood said the company was still not happy with margins, 'but at
least we can point to progress, driven by improved conditions in North
America.'
The group is diversifying into food machinery, and first deliveries of a
Pounds 6m contract with a multinational company for food machinery begin
later this year. 'This is a first step into what we hope will be a new
market for us,' said Mr Greenwood. 'We are building on our expertise in
machinery that can handle delicate materials at high speed.'
Earnings per share were 22.2p (20.1p), and the interim dividend is raised
from 4.9p to 5.3p.

FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Premier Consolidated hit by oil price fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Premier Consolidated Oilfields, the independent oil company, raised its
production by 26 per cent in the first half of 1994. But a parallel fall in
the oil price, of 26 per cent, left operating profits down slightly over the
period.
The company earned Pounds 8.5m to June 30, compared with Pounds 8.7m, while
at the pre-tax level profits were down at Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 6.2m).
After-tax profits at Pounds 3.4m were down by Pounds 1.2m due to adverse
currency movements and slightly higher tax.
No dividend is being proposed, but Mr Charles Jamieson, the chief executive,
said that Premier 'is working towards it.'
Capital expenditure over the period was Pounds 17m, and gearing remained
around 50 per cent, with net borrowings of Pounds 64m.
Premier recently became the first foreign oil company to sign an oil
production agreement in post-communist Albania. The deal, with Albpetrol,
the state oil company, provides for enhancement of the Patos Marinze fields
in the south of the country, and a development well at Dumre.
The company has also had exploration successes in Tunisia and Pakistan, and
a testing programme is in progress offshore Cambodia.
Premier's current production is over 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day,
and this is expected to rise to 20,000 barrels by the end of next year as
developments at Wytch Farm, Fife and Qadirpur come on stream.
Mr Jamieson said: 'We are exposing our shareholders to considerable upside
through low cost offshore developments.'

FT  10 SEP 94 / International Company News: Groupe Bull widens US computer
ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Groupe Bull, the troubled French computer company, yesterday announced plans
to form strategic alliances with two US groups, Motorola and Tandem
Computers, to prepare for privatisation.
Mr Thierry Breton, deputy chief executive, confirmed that Bull had concluded
negotiations for a technological agreement with Motorola, the world leader
in mobile communications technology, and was in advanced talks with Tandem,
maker of fault-tolerant computers.
He said Bull was considering forging similar alliances with other partners,
some of whom might take minority stakes in the group and participate in its
privatisation. It is not thought that either of the US companies would take
an equity stake in Bull.
The privatisation of Bull has been clouded by uncertainty due to its
financial problems. However, Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, chairman,
forecast Bull could return to the black at an operating level this year
after halving its interim net loss to FFr843m (Dollars 157.27m) for the
first half of 1994 from FFr1.98bn in the same period of 1993.
The French government has invited banks to tender to act as advisers on the
sale of Bull and is expected in November to ask potential noyaux durs, or
hard core shareholders, to step forward as the first stage towards selling
its stake in a series of share sales.
Last week, a Franch satirical magazine alleged that Bull lost FFr1bn of
computer sales in 1989 and 1990 through illegal trafficking by employees.
Mr Alain Gomez, chairman of Thomson, the state-controlled electronics group,
yesterday called on the French government to recapitalise his company in
preparation for the proposed merger of the Thomson-CSF defence electronics
business with the Thomson holding company.
Mr Gomez said at a conference that a recapitalisation was essential if
Thomson was to be privatised.

FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Ulster TV up 25% to Pounds 2.45m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growth in advertising revenue pushed the pre-tax profits of Ulster
Television up by 25 per cent in the six months to the end of June to Pounds
2.45m.
The Northern Ireland broadcaster increased advertising revenue by 16.1 per
cent to Pounds 14.1m, a rate of growth more than double that achieved by the
ITV system as a whole.
The growth was influenced, said Mr John McGuckian, the Ulster chairman, by a
share of viewing that continued to be the highest of any television channel
in the UK and the fact that consumer expenditure in the recession had held
up better in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the UK.
Current trading continued to be healthy and the television market in the UK
was strengthening as a result of growing confidence in recovery. 'We expect
that this will be reflected in the forthcoming 1995 negotiations this autumn
with those advertisers on annual agreements,' Mr McGuckian said.
Ulster Television also reaffirmed its intention to apply, with partners, for
a cable television licence for Northern Ireland.
Turnover for the six months was Pounds 15m, an increase of 13.6 per cent.
Earnings per share rose from 6.25p to 15.6p and the interim dividend rises
from 6.25p to 7.5p.
Investment income at Pounds 204,000 was significantly lower than the Pounds
641,000 last year, reflecting lower deposit and dividend income, but will
realise an exceptional pre-tax gain of Pounds 860,000 in the full year from
the sale of part of its stake in SES, the Luxembourg-based satellite system.
The share price rose 15p to close at 685p.

FT  10 SEP 94 / International Company News: Electrolux plans Dollars 50m
investment in SE Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electrolux, the world's largest producer of household appliances, has
underscored its new focus on emerging markets with a Dollars 50m investment
programme in the fast-growing south-east Asia region.
Mr Christer Forsstrom, senior vice-president, said: 'Our objective is to be
one of the top three suppliers of white goods in the Asean region by the
year 2000.'
The programme, which will rely heavily on advertising to promote Electrolux
brands, will begin in Thailand before being expanded to include Malaysia,
Singapore and Indonesia.
It is in line with the group's target of doubling its Asian sales from
SKr4.57bn (Dollars 585.9m) in 1993 over the next five years. Electrolux said
there was an emerging class of educated, urbanised Asian consumers with
rapidly rising disposable income which provided it with a big new sales
opportunity.
It cited predictions that in Thailand alone, the number of urban households
would leap from 3.9m in 1990 to 8.2m in the year 2000.
The company said it had already widened its distribution network and it had
spent the past two years adapting a wide range of products to meet Asian
needs and tastes.
Electrolux said it expected annual demand growth in emerging markets,
including south-east Asia, China and India, to be at least three times the 2
per cent level it forecast for its mature US and European markets.

FT  10 SEP 94 / International Company News: Heineken profits rise 15% at six
months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Heineken yesterday said it lifted net profit before extraordinary items by
15.6 per cent in the first half, in spite of a stagnation in the volume of
beer sold.
The Dutch brewer attributed the rise to a stronger performance by its
premium brands, such as Heineken, Amstel and Buckler, which command higher
prices and generate higher profit margins than the standard beers in its
international portfolio of brands.
Net profit before extraordinaries rose to Fl 254.5m (Dollars 144.6m) from Fl
220.1m a year earlier. Turnover was up 3.9 per cent at Fl 4.69bn compared
with Fl 4.52bn in the same period of 1993.
Total net profit was lifted to Fl 313.1m by an extraordinary gain of Fl
58.6m from the sale of a stake in Bols Benelux, the spirits joint venture.
Heineken said profit from normal business operations would rise at roughly
the same rate in the second half as in the first six months.
The company gave no figure for volume sales by hectolitre, but said this was
unchanged from a year earlier, excluding the consolidation of new companies
in Switzerland and New Zealand.
The flatness of sales was due mainly to stagnant conditions in Europe, where
demand was constrained by economic recession and inclement spring weather.
Beer consumption fell in the Netherlands, Italy and France, but was higher
in Spain and Greece.
Heineken reported strong exports to long-established markets such as the US,
where turnover rose by 9 per cent, as well as to relatively newer markets
such as China, where exports surged by 50 per cent.
The company is planning to step up its investment in Asia Pacific to benefit
from the rapid expansion of the region's beer market. 'We have several irons
in the fire and we expect to be able to provide more information before the
end of the year,' Mr Karel Vuursteen, chairman, said.

FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Vinten in the black at Pounds 9.06m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vinten, the international manufacturer and supplier of photographic,
broadcast and surveillance products, yesterday reported interim pre-tax
profits of Pounds 9.06m, compared with a losses of Pounds 1.71m after taking
account of a Pounds 7.27m exceptional charge.
Acquisitions made in 1993, favourable trading conditions and the elimination
of loss-making activities, including the electro-optics operations, helped
lift trading profits by 59 per cent to Pounds 9.52m (Pounds 6m) on turnover
which advanced by 7 per cent to Pounds 46.7m (Pounds 43.7m).
Earnings per share of 18.4p compare with losses of 7.2p and the interim
dividend rises to 2.4p (2.1p).
Mr Malcolm Baggott, group chief executive, said the results, which were
ahead of market expectations, represented 'an outstanding performance.' The
shares closed 19p higher at 502p.
The profit advance was led by the photographic business, which increased its
profit contribution by 48 per cent to Pounds 5.24m (Pounds 3.54m) in
turnover up 30 per cent to Pounds 21m (Pounds 16.1m). The latest period
included a full contribution from Bogen Photo which was acquired in April
last year and a particularly strong performance by Gruppo Manfrotto.
The broadcast business, which comprises Vinten Broadcast and Bexel which
reported substantially improved results, more than doubled its profits to
Pounds 2.89m (Pounds 1.24m) on turnover which grew by 7 per cent to Pounds
16.3m (Pounds 15.3m). Trading profits were boosted by cost reductions and by
the acquisition of Total Spectrum Manufacturing in June last year.
Surveillance, the old core Vinten business, managed to increase turnover by
a more modest 2 per cent to Pounds 9.35m (Pounds 9.17m) although profits at
Pounds 1.4m were slightly down on the unusually high Pounds 1.69m in 1993.
Vinten's cash flow was again very strong and net debt fell by Pounds 10.7m
to Pounds 700,000 resulting in negligible gearing at the end of June.
COMMENT
Vinten's transformation from a small domestic defence orientated business
into an international company with three main business activities is
complete and the group is now beginning to reap the rewards. Bolstered by
shrewd acquisitions and timely disposals the trading margin in the latest
period was a very comfortable 20.4 per cent. Perhaps the biggest question
facing the management is what to do for an encore. With Pounds 29m of cash
in the balance sheet at the half year and virtually no gearing the
management has plenty of flexibility. Building a fourth leg to the business
looks like a reasonable option. In the meantime analysts were upgrading
their full year pre-tax profit forecasts yesterday to around Pounds 18m
producing earnings of about 36.8p. Despite yesterday's rise the shares are
trading on a prospective p/e of 13.6 and still look good value.

FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Broad-based growth lifts Christies to
Pounds 8.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Broad-based growth in all its main salerooms helped Christies International,
the auctioneers, lift first half pre-tax profits by 15 per cent to Pounds
8.13m.
Total auction sales rose by 19 per cent to Pounds 390m in the six months to
June 30 compared with the same period last year, although this was below the
Pounds 399m achieved in the second half of 1993.
Furniture, oriental art, old masters, books and wine all produced sales
increases of more than 25 per cent; the New York, Hong Kong and South
Kensington salerooms all saw rises of 19 per cent or more.
Sir Anthony Tennant, chairman, said sales planned for the forthcoming
season, which included consignments such as a Leonardo da Vinci manuscript,
were encouraging. But it was too soon to predict second half sales.
Christies continued to devote 'substantial resources' to developing its
presence in east Asia and Latin America, he said. It became the first
western auction house with a presence in China, opening an office in
Shanghai earlier this year. Spring sales in Hong Kong grew by 50 per cent.
Mr Peter Blythe, deputy finance director, said Christies would use the
office in Shanghai to raise its profile in China before making decisions
about further investments.
Total auction revenues rose by 21 per cent from Pounds 71m to Pounds 59m.
This was slightly more than auction sales, mainly because of an increase
last March in the buyers' premium, a commission charged to buyers.
Competition for major consignments meant that auction commission as a
proportion of sales remained under pressure and costs had been pushed
higher. Administrative expenses were up from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds 26m
while auction, print and other costs rose to Pounds 49.3m (Pounds 39.1m).
Remuneration costs also increased, partly because of recruitment in the
Asia-Pacific region and Latin America.
Spink and Son, the fine art dealer acquired last April, contributed Pounds
10.6m to sales against Pounds 5.7m last time, while its operating profits
dropped from Pounds 178,000 to Pounds 51,000.
Earnings per share increased by 13 per cent to 2.84p (2.51p).
The interim is unchanged at 0.5p.

FT  10 SEP 94 / International Company News: Cray revamps production lines

<TEXT>
Cray Research, the world's leading supercomputer company, plans to revamp
its manufacturing operations to speed production. The initiative will cut
382 jobs, plus about 1,000 temporary lay-offs.
The company said yesterday it would temporarily suspend some production
operations in Wisconsin to install new equipment and 1,000 workers would be
idle for up to eight weeks.
Cray said it would take a charge in the fourth quarter of about Dollars
8.5m, or 25 cents a share, to cover severance charges and costs for idle
production.
Cray is facing competition from makers of massively parallel supercomputers
that are less expensive than traditional supercomputers. IBM's entry into
the market has increased competitive pressures on Cray.
Mr John Carlson, Cray chairman and chief executive, said the new
manufacturing system would cut production time in half, to about 16 weeks,
reduce inventories and cut costs.
'We are retooling our operations unit to serve tomorrow's market place and
to grow,' Mr Carlson said in a letter to employees. The actions are
'unavoidable,' he said. 'Our customers have choices today they didn't have
just a few years ago.
'If we don't reduce the cost of our products to customers, they will simply
do business with suppliers who can. We must grow; it is our only hope for a
successful future.'

FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Weather checks James Beattie performance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Announcing a static first half pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.27m, against
Pounds 1.22m, Sir Eric Pountain, chairman of James Beattie, the Midlands
department store group, said performance had been depressed by the weather.
Although total sales for the six months to July 31 were up by 9 per cent to
Pounds 40.8m (Pounds 37.4m) this reflected new space; on a like for like
basis sales were only 2.6 per cent ahead.
'The opening and closing weeks of the half year brought difficult trading
conditions as we suffered from the extremes of weather,' said Sir Eric.
After capital expenditure of Pounds 2.2m investments stood at Pounds 19.7m
at July 31 against Pounds 19.3m a year earlier.
Earnings per share came out at 1.8p (1.73p). The interim dividend is a
same-again 1.5p.

FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: World of Leather plans faster growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Improved trading during 1994 has encouraged World of Leather, the USM-quoted
furniture retailer, to accelerate its growth plans.
It is also returning to the dividend list with an interim payment of 0.75p.
The company plans to take the present 29 stores to 45 within the next three
years.
To finance the expansion it is seeking a net Pounds 2.8m by way of a 1-for-2
rights issue of 4.02m shares at 75p. The issue is underwritten by Beeson
Gregory, the company's broker.
The company also announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 341,000 for the first
half of 1994, compared with Pounds 71,000 last time and full year losses of
Pounds 121,000.
Turnover advanced by 10 per cent from Pounds 14m to Pounds 15.5m.
Profits were helped by margins being maintained and by the lack of last
time's exceptional charge of Pounds 134,000 relating to the settlement of a
dispute with a contractor.
The directors are not taking up all their entitlements, resulting in their
aggregate holdings falling from 62 per cent to 42 per cent.
The company is seeking to move up to a full listing.
Earnings per share came out at 3.3p (0.9p).

FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Too many chasing too little - The problems
facing the UK contractors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of the worst financial results to be published by Britain's
construction companies were announced this week.
The contracting arms of Wimpey, John Laing, Amec and Costain between them
produced a profit of just Pounds 8.3m from a combined turnover of more than
Pounds 1.5bn in the first six months of this year.
Published profits would have been even worse but for the inclusion by Wimpey
and Costain of interest earned on advance payments for construction work.
John Laing and Amec, which did not include interest, managed only to break
even on a combined turnover of Pounds 834m.
Annual UK construction output fell by 12 per cent between 1990 and the end
of 1993. Contractors which won work during that period on lossmaking or
non-existent margins to boost cash flows are now paying the price.
The scale of the downturn has prompted renewed calls for mergers and
acquisitions to rationalise a UK industry which still has too many companies
chasing too little work.
Mr Martin Laing, chief executive of John Laing, has blamed banks for helping
to sustain over-capacity in the industry, propping up UK contractors which
would otherwise have failed during the recession.
But reducing the number of general contractors will be difficult to achieve,
says Mr Alan Cockshaw, Amec's chairman. Many balance sheets have been sapped
during the recession, while companies which can afford it 'will be reluctant
to purchase skills they already possess simply to reduce capacity and
benefit competitors as much as themselves.'
UK contracting margins, therefore, are likely to remain depressed with
construction demand expected to rise only modestly in the next two years.
Companies like Laing, Amec, Wimpey and Costain, therefore, are looking to
international work and private investment in infrastructure to increase
profitability of their contracting operations.
Competition in overseas markets, however, is also tough and likely to become
increasingly so, as contractors in other countries, particularly in east
Asia, develop new skills.
South Korea, when it began its nuclear power programme 15 years ago,
imported up to 90 per cent of the value of the works. Today imports have
been cut to 10 per cent while Korean construction companies have broken into
international markets, particularly in the Middle East, where they have been
highly competitive.
Martin Laing says: 'It has long been recognised that being proficient in
pouring concrete and erecting steel is not enough and that British and other
international companies need to bring something else to the party if they
are to be successful in overseas markets.
'Far Eastern countries have shown themselves very quick to learn new skills
which they then use to win work in other export markets, further increasing
competition.'
Laing and other large British contractors in a bid to resolve this dilemma
are pursuing privately-financed domestic and international infrastructure
projects where returns, because of the investment risks involved, are
expected to be much higher than for traditional contracting.
Europistas, the Spanish toll road company in which Laing has an 18 per cent
interest, is expected to generate dividends this year of Pounds 3.4m,
against a book cost of Pounds 3m. The group's five per cent stake in a
Malaysian power station project is expected to yield returns of at least 15
to 20 per cent from dividends, the construction management contract and the
increased value of its equity.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, this week argued that rates of
return on privately-financed UK infrastructure projects will need to be
between 10 and 15 per cent if investors are to persuaded to support them.
This figure, he admits, is higher than the British government wishes to
concede, although the 'gap between us has narrowed.'
He is strongly supported by Martin Laing, who says contractors with
housebuilding operations, such as Wimpey, Amec and Laing, can choose to
invest their money elsewhere if the returns offered on UK private
infrastructure projects are insufficient.
Laing has recently been buying UK housing land on the basis of achieving an
operating margin of between 10 and 12 per cent, which would produce a return
on capital of about 20 per cent, says Mr Jim Armstrong, the finance
director.
British infrastructure investments will also have to compete with
international projects seeking private investment, such as the Pounds 300m
first phase of privately-financed light rail system in Kuala Lumpur in which
Taylor Woodrow has taken a 15 per ent stake.
Contractors such as Taylor Woodrow have taken the lead in bidding
individually and forming consortia to tender for privately-financed UK
roads, railways, hospitals, prisons and student accommodation. Companies,
however, will need sound balance sheets if they are to make headway in this
market.
Laing, which had net cash of Pounds 16.2m at the end of June is more
advanced than many of its rivals in establishing a portfolio of private
infrastructure investments. These include the Pounds 300m privately-financed
new Severn bridge, which it is building jointly with GTM Entrepose of
France.
The problem for shareholders is that projects are unlikely to start making
significant returns until the mid to late 1990s. Meanwhile general
contracting margins will remain depressed and construction companies will
have to continue to rely on a recovering UK housing market to bail them out.

FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Rise in continental car production lifts
Laird
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Laird Group, the automotive components and building products manufacturer,
saw underlying pre-tax profits improve by 17 per cent to Pounds 23.9m in the
first half helped by a recovery in continental car production in May and
June. If last year's Pounds 3.1m exceptional credit is included, profits
rose by just Pounds 300,000.
Mr John Gardiner, chairman, said that all three of the group's divisions
reported higher profits, excluding exceptional items. 'For the future the
full benefits of the major investments in Draftex in Spain and the Czech
Republic for the automotive industry have yet to be realised and the new
plant in the US for Fullarton to supply the personal computer industry is
just starting.'
Underlying profits from automotive sealing systems rose 14 per cent to
Pounds 10.9m on sales of Pounds 114.6m (Pounds 118.3m) despite margin
pressure in Germany. Mr Ian Arnott, managing director, said he did not
expect to see a rapid recovery in Germany due to the car manufacturers'
efforts to reduce their costs and the transfer of assembly to lower cost
countries.
However, Laird saw good growth in France helped by the success of Renault's
and Peugeot's small models. Profits also rose sharply in Spain where the
investment in new capacity began to pay off. The full benefit from
Volkswagen's new Polo, which was launched on the continent last month, will
be felt next year.
Underlying operating profits from the industrial products division rose 17
per cent to Pounds 11.5m on sales of Pounds 115.4m (Pounds 105.3m), largely
thanks to the non-sealing systems automotive components business in France.
The UK and US building products companies also turned in better figures.
Helped by a lower tax charge, earnings per share rose 7 per cent to 13.2p,
an increase of 23 per cent excluding exceptional items. The interim dividend
is up from 4.2p to 4.4p. Although Laird does not recover all its ACT, it has
so far decided against paying foreign income dividends.
COMMENT
Given its heavy dependence on the French and German car markets, Laird has
performed extremely well over the last couple of years. Its Spanish
investment has come good even though the new Polo, which was the main reason
it put up the plant in 1989, is only now rolling off the production line.
The non-automotive businesses are also building nicely and the French market
is now recovering well. But life remains very tough. It is having to absorb
some raw materials price increases in the face of fierce competition and
pressure on costs from the car manufacturers, particularly in Germany.
Profits could reach Pounds 44m this year which puts the shares at 406p on a
multiple of nearly 17. With a yield of only 3.4 per cent the shares may
struggle to make more headway.

FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Perry shares take a 12% tumble to 173p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATHER DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The share price at Perry Group, the motor distributor, dropped 12 per cent
yesterday from 198p to 173p.
Mr Richard Allan, chairman and chief executive, reacted with surprise,
blaming the fall on 'over reaction by the market makers' to August's new car
sales figures.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 fell 11 per cent from Pounds
2.87m, which included a Pounds 1.56m property disposal, to Pounds 2.56m. The
figures, Mr Allan said, were 'in line with expectations'.
Operating profits improved by 29 per cent to Pounds 3.14m (Pounds 2.44m) on
turnover up 17 per cent from Pounds 151.2m to Pounds 176.2m. New operations
provided operating profits of Pounds 131,000 and turnover of Pounds 1.64m.
In his statement to shareholders, Mr Allan said the significant improvement
in the first quarter was not sustained in the second, when consumer
confidence appeared to stall.
New car sales to fleets over the six month period were up 19 per cent, while
retail sales rose only 6.5 per cent. The sale of new cars accounted for 50
per cent of turnover but only 17 per cent of gross profits.
Mr Allan added that establishment of the new car sales 'hub' , which the
company will lease from Ford, was 'taking longer than either would have
wished'; until then, he said, the market's full potential would not be
unlocked.
Earnings per share were 6.6p against 10p, a fall of 34 per cent reflecting
last September's rights issue. The interim dividend is unchanged at 2.75p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Driven by growth in its automotive supplies division, Armour Trust, which
also has confectionery interests, raised turnover by 6 per cent from Pounds
24.6m to Pounds 26.1m in the year ended April 30. Pre-tax profits grew 13
per cent to Pounds 1.83m, against Pounds 1.61m.
After a reduced tax charge, earnings per share rose 17 per cent to 4.9p
(4.2p), while a final dividend of 1.42p makes a total of 1.8p (1.6365p).
Mr Andrew Balcombe, chairman, said the automotive division had been
significantly strengthened by four acquisitions in the year and a further
one since the year end.
He said 'the group can now look forward to further progress in the current

FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Costain slips back into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Costain Group fell 11 per cent yesterday as the construction and
engineering group slipped back into the red for the first six months of the
year and put its US mining operations up for sale.
The company said that the mining division, which has been the subject of a
recent Dollars 170m (Pounds 110m) investment programme, was likely to fetch
in the region of Pounds 180m, although industry analysts believed the figure
was more likely to be about Pounds 160m.
Mr Peter Costain, group chief executive, said that the group had already
received several approaches. 'There is consolidation in the industry and
after our successful investment programme we believe it is the right time to
exit.'
He added that the decision to sell had been prompted by a review of the
company's strategy resulting in a plan to concentrate its efforts on the
construction and engineering business.
The shares closed down 3p at 24 1/2 p.
Operating losses for the mining division totalled Pounds 9.8m (Pounds 5m
profits) in the period helping drag Costain into pre-tax losses of Pounds
14m compared with profits of Pounds 68.1m, which included disposal profits
of Pounds 68.5m.
Turnover fell to Pounds 514.8m, against Pounds 622.6m which included Pounds
38.2m from discontinued activities leaving the decline on continuing
operations at 12 per cent.
Losses per share were 3p, against earnings of 28.5p. The dividend, last paid
in 1991, was again passed.
Mr Costain said that the investment programme in the US mining business had
been self-financing and had enhanced the sale value. Mr Thomas Parker, who
headed the US coal operations, has left by mutual consent and been replaced
by Mr Peter Hill, a member of the board.
Profit margins in the construction and engineering division slipped from 1.5
per cent to 1.3 per cent as the company experienced tough trading
conditions, particularly in the UK.
Operating profits fell 31 per cent to Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 6.7m) on turnover
down 24 per cent at Pounds 349.3m (Pounds 432.1m). Mr Costain said he
expected the UK market to remain difficult for the foreseeable future and
that the company was redoubling its efforts to seek overseas work where
margins were healthier.
The continuing divestment programme of non-core assets resulted in net debt
falling from Pounds 204.7m to Pounds 63.3m. Shareholders funds increased 34
per cent to Pounds 210.4m (Pounds 157.4m), helping cut gearing from 37 per
cent to 30 per cent.

FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Taylor Nelson rises to Pounds 3.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taylor Nelson AGB, the market research group, doubled pre-tax profits to
Pounds 3.06m in the six months to end-June.
This compares with Pounds 1.55m in the first-half last year, when the
company invested Pounds 526,000 in an associated business.
The company attributed the improvement to rigorous cost controls and a
reduction in low margin business, as well as an upturn in general business.
The increased volume had been handled with little increase in administrative
costs.
Operating profits rose by 47 per cent from Pounds 1.88m to Pounds 2.77m,
while turnover increased by 10 per cent from Pounds 25.9m to Pounds 28.6m.
Mr Tony Cowling, chief executive, said the company had been promoting
branded services, where margins were higher. In the business service sector
the brand Foqus, which measures levels of customer satisfaction, had won
several large contracts.
However, the healthcare sector, which accounts for more than 20 per cent of
group sales, had proved the strongest performer. Turnover grew by 40 per
cent as the pharmaceutical industry responded to dramatic change, with a
move from branded to generic products.
The net cash position improved from Pounds 8.46m at the end of last year to
Pounds 12.3m at the end of the half. Net interest receivable rose from
Pounds 195,000 to Pounds 288,000.
Earnings per share rose from 0.47p to 0.91p, and the interim dividend is
lifted from 0.13p to 0.3p.

FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Sheffield Insulations well ahead at Pounds
9.11m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sheffield Insulations Group, the distributor of thermal insulation and
related products, yesterday announced substantially higher interim pre-tax
profits, reflecting organic growth and acquisitions.
The group also revealed plans for a one-for-one scrip issue and said it
plans to change its name to SIG to more reflect its broadly-based
distribution business in the UK and overseas.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 almost trebled from Pounds
3.09m to Pounds 9.11m, on turnover up 78 per cent to Pounds 132.7m (Pounds
74.6m), which included Pounds 31.2m (Pounds 1.44m) from acquisitions.
Earnings per share advanced by 55 per cent to 8.5p (5.5p) and the interim
dividend is increased by 11 per cent to 2p (1.8p).
Mr Norman Adsetts, chairman, said the results reflected 'good organic growth
in the continuing operations supported by encouraging contributions from
acquired businesses.
'The strong first half sales and margin performance in all our businesses
and the opportunities which exist for further growth and development within
the group lead me to view the second half and beyond with confidence,' he
added.
Operating profits from continuing operations advanced from Pounds 3.09m to
Pounds 7.81m, while total operating profits increased threefold to Pounds
9.25m (Pounds 3.09m). WMS Group, a manufacturer of fittings for plastic
windows and doors which contributed only one month's profit to the 1993
interim results, posted operating profits of Pounds 3.2m on turnover of
Pounds 19.8m in the 1994 first half.
In the core insulation and ceilings distribution business, market share
gains, further operating efficiencies and progress on margins all
contributed to an improvement.
In hardware and security products, WMS continued to trade well having
produced a strong profit performance.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN B BRASS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Government refusal to legislate for the interest on non-payment of
accounts is but a small part of the UK business scene which has long since
branded us as a third world country ('Venturing capital', August 25). Some
of the others are:
1) The right to bounce cheques ad infinitum.
2) The time taken for courts to approve debts. Even when debts are approved
for collection, the system for doing so is outrageous, with bailiffs rarely
visiting as required - and going away as soon as someone says 'boo'. The
time they take is sufficient to allow anyone to disappear with any remaining
assets.
3) Complex court procedures for redress. They are as costly as for any
complex action, when they should be part of a simple 'business court' and
easy to operate in a business climate.
Business disputes should be able to go through the business court directly
if the parties do not wish/are unable to go through the various agencies
currently available, most of which do not have any legal standing.
For an easy reference to countries which operate easy, workable and
efficient systems I suggest examination of systems in operation in
Switzerland and Germany.

FT  10 SEP 94 / TV adventure that shows business: Financial programmes are
back in fashion, but will enough people watch?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trouble with business television in the past has been that it has not
amounted to much of a business. Businessmen may be happy to appear on
television and, of course, they are desirable targets for advertisers. But
catching them in front of the screen has been a much more difficult task.
That may be about to change as leading broadcasters and international
business information providers use the latest technology to try to entice
businessmen to switch on more often.
On Thursday Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, and Flextech,
the media group controlled by US cable group Tele-Communications of Denver,
said they planned to launch a round-the-clock business channel in February.
European Business News will be broadcast by satellite and carried on cable
network. There will also be a specialist service aimed at the screens of
market professionals. Dow Jones is already a partner in the satellite
channel, Asia Business News, launched last year in Singapore.
Also on Thursday, NBC Super Channel, the pan-European satellite broadcaster
whose US parent company operates the CNBC business channel, announced an
expansion of its coverage.
From January 3, NBC Super Channel will broadcast European Money Wheel - five
hours of live business programming which will focus on the main financial
and business markets. The morning European Money Wheel segment will be
followed in the afternoon by CNBC live from the US, before giving way to
non-business programming in the evening.
NBC Super Channel has not ruled out becoming a 24-hour business channel by
adding an Asian Money Wheel to its existing Asian business service.
Likely to provide the European input is FTTV, the television arm of the
Financial Times, which already provides two live 30-minute business
programmes each weekday for NBC Super Channel. It is on the verge of signing
a deal to provide the new European Money Wheel section, though neither
organisation would confirm this officially last night.
That means that by early next year the two rival business publications, the
Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal, will be involved in
head-to-head confrontation for the business television market in Europe  -
though not 24 hours a day.
The activity is in marked contrast to a few years ago, when an early attempt
to create a European business channel failed. The Zurich-based European
Business channel went into bankruptcy in June 1990 after a possible rescue
from Time Warner, the US media group, fell through.
A similar revival of interest in business programming is taking place in
terrestrial television. In 1991, after four years on air, Channel 4 closed
down its Business Daily having decided that its stretched resources should
be used for business documentaries, rather than reaching about 350,000,
often retired, viewers on weekday lunchtimes.
Yet on September 19 the BBC will launch Working Lunch, a new half-hour
programme five days a week, intended to explain the business and financial
world.
To some in the media industry, the flurry of interest is surprising. Mr Mark
Wood, editor-in-chief of Reuters news and information group, which this year
launched a specialist financial television service for market professionals,
is sceptical about the prospects for more general business channels, such as
that planned by Dow Jones and Flextech.
'It's a bold move. We keep looking at it (a general business channel), but
we have not been able to see how it can be done profitably,' says Mr Wood.
Apart from its specialist channel, Reuters Financial Television, which
usually only broadcasts when there is a market-moving interview or
announcement, the group prefers to make programme segments for other
broadcasters.
In spite of such scepticism, Mr Michael Connor, the managing director of
European Business News who is beginning talks with cable operators about
carrying the new channel, is optimistic there is a market for a quality
channel offering 'news for business people'.
Dow Jones appears to be intent on creating a worldwide network of both
general business, and specialist, channels for market professionals. In
Asia, for instance, it is experimenting with a specialist service to
complement the existing Asia Business News. In the US, the company is
thinking about adding a general channel (to challenge CNBC) to its existing
specialist outlet, Dow Jones Investor Network.
Its plans for Europe appear to be built on a conviction - rather then
evidence - that there is a market for such services. There are no firm
estimates of likely audiences. Even in Asia, after nearly 10 months on air,
Mr Chris Graves, managing editor of Asia Business News, can only say that
the channel, which can be picked up from Taiwan and southern China to
Thailand and eastern India, is now available in between 12m and 16m homes.
He has, however, had letters from the Solomon Islands and reports that his
audience includes businessmen such as Mr Richard Li, founder of Star
Television, the Hong Kong-based satellite broadcaster.
Similarly, NBC Super Channel argues that it has a big reach on which to
build an audience. It says it can be received in a total of 60m homes in
Europe, former Soviet states, the Middle East and north Africa - 33m on
cable networks and a further 27m through terrestrial retransmission.
Nevertheless, as the multi-million-pound business television battle begins
to intensify, there is more than a degree of caution in the advertising
world. 'Newspapers are a much better way to reach businessmen. There's much
less waste,' says Mr Adam Smith of Zenith, the media buying arm of
advertising group Saatchi and Saatchi.
If business television is to become a proper business in Europe, it will
increasingly have to depend on subscription revenue from cable operators, as
well as advertising. It will also have to prove businessmen want to watch.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Dreaming spires on city rubble: UK universities used to
build on greenfield sites. Now they pick run-down urban areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's docklands may soon have an academic ivory tower to go with the
spectacular glass skyscraper at Canary Wharf. Plans were unveiled this week
to build a Pounds 60m university campus on derelict land in the Royal Docks,
in partnership with the London Docklands Development Corporation, the local
regeneration agency.
The project is the latest in a series of innovative schemes where
universities are taking a leading role in the regeneration of UK cities.
These include several other new campuses and a host of smaller projects such
as science parks and student housing.
The partnership between universities and urban regeneration agencies is
bringing benefits for both sides. Universities create jobs, provide training
and other support services for business, and stimulate the local economy
through spending by students and staff. In return, they get access to
government urban regeneration grants at a time when funds for university
expansion are limited.
The docklands project involves four local universities in plans to build a
campus to cater for up to 5,000 students. Centred around a new Technology
Institute, it will offer courses tailored to the needs of local employers,
such as media, design and communications, business studies and health.
The London Docklands Development Corporation has committed Pounds 4.1m to
the plan, arguing that it will be a 'powerful stimulant for economic and
social regeneration' in the area to the east of the capital. Support has
also come from the London East Training and Enterprise Council, Newham
Borough Council and London First, the business-led organisation set up to
promote the capital. The project's sponsors hope that the new Royals
University College will create up to 2,000 permanent jobs.
A similar project is just completing its first phase in Sunderland, where
the university, a former polytechnic, is building a spectacular new campus
on the site of a former ship fitting-out yard and dock. It will provide a
home for four faculties, including business studies, computing and
information systems, and art and design. Other parts of the riverside will
be redeveloped as student accommodation.
For the university, the project provides much-needed space for expansion, on
a site where the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation has been prepared to
pump in Pounds 4m. The balance of the cost, forecast to be about Pounds 40m,
will come from the higher education funding council and the university
itself.
'Funding councils are very pleased when institutions can get financial
leverage from other sources,' says Dr Anne Wright, the university's
vice-chancellor.
For Mr Alastair Balls, chief executive of the development corporation, the
campus is the centrepiece of a strategy to regenerate the mouth of the Wear.
Large businesses, such as the Nissan car factory, prefer spacious greenfield
sites on the outskirts of the city with room for expansion. The university
creates a new focus of activity on a waterfront that once housed the area's
heavy industries. 'It will bring new vitality to the area and put Sunderland
firmly on the academic map of Britain,' he says.
Building the new campus will create the equivalent of 200 full-time jobs in
construction. When it is completed, about 1,500 permanent jobs are expected
to follow. These include university employees, with 600 new staff in
education and support services. The rest will be in the surrounding
community, in businesses meeting the needs of staff and students.
The value of a university to the local economy is increasingly recognised
outside big urban centres. Campaigns have been launched to bring higher
education institutions to towns such as Lincoln and Gloucester.
In Manchester, the three universities in its 'higher education precinct'
employ a third of the city centre's population. 'Higher education means
serious money for Manchester,' says Mr John Glaister, Central Manchester
Development Corporation's chief executive. 'It was Pounds 517m a year at the
last count, and its value to the city's business economy is incalculable.'
For many 'new' universities, formerly polytechnics, involvement in urban
regeneration is not just an easy way to raise capital when public funds are
scarce. Often based on inner-city sites, they see their scope for growth
lying in partnerships with local businesses, community organisations and
development agencies.
Such universities believe something of a virtuous circle could be created:
they will be in greater demand if the local economy is flourishing and there
is a demand from local businesses for education and training.
Moreover, such universities will also do better in attracting students if
their environment is safe and attractive, says Professor David Chiddick, an
executive pro-vice-chancellor at de Montfort university, which has four
campuses in the east Midlands.
'We are more likely to attract women to sign up for part-time business
studies courses in the evening if they feel secure about entering the area
on their own,' he says. 'I'm very anxious that the area around us is
financially viable.'
Prof Chiddick is closely involved in the government-funded City Challenge
scheme, in the area around its Leicester campus. A town planner by
profession, he is convinced that universities have a role to play in
bringing businesses back into the city centre. 'We can offer facilities that
will attract businesses into the urban environment,' he says.
Like several other higher education institutions, de Montfort has set up a
technology transfer and training centre to do just that. But the centre also
brings benefits for the university, he says. 'We have good ideas that have
withered or been kept within a research environment,' he says. 'The centre
allows us to test whether they have commercial applications.'
The need for more co-operation between universities and urban regeneration
agencies is underlined by the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals,
the co-ordinating body for university managers. It is lobbying agencies such
as development corporations to make more use of higher education
institutions. The committee's chairman, Professor Kenneth Edwards,
vice-chancellor of Leicester University, says: 'All universities have grown
out of their local communities. As they developed into the universities of
today, with their national and international dimensions, they have retained
this local focus.'
It would probably be more accurate to say that some, at least, have only
recently rediscovered their local roots. The new universities of the 1960s
such as Sussex, Warwick and York were built on greenfield campuses outside
provincial centres, far removed from the inner cities.
At Warwick in 1970, there was a bruising student sit-in after students
discovered links between the university and local businesses. The
university's most famous don, the radical historian EP Thompson, resigned in
disgust, penning a book called Warwick University Ltd.
Today, 51 per cent of Warwick's income is earned from the private sector.
And the archive of trade union history started by Prof Thompson is housed in
a Pounds 4m library funded by oil company BP. The university is now one of
Coventry's 10 largest employers, and no longer wants to keep its links with
the local economy a secret.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Reds alert in hostile skies: Russian defence salesmen may
not look smart, but they should not be written off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Appearances can be deceptive - especially in the world of defence. The
Russians were not the smartest figures at this week's Farnborough Air Show.
They could not afford expensive stands with imaginary high-tech battles on
giant video screens; and they have something to learn about the production
of glossy corporate literature in the peculiar, breathless style cultivated
by arms companies.
They are, however, finding customers - and not just among former allies.
With their craggy, lived-in faces, Russian pilots are glamorous figures in
their own, no-nonsense way, but they lack the permanent sun tans affected by
their western counterparts.
They often also have less cash. About half the exhibitors who came from
Moscow to Farnborough two years ago could not afford to return. 'Our
engineers are paid miserably. They only get 250,000 roubles and they could
make 2m roubles a month from a back-street trading business,' said one
salesman.
Though some of the first fruits of east-west co-operation in civilian
aviation were on display - including the new Ilyushin-96, a wide-body
passenger aircraft with engines from Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US - aficionados
of military aircraft had to search a bit harder for the Russian
contribution.
The Tsagi institute, one of the cradles of Soviet research in aviation and
space, was well represented - at the exhibition stand of the UK government's
Defence Research Agency, its partner in a recent co-operation deal.
However, Professor German Zagainov, Tsagi director, was keener to stress the
civilian uses of his institute's work in theoretical aerodynamics: from the
measurement of gas flows to the drying of timber. Tsagi has had remarkable
success in contracting out the use of its facilities near Moscow to
aerospace companies from the US, Britain and Germany without arousing fears
that commercial or military secrecy will be compromised.
'We are used to respecting confidentiality of our clients,' said the
professor, whose well-cut suit and courteous manners marked him out as
Farnborough's most polished Russian. 'For years, we worked in conditions of
absolute secrecy,' he added, with the hint of a smile.
Yet the west would be making a bad mistake if it took the Russians' low-key
style as a sign they can be written off.
The Russians have a quiet certainty about the superiority of their products.
Mr Viktor Puzanov, chief engineer at MAPO, manufacturer of the legendary Mig
fighter, is convinced that the latest models can hold their own against any
challenge from US or European rivals.
Migs are already in service in 40 countries, mostly former Soviet allies.
For MAPO, June's Dollars 550m sale of 18 Mig-29 aircraft to Malaysia was a
landmark success: achieved in a region long seen as subject to western
commercial and political influence.
Besides the Migs, Russia's greatest hopes lie with work-horse helicopters
such as the Mi-17, made by the Kazan helicopter company in Tatarstan and
favoured by oilmen and geologists in remote parts of Latin America and
Indochina. 'I've been flying these helicopters for 20 years and I have never
heard of a mechanical failure,' said Mr Yuri Pornin, an Mi-17
representative, to a sceptical westerner. 'They are as sturdy as tractors.'
It is important for the Russian salesmen to break out from traditional
markets. The Russian defence industry is undergoing a painful, but possibly
invigorating, shake-out.
On one hand, the virtual freeze on weapons procurement imposed by the
government two years ago is drawing blood, with lay-offs and factory
closures. On the other, Russia has identified defence equipment as one of
the few industrial products in which it has an advantage. President Boris
Yeltsin threw his weight behind the creation this year of a state agency,
Rosvooruzhenie, which will monopolise the export of guns and missiles.
On paper, Russian arms sales have plunged since the Soviet collapse, from an
annual level of almost Dollars 10bn a year - comparable with the US - to
barely Dollars 2bn. But these figures are misleading. In the Soviet era,
arms deliveries to allies were on such soft terms as to be virtually free.
Only since 1992 has Russia properly entered the commercial arms race.
One country with which Russia has rapidly revived its defence relationship
is India. A group of Indian businessmen, based in Singapore, has joined the
makers of Mig in a joint venture known as Mig-Apio, which will try to
facilitate the purchase of Russian aircraft by Asian governments. 'The aim
is to respond more flexibly to our clients' needs and get away from the
inertia of the state sector,' said a representative from MAPO. The Malaysia
deal illustrates what that flexibility can mean: part of the payment is in
palm oil.
The Indian government, meanwhile, is giving Russia the job of upgrading more
than 100 of its Mig-21 fighters. It is hoped this will encourage the world's
other Mig users to upgrade their aircraft with Russian help, rather than buy
new western aircraft.
As Tass news agency commented caustically last month, Russian Migs have been
studied by the Royal Air Force in a manner that 'did not exclude the chance
of encountering them under combat conditions'. This does not, of course,
mean the RAF expects to go to war with Russia; but the greater the success
of Russia's marketing campaign, the more likely it is that the west will
find itself in confrontation with a country that is one of Moscow's
customers.
Companies that supply military aircraft to western governments do not view
this prospect as an unmitigated disaster; it is the kind of thing that keeps
them in business.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Keep a sharp eye on Spanish property
contract, not the Sangria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN S BLACKSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with great interest Gerald Cadogan's article on Spanish property
(Mediterranean Property, August 13/14) and, in particular, his warning
against the vendor including a clause in the contract of sale, under which
the purchaser becomes responsible for all the debts and taxes of the
property. Such a clause can, contrary to what the General Spanish Law
otherwise provides, add quite substantially to the price.
This underlines the need not only for professional legal advice to be taken
at an early stage in any Spanish property purchase, but also the need to
follow the common sense precept that one should not sign anything,
especially in Spanish, which one has not read or understood, particularly
after a jug or two of Sangria]

FT  10 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: The critical factor in population
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN MONTAGU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Mortimer ('False alarm in Cairo', September 7) and others at
last begin to reveal one of the underlying development messages of the Cairo
conference which have been blurred by the more newsy antics of more
fanatical priests and mullahs. Women's economic power and consumer choice,
where it has been allowed to develop, is already making an impact on the
growth of world population and may ultimately prove the most critical factor
 -more than education.
I visited a women's economic activity development project in Orissa recently
on behalf of the international charity Care, and was impressed by the
potential earnings and savings power of rural women employed in a variety of
small businesses. This scheme is linked directly with a government nutrition
programme in which families benefit from a range of health and childcare
advice, while mothers have the chance to meet and share ideas for improving
their income.
It is only within this social and economic structure that women cease to be
mere child-bearers and have the opportunity to plan their families in the
broadest sense.
In many countries they of course start at a considerable disadvantage, but
it has been shown that in the least advanced rural economies there is often
potential for the most dramatic social change.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pattern of EU progress leaves public
feeling frozen out by Eurocrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK LIBBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest your editorial, 'The chance for a Euro-debate'
(September 5), about a multi-speed Europe.
Openness to the extension of the 'hard core' and minimum EU membership
requirements will not be enough for this model to work. Further
democratisation of the European Union will also be necessary. Even after
Maastricht, democratic accountability undermines the moral legitimacy of the
European Union and endangers both the process of integration and the process
of enlargement.
Until now, integration and closer co-operation among EU member states have
been hammered out by national politicians in a relatively behind-the-scenes
manner. This pattern cannot be sustained. It is alienating to the electorate
and leaves the public with the impression that it has been frozen out by
'Eurocrats'. This process also links European integration firmly to the
incumbent and often unpopular national governments who make the decisions.
This discourages public debate of European issues on their own merits.
In a similar fashion, the democratic deficit undermines a key element in the
logic of widening the EU. Membership of the Union will do little to
'reinforce parliamentary democracy' in eastern Europe if policy-making at
the European level does not incorporate greater democratic consultation. As
European co-operation grows stronger, decisions made at the EU level will
take on greater importance. Eastern and western Europeans alike will want a
greater say as this process goes forward. But, however noble its end-goals,
the current Byzantine horse-trading which characterises EU politics has
little more legitimacy than a Soviet-era politburo.

Sir, Jonathan Aitken's comments on the growth of housing benefit ('Aitken
targets housing housing benefit', September 6) are an example of what John
Stuart Mill called the 'inability of the unanalytic mind to recognise its
own handiwork'. He quotes figures for the growth of housing benefit since
1988, that is since the 1988 Housing Act deliberately adopted a policy of
forcing up rents which has led, as could have been foreseen, to the growth
of housing benefit. The government picked the rod for its own back.
Cuts in housing benefit without rent reductions will make more people
homeless - just when the route of the homeless into permanent rehousing is
being closed. This will lead to much higher expenditure on temporary housing
and to a rapid growth in street begging. I fear the prime minister might
find it an eyesore.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Rising in the east
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something different about Japan this week. No, the current round of
trade talks in Los Angeles has not miraculously resolved the country's
conflicts with the US. But a process that will eventually do more to bring
the two countries closer has begun: the Japanese economy is growing and its
structure is slowly changing.
There have been enough phantom upturns over the past 18 months that the news
is spoken softly. But yesterday even the Japanese Economic Planning Agency
included the word 'recovery' in its monthly economic update. Growth is still
fragile enough for caution to be well-placed: real GDP may achieve only
around 1 1/4 per cent growth this year, if that. But Japan's industrialised
trading partners should be more encouraged by the emerging pattern of growth
than its magnitude.
Politically, things in Japan are as murky as ever, as the debate over the
continuation - and funding - of last year's tax cuts carries on unresolved.
But thanks to the past year's fiscal injections, economic prospects in
consumption and residential investment are looking less sombre than for a
long time.
This does not mean that this year's further surge in the value of the yen
will have no effect. So far, the dollar-denominated current account surplus
has yet to show the effect of the re-adjustment currently taking place. But
Japanese net exports will almost certainly fall in the coming year: what is
different about this recovery is the way that re-adjustment will occur.
Japan's exporters are benefiting from economic growth in their most
important markets: the US, Europe, and East Asia. Falling competitiveness
will probably rule out significant export growth, but the decline is
unlikely to be dramatic.
Greater improvement
In contrast to past occasions, the country's exporters are finding
themselves less able to compensate for losses abroad by raising prices at
home. The competitiveness of Japanese export goods, in dollar terms, has
fallen by 25 per cent since 1985. But a still greater improvement in the
competitiveness of foreign goods has hit domestic sales of
domestically-produced goods. The tentative rise in domestic consumption is
increasingly going towards purchases of foreign goods. Imports of video
recorders trebled in July alone.
Thus the strong yen, coupled with the slow process of market deregulation,
is adding momentum to the industrial restructuring taking place in Japan.
Given the over-capacity left over from the 1980s boom, another ingredient of
the typical Japanese recovery - surging capital investment - is also
missing.
The spur behind recent investment has been almost entirely residential:
usually the country's weakest investment sector. Heavily-subsidised loans
are helping young people buy cheap condominiums for the first time. New
housing starts rose at an annual rate over 6 per cent in July, the fourth
monthly rise running.
Saving rate
What does this very different picture of Japan in recovery mean for Japan's
trading partners? The steady rise in consumer imports will lessen, but not
eliminate Japan's current account surplus. As the Japanese (and others)
never tire of pointing out, the country's high rate of net saving will
continue to deliver a net injection of capital to the rest of the world for
some time yet. Though the population is ageing fast, even very old Japanese
display much higher rates of saving than pensioners elsewhere.
But the destination of this capital contribution may well change, in light
of recent developments. Wider deregulation of the economy now has the
backing of many important business constituencies, as well as that of the
ruling coalition. Though it may be held back by political shifts, it is
unlikely to be halted altogether. This means that Japanese consumers could
begin to enjoy a lower cost of living relative to Americans and Europeans,
whose goods they will buy in greater numbers.
That might give Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, and his
successors less to talk about in years to come. Having lost approximately
Dollars 320bn on their US investments since 1986, Japanese investors are
likely to be more cautious of sending their surplus cash to the US.
Non-portfolio flows may concentrate increasingly on Asian emerging markets.
Japan's neighbours could therefore receive the benefit of still more of the
know-how and technological creativity which helped Japan grow so rapidly
after the war.
Much could go wrong with this scenario, but there is encouragement to be
found in this week's news from Japan. On Thursday, Mr Kantor predicted that
there would be 'no breakthroughs' in the state of US-Japanese trade
relations in the near term. He may, however, be looking in the wrong place.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Firmly footed for the final hurdle: Helmut Kohl's revived
fortunes in the German election campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The greatest strength of Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl, according to one
of his closest friends and admirers, is that he is always 'hugely
underestimated' by his opponents.
Now he appears to have got away with it again.
As Germany's 1994 election marathon enters the final straight - with 12 out
of 19 elections over, including the choice of a new federal president, and
just seven to go - the big man is back in front, leaving his opponents
apparently floundering in his wake.
Less than seven months ago, before a party conference of his Christian
Democratic Union (CDU) in Hamburg, Mr Kohl looked practically down and out.
His party was trailing the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) by 35.1
per cent to 40.9 per cent, and the chancellor himself looked even worse: his
popularity rating stood at 26 per cent, compared with 35 per cent for Mr
Rudolf Scharping, the youthful new leader of the SPD.
This week, on the eve of two important state elections in east Germany, and
just five weeks from the general election on October 16, the irrepressible
Mr Kohl is sitting almost pretty: the most recent personal ratings give him
40 per cent, to only 30 per cent for Mr Scharping. As for the CDU, and its
Bavarian sister party, the CSU, they are on a combined 40.3 per cent,
compared with 34.2 per cent for the SPD.
In spite of everything the opposition can throw at him, the chancellor
appears unmoved and unflappable. And in spite of all the urgent promises the
SPD can make, it does not seem to be able to break through the barrier of
electoral suspicion.
Mr Kohl's personal performance has been remarkable. He has scarcely put a
foot wrong. For a start, he has calmly sat back and waited for the economy
to turn the corner out of last year's sharp recession. All the latest
indices suggest the economy has come right even faster than the government's
optimistic advisers expected. Unemployment appears almost to have peaked at
just less than 4m, although it was expected to keep rising for the rest of
the year, and gross domestic product could end the year with a growth rate
of at least 2.5 per cent, compared with a rosy government forecast of 1.5
per cent last December.
Second, he has exploited every possible opportunity to hammer home his
obvious electoral advantage as an international statesman over the
relatively untravelled Mr Scharping. The great outcry raised by government
politicians all summer over the illegal export of plutonium from the former
Soviet Union owed a great deal to the desire to remind the German electorate
just how unstable their eastern neighbours remain. The subliminal message
was clear: in an uncertain and dangerous world, vote for the devil you know.
The sudden emergence of European integration as an issue in the campaign is
unlikely to do the chancellor any harm, either. Mr Kohl enjoys a substantial
reputation as a 'good European', but the one issue which could cost him
votes is the prospect of eventually abandoning the D-Mark in favour of a
single European currency.
By allowing his party to publish a tough position paper, suggesting that
future economic and monetary union would be based on a hard core of only
five member states of the European Union - Germany and France as well as the
Benelux countries - Mr Kohl may well help to reassure some of the doubters.
Mr Scharping, a worthy but uninspiring candidate, has failed to set the
electorate alight, not to mention his own party. Only last weekend, he was
still appealing for his loyal followers 'not to be down-hearted'. It
certainly seemed a bit late in the day.
Having launched his campaign as the undisputed leader of the party, he has
been forced to co-opt his two greatest rivals, Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the
Saarland premier, and Mr Gerhard Schroder, the Lower Saxony premier, as part
of an uneasy 'triumvirate'. Mr Scharping's own performance was clearly seen
as lacklustre by his supporters.
Perhaps the fatal moment for Mr Scharping was in May, when he launched, with
great fanfare, the party's new tax plans, drafted largely by Mr Lafontaine.
In them, he proposed to cut taxes for the lowest paid - in particular the
surcharge to pay for unification - at the expense of higher income earners.
The trouble was, that the threshold for the better income earners of
DM60,000 a year meant that a very large number of middle-income earners -
classic swing voters - would be caught. It was a gesture of electoral
suicide.
And yet all is not over, bar the shouting. Mr Kohl is by no means home and
dry. The result is still too close to call. For the complex arithmetic of
Germany's coalition-building means that Mr Kohl cannot be so sure of gaining
the overall majority he needs for his own party and his allies, the CSU and
the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP).
For a start, the FDP is floundering in a state of pre-electoral paralysis,
after a string of resounding setbacks in earlier polls. It is an open
question if the FDP can win enough votes to give Mr Kohl an outright
majority. In the latest poll published by the Allensbach opinion research
institute in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung this week, the FDP stood on
8.2 per cent, to give the coalition a combined 48.5 per cent - still short
of the magic 50 per cent.
The challenge for Mr Kohl is to drag the FDP up with his own revived
momentum. Indeed, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the FDP party leader, seems to be begging
for votes on just that basis: his message at his election launch rally in
Nuremberg was 'vote for us, to re-elect the coalition'.
But it is not his allies who may end up giving Mr Kohl the greatest
headache. Ironically, the party which could end up holding the real key to
the result is the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) - the reformed old
East Germany Socialist Unity party (SED), the Communist party.
Tomorrow's elections in the eastern states of Brandenburg and Saxony will
give the clearest indication so far about just how the long-suffering east
German electorate will vote in five weeks. Battered by soaring unemployment,
by the collapse of their traditional industrial economy, and the
disappearance of all the old certainties in their grim communist lives, the
east Germans are confused, divided and yet resigned. Those who have jobs are
satisfied. Those without are bitter. The opinion polls seem often to be wide
of the mark. Many may not vote at all. Others will vote with varying degrees
of enthusiasm for western parties. And others are clearly turning back to
the PDS in protest at the confusion in their lives.
So far, the three-party-dominated west German system of Christian Democrats,
Social Democrats, and Free Democrats has not taken root in the east.
Instead, to the horror and amazement of most westerners, the former
communists are picking up a very healthy proportion of the votes  - up to 20
per cent.
The PDS, which inherited the SED's organisational structure, including a
well-disciplined grass-roots movement, has 130,000 members, of which 90 per
cent were SED members. This is still less than a tenth of the former
Communist party, but the PDS still boasts the biggest paid-up political
membership in east Germany.
With between 15 per cent and 20 per cent support, the PDS is the third
largest in east Germany after the SPD and CDU. On an all-German basis,
however, it still would not gain the 5 per cent minimum needed to gain seats
in the Bundestag, the directly-elected lower house of parliament. What the
party is far more likely to win is three directly-elected members of the
Bundestag, if they can gain an outright majority in the first round of
voting: and if the party can do that, it automatically qualifies for
representation according to whatever proportion of the national vote it won,
even if less than 5 per cent.
That is the horror scenario facing both Mr Kohl and Mr Scharping. For if the
PDS does not get into the Bundestag in October, it will be possible to form
a coalition government of right or left with less than 50 per cent of the
vote. If the PDS does win through, it could prevent either side forming a
coalition with its natural partners. The end result could be one nobody
wants: a so-called Grand Coalition of CDU and SPD, leaving the job of
opposition to the minorities and the extremists, including the PDS, the
Greens, and the FDP.
The result is that, in spite of its virtual non-existence in the west, and
its uneven showing in the five eastern states, the PDS has been singled out
as the bogey-man in the election campaign, by all the main western parties.
One of the reasons for this characterisation is that over the past year, the
PDS has managed to erode the support held by the SPD in east Germany. It has
also managed to capitalise on its image as the one genuinely 'home-grown'
party in the east, in contrast to the imported SPD, FDP and CDU.
Given the social conditions in the east, with unemployment in some areas
exceeding 50 per cent, the SPD might have been expected to flourish. Mr
Scharping has fought a campaign dedicated to social justice, and his
controversial tax reforms to aid the low-paid at the expense of the
better-off, should also appeal to voters. But the tax proposal has not
really helped, at least so far, in either east or west.
Mr Kohl's CDU has launched a massive publicity onslaught against the PDS,
and sought to tarnish the SPD with the same brush. The CDU suggests that the
Social Democrats can only hope to gain power in Bonn with PDS support.
According to the latest polls, the SPD plus the Greens, their closest
allies, would have 44.4 per cent of the vote. With 4.4 per cent from the
PDS, they could be just in front of the ruling coalition.
Mr Scharping has flatly rejected any such solution, but the voters do not
really believe him. Some 54 per cent are convinced that if it was a question
of gaining power, the SPD would accept overt or tacit PDS support. So the
onslaught on the former communists is stepped up.
And yet the ultimate irony is this: the more the western parties attack the
PDS, the more eastern voters appear inclined to back it after all. It is as
if east German voters feel an instinctive solidarity for 'one of theirs'. Mr
Kohl is therefore treading a very delicate path.
All the evidence suggests that he must have done enough to be re-elected,
albeit by a narrow margin. But his efforts to ensure that outcome could trip
him up at the very final hurdle.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Men in the News: Five men in a bit of theatre - The Savoy
board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's show time]' exulted one City analyst as the curtain rose on the latest
act in the Forte group's battle to take over Savoy hotels. Founded by
Richard D'Oyly Carte, manager of Gilbert and Sullivan, the Savoy has never
lacked dramatic flair.
In the past week, a Savoy director has admitted he told a journalist the
subject of a document on his desk - but added that anyone who suggested he
had revealed the details would hear from his solicitors. His chairman said
it was a perfectly acceptable explanation but he had had enough of the whole
Savoy business anyway.
A managing director has issued a statement from a board which was astonished
to hear it had met. The managing director is packing his desk as a result.
And the man who could decide how the story ends runs a golf course and was
once cornered by police in the south of France suspected of being Lord
Lucan.
On Tuesday, four of the principal characters in the saga will meet their
fellow Savoy directors to see if they can resolve the issues raised by the
week's events and other matters which date back 13 years, since Forte first
began its quest for control. Forte now has 68 per cent of the shares but
only 42 per cent of the votes.
The four are Sir Anthony Tuke, 74, the Savoy's chairman for 10 years who is
desperate to retire; Mr Rocco Forte, chairman of Forte and a Savoy director
since the two sides agreed an uneasy truce in 1989; Sir Michael Richardson,
who has just announced his retirement as chairman of securities house Smith
New Court and who did not leak the document to the Sunday papers; and Mr
John Sinclair, Lucan lookalike, who is chief executive of an East Sussex
golf course, and controls shareholding trusts which could give Forte control
of the Savoy.
The fifth character - Mr Giles Shepard, Savoy's managing director - will
probably not be at the board meeting, and, if he is, it will be for the last
time. After 15 years of running the Savoy group - whose hotels include the
Savoy, Claridge's and the Connaught - he is leaving, possibly as early as
Monday. Some directors are thought to favour as his replacement Mr Ramon
Pajares, the Spanish-born general manager of the Four Seasons (formerly the
Inn on the Park), one of London's most respected hotels.
The unfailingly courteous Mr Shepard always opposed a Forte takeover, saying
the hotels would lose their character.
Mr Shepard, one of whose hobbies is embroidery, has definite ideas on the
right and wrong way to do things. He is always impeccably dressed. Mr Forte
once said he would not employ Mr Shepard as a doorman. The oft-told story
that Mr Shepard then greeted Mr Forte at the Savoy dressed as a doorman is
nonsense; Mr Shepard has his own uniform, which includes a waistcoat, tie
pin and highly polished shoes.
It is true that Mr Shepard and Mr Forte have no great regard for one
another. But Mr Forte has tried to put his acrimony aside. Instead, he has
spent the past months persuading fellow directors that the problem with the
Savoy hotels is they are not well run, turning in profits of only Pounds
725,000 last year on turnover of Pounds 83.3m.
Mr Forte's tactics have been effective. Several of Mr Shepard's allies
deserted him - or began to listen to what Forte had to say. One who began
listening was Mr Sinclair. Mr Sinclair, who is 41 today, is steeped in Savoy
culture. He was a Savoy management trainee, reception manager at Claridge's
and general manager of the Lancaster, the Savoy's Paris hotel. He became a
Savoy director last year with Mr Shepard's support.
Mr Sinclair is trustee for some of the interests of the family of Sir Hugh
Wontner, Savoy president until his death in 1992. Sir Hugh ferociously
opposed Forte, but trustees have to be guided by their beneficiaries'
interests (rather than sentiment) on the question of whether the Savoy
hotels' performance would improve if they were merged with Forte's luxury
establishments.
The discussions continue. If Mr Sinclair allies himself with Forte, it would
give the latter control without spending another penny.
Sir Anthony Tuke, a Savoy loyalist throughout the 1980s battle against Forte
is credited by both sides with having taken an even-handed approach since
the truce and Mr Forte's accession to the board. He hopes to announce his
replacement on Tuesday.
Several close observers believe Sir Michael Richardson would like to be
chairman. Sir Michael was also on the Savoy board during the initial battle
but he too drifted over to the Forte side.
It was while he was being interviewed earlier this month about his
retirement from Smith New Court that a journalist asked him about Mr
Shepard's document lying on his desk. Sir Michael says he told the
journalist it was about the Savoy but revealed no details - an explanation
accepted by Sir Anthony.
Some of the details did appear, however. Mr Shepard issued a statement which
said: 'The board of the Savoy group is dismayed that one non-executive
director, for his own reasons, has decided to discuss confidential papers
with the press.'
The board, however, had issued no such statement. Mr Shepard had acted on
his own, apparently convinced that, as the guardian of the group's spirit
and traditions, he could speak on Savoy's behalf. The board, however, had
moved on, leaving Mr Shepard behind. Sir Anthony's even-handedness towards
Mr Shepard ended. He described his behaviour as 'extraordinary'.
This week, the two warring sides hope to put the dissension of 13 years
behind them and appoint a new chairman and a managing director who will
represent them all.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Move to close pyramid scheme
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry has moved to close down another pyramid
scheme. It has petitioned the High Court to wind up Global Pioneers, a
scheme which traded from Morecambe in Lancashire.
It said Global Pioneers 'held out the prospect of substantial earnings to
members by the redistribution of subscriptions of members joining later'.
Investigators believe that the scheme started in July last year and has
attracted a membership of about 3,000.
The government wound up a larger scheme called Alchemy Marketing in July and
hearings on 3T Publications are scheduled for next month.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Building output at two-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction output in the second quarter of this year was the highest for
more than two years, figures published yesterday by the Department of the
Environment show, Andrew Taylor writes.
Contractors, which this week reported sharp falls in construction profits
for the first six months of the year, said overcapacity in the industry had
meant profit margins remained very depressed in spite of an increase in
orders.
The total value of output in constant 1990 prices rose 4 per cent in the
three months to the end of June compared with the same period last year. It
rose 1 per cent against the first quarter of this year.
Private-sector housing was 14 per cent higher than the same period last year
and 3 per cent higher on the previous quarter. Private industrial output was
11 per cent and 8 per cent higher respectively while private commercial
output rose 6 per cent and 1 per cent.
Infrastructure work was down 13 per cent on the same period last year but
rose 4 per cent over the first quarter.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Walker weeps in Old Bailey witness box
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Walker, the former chairman of the Brent Walker property and
leisure group who is charged with fraud, yesterday broke down in tears in
the witness box at the Old Bailey as he told how he tried to save his
company from liquidation.
Mr Walker was explaining how in late 1990 he put 'every penny' of his
family's money into the company to enable a crucial bond issue to go ahead.
He and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director, are both
accused of fraudulently inflating the company's profits. Both deny charges
of theft, false accounting and conspiring to falsify accounts.
Mr Walker said the bond issue was necessary after the takeover of the
William Hill betting shop chain left Brent Walker short of funds.
However, problems on the Japanese stock market had meant that institutions
there withdrew backing of Pounds 150m. His bankers then insisted he
personally had to raise Pounds 100m if they were to continue supporting the
company, he said.
The Walker family put in Pounds 30m and after receiving an assurance from
the Serious Fraud Office that it had dropped its investigation into Brent
Walker he attracted a further Pounds 65m from associates.
'I got to Pounds 95m and the banks said they would cough up the rest. Every
penny we had went into keeping that company alive - work money, boxing
money, dividend money, everything,' Mr Walker told the court. He paused
before continuing: 'And now I stand here accused of . . .' Mr Walker then
told the judge: 'I have got to have a break, if you don't mind', and left
the witness box in tears.
When he returned Mr Walker told how the banks, led by Standard Chartered,
finally forced him out of the company. At a board meeting in April 1991,
with the banks attending, he was told their support depended on his being
removed as chief executive.
'That caused a lot of anger, and a lot of harsh words were said,' Mr Walker
told the court. The Brent Walker company solicitor warned the banks their
tactics were putting other directors under duress and could be challenged in
the courts, he continued. However, the banks would not relent.
Mr Walker said: 'I was fired. I was told by the banks to be escorted to my
desk, only take my diaries and remove myself from the building and that I
was not allowed back in the building again.'
The judge ordered the proceedings to stop late in the morning, saying Mr
Walker was 'very tired' and needed to recuperate. The trial continues.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Government privacy proposals could slow paper inquiries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government proposals for new legal safeguards against the invasion of
privacy would deter legitimate inquiries by newspapers, a Liberal Democrat
committee warned yesterday, Ivor Owen writes.
The party's press and broadcasting working group believes that invasions of
personal privacy should continue to be dealt with case-by-case by the
courts.
It maintains in a document for the party's conference later this month that,
while a privacy law might assist some victims of press intrusion, it would
also allow others to deter legitimate inquiries with the threat of legal
action.
However, it favours carefully tailored criminal offences of physical
intrusion to deter peeping toms and aggressive 'doorstepping' by the press.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Brown fears Budget will be 'raid on welfare state'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday called on the government
to announce the results of its year-long review into social security
spending after a leaked Whitehall document showed that officials have been
considering how to implement a wide range of cuts.
Mr Brown warned that the November Budget could be 'a raid on the welfare
state'. He made clear that the defence of social security and health
spending would be at the heart of Labour's political campaign this autumn.
Earlier this week Mr Jonathan Aitken, the new chief secretary to the
Treasury, strongly hinted that housing benefit payments could be reduced in
the Budget to rein back the Social Security Department's Pounds 85bn
spending programme.
However, a leaked DSS document yesterday confirmed that officials have also
been pressing ahead with plans to abolish the statutory sick pay subsidy to
employers and the industrial injuries compensation scheme for employees,
both of which cost the government about Pounds 1.4bn.
According to the documents, Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary,
asked officials late last year to 'make recommendations on a strategy to
achieve abolition' of the statutory sick pay scheme.
Last year the government ended the policy of providing a sick-pay subsidy to
'large employers' who pay National Insurance contributions of more than
Pounds 20,000 a year.
But, according to the document, DSS officials have been asked to take this a
stage further, abolishing the subsidy for the 750,000 'small employers' who
were unaffected by last year's legislation.
Such a move could save the government as much as Pounds 700m a year.
In addition, another group of officials has been asked to examine 'the scope
for transferring the no-fault industrial injuries scheme to employers' and
to outline the timetable for such legislation.
Under these proposals employers could be forced to bear the full costs of
compensating employees who are involved in an accident where the company is
not at fault.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Derailment 'unrelated to stoppage'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The two incidents, one of them a derailment, which occurred during
Thursday's one-day stoppage by signalling staff cannot be blamed on the
strike, Railtrack said yesterday.
The RMT transport union and the Aslef train drivers' union have accused
Railtrack, which runs the network, of taking chances with passengers' safety
by employing inadequately trained staff in signalboxes.
An incident at Sawley in Derbyshire when two cars passed over a level
crossing moments before an oncoming passenger train was the result of
actions by a contractor working on the line, Railtrack said.
BRIS, a British Rail maintenance subsidiary, had begun its own disciplinary
proceedings, Railtrack Midland said. 'There was no involvement by any
signalling staff,' an official said. 'Contractors were working on the
crossing and they did not follow the correct procedure.'
An initial investigation of an incident at Bickley in Kent, where several
carriages of a commuter train were derailed, also showed that the signal
workers' strike was not to blame, Railtrack South said.
A full inquiry is to be held next week but initial indications were that the
signalling equipment was being operated normally.
The full inquiry will focus on the technical operation of the points,
signals, the train's brakes and the actions of the driver, Railtrack added.
It expected repairs to the line to be completed by Monday.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Unionist MP accepts IRA terrorism could be over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Taylor, a leading Ulster Unionist MP, yesterday added to the
pressure on Mr John Major's government to recognise the IRA's ceasefire by
openly accepting that the organisation's campaign of violence could truly be
over.
As the British and US governments continue to refrain from full acceptance
of the ceasefire, Mr Taylor, the MP for Strangford, Co Down, came as close
as any unionist to admitting that the IRA had fully renounced violence. 'My
gut reaction is that the ceasefire is for real,' he told his constituency
association.
Mr Taylor, who was seriously wounded by an IRA gunman in 1972, added: 'I
consider it to be my responsibility to encourage the peace process forward
so that there will eventually be lasting peace.'
He was clearly at odds with another unionist MP, Mr David Trimble, who
claimed that the UUP's view was that the IRA had no intention of abandoning
their campaign unless there were substantial concessions from the
government.
Writing in the Belfast Telegraph, Mr Trimble, the MP for Upper Bann, said
that the ceasefire was a 'gamble' by the IRA. 'They reckon that if they fail
to gain concessions, the blame for resumed violence can be placed on the
British government or the loyalists.'
Ulster Unionists will have been pleased with comments yesterday by Mr
Michael Howard, home secretary, that the transfer of four republican
terrorists from English jails to Northern Ireland only hours after the IRA
ceasefire began had been 'completely wrong'. He said ministers should have
been consulted about the timing of the move.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Teachers seek rise that exceeds RPI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Teachers are on a collision course with the government over a pay submission
that would mean rises of more than 20 per cent for some over two years. And
they have warned they may take steps to cut their workload.
The National Union of Teachers yesterday called for a salary increase next
year above the rate of inflation, possibly up to 4 per cent.
The biggest teaching union's submission to the School Teachers' Review Body,
which advises the government on setting teachers' pay, is calling for a
10-point salary scale by 1996. This would range from Pounds 14,750 for a
graduate-entry teacher - up 13.5 per cent from the present equivalent
starting salary of Pounds 12,999.
The NUT is arguing for a 'significant increase' next year, beating the rate
of inflation and combining a lump sum and percentage.
Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said the government had breached its
ban on 'catch-up' pay rises when MPs awarded themselves 4.7 per cent. He
warned that his members could take steps to cut a mounting workload. 'There
comes a point where you say it just can't go on. If no one is going to
listen to us, we will have to look very carefully and decide which aspects
of our work we could discontinue.'
This year the government imposed the School Teachers' Review Body's
recommended 2.9 per cent pay rise.
The submission to the review body from the National Association of
Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers called for a 35-hour-week and a pay
increase in line with other non-manual staff.
The Secondary Heads Association has called for a pay increase for all
teachers 'in recognition of their improved productivity, measured by
published examination results'.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Warning to bidders for tunnel rail link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any changes in membership of the consortia bidding to build the Pounds 2.7bn
Channel tunnel rail link must be approved by the government, the Department
of Transport said yesterday.
It was commenting on an announcement from the GMB general union that the
consortium headed by Hochtief, a German construction company, had invited UK
unions to join the bidding team.
No application for the unions to be allowed to join the Hochtief group had
been received by yesterday afternoon, the transport department said.
Some of the companies involved in the bidding have expressed irritation at
the government's intervention in the make-up of the bidding groups.
London Electricity said in June that it had withdrawn from one of the four
bidding consortia because of a conflict of interest resulting from the fact
that Sir Bob Reid, its chairman, was also chairman of British Rail.
Meanwhile, Sofrerail, a French railway consultancy, is an adviser to, but
not formally a member of, London &amp; Continental Railways, another consortium.
Eurorail, a consortium comprising BICC, Trafalgar House and GEC, yesterday
received the documents containing details of the tender competition 10 days
after the other three consortia.
The delay resulted from one member of the consortium, believed to be GEC,
refusing to sign the confidentiality agreement because it was too onerous.
The four consortia have until March 14 to submit their bids. The government
has said it expects to award the contract by the end of next year.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Calor Gas workers back strike action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Workers at Calor Gas, the gas products company, have voted to take strike
action against the imposition of personal contracts for manual grades and
pay cuts for some drivers.
The small majority - 53 per cent in favour from a 78 per cent turnout - has
led the company to complain that fewer than a third of those covered by the
agreement with the TGWU general union were in favour of striking.
The ballot combined two separate issues. One involved personal contracts,
affecting 363 workers, and another involved wage cuts for 50 drivers at
Calor Transport, the contract transport division.
Calor has accused the union of blurring the issue. Most employees, it said,
did not want to be involved in an industrial dispute and about half of those
offered new contracts had already signed.
Mr John Harris, Calor's director of operations and human resources, said:
'It is very unfortunate that our employees have become caught up in a
confrontation which the TGWU has chosen to have with the company.'
The management is to meet union officials on Monday for discussions on the
transport division.
Mr Danny Bryan, national secretary of the union's commercial transport
group, said one of the initial concerns was the company's September 19
deadline for employees to sign the new contracts, after which they would
receive notice of termination.
He said: 'If the company imposes its threat we will be taking strike action.
That is what we will be recommending to shop stewards.'

FT  10 SEP 94 / Adams likely to be given US visa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, JAMES BLITZ and JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST, LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, last night looked likely to be
granted a visa to visit the US as he moved to raise his political profile in
the Northern Ireland peace process.
He said yesterday that he had received 'thousands of invitations' from the
US to explain the recent ceasefire declaration by Sinn Fein and the IRA, and
he planned to visit as soon as possible.
Mr Adams is barred from visiting the US, and his application aims to test
how receptive the Washington and London governments are to the recent IRA
ceasefire.
A State Department official said in Washington last night that no formal
visa request had been received. But if his intention was to advance the
peace process Mr Adams would probably receive one.
The official was also reported to have said that the Clinton administration
was considering a request from a unionist delegation to visit Washington.
'I think it's safe to say that the US is going to - as President Clinton
said - support this effort of peace in every possible way,' the official
said.
Mr Adams last applied for - and obtained - a US visa in February in spite of
a strong public protest from the British government that the IRA had not
renounced violence.
On that occasion the White House overruled the advice of State Department
officials and agreed to a 72-hour visit by Mr Adams, having become convinced
that it would contribute to the peace process.
White House officials who feel vindicated by that decision are likely to
recommend granting a visa again, although the State Department remains
sensitive to the complex issues at stake. The State Department yesterday
also pointed out that the US admitted Mr Joseph Cahill, a Provisional IRA
leader with a criminal conviction, at the end of last month.
Senator Chris Dodd yesterday met Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier and
suggested that Mr Adams, Mr Reynolds and Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly
nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, should visit the US to
participate in a hearing on the future of Ireland before the Senate foreign
relations committee.
Mr Dodd, as chairman of the subcommittee on western hemisphere and Peace
Corps affairs, would be one of the senators responsible for inviting Mr
Adams on behalf of the Senate committee.
Political aides to Mr Dodd said yesterday that the senator believes there
should be a role for the US in Irish reconciliation and that 'Mr Adams
should sit at the table'.
The British government may formally urge President Clinton not to grant Mr
Adams a visa until the IRA gives a firmer indication that it has permanently
abandoned its military campaign. But officials are aware that the survival
of the IRA ceasefire depends in large measure on Mr Adams being able to show
his supporters that the 'unarmed struggle' is producing political results.
Mr Adams plans to give his next US trip a higher profile than his last one,
hoping he will be heralded as a peacemaker and not a terrorist.
Will they bid for peace? Weekend I

FT  10 SEP 94 / Monks warns unions of 'critical period' ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions face a critical period with their memberships under threat and their
resources hard-pressed, Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, warned at the
end of this year's congress yesterday, Robert Taylor writes.
Mr Monks said unions would have to modernise their organisation, and this
could not be delayed if they were 'to come through their present problems'.
The TUC would have to focus sharply on key campaigning issues at national
level and give more support to union officials in the field. Union activity
was much more decentralised and localised than it used to be, he said.
'The move away from national agreements, the growth of local bargaining and
industrial contrasts, the decentralisation of public services and large
companies, the need to recruit new members and retain existing ones' were
all factors suggesting that unions should concentrate their resources where
their immediate future lies. Photograph: Ashley Ashwood

FT  10 SEP 94 / Teaching union calls for above-inflation pay rises
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Teachers are on a collision course with the government over a pay submission
that would mean rises of more than 20 per cent for some over two years.
The National Union of Teachers challenged the government's public-sector pay
freeze yesterday by calling for a salary increase next year above the rate
of inflation, possibly up to 4 per cent.
The biggest teaching union's submission to the School Teachers' Review Body,
the quango which advises the government on setting teachers' pay, is calling
for a 10-point salary scale by 1996. This would range from Pounds 14,750 for
a graduate-entry teacher - up 13.5 per cent from the present equivalent
starting salary of Pounds 12,999.
Pay for a classroom teacher with 10 years' experience should rise to Pounds
27,000 - up 22.3 per cent from the present maximum of Pounds 22,068 without
payment for extra responsibilities.
The NUT is arguing for a 'significant increase' next year, beating the rate
of inflation and combining a lump sum and percentage to boost starting pay.
Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said the government had breached its
own ban on 'catch-up' pay rises when MPs awarded themselves a 4.7 per cent
increase.
Mr McAvoy warned that his members could take their own steps to cut mounting
workload. 'There comes a point where you say it just can't go on,' he said.
'If no one is going to listen to us, we will have to look very carefully and
decide which aspects of our work we could discontinue.'
With early retirement, teacher absences and stress-related illness at record
levels, conditions of service were as important as pay this year, he added.
Teachers worked an average 49-hour week, with one in 10 putting in more than
60 hours.
The NUT wants the review body, which reports to the government in January,
to recommend smaller classes and more supply teachers.
The union rejected the government's call for performance-related pay as
'completely inappropriate' for teaching.
It wants a two-year deal producing salaries comparable with other non-manual
workers and compensating for years in which it says teachers' pay has
slipped behind other professions.
This year the government imposed the School Teachers' Review Body's
recommended 2.9 per cent pay rise.
Mr McAvoy said improvements in pay and working conditions were essential to
avoid a crisis as the recession eased and numbers of pupils grew.
On present projections of pupil numbers, it would take 19,000 more teachers
just to keep class sizes the same over the next four years.
The submission to the review body from the National Association of
Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers called for a 35-hour-week and a pay
increase in line with other non-manual staff.
The Secondary Heads Association urged the a pay increase for all teachers
'in recognition of their improved productivity, measured by published
examination results'.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Scientists demand share of Millennium Fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Science risks being left out of the Pounds 1.6bn Millennium Fund, Dr Anne
McLaren, departing president of the British Association, warned at the final
day of its science festival in Loughborough yesterday.
Association leaders said scientific projects must be given a share of the
fund, which will distribute a quarter of the proceeds of the new National
Lottery to projects marking the start of the third millennium.
The only millennium proposal so far with any scientific content is the
redevelopment of the area of South Kensington in London inspired by Prince
Albert in the 1850s which includes the Natural History Museum.
Dr McLaren's successor, Sir Martin Rees, said one of his priorities during
the coming year would be to help organise 'high-profile scientific
proposals' to put to the Millennium Commission, which will decide how the
fund is to be distributed.
'The important thing is to ensure that on the menu of millennium proposals
there is at least one that is likely to be widely supported by the
scientific community,' he said. Sir Martin, who will also become Astronomer
Royal in January, said it was too early to specify scientific millennium
projects. But he indicated that his preference was for something that would
involve people all round Britain in science, rather than creating a
grandiose UK equivalent of La Villette, the 'science city' in Paris.
One possibility would be a nationwide network of science centres, linked by
telecommunications and computer technology. At each centre, visitors could
interact with their counterparts elsewhere in the country -
videoconferencing, sharing experiences in virtual reality and taking part in
collaborative games and experiments.
Sir Martin said another priority during the coming year would be to monitor
the performance of the new science minister, Mr David Hunt.
'By the time of our meeting in a year's time in Newcastle, he will be beyond
his honeymoon period and we will want to see whether he can deliver on the
promises he made in Loughborough this week,' he said. Mr Hunt told the
association on Thursday of his commitment to fight for science in the
government.
'Scientists are being very patient,' Dr McLaren said. 'Last year's science
white paper was well received and it is excellent that we have a cabinet
minister responsible for science. But by next summer, unless there are signs
of a bit more money forthcoming for the science budget, scientists are going
to become very concerned.'
Dr McLaren, a distinguished geneticist, added that one sign of trouble was
that the Medical Research Council was forced by lack of funds this summer to
reject some excellent grant proposals.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Coalmines to receive bids from at least 15 groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intense competition is developing in the battle to gain control of British
Coal's mining assets on privatisation of the industry later this year.
With just four days to go before the government deadline for accepting bids
closes, it seems certain that each of the five 'core' regions on offer will
attract at least three tenders, and in some cases considerably more.
Scotland and South Wales, both rich in high-quality opencast reserves, are
likely to attract the largest number of bids - up to nine in each case. The
other regions are based around Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and north-east
England.
Of the 25 companies or consortia that received government approval to bid
earlier this summer, at least 15 are likely to bid for one region or more.
The likely level of bidding presents a sharp contrast to gloomy predictions
made within the industry last year and the year before when mining was in
sharp decline.
While pit closures have caused ministers acute political difficulties, they
have enabled the government to reduce the industry to a size that matches
more closely the demand for coal and is therefore more marketable.
One disappointment for the government is that RTZ, the only international
coal company qualified to bid, seems unlikely to submit tenders, even though
it has been looking actively at what is on offer.
Electricity generators National Power and PowerGen are also likely to stay
out of the fray.
However several large construction companies are thought to be bidders.
Taylor Woodrow is understood to be considering tenders in partnership with
Kier Mining, while Wimpey is linked to Powell Duffryn, the engineer, for a
bid in South Wales. Miller Group has teamed up with Ryan Group, the mining
company, for an assault on Scotland. Amec, another construction company, is
thought unlikely to submit comprehensive tenders for the two regions for
which it has qualified to bid.
Apart from Ryan, which is also aiming at the north-east region with Alcan
Aluminium of Canada, mining companies making bids include RJB Mining, which
is expected to tender for all five regions, and Coal Investments.
CI is in a consortium with the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, which wants
the central north and central south regions. NSM, another coal company, is
considering whether to take up its option to bid for all five regions.
Other bidders include three management buy-out teams.
Bids are also being invited for seven stand-alone pits that have been
mothballed by British Coal following closure. One definite bidder is an
employee buy-out team at Tower Colliery in Mid Glamorgan, where former
participants are prepared to invest Pounds 8,000 each in the venture.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Parsons to cut 600 jobs after contracts delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Parsons Power Generation Systems, part of the Rolls-Royce Industrial Power
Group, yesterday announced the loss of 400 jobs because of a shortage of
work. Most of the losses will be at its Heaton base in Newcastle upon Tyne.
In addition Parsons is shedding 200 temporary jobs at Heaton, where
manufacturing work on existing export contracts will finish next summer.
Last November the company won three power-station projects in India
totalling Pounds 660m. Parsons was to be the turnkey contractor - with
overall responsibility for all three projects - and was also to manufacture
five turbine generators for the projects.
But the contracts, placed by independent Indian power producers, depended on
the negotiation of financial packages which have taken much longer than
expected to complete.
The delay on the contracts, which Parsons still hopes to carry out, has
combined with tough competition for orders.
Mr Trevor Murch, Parsons managing director, said the company faced a change
in the nature of its customers from 'state-owned, monolithic utility
generators' towards independent power producers.
'For projects run by an entrepreneur there's a complete funding package we
need to put together,' he said. 'These things take a little while.'
Parsons, which has made steam turbine generators at Heaton since 1889, has
recently developed a new role as a turnkey contractor, responsible for
projects incorporating equipment from other Rolls-Royce companies and its
alliance partner, US-based Westinghouse. Mr Murch said the role was in
addition to Parsons' manufacturing activities.
Parsons stressed it was making 'strenuous efforts' to boost its orders, and
was continuing investment in product development and new equipment and
systems.
The across-the-board job cuts, affecting 360 at Heaton and 40 service jobs
elsewhere, will cut Parsons' payroll to 2,100 in Newcastle and to 2,500 in
total. Mr Barney McGill, spokesman for the unions, described the job losses
as devastating but hoped negotiation, and possibly orders, during the 90-day
consultation period would reduce the numbers.
Parsons is Tyneside's largest manufacturing employer following the rundown
of shipbuilder Swan Hunter. Mr Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle East,
yesterday wrote to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
saying this had been a 'disastrous week' for the area's industrial base and
urging him to offer constructive support for Parsons' export drive.
Redundancies at Parsons could be averted, he said yesterday. 'We need a
prompt response from government offering help with key overseas orders.
Michael Heseltine should intervene now - as his French, German, American and
Japanese counterparts would.'

FT  10 SEP 94 / Artificial hand will be able to raise a delicate glass
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A prosthetic hand that will be sensitive enough to pick up a glass of wine
without breaking it will be developed within two years, Mr Peter Nurse of
the University of Plymouth said at the meeting yesterday.
Mr Nurse has already developed a prosthetic gripping device strong enough to
pick up an iron bar, and sensitive enough to pick up a paper tube without
deforming it.
The device, which is being used by a student in Plymouth who has suffered a
hand amputation, only has two 'fingers'. The full prototype will look like a
human hand.
Hand-like prostheses are already in use, said Mr Nurse, but the grip is not
easy to control. In order to grip something hard enough to pick it up, they
grip until they crush.
The new device is able to combine strength and sensitivity because it has a
novel sensor that detects both touch and slipping.
The closing of the hand stops when it makes contact with an object, but if
the object starts to slip, the grip is tightened. The prosthetic hand will
grip objects just tightly enough to pick them up.
The wearer commands the prosthesis to close or to open by twitching two
muscles in his upper arm. Sensors placed over the muscles detect the motion
of the skin as the muscle twitches. The batteries in the present model last
about six hours.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Drive for more bank regulation 'may reverse'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trend towards ever more detailed regulation of banks may soon reverse, a
senior Bank of England official told the British Association economics
section in Loughborough yesterday.
Mr Lionel Price, head of the Bank's Centre for Central Banking Studies, said
the views of Mr Don Brash, governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand,
might be 'a harbinger of a wider shift in opinion'. He 'has come to the view
that banking supervisors should be less ambitious,' Mr Price said.
The supervisory burden faced by central banks is made much worse by the
rapid growth of derivatives, he added. 'The pricing of these products, and
the measurement of the risks they carry, has provided much rewarding
employment for mathematicians,' Mr Price said.
Professor David Llewellyn of Loughborough University said the ingredients
were in place for a 'regulatory nightmare'. He proposed moving from
regulating specific risks to supervising each bank's risk-management system.
Mr Price also asked whether central banks are necessarily the right bodies
to supervise the banking sector. 'The distinctions between banks and other
financial institutions are breaking down,' he said. 'As their fields of
activity overlap . . . the case for placing them under a single regulator
becomes stronger.'
Traditional banking is a declining industry, Prof Llewellyn said. As entry
barriers come down thanks to new technology and changes in regulation, banks
will lose business to other financial institutions and to non-financial
corporations in retailing and manufacturing.
'Direct banking', using new computing and communications technology, will
reduce the importance of conventional branches, Prof Llewellyn said.
'Institutions with a substantial branch network may find that what used to
be a major competitive advantage. . . becomes one of their most expensive
problems.'
Banks will continue to respond to the encroachment by moving into other
financial services. 'However, it is unlikely that the market will continue
to support anywhere near the current number of banks in the global financial
system,' Prof Llewellyn concluded.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Swan Hunter design team loses work offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The design team at Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership,
faces redundancy on Monday. after a proposal to offer it sub-contract work
was withdrawn yesterday by Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie. Earlier
this week the French company dropped its attempt to buy the yard as a going
concern.
Most or all of the 100 design staff will lose their jobs on Monday unless
receiver Price Waterhouse is able over the weekend to convert other
expressions of interest in buying Swans as a going concern into firm
propositions.
Joint receiver Mr Gordon Horsfield said yesterday that the likelihood of
this was a 'long shot'. Mr Horsfield, who earlier this week said prospects
of a going-concern sale were now remote, said the redundancies were likely
to be announced on Monday.
The loss of the design team would end the ability of the 164-year-old
company, one of the world's great shipbuilding names, to tender for new
work, in effect sealing its fate.
Their chances of staff finding alternative employment in the shrunken UK
shipbuilding industry were further dented yesterday by an announcement from
Yarrow, the Clyde warship builder, that it now has a 'surplus' of 93
technical staff, including drawing office employees.
At Swans, Mr Horsfield said negotiations were likely to start next week on a
piecemeal sale of assets. Some deals, he said, could be concluded by the end
of the month.
Swans is due to hand over its last vessel, the Type 23 frigate Richmond, on
November 2.
Although the company has shed 1,800 jobs since it went into receivership in
May 1993, the fact it now has 660 employees and a virtually empty order book
is a big impediment to any sale. Under the Transfer of Undertakings
(Employment) Regulations, any going-concern purchaser would have to take on
Pounds 8m of contingent liabilities for the workforce, many of whom have
worked at Swans for 20 years or more.
'It's a classic example of a situation in which potential buyers for a
business have been frightened off by European legislation which is designed
to protect employment,' said Mr Horsfield.
The design team was to have been made redundant on August 31, but the
deadline was extended to yesterday after CMN tabled revised purchase
proposals 10 days ago following deadlock with the MoD over a previous plan.
On Monday, CMN and Price Waterhouse said they had been unable to agree terms
for a going-concern sale conditional on Swans first winning two years' work
before CMN took over. CMN then put forward proposals to acquire Swans'
Hebburn dry dock, the biggest on the east coast of Britain, and its
intellectual property rights. It also proposed to offer the design team
subcontract work up to the end of the year. It is still bidding for Hebburn
and Swans' intellectual rights.
In a statement which indicated increasing frustration with CMN, Price
Waterhouse said yesterday: 'This is the third proposal we have considered
from Soffia/CMN in as many weeks, and each has failed to come to fruition.
The frustration felt by the design team, and the bitterness of the whole
Swan Hunter workforce, can only be imagined as their hopes have been raised
and dashed once again.'
Mr Peter Chapman, Swans' MSF representative, said CMN now had no credibility
with the workforce. 'It's the way they have strung us along, and their
indecisiveness.'
Mr Fred Henderson, leader of CMN's bid team, said it had withdrawn its
subcontract proposal yesterday after the receivers said it must start paying
the design team's Pounds 200,000 monthly wage bill now without any certainty
of acquiring the Hebburn dry dock. He said CMN wanted the dry dock to carry
out shipbuilding.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Stock exchange urged to diversify
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock exchanges which offer only one method of share trading, such as
London, may need to diversify their range of dealing techniques or face a
loss of business to new low-cost trading mechanisms, an article in the
London Stock Exchange's Quarterly Review says.
'An exchange which offers only a single trading mechanism may lose out at a
time when alternative investment strategies are flourishing and trading
needs exhibit growing variation,' the article says.
The article, by Mr Bruce Weber of New York University, does not purport to
be the view of the exchange itself. But many of its members, including some
on the board, have been pressing it to accommodate an 'order-matching'
system alongside its existing marketmaking system.
However, London's market-making firms - some of its wealthiest and most
powerful - oppose erosion of the system.
An order-matching system simply matches the orders of a large group of
buyers and sellers with each other while a marketmaking system designates
securities firms who agree to buy and sell the shares of particular
companies in large quantities in all market conditions.
Earlier this year the board approved funding to build the hardware necessary
for an order-matching system, although it agreed to put off any decision on
whether it should ultimately be built until the end of next year. Some board
members fear competition from a new start-up order matching dealing system,
Tradepoint, which is applying to become a regulated investment exchange in
London.
The article concludes that 'an exchange's best response may be to pre-empt
these alternatives by offering a range or linked trading mechanisms
including competing market maker quotes, limit order facilities and periodic
crossing.'
In his article Mr Weber says the drive towards order-matching systems, which
has moved significant volumes of business away from the New York Stock
Exchange, was prompted largely by the growing popularity of so-called
'passive' investment management techniques. These require investors to
compile a portfolio of stocks whose performance mimics that of a particular
index, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and does not require the
manager to buy or sell significant positions in a particular security at any
particular time. Thus, the immediacy of trading offered by market makers is
unnecessary, saving investors money.
However, the article points out that in some instances dealing costs through
order- matching systems are higher than those of market making.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Judges attacked for relying too much on eyewitnesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new generation of judges is placing too much faith in unsupported
eyewitness testimony, the British Association meeting heard yesterday.
The judges have lost sight of the fact that 'fleeting glimpses lead to
fragmentary and easily influenced memories' said Professor Graham Davies, a
forensic psychologist from Leicester University, after reviewing
miscarriages of justice.
Identity parades can mislead, he said. The fact that an eye-witness is able
to pick the suspect when eight others are present may be irrelevant if none
of the other people in the parade looks like the defendant. The effective
size of the parade - the number of people in it with the same physical
description as the subject - is much more important than its actual size.
Often the effective size can be reduced to one, which means that the
identity parade is meaningless. In one case examined by Prof Davies the
description of the suspect was sufficient for most people to select his
photograph from those of the others in the parade.
Witnesses tend to make their identifications using only two or three key
features, often the eyes and the hair, said Prof Davies. They tend to ignore
differences in other features such as the mouth and the chin, and will
confuse two faces that are obviously very different.
These problems of eye-witness testimony are well known to the legal
profession. In 1976 Lord Devlin reported the results of a judicial inquiry
that recommended that identification evidence alone should not usually be
considered sufficient evidence for prosecution.
These recommendations were not fully implemented, in part because of the
importance of identification in cases of rape. But there continue to be
cases where a conviction on the basis of identification evidence is
overturned by evidence that comes to light after the trial.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Managers' top pay in hospitals is Pounds 95,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's best paid hospital manager earned Pounds 95,000 last year, but was
still worse off than counterparts in industry or commerce, says a survey
published yesterday.
Pay of National Health Service managers has become subject to frequent
political criticism since the government's health reforms gave trust
hospital boards freedom to decide salaries locally.
The survey of 174 NHS trusts shows that chief executives of the country's
biggest hospitals - handling annual budgets of more than Pounds 110m -
earned between Pounds 75,000 and Pounds 95,000 including performance-related
bonuses in 1993-94. There were, however, few managers at this earnings level
 -only six chief executives received more than Pounds 80,000.
While such salaries are good by public-sector standards, the NHS Trust
Federation, which represents trust managements and undertook the survey,
says that 'in business the top manager of a similar-sized operation would
expect total earnings to be more than Pounds 123,000'.
According to the survey chief executives of typical hospitals - with budgets
of Pounds 50m and several thousand staff - earned an average of Pounds
59,000. The federation says this compares with remuneration packages of
Pounds 107,000 for chief executives of similar-sized private sector
companies.
The figures are likely to rise this financial year as more trust chief
executives become eligible for performance-related pay. It was worth an
average 7 per cent to the 70 per cent of chief executives who benefited last
year.
Almost 80 per cent of trust chief executives are shown to be on fixed-term
contracts. Although the provision of cars for NHS managers has caused
political controversy, the survey shows that 85 per cent of chief executives
either provide their own or make personal contributions to running their
office cars.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Competency tests suggested for pre-secondary school pupils
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pupils should have to pass a test of 'minimum competence in maths and
English' before moving on to secondary school, a leading education professor
told the meeting.
'If a pupil does not reach that level, then there is a case for extra
tuition in the evenings, holidays or, in a few cases, repeating a year,'
said Prof Alan Smithers of Manchester University's Centre for Education
Research.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Cairo women worlds apart from UN ideologues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In the gloom of 'Jimmy's' beauty parlour in the well- heeled Cairo suburb of
Heliopolis, the United Nations prescriptions for the 'em- powerment of
women', which are being forged in the city's nearby conference halls, seem a
world away, writes Bronwen Maddox in Cairo.
The walls of the parlour's cubicles for manicures and pedicures, decked out
like underwater grottoes with sea shells, are scattered with soft-focus
portraits of weddings and of intertwined hands wearing huge engagement
rings.
Much of the opposition which has surfaced in recent weeks to the proposed
policies of the UN Conference on Population and Development has been
provoked by the perceived threat to traditional patterns of families and
marriage.
One elegant woman leaving Jimmy's with coral-coloured nails to match her
black and coral dress said the women's groups she had seen on television
reports about the conference had seemed 'very feminist, very American.
'Egyptian men - and women - have very traditional ideas of the woman's place
in the family and I don't think that will change,' she said.
Dr Nafis Sadik, executive director of the UN Population Fund, who is
chairing the conference, has stressed that the UN policy document does not
threaten traditional notions of the family.
That message has been reinforced by the Egyptian government, which wants to
maintain public support for its family planning programme to combat
overcrowding and poverty.
This programme has seen the use of contraceptives rise from 28 per cent to
50 per cent in just over a decade. That has cut the annual growth in
population from 2.8 per cent in 1980 to 2.2 per cent, although without
further falls Egypt's population of 56m could still double by early next
century.
Outside the conference halls, however, it is easy to see how the UN
proposals to increase women's educational opportunities, encourage them to
marry later, and give them equal opportunities at work, seem uncomfortably
foreign and militant.
In particular, the UN exhortations that women should have equal rights at
work are met with scepticism by many Cairo women.
The kind of discrimination at work which Dr Sadik has been inveighing
against is evident two doors up from Jimmy's, at Chez Samir, a renowned
hairdressing salon.
Washing and switching on the hairdryers is left to the quiet teenage girls,
but it is made clear that the business of hair styling is the preserve of
five men.
They approach it like engineering, constructing a scaffolding of rollers,
pins, steel grips and thick hairspray on top of client's head to get the
greatest height possible.
Judging from the reaction of customers and staff, Dr Sadik's fears that the
enduring public memory of the conference will be the much-publicised row
over abortion policy, rather than the central questions of contraception and
women's rights, are justified.
'I am not against the conference, you understand,' says Miron, a Cairo
dentist in her late 20s.
'But there has been so much fuss about abortion, I wonder if the conference
has looked at the right questions.'

FT  10 SEP 94 / USAir disaster is fifth in five years: British Airways
affirms its partnership with the financially troubled US carrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US federal aviation investigators yesterday mounted a search to discover the
cause of the fifth crash of a USAir passenger airliner in as many years,
which was feared to have killed all 132 people on board.
The accident is a further blow to the financially troubled airline, in which
British Airways holds a 24.6 per cent stake, and led to the brief suspension
of USAir's shares on the New York stock exchange.
But Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, said in Atlanta the UK carrier had no
plans to pull out of its partnership with USAir, the sixth largest US
carrier, which is trying to put together a sweeping restructuring package to
stem heavy losses. He denied suggestions that the US carrier's financial
problems were connected to the crashes.
The accident, involving a Boeing 737-300 twin-engine aircraft on its landing
approach near Pittsburgh airport on Thursday night, was the worst in the US
since a Northwest Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-80 crashed on take-off at
Detroit in 1987, killing 156 people.
Although investigators found the aircraft's 'black box' flight recorder,
which they hoped would provide clues to the cause of the crash, officials
yesterday said the cause could take weeks to establish because of what one
called 'the severity' of the accident.
The aircraft, en route from Chicago, was preparing to land when it plunged
into a ravine about half a mile from a shopping centre.
Some witnesses said the aircraft lost power and appeared to have suffered a
shutdown of both engines. Others said there was an explosion before the
aircraft nosedived into the wooded ravine.
Weather conditions were clear in the area before the crash. Pittsburgh
airport lost radar contact with the aircraft at 6,000ft seven miles west of
the airport, a Pittsburgh airport official said.
BA has extensive commercial links with its US partner and has already warned
it will not inject any further money into USAir until it is satisfied with
the restructuring. It has also warned it may write off its Dollars 400m
(Pounds 258m) investment in the airline.
In New York, USAir shares dropped by 7.5 per cent to Dollars 6 1/8 at the
close on heavy volume of 2m shares. BA shares closed in London 9p lower at
401p, reflecting the overall decline in the stock market but also concerns
over USAir.
The crash came just before public hearings into another fatal accident this
year, involving the crash during a thunderstorm of a USAir McDonnell Douglas
DC9 near Charlotte-Douglas airport in North Carolina on July 2 which killed
37 of the 57 people on board.
Boeing said the 737-300 which crashed on Thursday was delivered to USAir in
October 1987. It also said that more than 2,600 737s had been delivered to
airlines throughout the world since 1967.
The 737-300, which can seat 128-149 passengers, is the mid-sized member of
the current second generation of the 737 family. Boeing has launched a
programme to develop a new generation of 737s.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Japan on slow but sure road to recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese economy's crawl towards recovery became official yesterday,
when economic ministers endorsed a report stating that better times were
just around the corner.
Japan 'is moving toward recovery at a gradual pace,' according to the latest
monthly report by the government's Economic Planning Agency; slightly more
cheerful than the previous month's observation that the economy was 'pulling
out of the slump'. Mr Masahiko Komura, the agency's director-general, said
this was not a declaration of economic recovery, merely that the economy was
moving that way.
The EPA's monthly reports, closely watched by the financial community for
minute changes in wording, are of less practical than symbolic importance.
EPA watchers say the previous report did not mention 'recovery'.
Yet this latest attempt to spread mild optimism over an end to nearly three
and a half years of recession, the longest since the second world war, fell
on sceptical ears yesterday. It produced not a twitch in the government bond
market, and a chorus of doubt from business leaders.
The agency wrongly declared that the economy had bottomed out last year, so
businessmen are almost superstitiously reluctant to believe it this time.
'Bright factors are certainly spreading, but I believe it only means that
the economy is coming out of the worst period, and I have no feeling of real
recovery yet,' said Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of both Toyota, Japan's
largest car maker, and of the Keidanren business federation.
Less circumspect than his Keidanren counterpart, Mr Takeshi Nagano,
president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation, warned that a rise in
personal spending might be a one-off, brought on by the hot summer and an
income tax rebate. 'I cannot be optimistic,' he said, citing the impact of
the yen's continued strength on Japan's export-dependent manufacturing
industry.
Despite business leaders' doubts, the EPA report does back up the more
respected Bank of Japan's recent quarterly Tankan survey of business
confidence. Its most recent Tankan, early this week, indicated that a
fragile recovery is emerging, constrained by a weak jobs market and a
continued decline in corporate investment.
The real test will be the EPA's publication, in the second half of this
month, of gross domestic product for the second quarter of the year.
Japan produced higher than expected 3.9 per cent annualised growth in the
first quarter. Growth usually eases in the second period. So anything near
the 1-2 per cent annualised increase that several private sector economists
in Tokyo are expecting would prove the agency's moderate cheerfulness to be
on the mark after all.
Japan's top four securities companies' research units have revised upward
their forecasts for the earnings of leading quoted manufacturers in the year
to next March.
Nomura, the largest and least optimistic, yesterday forecast that blue chip
companies' pre-tax profits would fall for the fifth consecutive year, by 0.5
per cent. This is considerably less than the 2.7 per cent reduction it was
expecting in June.
The other three - Yamaichi, Daiwai and Nikko - are all forecasting that big
manufacturers will show a clear recovery from four years of profit decline.
The difference is that, unlike Nomura, they include steel companies' asset
sales as earnings.
However, all four agree that a rise in exports, the fruits of corporate cost
cutting and a recovery in domestic demand, helped by a hot summer, are the
main features in the improved profits outlook.

FT  10 SEP 94 / New floppy disc poised to spur industry battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The 3.5-inch floppy discs that record computer data may not seem likely to
lead the charge into the multimedia age.
But a significant advance in floppy disc technology looks set to spur a
battle in the electronics industry over what format will dominate the market
for next-generation recording media.
Fuji Photo Film, the Japanese film maker, has developed an advanced 3.5-inch
floppy disc which is capable of recording 50 times as much data as those
currently in use.
This opens up the possibility for floppy discs to dominate future markets
for portable recording media for the digital data created on the PC.
Conventional floppy discs have a recording capacity of just 4 to a maximum
of 21 megabytes, which enables them to record data comprising only words and
numbers.
In the age of multimedia, however, recording media would need to be able to
record moving pictures and sounds, as well as words and numbers. This
requires capacity on the scale of gigabytes, rather than megabytes.
At their current capacity, floppy discs therefore would not be able to
record multimedia information.
Even magneto-optical discs, until now thought to be the frontrunners in the
race to increase recording capacity, can record up to only 230 megabytes.
Fuji's development of floppy discs which can record up to 100 to 200
megabytes of information, puts floppy discs in the frontline of
next-generation recording media along with magneto-optical discs.
An advanced floppy disc has several advantages over magneto-optical discs.
While MO discs are a relatively new product, floppy discs are in wide use,
with production reaching nearly 2.4bn units last year, according to Japan's
Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
Demand for floppy discs is expected to reach 3.5bn units in 1994, according
to the industry.
Not only would floppy discs be able to capitalise on their familiarity, they
are relatively cheap to produce. The new floppy discs developed by Fuji Film
can be used in conventional PCs by installing a special, relatively
inexpensive, component.
Kyocera, the Japanese high-technology company, has been ordered by the
International Court of Commerce to pay LaPine Technology of the US and
Prudential Bache Trade Corporation damages totalling Dollars 257m for breach

FT  10 SEP 94 / Cubans bullish over UK trade delegation visit

   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A high-level British trade mission to Cuba next week could lead to a
'significant' increase in business and commercial ties with the European
Union, to the detriment of US companies, according to Cuban officials.
The mission, led by Mr Ian Taylor, the trade and technology minister, will
include representatives from the leisure, construction and manufacturing
industries, and is the first official visit by a British minister in more
than 20 years.
The officials said the visit could lead US business to put pressure on their
government to relax or remove the 32-year economic embargo before they 'lose
all opportunities' for business with and in Cuba.
'We are open for business, and the world is realising this,' said a Cuban
government official. 'We have a business climate which is better than that
in most other countries of our size and our state of development. We have
workers who are highly educated and are eager to work.'
The Cuban government is also laying great store by recent changes in
economic policy which officials say will attract investments and trade
opportunities from Britain and other European countries. They point to the
free use of foreign currency on the island, and investment regulations which
allow the retention and repatriation of profits, and efforts to encourage
private individual and co-operative business ventures.
Infrastructural problems and deficiencies in utilities such as power and
telecommunications are being mended, they say.
The British mission, in Cuba from Monday to Wednesday, will be encouraged to
explore business opportunities in the form of joint or wholly-owned ventures
in tourism, manufacturing, biotechnology and the marketing of a range of
Cuban agricultural exports.
'Fidel (Castro) said recently that if the United States does not end the
embargo soon, there will not be even one grain of sand left here for
American business,' said the Cuban spokesman. 'The British and other
governments and companies which are brave enough to ignore American pressure
to reduce economic links with Cuba are getting in on the ground floor.'
Aware of concern about the safety of foreign investments, the island's
government will negotiate an investment protection treaty with Britain later
this year, and will be willing to enter similar agreements with other
countries, said government spokesmen.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Seoul to ease hard line over N Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL, BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea yesterday indicated it may pursue a more conciliatory policy
toward North Korea, reversing its recent tough approach to Pyongyang.
The government of President Kim Young-sam has been criticised for its North
Korean policy, which is leaving Seoul increasingly isolated as Washington
and Pyongyang conduct negotiations on possible diplomatic ties.
US diplomats will make an unprecedented visit to the North Korean capital
today to begin talks on setting up liaison offices between the two countries
as part of a deal under which Pyongyang would accept full nuclear
inspections.
The two sides will also meet in Berlin where Mr William Perry, the US
defence secretary, said he was prepared to offer North Korea 'substantial
incentives' in return for Pyongyang dismantling its nuclear weapons
capacity.
The softening of Seoul's stance on the North is believed to result from
talks held in Washington earlier this week between Mr Han Sung-joo, the
South Korean foreign minister, and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of
state.
The US agreed that progress in US-North Korean relations would have to be
linked to an improvement in inter-Korean dialogue, but it is believed that
Washington asked South Korea to improve the atmosphere for a resumption of
talks between Seoul and Pyongyang.
In a sign of compromise during the Washington talks, South Korea agreed to
accept liaison offices between the US and North Korea, according to a senior
adviser to the foreign ministry.
The Seoul government has conducted an inconsistent policy over the North
Korean nuclear issue since it erupted 18 months ago, alternating
conciliatory gestures with tough statements. This reflected deep divisions
in the government over the appropriate response to solving the North Korean
problem.
Following the death of North Korean President Kim Il-sung in early July,
President Kim Young-sam adopted a hardline stance toward the North. He
predicted that North Korea was close to collapse and indicated that a
planned summit between the two Koreas would not be held as it would give a
stamp of legitimacy to Pyongyang's new leadership under Mr Kim Jong-il, the
late president's son.
He also ordered a crackdown on leftist students who expressed sympathy for
North Korea, amid allegations that radicals had infiltrated the political
establishment and media.
Analysts said the tough policy was meant to reverse a recent drop in Mr
Kim's popularity and bolster his support among conservatives, including the
7m South Koreans who once lived in the North before escaping after the
communist government took power in 1945.
But the South Korean media have spoken of a 'crisis in diplomacy' in recent
weeks.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Mitterrand wields double-edged sword: Ailing French
president prepares the ground for the judgment of history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In recent days Francois Mitterrand has been behaving like a man clearing his
desk, putting a gloss on his presidential record for posterity, and emptying
out dusty drawers before the historical cleaners arrive to uncover more
murky incidents in his past.
One of his doctors affirmed yesterday that the president, whose 78th
birthday falls next month and who has been suffering from prostate cancer
for at least two years, was 'fine'. And indeed on Thursday Mr Mitterrand was
in Berlin to take the farewell to his country's troops there, and he was
back in Paris yesterday to greet President Jiang Zemin of China, with whom
he will sign some big-figure trade contracts today.
But what the president has told Le Figaro newspaper in two long interviews
this week, and Mr Pierre Pean, the author of a startling book on the 1936-47
period of his youth, has left an extraordinary ambiguity around everything,
including his health. He told Le Figaro that he reckoned his cancer 'will be
obliging enough for me to finish my term' which ends next May, but also said
he was conscious that he would only be around 'for a few months or years'.
As Mr Mitterrand, a specialist in ambiguity, well realises, such comments
only fuel the uncertainty in the markets and the French political world
about an early election. In addition, the Socialist president has managed to
spray criticism and praise around in such a way as to help destabilise
French conservatives. This would be wholly welcome to his own party, if it
were not for the fact that revelations about his right-wing and Vichyist
associations before, during and after the second world war have shocked many
Socialists.
It was already known that the young Mitterrand participated in some
right-wing movements before the war, and that after his escape from a German
prisoner camp in 1941, he worked for the Vichy administration for a year or
so before sliding into the resistance.
But what has shocked many French is the disclosure of Mr Mitterrand's
friendly associations with Mr Jean-Paul Martin and Mr Rene Bousquet, senior
officials in the Vichy police. Mr Mitterrand, while president, apparently
attended Mr Martin's funeral in 1986. He also told Mr Pean that he
considered Mr Bousquet 'sympathetic'; yet as president he inaugurated a day
of national mourning for one of the Jewish deportations in 1942 of which
Bousquet was accused. The latter was assassinated last year before he could
face war crimes charges.
In the same interviews, Mr Mitterrand also delves into his more recent past.
He says, for instance, that his 1989 call for a Europe-wide confederation
was misinterpreted as a bid to keep eastern Europe out of the European
Union, and that his 1991 resistance to German calls to recognise ex-Yugoslav
republics' borders was not an attempt to freeze the Titoist order there.
But of more current interest are the various stones he casts in the path of
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur by revealing divisions in the conservative
government over whose Wednesday cabinet meetings he presides. In addition to
warning rank-and-file Gaullists of 'the certain tendency' of their
government 'to re-enter the ranks of Nato', he also notes that Mr Alain
Juppe, the foreign minister, sided with him  - and against the prime and
defence ministers - on intervention in Rwanda. On Algeria, he points out the
way that Mr Balladur sided with Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister,
and against Mr Juppe.
Anything resembling praise for Mr Juppe is tacit encouragement to Mr Jacques
Chirac, whose presidential bid the foreign minister backs against that of
the prime minister.
Clearly, President Mitterrand intends to go on dividing before he stops
ruling.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Mappin &amp; Webb opens Prague store: Vincent Boland wonders
whether Czechs are ready for the ultimate in consumerism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Czech Republic's new rich, thanks to the country's breakneck economic
transformation, are no strangers to German cars, French perfumes, Italian
clothes, Japanese electronics and American computers. Now they have been
asked the ultimate consumer question: Are they ready for a hand-made,
diamond-studded, Pounds 45,565 Rene Boivin wrist watch?
One man who thinks they are is Mr Naim Attallah, chief executive of Asprey,
the London jeweller which owns Garrard, the crown jewellers, and Mappin &amp;
Webb, the upmarket jewellery and luxury goods chain. Yesterday Mappin &amp; Webb
opened in Prague.
'I've got a good hunch about Prague,' said Mr Attallah, explaining why he
chose the Czech capital as Mappin &amp; Webb's first European store outside the
UK. 'It's new, it's enterprising, people are making money.'
Mr Attallah said he believed Mappin &amp; Webb's Pounds 2.5m investment in the
new store, located on the main tourist route through the centre of Prague's
Old Town, would show immediate results. He said he expected turnover of
Pounds 2m in the first year and profits of about Pounds 150,000.
'The risks are very minimal,' he said. 'It is definitely not too early to go
in.'
The store's main target is not, he insisted, the thousands of tourists who
pass its front door every summer as they traverse Prague's famous Royal
Route.
'We are opening for Czech business,' he said, adding that the store stocked
more affordable items, too.
Ms Wiz Marshall, Mappin &amp; Webb's promotions manager, who is overseeing the
launch of the store, said the intention was to offer a little bit of English
tradition.
Private viewings may be arranged for top clients, and serious customers will
be offered tea or a glass of wine as they consider a fine diamond, or a
sterling silver cutlery set. This will certainly make a change from the
scowls that often greet customers at many Prague stores.
Mr Attallah said he originally planned to open a store in Shanghai, another
city rediscovering its taste for free-wheeling capitalism and the material
benefits it can bestow. He decided on Prague after 'wearing my feet out'
wandering around the city one sweltering evening earlier in the summer,

Two men with family ties to the White House survived primary elections in
Florida on Thursday. Mr Hugh Rodham, brother of the First Lady, finished
first in the Democratic contest to field a candidate against Republican
Senator Connie Mack in November. But his 34 per cent forces him into a
run-off poll on October 4. If he wins then, his chances against Ms Mack are
still reckoned small. Mr Jeb Bush, second son of former President George
Bush, won the Republican primary in the governor's race with 46 per cent and
also faces a run-off for the right to fight Mr Lawton Chiles, the incumbent
Democrat, in what is predicted to be a close race. Mr Jeb Bush's older
brother, George Jr, is also in a governor's race as a Republican - in Texas
against the incumbent Ms Ann Richards.

The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) yesterday re-elected
incumbent general secretary Mr Sam Shilowa and pledged to strengthen its
formal political alliance with the African National Congress and the South
African Communist party. The unopposed election of Mr Shilowa at the
federation's national congress in Soweto quashed speculation that he would
be challenged for the position, while approving continued links with the ANC
seemed to show willingness to co-operate with, rather than oppose, the
government. The federation has been struggling to define its role since many
leaders left the trade union movement for political office, and tensions
between the ANC-led government and Cosatu have risen over a recent wave of
strikes.

<TEXT>
Approved Taiwanese investment in China fell sharply during the first eight
months of the year to Dollars 652.1m, down 31 per cent from the same period
in 1993, according to government figures published yesterday. For 1993,
Taiwanese commitments in China totalled Dollars 3.17bn. Taiwan's overseas
investments to August, apart from those in China, climbed 15 per cent from a
year earlier to Dollars 1.15bn. The government's Investment Commission
attributed the rise to increased funds flowing into the British Virgin
Islands, through which Taiwanese companies may invest in Europe without
paying tax. Such investments jumped 137 per cent to Dollars 821.4m, making
the islands the largest investment destination so far this year. China's
mishandling of a murderous attack on 24 Taiwanese tourists in China's
Zhejiang province in late March dealt a blow to investor confidence. For the
three months before this, approvals had been up 139 per cent on the year.

Indian officials yesterday signed an agreement to cap the government's
borrowing from the country's central bank, aiming to curb public sector
over-spending. The government is limiting itself to borrowing a maximum of
Rs60bn (Pounds 1.2bn) from the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, in
the current financial year. It is also accepting a ceiling of Rs90bn on the
net amount it can borrow for periods of over 10 days during the financial
year. Similar ceilings are to be set in 1995-96 and 1996-97 after which the
government will stop borrowing directly from the central bank and will raise
funds from the markets.

Talks on foreign aid to support Palestinian self-rule broke down yesterday

sponsor of the talks, which said the aid issue was too important to be
'derailed by the two main parties'. The bank indicated it would try to
resume the negotiations, but set no date for reconvening the delegations
from donor nations. A Palestinian official said 6 per cent of the
Palestinians' Dollars 160m 1994 operating budget was proposed for projects
in Jerusalem.

The US will launch a new European-wide commercial strategy aimed at

under-secretary of commerce, said yesterday in Berlin. He said Washington's
trade ties with Germany would form the basis for this strategy, as well as
providing a crucial stepping stone for US companies seeking to expand into
eastern Europe. He told a meeting of senior US and German political and
economic officials: 'Commercial issues have moved to the centre of our
foreign policy. How we handle this aspect of our relationship (with Germany)
will be a driving force for the broader ties we seek in the arenas of
politics, security and culture.'

Nato, Russia was an entirely different 'quality'. He added that the special
co-operation which had developed among the 16 Nato countries over the years
would be 'endangered' were Russia to join. Mr William Perry, the US

include Russia was based on the need to co-operate with Russia to minimise
the threat of a nuclear holocaust happening: 'That fact must always be at

Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister, yesterday called upon Mr
Didier Pineau-Valencienne, the fugitive French industrialist and chairman of
Groupe Schneider, to surrender to Belgian authorities. Mr Dehaene warned
that it would set 'a dangerous precedent' if justice was flouted. 'No person
is above the law,' he said. Mr Dehaene's intervention threatened to
exacerbate strains between Belgium and France over the fate of Mr
Pineau-Valencienne, who faces charges of fraud and embezzlement relating to
Cofimines and Cofibel, two Belgian subsidiaries of Groupe Schneider. The
Schneider board yesterday issued a formal statement in support of Mr
Pineau-Valencienne. The statement followed an emergency board meeting called
to discuss the international arrest warrant for Mr Pineau-Valencienne
obtained by the Belgian judge investigating the alleged fraud.
Mr Pineau-Valencienne has pledged to co-operate with the Belgian
authorities, but only on condition that the interviews take place in France
under the supervision of French authorities. His cause has been taken up in
France, notably by Mrs Edith Cresson, the former Socialist prime minister
and one of France's two nominees to the next European Commission.

FT  10 SEP 94 / CIS strengthens economic ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Commonwealth of Independent States yesterday agreed to form a payments
union and an interstate economic committee in a drive to strengthen economic
ties.
The interstate economic committee, described by Russian deputy prime
minister Alexander Shokhin as roughly equivalent to the European Commission,
is designed to put into effect the economic treaties signed by members of
the CIS, but often not implemented. The payments union is an attempt to
achieve relatively speedy settlement of accounts between states with
independent, and non-convertible, currencies.
An official communique from a meeting of CIS prime ministers in Moscow
yesterday said both mechanisms were approved by all members except the
central Asian republic of Turkmenistan and the Caucasian republic of
Azerbaijan. Representatives of these two states asked for further time to
study the plans after saying they would dilute their sovereign rights.
At the meeting Ukraine showed it still wanted to keep its distance from a
closer union with the Russian-dominated body, in spite of the election of a
more pro-Russian president in Mr Leonid Kuchma earlier this year.
Mr Vitaly Masol, the Ukrainian prime minister said that since the proposal
for a payments union assumed the free convertibility of national currencies
at their market price, it should be brought in slowly through bilateral
agreements between the states. 'For the free floating of the Ukrainian
coupon we need a stabilisation fund and gold reserves, neither of which we
have.'
Mr Igor Mityukov, Ukrainian vice premier for the economy, said Ukraine did
not intend to change its status as an associate member of the CIS economic
union - and thus it could only become an associate member of the interstate
economic committee, taking part only in selected discussions.
Russia's regional governors yesterday demanded that the government erect
tariff walls to protect Russian industry against the 'uncontrolled' flood of
foreign imports. Mr Nikolai Sevriugin, governor of the Tula region and an
emissary from a meeting of the Union of Governors in Yaroslavl, told
government ministers that 'the untimely policy of opening the doors to
exports will lead to the extinguishing of Russian consumer goods and other
industries'.
At the meeting, Mr Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy prime minister, said he
would respond 'positively' to a proposal from Rosugol, the Russian state
committee for coal production, for subsidies initially amounting to Rbs110bn
(Dollars 50m) to subsidise coal exports and raise the planned sales to
Europe from 9m tonnes to 16m tonnes this year rising to 30m next year. The
ministers also agreed to increase subsidies to coal transport so that the
tariffs paid by the producers are cut by 50 per cent.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Bundesbank member hits at move to soften Emu terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a leading member of the Bundesbank's decision-making
council, yesterday attacked attempts to relax the terms under which European
Union states could take part in economic and monetary union.
Speaking as an informal meeting of European finance ministers was getting
under way to discuss the issue in southern Germany, Mr Jochimsen said a big
operation for softening the convergence criteria was already starting.
In remarks at an Anglo-German university conference in Oxford, he opposed
indications that European finance ministers may decide that Ireland meets
the terms, in spite of its large government debt.
Ireland's government debt was about 90 per cent of gross domestic product,
well in excess of the 60 per cent level set by the Maastricht Treaty, Mr
Jochimsen pointed out. 'This gives the wrong signal,' he said, adding that
Belgium, Italy and Greece had even more acute debt problems.
He welcomed as a contribution to debate last week's proposals from Germany's
Christian Democrats on differing paces of European integration.
However he doubted the wisdom of proceeding to monetary union with 'core
members' at a time when the European Union had to open membership to the
east.
He underlined the Bundesbank's longstanding wish that monetary union should
be embedded in a full-scale political union embodying the principle of
subsidiarity - carrying out decision-making as closely as possible to the
local level.
'If we want to take this powerful step of Emu we will need a federal order
in Europe ..no one wants a superstate, but unless we have the right
framework it might be necessary, as a last resort, to give up this project.'
Mr Jochimsen expressed concern that acceptance was growing only 'very
hesitantly' of the need for a 'common political roof' for monetary union.
He said Germany's original request before the Maastricht summit in December
1991 for thoroughgoing steps towards political union had not been simply a
bargaining tactic. Rather, it was a crucial precondition to make Emu work.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Pope picks up remnants of peace mission with visit to Zagreb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sarajevo's beleaguered status and fragile security was cruelly underlined by
the Pope's decision to abandon his planned visit this week. But the Pontiff
is assured of an enthusiastic welcome when he arrives in Zagreb today for
his long awaited visit to the capital of staunchly catholic Croatia.
The first papal visit formally celebrates the 900th anniversary of the
establishment of the Zagreb diocese. But it was originally planned as part
of a more ambitious scheme to visit the three feuding capitals of former
Yugoslavia to plead for a return to religious and cultural co-existence
between those of catholic, orthodox and Islamic belief.
Gunmen, and fear of another assassination in the city where a Serbian
nationalist fired the shot which ignited the first world war scuppered the
first speech. A hostile reaction from the orthodox church prevented the
Pope's healing words being heard in Belgrade.
The risk now is that the Pope's visit to Zagreb alone will be twisted by
propagandists as evidence of Vatican support for the Croatian president, Mr
Franjo Tudjman, and behind the scenes support by the world-wide catholic
church for one side in the Yugoslavian conflict.
In fact the Vatican has never hidden its reservations over the personality
and policies of Mr Tudjman, a former communist general turned Croat
nationalist. His insensitivity to the fears of Croatian Serbs at the time of
independence played into the hands of Mr Slobodan Milosevic, his Serb
counterpart, and contributed to the post-independence uprising by ethnic
Serbs in Slavonia and the Krajina regions.
The independent Croatia which the pope is visiting this weekend is not the
prosperous, independent state dreamed of by Croats for centuries. It is a
rump state with one-third of its territory controlled by Serbs who possess
the most fertile land in Slavonia and block access to the Dalmatia coast
which once provided more than Dollars 1bn a year in tourist earnings.
It is also a country still at war in neighbouring Bosnia where Zagreb's
clandestine deal with Belgrade for a two-way territorial carve-up and
initial support for Croat nationalists degenerated into a three-way
conflict. Again it was largely discreet papal diplomacy which persuaded Mr
Tudjman to lean on the Bosnian Croats and persuade them to accept the uneasy
Croat-Moslem alliance which currently prevails.
For a brief weekend the papal visit will raise the spirits of the Croat
nation. He will call for reconciliation, address the rights of minorities
and call for the return of refugees. They will be words of special relevance
for the estimated 250,000 Croats and ethnic Hungarians driven from their
homes in 1991 and hoping that the Pope will be able perform the miracle
which continues to elude armies, politicians and international negotiators.
The unanswerable question is whether the Serbs, with similar hopes and
fears, will be listening.

FT  10 SEP 94 / US upsets Paris with OECD demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration has expressed its firm opposition to Mr
Jean-Claude Paye continuing as secretary general of the Paris-based
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development after his term
expires at the end of this month.
An unusually blunt US statement, sent by the State Department to the
Washington embassies of other OECD members this week, has angered the French
government, which will seek EU backing for Mr Paye's candidacy at informal
meetings of foreign and finance ministers in Germany this weekend.
The statement, ruling out Mr Paye's renomination even on a stop-gap basis,
reflects increasing impatience at what Washington regards as European
foot-dragging over decisions on the OECD job and the future development of
the body.
The EU ministers will also seek to agree on candidates for the top jobs at
Nato, the Western European Union and the World Trade Organisation, the
planned successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister, yesterday won his government's
support as candidate for secretary general of Nato, succeeding Mr Manfred
Worner, who died last month.
Consensus at this weekend's meetings could be hard to achieve if EU
governments insist on linkages between the various posts. Some of France's
partners fear it may demand that they back Mr Paye for the OECD in return
for French support for Mr Renato Ruggiero, an Italian former trade minister,
as the EU's candidate for the WTO.
French officials were discouraging such speculation last night.
OECD ambassadors will again seek to agree on who should fill the post in
Paris on Thursday. The other candidates are Mr Don Johnston, a Canadian
former politician strongly backed by the US, which argues Mr Paye's 10 years
in the job is enough; Lord Lawson, the former UK chancellor of the
exchequer; and Mr Lorenz Schomerus, a senior German economics ministry
official.
Mr Claes is competing for the Nato post against Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the
Norwegian foreign affairs minister and UN mediator in former Yugoslavia, and
Mr Hans van den Broek, the Dutch EU commissioner responsible for external
political affairs.
Though Mr Claes won widespread approval for his performance during the
Belgian presidency of the EU last year, diplomats in Brussels said yesterday
there was behind-the-scenes pressure on Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign
secretary, to stand. Mr Hurd, however, is said to be reluctant to move.
If Mr Claes were to succeed Mr Worner, it would most likely mean the removal
of Mr Karel Van Miert, the popular Belgian EU commissioner for competition
policy. Because both Mr Claes and Mr Van Miert are members of the Flemish
Socialist party, other members of the governing coalition would most likely
demand compensation. Belgium is allotted one nomination for the next
European Commission, which begins next January.
The German government confirmed yesterday that its two candidates to be
members of the next European Commission would be Mr Martin Bangemann, the
current industry commissioner, who is a member of the minority Free
Democratic party in the Bonn coalition, and Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, leader
of the oTV public sector workers' trade union, nominated by the opposition
Social Democrats.

FT  10 SEP 94 / American Express close to deal on Thomas Cook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
American Express is close to acquiring the international business travel
operations of Thomas Cook in a move that would strengthen its position as
one of the world's two biggest travel agency groupings.
The deal, which is expected to be announced early next week, would also
involve American Express buying all of Thomas Cook's US travel agency
operations.
The purchase would be the latest and largest of a series of acquisitions in
the worldwide business travel market. It signals a move by agencies to
increase their negotiating power with airlines and to offer a wider range of
services to the big companies whose budgets drive a large part of the
international business travel market.
American Express refused yesterday to confirm the deal. However, one
industry executive close to the talks said it was likely to be concluded
within days.
The deregulation of airlines around the world is creating new markets for
travel agencies. By increasing their buying power, the biggest agencies
claim they can get cheaper flights for their corporate customers than would
otherwise be the case.
The Thomas Cook operations are expected to add about Dollars 2bn (Pounds
1.2bn) a year to American Express's travel agency billings (the spending by
its customers on airline tickets, hotels and so on), which stood last year
at Dollars 8bn.
That would put it shoulder-to-shoulder with the US-French grouping of
Carlson and Wagonlit, which agreed to combine their business travel
operations in March. Between them, Carlson and Wagonlit had billings of
Dollars 10.8bn last year.
American Express is buying the Thomas Cook operations from Westdeutsche
Landesbank, the German bank which itself bought the travel agency and
travellers' cheque business from Midland Bank of the UK for DM600m (Pounds
247.9m). WestLB will retain Thomas Cook's travellers' cheque business, as
well as its non-US consumer travel agency operations.
In the past year, American Express has bought big domestic business travel
agencies in Scandinavia, Brazil and Australia, as well as a regional US
agency based in Texas. Carlson Wagonlit Travel, the business travel joint
venture between the US and French companies, has made acquisitions in the
Far East.
The US Thomas Cook agency business, which has 385 offices, is being bought
from a private US company which operates under a franchise arrangement.
Under US banking laws, WestLB has not been able to own this outright.
American Express is thought to have sounded out antitrust authorities in
Washington on the US part of the deal, and to have received an initially
favourable response.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Shares and bonds slide after US price surge: Renewed fears
of rate rise - Dollar and pound weaken against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bond and stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic tumbled yesterday after
the US government released data showing an unexpectedly sharp increase in
wholesale prices during August.
The figures suggest that inflationary pressure may be building up in the US
economy and revived fears among investors and traders that the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates again soon to slow the pace of economic
growth and curb inflation.
The Fed last raised interest rates on August 16, the fifth tightening of US
monetary policy since February. At the time, Wall Street analysts hoped it
would be the last rate increase until at least November. Yesterday's data on
wholesale prices, however, may persuade the Fed that it has not yet done
enough to fight off inflation.
The US government figures showed the largest single monthly increase in
wholesale prices for nearly four years. The Labour Department said that the
producer price index in August had risen by 0.6 per cent from July, the
biggest jump since the 1.1 per cent increase of October 1990.
The advance, in excess of market expectations, comes on top of a 0.5 per
cent rise in July compared with June, when no increase was recorded. In the
first eight months of this year, wholesale prices have gone up at an annual
rate of 2.9 per cent.
The selling on financial markets yesterday was widespread. In New York, the
Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 33.65 at 3,874.81, and bond prices
dropped steeply. The fall in bonds pushed the long bond yield, the most
widely followed measure of long-term interest rates, up to 7.7 per cent -
its highest level since July.
The sell-off on Wall Street spread to Europe, where early gains quickly
turned into losses as traders scrambled to unload the more hopeful positions
they had taken earlier in the day. In London, the FT-SE 100 index of leading
stocks closed down 40.7 at 3,139.30, and in Frankfurt the Dax index ended
22.52 lower at 2,155.58. The Paris CAC-40 dropped 2.2 per cent from its
day's peak and 34.57 points on day, to 1,948.83.
The US data also sent European government bonds tumbling as the prospect of
another rise in US rates dashed any lingering hopes of further monetary
easing in Europe. 'It is another nail in the coffin of those who believed
that further cuts in Europe were likely,' said one bond salesman.
A further worry was that the price fall was accompanied by some relatively
heavy selling of cash positions, suggesting that fund managers were growing
tired of waiting for a recovery in bond prices.
UK gilts fell by 2 points at one stage, sending the yield on 10-year paper
up by 26 basis points to 8.82 per cent, the highest since June. German
government bonds were also weak, pushing 10-year yields back above 7 1/2 per
cent.
The big losses on Wall Street prompted a fall in the dollar, with traders
fearing that the poor performance of US stocks and bonds would continue to
depress an already weak US currency. The dollar was trading at DM1.5375 in
the New York last night, down from a high before the figures of DM1.5620. It
was also lower against the yen.
The weaker dollar helped sterling, which firmed to Dollars 1.55, from
Dollars 1.54 before the release of the price figures, but the pound fell two
pfennings against the stronger D-Mark, to DM2.3850, from DM2.4050.

FT  10 SEP 94 / De Beers accuses Russia of Dollars 500m gem 'leak'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
De Beers has accused Russia of 'leaking' up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 322.5m)
worth of uncut diamonds on to the world market, seriously violating the
agreement between the South African group's Central Selling Organisation and
the Russian producers.
The company believes the contract, vital to maintaining control of rough
diamond prices, may not be renewable after the end of next year, when it
expires.
Talks in Moscow this week between De Beers executives and the Russian
Committee on Precious Metals, together with Mr Anatoly Golovaty, the deputy
finance minister, on the huge level of unofficial sales brought the two
sides no closer together. The company's executives remain pessimistic about
future co-operation.
Russia is the second-largest diamond producer after De Beers' own production
in Botswana and South Africa. Its defection from the De Beers-controlled
cartel would be likely to set off a price war that could send prices
tumbling. The CSO sold a record Dollars 2.6bn of diamonds in the first half
of 1994.
De Beers has limited scope for reasserting order in the market, in spite of
its traditional domination of diamond sales. If it refuses to renew the
agreement, it will be faced with a large producer capable of launching a
sustained attack on its prices. If it renews the contract, it may have to
accept a level of indiscipline that might also threaten price levels. It
would also send the wrong message to other cartel members such as Zaire,
Australia, Namibia and Angola.
The belief in Russia that producers could achieve a higher return outside
the cartel has been strengthened by the retirement of a generation of
officials used to working with De Beers in the cartel system - and the rise
of nationalist politicians hostile to the agreement on political and
economic grounds.
Mr Leonid Gurevich, formerly head of a parliamentary committee on gold and
precious metals and now vice-president in charge of diamonds at the State
Precious Metals Committee, believes the agreement with De Beers is too
restrictive and should be renewed only if it allows much more scope for free
sales.
De Beers executives, who have held a series of talks with the Russians this
year, presented evidence that the unofficial sales had lowered prices
worldwide - or at best kept them at last year's levels when increased
consumer demand would normally have caused an increase.
According to De Beers, the Russian officials accepted that there was
substantial unofficial selling and that prices were depressed, adding that
these sales were causing concern to the Russian authorities, which were
investigating how to stop them.

FT  10 SEP 94 / Major attacks 'yob culture' in fresh law and order drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday called for a drive to dispel public despair over
crime as he declared war on 'yob culture' and indicated a growing
inclination towards identity cards.
While insisting that Britain is safer, more civilised and more secure than
most countries, the prime minister admitted: 'When I talk to people I sense
that the fear of crime is greater than I can ever remember.'
Mr Major advocated the building of 'a huge national partnership against the
criminal, in every city and county, every workplace, every school and every
home'.
The prime minister underlined the importance attached by the Conservative
party to regaining its lead on law and order issues. In the run-up to next
month's Tory conference, the prime minister was also keen to address the
Tory activists' favourite issue.
But Mr Major's call for a crime crackdown was greeted with scepticism in
some quarters. Mr Peter Cadbury, the former head of Westward Television, who
announced he would no longer give financial support to the Conservative
party after his home was burgled last month, was far from enthusiastic. He
doubted whether it would be possible to build a partnership against crime
and forecast that the Tories would be 'wiped out' at the next general
election.
Mr Major called on magistrates to make full use of their powers to give
tougher sentences for so-called 'petty offences'.
The prime minister said he looked for 'a real national effort to build an
anti-yob culture', ruled out legalising cannabis and other soft drugs and
hinted that the government was close to being persuaded that identity cards
should be introduced.
He said: 'Anything that could check crime and cut fraud must be worth a
look. It is crime and the fear of crime that most violate our civil
liberties.'
Outlining measures already in place, he said they would cut down the
'scandalous over-use of cautioning for persistent offenders' and tighten the
bail rules.
Mr Major accepted that the public wanted 'tough and challenging penalties
for persistent young offenders, not visits to safari parks'. Alleged
offenders should be remanded in custody rather than bailed if there was any
risk of repeating the kind of violent crimes for which they were awaiting
trial, he said.
He said the public want a clampdown on those who make the streets
frightening.
Mr Alun Michael, Labour spokesman on home affairs, accused Mr Major of
giving 'the illusion of action' while offering little comfort to victims of
crime.

Mr Leslaw Paga, head of Poland's securities commission, is leaving to join
Deloitte Touche Komatsu, the international accounting firm.
Mr Paga was one of the authors of Poland's stock market legislation and has
headed the commission since it was established three years ago. Under his
supervision the Warsaw stock market has been free of the scandals which have
bedevilled Poland's private banking sector.
The commission has policed the market in conjunction with the stock exchange
council and taken the number of companies quoted on the bourse from five in
1991 to the current 32.
Mr Paga's successor, yet to be appointed, will have to face the problems of
developing a market with a mass of individual investors but few domestic
institutional participants and no investment banks.
Yesterday Mr Paga said that he was leaving because he felt 'my mission has
been fulfilled'. Bilfinger und Berger, one of Germany largest construction
companies, has agreed to pay Dollars 7m for 70 per cent of Hydrobudowa 6, a
Polish construction company with experience in gas pipeline work in the
former Soviet Union.
PBR, the Polish development bank, is to take a further 10 per cent share and
both investors will put DM14m (Dollars 8.9m) into the company.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Kmart to close 110 discount stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kmart, the embattled US retailing giant, is to close 110 of its discount
stores with the loss of 6,000 jobs. It is also to reduce its management
workforce by 10 per cent during the next two years, resulting in a further
1650 job losses.
The closures are part of a retrenchment programme announced in January this
year, when Kmart took a Dollars 1.3bn restructuring charge against 1993
earnings. Kmart said yesterday that the programme, which covers relocation
of stores as well as outright closures, is now 65 per cent complete.
The group's profits have fallen for seven quarters in a row, chiefly because
of weak trading in the discount store business.
Yesterday's announcement was seen by Wall Street as evidence that Kmart is
concentrating on problems in its basic business. The company has been
wrangling with shareholders over its specialty retail operations, ranging
from sports goods to bookselling. In June, Kmart agreed to float off four of
its five specialty chains.
Kmart, which has been overtaken as the world's biggest retailer by its
younger US rival Wal-Mart, said the stores to be closed had not met
requirements on sales, profits or investment returns. The 110 closures
represent slightly less than 5 per cent of a total 2,350 stores in the Kmart
chain.
Kmart also announced the recruitment of Mr Ronald Floto as head of its Super
Kmart operation, its move into superstores. Mr Floto is was head of Kash
N'Karry Food Stores Inc.
Mr Joseph Antonini, Kmart president, said yesterday's announcements, and the
impending flotations of the specialty store chains, represented 'strong
steps towards focusing on the core US Kmart business.' However, he added,
'much remains to be done.' Kmart shares rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 18 1/4
on the news.
Concentration on the traditional discount chain is a recent departure for
the group. Previously, Mr Antonini insisted that Kmart should retain control
of its specialty chains as well, proposing that the company should issue
special categories of stock linked to the chains' performance. It was this
proposal which was thrown out in June by the investing institutions, who
preferred outright sale of the non-traditional business.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Lean times for New Zealand meat industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The sudden collapse of two big New Zealand meat processing companies -
UK-owned Weddel and the innovative Fortex group - has underlined the deep
financial problems that have plagued for the past decade the country's
biggest export industry.
The crash of Weddel last month after banks refused to lend it more money has
drawn attention to the indebtedness of remaining companies, and aroused
national concern for the future of the NZDollars 4bn (USDollars 2.4bn)
industry.
Weddel, which had been controlled by the wealthy UK Vestey family for most
of the century, had been considered one of the stronger players, and handled
an estimated 18 per cent of the industry through its six works. The
company's failure marked the end of UK investment in the industry.
Over the past decade Borthwicks and the British Co-operative Society had
been forced to quit due to changing markets and high costs. A string of
locally owned companies, including Fletcher Challenge, Goodman Fielder
Wattie, Waitaki, Gear, Waitane Meats, and Venison New Zealand had also been
forced out of the industry.
Collectively the losses total about NZDollars 950m over the past five years,
according to a study by merchant bank Southpac, which also said the industry
as a whole had shown no return on capital during that period. Nor had it
earned enough to cover interest payments in two of the past three years; and
would be unable to do so again this year. The banks, which are owed
NZDollars 1.9bn by the companies, are said to be running out of patience.
The problem is largely a structural one. The meat processing companies
receive an inadequate share of profits. Most have inadequate capital and
continuing funding problems as they try to cope with a deregulated
environment. There are also too many players, leading to big marketing and
overcapacity problems.
The industry's troubles have intensified over the past 10 years. The last
period of strong profitability was in the early to mid 1980s when the Meat
Board dominated the industry. As the government poured in taxpayer's money
in farm support payments, sheep numbers soared to 73m.
But from the mid 1980s things started to go badly wrong; the industry was
turned on its head after the Labour government removed farm incentives,
forcing companies to resume competitive bidding for stock, marketing and
other roles.
As sheep numbers plummeted - the national flock now numbers just over 50m -
the processing companies were placed under increasing pressure. The ensuing
tangle of ownership, mergers and plant closures grew increasingly complex,
as did changing industrial attitudes.
Initially unions battled management attempts to cut staff numbers, tighten
conditions and close works. But more recently they have decided to
co-operate to try to ensure the industry's future.
The role of the co-operatives, which dominate the industry, is seen as a
significant problem. Three big groups - Affco on North Island and PPCS and
the Alliance in the south - handle 66 per cent of the sheep and 45 per cent
of the beef kill.
It is claimed that the lower cost structure of the co-operatives, allied
with less pressure on them to make returns on capital to their farmer
shareholders, were factors which effectively helped PPCS and the Alliance to
squeeze the Fortex group out of business by forcing it to pay higher prices
for stock.
'Given the influence of co-operatives within the industry, the overall
profitability may not improve,' the Southpac report said.
Analysts believe the banks, which carry most of the risk, will be loathe to
finance the industry, aim to charge prohibitively high risk margins on loan
capital, or impose draconian restraints and other conditions on the way the
companies conduct business. Many lenders are seeking to reduce their
exposure by withdrawing funds they have committed in the past.
Nevertheless, the industry has overcome many of its old problems. Real lamb
processing costs have fallen by 20 per cent in the past 10 years, and costs
are considerably lower than in Australia. A decade ago New Zealand
processing costs were 50 per cent higher than in competing countries.

Bulgaria appears set for general elections within the next two months
following acceptance yesterday by the Bulgarian parliament of the
resignation of the government of Prime Minister Lyuben Berov. Mr Berov took
power at the end of 1992, leading a non-party government formed after the
collapse of a government led by the Union of Democratic Forces, an
anti-communist alliance. The Bulgarian Socialist party, successor to the
former communist party, supported the Berov government and is expected to
emerge from elections as the largest single party. A caretaker government
will be appointed to govern until the elections and the Berov cabinet has
been authorised to continue talks with international financial institutions
for a promised Dollars 125m loan from the World Bank and Dollars 100m from
the IMF.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Study forecasts rising level of economic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Swiss authorities have been given a fairly strong - if grudging -
endorsement from the OECD for their recent management of the Swiss economy,
writes Ian Rodger.
Switzerland is recovering from three years of mild recession, and the OECD,
in its latest annual assessment, forecasts 1.5 per cent real growth this
year and 2.5 per cent next year. Inflation, which soared to 6.6 per cent in
mid-1991, has dropped below 1 per cent, and seems likely to remain low.
'With employment picking up and consumer confidence progressively reviving
in the course of 1994, household consumption should gather strength.
Machinery and equipment investment is likely to continue its recent upswing,
reflecting ongoing efforts of enterprises to modernise productive capacity,
as well as reduced credit costs and lower prices of imported investment
goods,' the OECD forecasts.
'But the favourable outlook should not give rise to complacency,' the OECD
warns. It predicts that a further round of public spending cuts and tax
increases will be needed to eliminate a relatively high budget deficit.
It also says that business investment decisions could be affected by
uncertainty over Switzerland's participation in the process of European
integration. The Swiss voted against joining the European Economic Area in
1992, and the federal government has yet to clarify how it will now pursue
its goal of joining the European Union. The OECD says 'stepped up' efforts
should be made to liberalise many economic sectors and align standards with
those of the EU.
It has also renewed its complaints, first made in its November 1992 report,
about how the Swiss National Bank monitors monetary growth. It says that the
country will fall well below the bank's target of an average 1 per cent
annual growth in the seasonally adjusted monetary base over the three year
period to 1994. The OECD observes that the bank's policy stance 'still
appears relatively restrictive', but it then falls into line with the
central bank's cautious view that the scope for further easing is limited,
given the speed of economic recovery.
Meanwhile, the Swiss Federal Office for Economic Issues said yesterday that
economic recovery continued in the second quarter with a 2.4 per cent rise
in the annualised seasonally adjusted growth rate of gross domestic product
compared with a robust 3.2 per cent in the first quarter. It said all main
components of GDP rose, with the exception of exports, which were 4.6 per
cent lower, compared with the first quarter. Exporters have been complaining
recently that the strong Swiss franc is hurting their competitiveness.
The country's unemployment rate fell to 4.5 per cent in August compared with
4.6 per cent in July. and 4.7 per cent in August 1993.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Balladur details plans for tighter defence network:
Solidarity seen with eastern states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French prime minister Edouard Balladur yesterday issued detailed proposals
for improved defence co-operation among members of the European Union, which
he also suggested should negotiate a common security doctrine with
forthcoming EU members in central Europe.
In a speech to France's Institute of Higher Defence Studies, the prime
minister said a white paper on European defence could be prepared for a
future EU summit to which leaders of central European states could be
invited. Such a white paper would be 'a first manifestation of the new
solidarity' between the EU and its eastern neighbours.
But he said existing EU states should, in any case, push on with reinforcing
co-operation within the Western European Union organisation, particularly in
planning joint operations and in developing 'a true European system' of
space-based spy satellites.
As the European state with the strongest ambition in the defence field,
France is now at the centre of a web of arrangements with different WEU
partners.
Mr Balladur cited France's joint Eurocorps with Germany, Belgium, Spain and
Luxembourg, its 'rapid reaction force' project with Italy and Spain, and its
'more embryonic' discussions with Britain on joint air force planning. But,
echoing the wider debate over EU integration, he suggested the time might
come for a WEU summit to consolidate the organisation as 'the central core'
of European defence.
In the shorter term, he called on the WEU to use its new planning cell in
Brussels to prepare for joint military-humanitarian operations more
effectively than it had done in the case of Rwanda. He also called for a
European observation satellite system, similar to the satellite photo
interpretation system the WEU had set up in Spain. France is already working
on the Helios optic and infra-red satellites with Spain and Italy, but Mr
Balladur said he was 'counting a lot' on getting German financial support.
France by itself could not maintain military technology and hardware across
the board, he told his military officers, and therefore greater
collaboration with other Europeans was essential.
There is anxiety in the French government about the UK government's imminent
choice between joining the project for a new European military transport
aircraft or sticking with Lockheed of the US to fulfil its military
transport needs.
On the problem of stemming the spread of nuclear weapons, Mr Balladur said
the United Nations Security Council should be given a more permanent and
active role in checking nuclear proliferation. He said that giving the
United Nations this role had worked well in Iraq and that North Korea showed
the need for repeated vigilance.
'We believe the Security Council should have at its direct disposal
intelligence assets and expertise concerning such weapons.' Until Europe
acquired such assets, however, they would have to come from the US.
France appears on the verge of clinching a long-awaited sale of eight fast
patrol boats to Kuwait for Dollars 280m-Dollars 470m, its first big defence
sale to the emirate since the Gulf war. It is also discussing sales of
missiles and radar.

FT  09 SEP 94 / OECD critical of Swiss construction cartels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Switzerland has the highest rate of spending on construction of all the
industrialised countries, at Dollars 4,500 per head in 1990. And, according
to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, this bloated
Dollars 30bn annual construction bill is not just attributable to the quaint
Swiss tendency to build everything for eternity.
A fair part of it derives from a formidable range of anti-competitive
practices that prevail throughout the country - mainly cartels and the use
of industry standards and arcane qualifications to restrict entry.
In Geneva, for example, a contractor has to have already built a bridge in
the canton to qualify to tender on any new bridge project.
In a special study of Switzerland's construction sector, the OECD also says
that excessively strict zoning regulations and tenant protection laws help
boost housing prices beyond the ability of ordinary people to pay.
Switzerland has the lowest level of home ownership among leading OECD
countries, at 31.3 per cent in 1990. High construction costs also constitute
a significant drag on the whole economy because of the industry's unusually
large size and links to other sectors. It accounts for 16.8 per cent of
gross domestic product and two-thirds of total fixed investment.
The OECD acknowledges the Swiss authorities' concern with preserving the
natural beauty of the countryside, but argues 'there would seem to be ample
scope' for lowering housing costs without compromising this objective.
Swiss construction prices are about 40 per cent above the OECD average on a
purchasing power parity basis, a figure consistent with prices in other
sectors.
A recent study found that the construction cost of a representative
apartment building was 29 per cent higher in Switzerland than in Germany.
About 60 per cent of the difference was attributable to more demanding
construction standards, with much of the remainder due to higher architects'
fees and taxes. Swiss builders also face additional requirements to build
air-raid shelters and parking spaces.
Wage rates tend to be only slightly below those prevailing in other sectors,
even though productivity is considerably worse. Foreign competition is
virtually absent from the Swiss construction market, partly because of a
law, the so-called Lex Friedrich, restricting foreigners from owning
property.
Cantonal governments, which buy a third of the industry's output, also
restrict competition. Many governments impose restrictive qualifying
conditions, such as membership in local organisations or local domicile.
'Other devices include the automatic exclusion of the best offer or, indeed,
of all offers below professional associations' reference prices and the
abusive use of government charges,' the OECD says. According to a recent
study, these policies add at least 3.7 per cent to the cost of public
purchases.
'Cartel agreements among construction companies also boost the cost of
public works. These agreements aim at dividing the work among a number of
enterprises and fixing in advance the prices submitted to the authorities,'
the OECD says.
Moreover, cartels are endemic in building materials industries, especially
kitchen fittings, cables, bricks wallpaper and cement. 'The bathroom and
kitchen fittings industries have been able to influence prices because they
have fixed technical standards which severely restrict imports - so much so
that the major supplier of bathroom fittings has nearly 90 per cent of the
market.'
The cost of land for construction is inflated by zoning laws which prohibit
the construction in agricultural zones of any structure not related to
traditional agricultural use. In permitted zones, hoarding is common.
The OECD observes that Swiss governments are taking steps to resolve all of
these shortcomings - strengthening cartel laws, revising the Lex Friedrich,
reviewing zoning and rental control laws and promoting home ownership
through allowing people to use part of their pension fund equity for home
purchases. But it argues: 'Priority should be given to eliminating
structural features which needlessly lift housing costs and restrict
supply.'

FT  09 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Enterprise bought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Relief that there were no unpleasant surprises in Enterprise Oil's interim
results, and a growing feeling that the stock had been oversold since the
unsuccessful bid for Lasmo, triggered a burst of strength in Enterprise
shares.
The stock price forged ahead 13 to 400p, the best performance in the FT-SE
100 Index, after keen turnover of 3.6m shares. Smith New Court was said to
have been an aggressive buyer, with Mr Chris Grudniewicz, oil specialist at
Smith, saying 'the shares are cheap under 400p'.
Mr Grudniewicz said the shares had underperformed the market by 10 per cent
over the past month and 'all the bad news is already in the price'. He
cautioned that the market remained concerned on two issues - corporate
governance and the failed bid for Lasmo. Enterprise retains a near 10 per
cent stake in Lasmo; the latter rose 2 1/2 to 159p.
British Gas was one of the few FT-SE 100 stocks to remain in positive
territory throughout a difficult trading session, the shares being lifted by
news that the group was maintaining its interim dividend. They closed 3
higher at 298p on turnover of 11m shares.
'There was relief about the dividend and the underlying earnings figures
were better than expected,' noted one analyst. He said the company is to
hold a presentation to analysts on September 29 to outline its broad
strategy.
Comments to analysts from Glaxo that it had no immediate expansion plans in
the US refocused attention on the UK takeover targets Wellcome and Zeneca.
Wellcome, also feeling the effects of a good reception to its new
anti-migraine treatment, gained 13 at 696p.
Zeneca, which announced that it had set up the potential to borrow up to
Dollars 750m in the US, moved ahead 16 to 838p. However, turnover was not
excessive and the rise was exacerbated by a shortage of stock in the market.
Fisons, another perennial target, put on 1 1/2 at 154p.
Cable and Wireless dropped 9 to 430p on very heavy turnover of 9m shares
following talk in the market that Cazenove, C&amp;W's own stockbroker, had
downgraded its earnings estimates for the group. Cazenove has a policy of
not commenting on client business. C&amp;W announced that it was cutting prices
on its business tariff for its One-to-One mobile phone service.
The latest price war in cellular phones also impacted on BT, which eased 1
1/2 to 394 1/2 p, and Vodafone, 3 cheaper at 202 1/2 p.
Hanson was a beneficiary of BTR's bad news, with one leading broker
recommending a switch into Hanson, whose shares closed only 2 easier at 248p
after heavy turnover of 9m following massive dividend washing in the US on
Wednesday night.
Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks group, dipped on
concern over future sales growth and competition from own brand drinks. The
shares lost 4 at 468p in spite of 10 per cent underlying profits growth and
12 per cent margins - above the average for the sector.
Supporter Mr Carl Short of SGST said the market had taken a 'churlish view
of a strong performance' and upgraded his full-year forecast by Pounds 10m
to Pounds 483m.
Property group MEPC dropped 12 to 432p following negative comment. Agency
broker James Capel shaved sector forecasts yesterday, including MEPC's, and
Smith New Court cut profits estimates on Wednesday.
Paper company Arjo Wiggins Appleton put on 8 at 287p after better than
expected half-year results and a confident statement. Arjo announced profits
of Pounds 105.1m, against Pounds 63m previously and market forecasts of
Pounds 78m to Pounds 87m.
David S. Smith moved forward 12 to 560p after a very confident presentation
at its annual meeting.
Publishing group Emap eased 2 to 416p after announcing a one-for-eight
rights issue at 360p a share to raise Pounds 77m to halve its debt and ready
itself for acquisition opportunities.
Manweb outpaced the other regional electricity stocks, the shares closing 4
higher at 866p after the group said it had bought in a further 1.5m shares
at 870p.

FT  09 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leading pharmaceuticals group in the UK, Glaxo Holdings, put on a
volatile performance as it disappointed many in the market with its
full-year figures but managed to hold on to its fans.
The shares were down almost 20p after the company revealed profits of Pounds
1.84bn, against expectations of around Pounds 1.9bn, and a loss of Pounds
115m through bond holdings - analysts had expected a hit of about Pounds
95m.
The subsequent statement was described by one dealer as 'dull, listless and
bland' and did not provide a floor to the share price.
Detractors, such as Goldman Sachs, failed to discover much joy in the
figures and retained their negative stances. However, supporters Hoare
Govett and Smith New Court remained bullish. Hoare's Mr Nigel Barnes said:
'It was a solid set of figures and Zantac (Glaxo's headline anti-ulcer
treatment) appears to be holding up very well against generic Tagamet in the
US.' The shares ended 7 off at 609p.

FT  09 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: BTR falls on shock figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Acutely disappointing interim results and worrying signals of growing
pressure on profit margins and increases in raw materials prices combined to
demolish the BTR share price yesterday, taking the rest of the market with
it.
BTR shares registered their worst ever one-day performance, plunging 44, or
11.5 per cent, to 338p, their lowest level since December 1993. The dismal
figures had a greater impact on the company's warrants where, for example,
the 1993/94 issue almost halved, closing 42 off at 45p.
More worrying for the market was the strength of the selling pressure that
drove the shares down; turnover in BTR reached 47m shares, the second
highest single day's business on record.
Analysts expressed deep dismay. 'The investment community is so
disillusioned with their expectations and the actual figures that it will
take many months and a set of figures up to expectations to restore
confidence in the stock,' said one observer.
Profits forecasts were chopped after the figures and an acrimonious
post-results meeting with analysts. 'The shares are down 12 per cent and
most forecasts are being reduced by around 9 per cent, which is just about
right,' said another conglomerates specialist. The range is now said to be
from Pounds 1.25bn to Pounds 1.335bn for the current year.

FT  09 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Worries over profit margins hit share
prices - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market suffered a heavy setback yesterday morning after a batch
of company results drew attention to pressures on profit margins among
British companies. Share prices managed a partial rally later when sterling
and British government bonds improved behind an unexpected improvement in
the June trade figures as well as a stronger US dollar.
The FT-SE 100-share Index lost the 3,200 mark at the opening as share prices
were marked down in the face of a heavy list of company trading statements.
The sharpest blow came from BTR, the UK conglomerate which not only turned
in disappointing first-half profits but alarmed the broad range of the
market by disclosing that margins were being pressured by rising raw
material prices and difficulties in passing on these costs to customers.
Within one hour of the official opening, the Footsie was down by nearly 40
points, and BTR stock was severely hit on turnover already exceeding
previous daily volumes for the year. By the end of the day, BTR had lost
nearly 12 per cent. The market was also hurt by unsettling trading reports
from several other blue chips, including Cadbury-Schweppes, Glaxo, Sun
Alliance and British Gas, although the last named pleased investors by
maintaining the dividend payout.
The FT-SE 100 Index bottomed out for the day at 3,166.2 and rallied to close
at 3,180 for a fall on the day of 23.9 points. Market strategists calculated
that the drop in BTR shares was responsible for around 9.7 points of the
day's loss on the Footsie.
BTR's references to pricing difficulties, which hit hard across the
manufacturing stock centres, were echoed in the latest distributive trades
survey from the Confederation of British Industry. Other dull spots included
Glaxo, which spelled out its losses in bond markets. Cadbury Schweppes drew
attention to competitive pressures in its consumer markets.
Traders reported a wave of switching out of the manufacturing stocks, which
are now seen as vulnerable to a squeeze between cost inflation pressures and
customer resistance to high prices. Investors appeared to be moving back
towards the market's 'safe havens', notably the utility sectors which have
shown high dividend promise as well as good growth prospects.
Significant US selling originated in the stock index futures market and
gathered pace following optimistic comments on US inflation policies from
the vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve. Wall Street was 16 Dow points
ahead at the London close.
Although the weight fell on the blue chip sectors, which reacted to a
Footsie stock index future trading at a discount throughout the session,
sellers also appeared among the second line issues. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index
closed 17.3 down at 3,761.8.
Trading volume, boosted by heavy turnover in BTR and Glaxo, increased
yesterday to 668.5m shares, with the contribution from non-Footsie stocks
reduced to around 53 per cent. On Wednesday, retail business was worth
Pounds 1.38bn, continuing the pattern on this week's stock market activity
which has seen share trading volumes remaining high as the Footsie has lost
ground.
At last night's closing reading, the stock market had fallen by nearly 2 per
cent over the past three trading sessions. Nervousness over upward pressures
on domestic interest rates, which focused on this week's policy meeting
between the UK chancellor of the exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of
England, remained in place yesterday in spite of the unexpected dip in the
UK June trade deficit. This had little direct effect on equities, which made
no response until stering improved towards the close of the trading session.

FT  09 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures suffered the brunt of a wave of US selling in London
yesterday as worries over profit margins at UK companies was matched by
optimistic comments on Federal Reserve inflation policies. The Footsie
September future traded at a discount to the cash market for most of the day
and trading volumes were high, at more than 21,000 lots in the December
contract by the end of the day.
Early deals saw September edge higher to 3,207, but this picture quickly
changed as BTR's trading statement upset the market. The contract was sold
down to 3,157 at the day's worst.
The contract then steadied to trade around the 3,175 area, closing the
official trading day at 3,177, which was a discount of 3 points to cash
compared with a fair value premium worth around 3 points. Switching into the
December contract continued, with the September/December premium at around
13 points.
Traded options saw increased turnover of 53,666 contracts, with the FT-SE
100 option recording 26,721. The Euro FT-SE option was also busy, while
individual stock options were headed by BTR, which traded 4,733 lots.
British Gas, which also announced trading results yesterday, had 4,967
contracts dealt in an active session, and Hanson (1,903) and Glaxo (1,080)
were also busy.

Brazil
Sao Paulo closed 5.68 per cent higher, propelled by rumours that a new
opinion poll expected later that day would show Mr Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, the ruling party candidate, maintaining his lead in the
presidential race.
The Bovespa index of the 55 most active shares added 2,834 at 52,721 and
turnover totalled RDollars 355.3m (Dollars 404.2m).
Brokers reported only slow foreign activity, saying that most deals were
concentrated in day-trade operations by domestic investors. Foreigners, they
added, were staying on the sidelines, waiting for new presidential election
developments.
Mexico
Shares continued the rally that began late on Tuesday, after the two weeks
of declines which had followed the elections on August 21. The IPC index
finished 23.24, or 0.85 per cent, up at 2,762.16. At the end of 1993 the IPC
stood at 2,602.63.
Traders said local investors warmed to the upward movement of Mexican blue
chips on Wall Street.

FT  09 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Strength in 3M sets tone for
upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US equity investors went bargain hunting yesterday, lifting share prices
across the board after a string of soft sessions, writes Frank McGurty in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 22.21 ahead at 3,908.46, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.18 at 473.14. On the Big Board, advances led
declines by 1,315 to 806 after volume of 296m shares.
The American SE composite edged up 0.19 to 455.51, while the Nasdaq
composite again outperformed the rest of the indices, climbing 5.02 to
769.30.
The day's second-tier economic news was virtually ignored. The focus was
still set squarely on today's report on August producer prices.
The market awaited the report with a mixture of resignation and quiet
confidence. On one hand, most investors expected to be handed clear evidence
of accelerating inflation. Analysts were forecasting an increase of about
0.5 per cent in producer prices, or about 0.3 per cent excluding the
volatile food and energy sectors.
But there was also a consensus that the data would not prompt the Federal
Reserve to bring forward its next monetary tightening, even if it came in
stronger than expected. After losing ground in four of the last five
sessions, the market appeared to have already factored some bad inflation
news into stock valuations.
As a consequence, the stage was set yesterday morning for investors to bid
up stock prices in response to a firming trend in bonds and improvement by
the dollar in the foreign exchange markets.
Later in the day, bonds wavered but the bellwether Dow industrials remained
well above the 3,900 level.
Among the blue chips, 3M set the pace with a rise of Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 56 3/8 . The stock, which had receded over the past fortnight,
forged ahead after the company predicted that its earnings per share would
improve by 10 per cent annually over the next three years.
In retailing, Sears Roebuck moved forward Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 48 5/8 ,
while Kmart added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 18 in a muted reaction to the
company's decision to close 110 stores and cut its management ranks by 10
per cent.
The rally in technology stocks - the biggest surprise of a rather
predictable week - stretched into a second session. Texas Instruments, up
Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 77 1/8 , led the semiconductor sector, while
Compaq, Dollars 1 stronger at Dollars 36 5/8 , was to the fore in computer
makers.
On the Nasdaq, Microsoft put on Dollars 1 at Dollars 57 7/8 and Atmel rose
Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 28 3/4.
Canada
Toronto rallied as investors were heartened by the results of an opinion
poll showing the ruling Liberals ahead of the Parti Quebecois for the first
time in the Quebec election campaign. The provincial election takes place on
Monday.
The TSE 300 index ended 15.31 points firmer at 4,354.38 and rises outscored
falls by 396 to 340 after volume of 67.5m shares valued at CDollars 798.3m.
Nine of the 14 sub-indices were higher, led by mining, consumer products,
financial services and forestry products. The golds index, after recent
strength, slipped 0.52 per cent.

FT  09 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Transnational combines star as
Paris gains 1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong recovery in bond markets, flirting with the idea that the
Bundesbank may have another interest rate cut up its sleeve, took equities
up with it, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS mixed its bond market impetus with a mostly positive bag of company
news, and the CAC-40 index responded with a rise of 19.20 to 1,983.40 in
turnover of FFr3.1bn.
One French/UK combine, the Carnaudmetalbox packaging group, provided the
star turn of the day, rising FFr12.30, or 7.5 per cent, to FFr176.40
following news of better than expected first-half profits. Another, Arjo
Wiggins, did well in the London market for similar reasons; in Paris this
lifted Saint-Louis, which owns 39 per cent of Arjo, by FFr44 to FFr1,580.
Carrefour rose FFr35 to FFr2,131 on strong first-half results and the
retailer's forecast that it could match last year's profits growth.
Company chairmen came to the fore. Among the water companies, Lyonnaise des
Eaux's Mr Jerome Monod told a business conference that his company's 1994
net attributable profit would be 'clearly higher' than that of 1993, and saw
its shares up FFr13 to FFr528 after a period of relative weakness.
Weak spots included Peugeot, down FFr9 at FFr835 as Mr Jaques Calvet said
that he was merely less pessimistic about 1994. Meanwhile, Schneider, the
electricals group whose Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne was jailed for 11 days
in Belgium some three months ago, dropped 5 per cent at one point on news
that a Belgian judge has issued an international arrest warrant for its
chairman, before recovering to close FFr7.70 down at FFr399.50.
FRANKFURT reflected gains in the December bund future, with the Dax index a
modest 8.55 higher at 2,172.37, improving to an Ibis-indicated 2,178.10 at
the end of the post bourse.
Turnover eased from DM5.4bn to DM5.3bn. Financials and, to a lesser extent,
carmakers responded most consistently to the improved bond market
atmosphere.
Deutsche Bank rose DM7.80 to DM722.80 on the session, and another DM7 to
DM729.80 after hours. At Merrill Lynch, Mr Ian McEwen said Deutsche had been
relatively strong against the sector for the past two weeks, but that this
had followed relative weakness against the sector and the market for upwards
of a year.
Underperformers included Metallgesellschaft, down DM1 at DM183 on the
downgrading of some of its debt ratings. However, the hope of a break even
1994 for engineering concern KHD took the latter up DM6.30 to DM128.80.
MILAN saw a technical rebound as some buyers returned after five consecutive
days of losses which had taken the market 4.7 per cent lower. The Comit
index finished 6.77 higher at 665.16, although the mood remained constrained
by an absence of news about government action on the budget.
BCI rose L125, or 3.5 per cent, to L3,685 as its L2,400bn rights issue
continued to heighten volatility.
The insurers also put in a strong performance in the wake of Wednesday's
remarks by Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, who said that funds set
aside for severance pay should be channelled into private pension funds.
Generali rose L550 to L41,350, Ras picked up L450 to L24,150, and Ina added
L65 at L2,250.
Foreign interest helped the telecommunications stocks to rally, with Telecom
Italia up L70 to L4,440 and Stet finishing L85 ahead at L4,835.
Volatility in Benetton continued with the stock losing another L450 to
L22,100.
ZURICH finished little changed in thin trading after a firm opening
encouraged some investors to take profits during the session. The SMI index
edged up 1.6 to 2,664.1.
Ascom, the telecommunications group, rose SFr80, or 5.3 per cent, to
SFr1,590 after news that the company had swung back to a first-half pre-tax
net profit after last year's loss.
Saurer, the textile machinery maker, was SFr20, or 4.3 per cent, lower at
SFr450 after announcing that first-half net profits plunged by 75 per cent.
Georg Fischer, the foundries and engineering group, climbed SFr50 to
SFr1,700 as investors continued to react to the company's positive earnings
forecast for this year.
MADRID, closed today for a public holiday, galloped ahead in late trading on
strong gains in the bond market and its banking and utility sector
beneficiaries.
The general index rose 6.91, or 2.3 per cent, to 305.18, with a raft of
major gains among the banks from BBV, up Pta95 or just over 3 per cent to
Pta3,095, to Santander, Pta265 or 5.3 per cent better at Pta9,260. Endesa
led utilities with a gain of Pta180 to Pta5,530, but dealers said the market
would have looked more healthy if it had shown less volatility on the
downside, prior to yesterday's recovery.
AMSTERDAM saw some late foreign demand which helped the AEX index to end
0.67 higher at 415.84.
Fortis Amev, the Dutch-Belgian insurer, fell Fl 1.70 to Fl 73.00 after
first-half results failed to match expectations.
Some late US demand took Unilever Fl 2.20 forward to Fl 203.00 and VNU up Fl
2.50 to Fl 192.00.
DSM, the chemicals group, put on Fl 2.90 at Fl 146 in further response to
Wednesday's news that it planned a new polypropylene plant.
HELSINKI was virtually flat, the Hex index losing only 1.8 at 1,942.6, but
the forestry sector fell 2.2 per cent on profit-taking on Kymmene's news
that it may decide on a rights issue in November. Kymmene fell FM7, 4.8 per
cent, to FM138.
ISTANBUL was rescued from a deep downtrend as the main Turkish parties
agreed on a new privatisation bill. The composite index closed just 147.69
down at 24,200.29 after a fall of 7.4 per cent to a low of 147.69 at one
stage of the day.
TEL AVIV came back refreshed after two day's holiday for the Jewish new
year, and the Mishtanim index rose 6.29, or 3.3 per cent, to 198.48.
WARSAW rebounded strongly after five sessions of heavy losses as investors,
encouraged by bargain hunting on Wednesday, stepped up buying to cash in on
an expected rally next week. The Wig index rose 753.3, or 8.1 per cent, to
10,027.7 but turnover fell 39 per cent to 624bn zlotys.

FT  09 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei retreats as Seoul
rises 1.9% to five-year high

Share prices declined on selling by arbitrageurs and overseas investors, and
the Nikkei 225 average fell below the 20,000 level for the first time in
four months, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index closed 106.02 off at the day's low of 19,917.78, ending below
20,000 for the first time since May 10. It peaked in the afternoon at
20,108.42 on buying by public pension and insurance funds, but weak investor
confidence, triggered by over-supply ahead of next month's Japan Tobacco
listing, depressed shares later.
Arbitrageurs adjusted positions ahead of today's settlement of futures and
options contracts for September, while overseas investors were also selling
around the 20,000 mark.
However, in spite of previous speculation, the telecommunications sector
held firm. Japan Telecom, which dragged the wider market lower on Wednesday,
rallied along with other telecom stocks.
Volume totalled 304m shares, against 312m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks slipped 3.75 to 1,582.31 and the Nikkei 300 eased 1.06 to
288.09. Losers led gainers by 526 to 441, with 228 issues unchanged. But in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 4.20 to 1,288.85.
Japan Telecom, on the second section, finished Y30,000 better at Y4.46m. The
stock's rebound boosted other telecom shares, with DDI firming Y9,000 to
Y912,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Y3,000 to Y886,000. East Japan
Railway, a leading shareholder of JT, rose Y2,000 to Y507,000.
Nitsuko, a telephone equipment manufacturer, attracted speculative buying in
the morning session but later retreated on profit-taking, closing Y10 down
at Y1,470.
High-technology shares were sold by foreigners. Sony declined Y50 to Y5,800
and Matsushita Electric Industrial dipped Y50 to Y1,650.
Brokers were lower on active selling, with Nomura Securities off Y30 at
Y2,120 and Nikko Securities slipping Y20 to Y1,120. Some banks firmed after
falling heavily on arbitrage selling on Wednesday. Industrial Bank of Japan
picked up Y20 to Y2,830 and Sakura Bank Y10 to Y1,360.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 84.10 to 22,215.52 in volume of 97.5m
shares.
Roundup
The region was mixed, with strong performances in some markets.
SEOUL climbed 1.9 per cent to a five-year high in active trading as gains by
blue chips and large-capitalisation issues far outweighed steady sales of
shares with sluggish earnings prospects.
The composite index closed 18.76 ahead at 991.44 in heavy turnover of 39.5m
shares.
Samsung Electronics and Posco were the day's limit up, rising Won3,000 and
Won2,500 respectively to Won139,000 and Won89,600.
BOMBAY saw heavy buying by financial institutions on the final day of the
account which took the BSE 30-share index ahead 25.99 to 4,556.32.
Associated Cement advanced Rs70 to a year's high of Rs5,020 ahead of its
rights issue, details of which are to be given tomorrow.
KUALA LUMPUR rose to its best level for eight months in response to the
government's decision to lift the seven-month ban on government contracts
for British business.
The composite index added 18.02, or 1.6 per cent, at 1,181.17 as the market
shrugged off rumours about another rise in the statutory reserve requirement
of banks, which dragged share prices into negative territory from earlier
gains on Wednesday.
Telekom Malaysia, which shed 80 cents the previous day, recouped 70 cents at
MDollars 22.30.
MANILA lost 1.7 per cent as blue chips were led down by PLDT, which fell
sharply on Wall Street overnight.
The composite index finished 52.69 lower at 2,987.63 and PLDT dropped 3.9
per cent to 1,590 pesos. PNB lost 10 pesos at 437.50 pesos and Meralco 'B',
which is open to foreign investors, also receded 10 pesos to 367.50 pesos.
Petron, which made a strong debut on Wednesday, defied the slide and closed
slightly higher at 22 pesos.
HONG KONG finished slightly lower after selective buying trimmed most early
losses, and the Hang Seng index was off a net 14.89 at 10,150.98. The
weakness was attributed to a lack of participation from major overseas
institutions which had led recent rallies.
Conversely, H shares of locally listed mainland Chinese companies surged on
buying by overseas funds, particularly in Japan, and the Hang Seng H-share
index soared 66.12, or 4.6 per cent, to 1,516.61.
Among the blue chip losers, Hong Kong Telecom gave up 35 cents to HKDollars
16.25, while Wharf Holdings dipped 30 cents to HKDollars 34.50. But Sun Hung
Kai Properties, expected to post strong results next month, surged HKDollars
1.75 to HKDollars 60.50.
SINGAPORE experienced further weakness in index-linked stocks as investors
continued to focus on Malaysian shares traded over the counter, and the
Straits Times Industrial index fell 22.78 to 2,304.23.
Golden Plus put on 75 cents at SDollars 8.10 on talk of a Malaysian
construction deal. Dunlop Estate gained 60 cents on expectations that it
would participate in Sarawak's large dam project in Bakun through its
acquisition of Sarawak Electricity Supply.
SYDNEY's mood was soured by a late sell-off in BTR Nylex, the industrial
group, after results. The All Ordinaries index retreated 15.2 to 2,089.1 as
BTR fell 30 cents to ADollars 2.08.
WELLINGTON edged lower in the face of a weak bond market and domestic
political worries. The NZSE 40 Capital index gave up 4.27 at 2,159.48.
Continuing strong demand took Fletcher Challenge 9 cents higher to NZDollars
4.37, but Brierley Investments eased 2 cents to NZDollars 1.33 in spite of
record annual profits.

Heavy profit-taking wiped part of the gloss off gold shares as cautious
investors cashed in some recent sharp gains, in spite of the stronger price
of bullion. Golds lost 58, or 2.3 per cent, at 2,476 in what dealers said
was heavier than expected trade as investors sold into bullion's morning
strength above Dollars 391 an ounce.
Industrials ended well down as weaker overseas bourses put pressure on
sentiment amid a lack of fresh impetus in a highly-priced market. The
industrials index shed 39 to 6,639 and the overall index receded 46 to
6,007.
Running contrary to the rest of the market, the steel sector continued to
gain ground on improved market prospects. Iscor finished 4 cents stronger at
R4.89 after hitting a record R5 earlier in the session.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Sterling futures recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Short sterling futures rose sharply yesterday when the Bank of England left
short- term interest rates unchanged, writes Philip Gawith.
As soon as the Bank confirmed in its morning operations that rates were on
hold, prices rallied sharply. There had been fears, following the monthly
monetary meeting on Wednesday, that UK monetary policy might be tightened.
The Bank's stance was backed up by the release of the CBI's August
distributive trades survey, which suggested a possible fall in the rate of
GDP growth, and a further drop in inflation.
The December short sterling contract finished 18 basis points up at 93.73 on
fairly heavy volume - nearly 66,000 lots were traded. Sterling had a steady
day, helped by the firmer dollar, with the trade weighted index closing at
78.8 from 78.6. Sterling three-month LIBOR eased to 5 13/32 per cent from 5
15/32 per cent.
The dollar rose nearly a pfennig, helped by favourable comments from a
variety of US and German officials, to finish in London at DM1.5562 from
DM1.5486. It was also firmer against the yen, ending at Y99.4 from Y98.965.
New York trading closed with the dollar at DM1.5565 and Y99.60.
The firmer dollar caused the D-Mark to weaken against most European
currencies. It finished at L1,016 against the Italian lira, from L1,019. The
Swedish krona rose to SKr4.906 from SKr4.923.
Analysts said short sterling had been the beneficiary of a massive short
covering rally, with numerous stop-loss orders triggered, once the Bank had
shown its hand.
The longer end of the yield curve benefited from the distributive trades
survey. Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Greenwell Montagu, commented: 'This
survey should effectively put the kibosh on speculation of an imminent rate
hike.'
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg, said the general weakness
across all aspects of the survey pointed to a fall in the rate of GDP
growth, with underlying retail price inflation also likely to fall over the
next quarter. 'A rate rise against this background would be extraordinary,'
he added.
At the shorter end, Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at broker GNI, said there
had been a 'very positive reaction to the Bank's non-action'. He said the
market had seen very good buying, and was awash with rumours of large
stop-loss orders being triggered if prices continued to rise.
The pound was helped by a good trade figure which, analysts said, showed
there was less chance of a sterling crisis, and less need for the government
to raise interest rates in fear of one.
The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 1.2bn shortage in UK money markets, at
established rates, in its morning rounds.
UK and continental European interest rate markets benefited from a string of
bullish comments from senior Bundesbank officials.
Bundesbank board member Mr Otmar Issing said in an interview that German
inflation and M3 growth could be expected to continue their fall, while Mr
Hans-Juergen Krupp said he could not understand why the dollar was so weak.
A Bundesbank spokesman also confirmed that Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank
president, had not said in a speech that German short-term rates could not
fall further. He had simply suggested that a decline could not be expected
in the next few weeks.
This prospect of lower rates was endorsed by Mr Julian Jessop, international
economist at Midland Global Markets. In a research paper published today, he
suggests that the discount rate is likely to be cut at least one more time.
Cautioning against reading too much into these pronouncements was Mr Michael
Gallagher, director of IDEA, the financial markets consultancy: 'These
statements should be seen as an attempt by the Bundesbank to keep the market
guessing on interest rate policy rather than a formal statement of intent.'
He said the real issue was not whether economic conditions would allow
another cut - inflation and money supply figures favour one - but whether it
was needed.
With current data suggesting the recovery was not stalling, he said a
further cut was 'probably unnecessary', concluding that 'we see fading
prospects for such a cut'.
The US currency was helped by the Bundesbank comments, and a senior Clinton
official saying the administration favoured a stronger dollar. The market
largely ignored a string of comments about US-Japan trade talks. Mr Ian
Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan, said the market had
decided to test the upside of the current trading range after failing to
break lower earlier this week.
The release today of the August PPI figures should give the market new
direction, as it will provide some sense of how the Fed is doing in the
battle against inflation.
Mr Dave Munro, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics in New York,
downplayed the PPI, saying: 'Any big market impact will have only a
30-minute half-life.'

FT  09 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fine Merino wool sold at prices rising 30 to 40 Australian cents a kg. each
day auctions were held this week. This sector is favoured by fashion and
very little stock remains in Australia to supplement new production.
Recovery in most wool consuming countries is placing pressure on available
supply for this and other high fashion and highly priced natural fibres and
prices can already be two to three times their lowest point in the recession
which can now be seen to have ended twelve to eighteen months ago. Other
wools are selling at rising prices with this week's rise a particularly
strong one. Other wools are selling at rising prices, with this week's rise
a particularly strong one. The Australian market indicator (Eastern states)
finished at 780cents a kg., from 728 a week ago. British wool also sold at
prices 5% higher than at the previous sale.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Germany seeks modification of
EU agricultural policy reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German government is pushing for changes to the Common Agricultural
Policy reforms to make them more acceptable to farmers and reduce
administrative costs.
A German memorandum, circulated to other EU member states, insists the
proposed changes do not question 'the principles and aims' of the 1992
reforms.
But it says experience of the first full year of the reforms shows many
rules need to be simplified. It argues that the reforms do not take enough
account of the principle of subsidiarity - that decisions should be made at
the lowest appropriate tier of government.
Among the proposed measures, it says cereal farmers with plots in different
regions should be able to set aside 15 per cent of their arable land in one
area rather than having to do so on each plot.
Many farmers in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate have had compensation
payments cut because they did not obey the set-aside rule on small areas of
land, which 'makes them impossibley difficult to farm.'
The memorandum calls on the Commission to allow cereal farmers to submit
applications for aid up to the middle of May rather than by March 31 each
year to allow them more time to decide what crops to grow.
In the livestock sector, the Germans want removal of the rule limiting
support payments to 90 male beef cattle per holding because it 'makes it
difficult for efficient holdings with growth prospects to accept CAP
reform.'
Germany, which holds the EU presidency, hopes the Commission will adopt some
of its demands as proposals for agriculture ministers to vote on.
Pressure on the Commission may increase if other member states put forward
similar proposals. The British government has responded with its own
memorandum, which renews its call for arable land to be eligible for
set-aside payments if it is taken out of production for woodland or other
environmental schemes.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Grenada nutmeg oil output
starts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Grenada, the world's second largest producer of nutmeg, has started
producing nutmeg oil in the hope of supplying about one-tenth of world
demand for the product.
The oil plant has a rated capacity of 30 tonnes per year, and production
will be marketed mainly in North America, Europe, Russia and Japan.
The oil extraction plant will use about 300 tonnes of defective nutmeg per
year. Previously the industry has been destroying defective nuts, and
disposed of 400 tonnes last year.
It will ease the financial concerns of the industry on the eastern Caribbean
island, second to Indonesia as the world's largest producer.
Earlier this year both producers agreed on a plan to stabilise and then to
increase world market prices, but steered clear of recreating their cartel
which collapsed six years ago.
Grenadian farmers have been suffering from a fall in price in the
international nutmeg market.

FT  09 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fair deal for Peruvian growers
 -Deborah Hargreaves on Cafedirect's buying in the Chiclayo region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Luzmila Loayza visits 4,300 small coffee farmers in northern Peru several
times a year - some of them she can reach only by donkey.
As a coffee buyer for Cafedirect, the fair trade organisation, she is unlike
many other agents who do not venture further than the coffee processing
plant.
'At the moment some of these farmers are being offered fantastic prices by
some coffee buyers who appear one day and disappear the next and don't
return,' said Ms Loayza.
She stresses the benefits of a stable marketing organisation such as
Cafedirect which pays a 10 per cent premium over world prices in order to
guarantee a fair return to growers.
Since coffee prices have soared on the London and New York commodity
exchanges this year, prices for the Peruvian farmers in the area around the
town of Chiclayo have jumped from the equivalent of USDollars 110 per
quintal last year (a bag containing 200lbs) to between Dollars 340 and
Dollars 380.
When coffee prices reached their low point in 1992, the farmers were
receiving Dollars 10 a bag - not even enough to buy a bag of rice.
Most of the Peruvian farmers are extremely small producers with only 3-4
hectares of land, producing 7-8 bags of coffee a year. They are organised
into nine co-operatives to direct their products towards the export market.
The Peruvian farmers are using windfall profits from recent price increases
to buy land or cattle or invest in improvements to their production methods.
But few are planting new coffee trees - they take at least three years to
bear fruit and market conditions are too uncertain to risk the investment.
The coffee farmers are also eager to diversify into other products for
export to try to avoid the vagaries of the international coffee price. They
are looking to produce honey, black-eye beans, lemon grass and even cocoa.
The coffee price rise has meant farmers are more eager to stay on their
farms rather than migrate to nearby coca fields where the drug is grown
mainly for turning into cocaine.
Cafedirect buys five per cent of the 200,000 bags of coffee produced by the
farmers in the region around Chiclayo who are divided into nine
co-operatives. For the past two years the company has been selling ground
coffee as a 'fair trade' product and this week it launched a range of
instant coffee.
The company hopes to gain a one per cent market share of the Pounds 500m
British instant coffee market and is using the Peruvian farmers in its
advertisements.
'They're amazed at the promotional side of it,' said Mr Loayza.
'They can't understand why people in the west should be interested in
hearing about their farms.'

The mining industry has been startled by an out-of-the-blue revelation that
Ashton Mining of Australia, has discovered a diamond province in Finland. It
also said that 'the prospect for a commercial discovery is considered to be
high.'
While other companies have been scouring Canada's Northwest Territories,
African, Australia and even deep down in the depths of the sea for the gem
stones, Ashton secretly has been prospecting in Finland, a country
best-known for base metals production, for eight years.
Mr John Robinson, chief executive of Ashton, which is one-third owned by the
state-controlled Malaysian Mining Corporation, said his company had found
two fields of kimberlite pipes and a number of isolated kimberlite
occurences - 21 kimberlites in all - and most of them were diamond-bearing.
One pipe of about two hectares in surface area had yielded 26 carats of
diamonds of more than 8mm in size per 100 tonnes from a 23-tonne sample,
with a weighted average of 17 carats per 100 tonnes.
'The results to date confirm that the basic geology in Finland is
prospective for the discovery of an economic diamond deposit and that
Ashton's exploration techniques are effective in glacial terrain,' said Mr
Andrew Button, Ashton's group general manager of exploration and
development.
'New targets in Finland are being generated and testing is continuing in
this exciting location. The exploration areas are close to established
infrastructure and the prospect for a commercial discovery is considered to
be high,' he added.
Independent experts agreed. 'This compares favourably with most of the
discoveries in the Northwest Territories, said Mr Roger Ellis, editor of the
Mining Journal.
Ashton is a 40 per cent joint venturer in the Argyle mine in Western
Australia which is the biggest diamond producer in the world in carat (but
not value) terms.
It is not alone in looking for diamonds in Finland. The annual meeting of
RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, was enlivened this year by the
presence of two members of the Finnish Sami population (the Laplanders) who
complained that the UK-based group was seeking permission to excavate in
parts of Finland where they had reindeer grazing rights.
Mr Bob Wilson, RTZ's chief executive, said this week the group had, indeed,
staked large tracts of land in Finland, mainly because of its potential to
yield diamonds.
Meanwhile, Ashton has accelerated the pace of its activities in Finland and
is building a broader presence in the Nordic/Baltic region, including
Norway, Sweden and Karelia.

The US Environmental Protection Agency overstated the risks of dioxin from

Coffee prices closed the day off their lows but still Dollars 8 a tonne
below the previous close with the November futures contract at the London
Commodity Exchange closing at Dollars 3,920 a tonne. It was a dull session
as the market awaited fresh news of the Brazilian auctions.
Copper failed to hold onto the the Dollars 2,500 a tonne mark with
three-month metal at the London Metal Exchange slipping to Dollars 2,483 a
tonne.
The gloom in the copper market spread over into other metals pushing prices
for nickel and lead lower and dampening the rise in the aluminium market.
Aluminium prices closed slightly higher at Dollars 1,575 a tonne from
Wednesday's close of Dollars 1,568 a tonne. Lead was down to Dollars 612 a
tonne from Dollars 620 a tonne and nickel closed at Dollars 6,370 a tonne.

A group of Brazilian producers have aired proposals for a cocoa withholding
scheme at an International Cocoa Organisation meeting in London but other
producers and consumers said they would not work, Reuter reports.
Mr Joao Carlos Monteiro de Carvalho, director of Brazil's Cocoa Planning
Executive Committee, said that 'industrialists, exporters and producers want
to do this and we are studying it.' He said the plan was being studied by
Brazil's government.
It was being aired informally and in private with other producers and was
not being presented officially by Brazil at the ICCO talks that began today
and last until September 16.
But a producer delegate from another country commented: 'It is a very good
idea on paper but it just won't fly.'

FT  09 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Bunds encouraged by hopes of interest rate
easing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
German government bonds were lifted by official remarks which accompanied
the release of GDP data for the second quarter. The data showed a strong
recovery in the German economy, in line with market expectations, but senior
officials said there were no signs of over-heating.
These comments led to cautious optimism in some quarters that the Bundesbank
would ease official interest rates, or at least the repo rate, at its
regular council meeting next Thursday. These hopes encouraged yields on
10-year bunds to come in to around 7.43 per cent from just over 7.5 per cent
the day before.
However, most analysts remained sceptical about a further cut in German
interest rates. Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg, noted
that yesterday's improved sentiment followed a week in which bund futures
had dropped by two points.
In addition, the safe distribution of the new Treuhand bond issue had
eliminated market worries of an overhang of supply.
'There is no fundamental change to the market . . . there is not really room
for further easing,' said Mr Kokko.
Ms Wendy Niffikeer, senior economist at IBJ International, said signs that
the economy's recovery favoured investment spending over consumer spending,
which was still fragile, could lend support to the view that rates could
fall further. However, there were still doubts on the inflation front.
'The market's rise is a short-term reaction; the trend is still for a
further sell-off,' she said.
Mr Andrew Bevan, the newly-appointed international bond economist at Goldman
Sachs, said the GDP data made it even more likely the Bundesbank would have
to rein in monetary growth early next year. 'It is going to have to take a
fairly tight stance on rates which has not been fully discounted by the
market,' he said.
On Liffe, the December bund future stood 0.51 points higher at 89.67 in the
late afternoon, off the day's high of 89.74.
Gilts hit a more cheerful note, buoyed by the rise in bunds and the release
of the CBI distributive trade survey, which pointed to a slowdown in
consumer spending. This was taken as further evidence that pressure for a
rise in UK interest rates was easing.
Mr Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB, said: 'The survey suggests that the
tax rises are hitting the consumer who is becoming more cautious. With the
housing market so fragile, a rate rise would undermine confidence even
more.'
Mr Simon Briscoe, of SG Warburg, said if the CBI data were indicative of
other economic figures due in coming months, there would be little pressure
for a rate rise. However, Mr Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers said other
parts of the economy were picking up more strongly than the CBI data
suggested.
The yield spread between gilts and bunds narrowed to 130 basis points from
137 on Wednesday. On Liffe, the December long gilt future rose to 100 31/32
in late trading, up  3/4 points on the day.
Italian and Spanish bonds were pulled up by the Europe-wide rise in bond
prices. The yield on the 10-year Italian benchmark bond fell to 12.11 per
cent from 12.26. However, Mr Huw Roberts at NatWest Markets warned that the
market would fall back if the government continued to prevaricate over the
budget deficit.
The Spanish benchmark 10-year bond yield fell to 11.22 per cent from 11.38
per cent.
US Treasury bonds were finishing close to their opening values yesterday
afternoon as traders adjusted their positions ahead of today's inflation
data.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was off 1/32 at
99 5/32 , with the yield rising to 7.565 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 3/32 , to yield 6.181 per cent.
Traders plodded through another sluggish session, with many of them waiting
for the release of August's producer price index before stepping back in to
the market.
Today's report was expected to show an upturn in inflationary pressures.
Analysts were forecasting a 0.5 per cent gain in last month's PPI, and a 0.3
per cent rise when the volatile food and energy sectors were excluded.
However, there was a growing minority in the market which felt such
estimates were excessive, leading some traders to begin covering their bets
that bond prices would decline on the data's release.
Even those who were comfortable with the consensus forecasts did not expect
bonds to tumble on a big jump in producer prices. Most economists thought
the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates again before November,
even if today's inflation reading was strong.
Such confidence allowed bond prices to appreciate amid the morning's light
trading conditions. The market gained an extra push from a moderating trend
in commodity prices and a firmer dollar.

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Spanish bank deals keep French franc
sector alive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French franc sector of the eurobond market saw further activity
yesterday as two Spanish banks followed Abbey National's FFr2bn issue on
Wednesday.
Santander International launched a FFr2bn offering of 10-year bonds, priced
to yield 43 basis points above the underlying French government bond. Joint
lead manager JP Morgan reported strong demand from French institutional
investors and institutions in the UK and Germany.
Argentaria Global Finance brought a smaller offering to the shorter end with
a FFr1.5bn issue of three-year bonds priced to yield 38 basis points over
the underlying French government bond.
The deal met good demand in France from institutional investors, lead
manager Credit Lyonnais said. The proceeds were believed to have been
swapped back into pesetas.
'International demand is returning for French francs, with particularly
attractive spreads against Germany,' said one syndicate manager. 'The market
has dropped quite a bit recently so that it is now at very interesting
levels for investors across the whole of the yield curve.'
Ford Credit Canada brought a CDollars 150m offering of five-year eurobonds
destined for retail investors in Switzerland and the Benelux countries, lead
manager Wood Gundy said.
'With CDollars 1.6bn due for redemption in October, investors are beginning
to look for new products in the Canadian dollar market,' said one syndicate
manager.
The bonds were priced to yield 40 basis points over the underlying
government bond. Syndicate managers reported some unexpected retail demand
from Hong Kong.
Swedish Export Credit launched a Dollars 150m issue of three-year eurobonds,
bought entirely by lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation. SBC said the bonds
were mainly taken up by Swiss retail investors. The spread on the bonds was
believed to be around 17 basis points over Treasuries.
Zeneca, the bioscience group demerged from ICI last year, has filed a shelf
with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an amount of Dollars
750m. It incorporates a medium-term note programme lead-managed by Merrill
Lynch.

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Landesbank in note plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bremer Landesbank, the regional German bank 75 per cent-owned by
Norddeutsche Landesbank, said yesterday it would establish a Dollars 1.5bn
medium-term note programme. The decision follows the granting of an Aa1
rating by Moody's, the credit rating agency, writes John Gapper, Banking
Editor.
It is the latest Landesbank to gain an investment-grade rating. Bremer
operates both as a regional commercial bank in north-west Germany and a
central bank for 17 local savings banks.
Mr Peter Hasskamp, chairman, said it was important to have a recognised
rating, both to diversify its funding base and because of increased interest
from international investors in the German bond market, where it gains most
funding.
The programme, to be launched next month with Morgan Stanley as lead
arranger, will include sales of French debt instruments, and placements with
Japanese investors.

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: HK seeks market in
NYSE-listed Chinese stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Securities regulatory authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing are seeking to
facilitate simultaneous listings in the colony and New York.
The decision comes less than a month after the flotation of Shandong
Huaneng, the first company to acquire a primary listing in New York. A
further four China companies from the 13-strong 1994 batch of Chinese
overseas listings are slated for the US.
Hong Kong regulators are eager to enhance the colony's international
reputation and obtain the extra business generated by offering a secondary
market in New York-listed China companies. Investment bankers and investors
are also behind the move.
Mr Andrew Liu, president and managing director at Morgan Stanley Asia, said:
'In the long run (dual listings) are clearly going to be the trend. There
are just mechanical problems vis-a-vis facilitating such listings, for
example because of the different subscription systems used (in the US and
Hong Kong).
'But the stock exchange has indicated its willingness to us and other firms,
and we are having discussions about the rule changes they might need to
make.'
Issues include who has jurisdiction in a simultaneous US-Hong Kong listing,
prospectus differences and underwriters' role in price stabilisation
following a new listing.
Hong Kong regulators are still undecided on whether a New York-listed China
company would have to build in additional shareholder rights and protections
to bring them in line with H share listings. However, as the bulk of trading
is expected to be concentrated in the colony, the Securities and Futures
Commission (SFC) is likely to insist on this.
Another key area is pricing. The stock exchange is in the process of
finalising its report on pricing mechanisms.

Improved occupancy rates in London for the Mount Charlotte Thistle Hotels
helped Brierley Investments achieve a 58 per cent rise in profits to a
record NZDollars 430m (USDollars 259m) for the year to June 30, Mr Bob
Matthew, chairman, said yesterday.
Provincial hotel performances were also better, leading Brierley Investments
 -which owns 70 per cent of Mount Charlotte - to 'confidently expect
substantial improvements in Mount Charlotte's profitability'.
He said most New Zealand and Australian subsidiaries and associate companies
performed well during the year, with strong profit contributions from Air
New Zealand, Australian Consolidated Investments, textile group LWR
Industries, Sealord Products, Union Shipping and the Skellerup Group.
Subsidiary and associate company profit contributions were up 17 per cent to
NZDollars 318m from NZDollars 273m, and investment company contributions
rose 43 per cent to NZDollars 283m from NZDollars 197m.
Earnings before parent funding costs and overheads were up 23 per cent to
NZDollars 565m.

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: One-off charges drag down
results at Boral
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The acquisition of Sagasco and good results from its core Australian
operations helped Boral, the Australian energy and building products group,
to a 34.7 per cent increase in profits to ADollars 280.9m (USDollars
207.7m), after tax but before abnormal items, in the year to end-June.
Earnings per share, again before abnormal items, were up by 28.6 per cent to
28.3 cents. Sales rose by 10.2 per cent to ADollars 4.65bn.
Large abnormal items severely depressed the bottom-line performance, causing
Boral to post profits after tax and abnormal items of ADollars 121.8m, down
from ADollars 228.9m a year ago.
The net abnormal items charge was ADollars 159.1m, including a ADollars
121.3m profit on the sale of the Azon businesses, a ADollars 108.8m
write-off of goodwill, and a ADollars 140.1m provision for rationalisation
and restructuring costs.
The abnormal charge means that Boral is dipping into its reserves to pay a
dividend of 20 cents a share for the year, with the final being an unchanged
10 cents as promised at the time of the rights issue.

A US bankruptcy court yesterday approved the merger agreement signed last

The Dollars 1.4bn deal to bring Macy's out of bankruptcy, however, still has
some hurdles to overcome. Later this month, a bankruptcy court will rule on
the joint reorganisation plan submitted to the court by Federated and Macy's
last week.
If that plan is approved, the merger is likely to go ahead, creating a
company with revenues of more than Dollars 13bn.

FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Nine Network reports earnings
ahead 25%
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nine Network, the operator of Australia's largest commercial TV network and
44.5 per cent-owned by Mr Kerry Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings, has
reported a 25.5 per cent increase in profits after tax and abnormal items to
ADollars 88.3m (USDollars 64.9m) for the year to end-June, writes Nikki
Tait.
Revenues were up by 5.1 per cent, and operating profit before abnormal items
and tax was 11.5 per cent higher at ADollars 136.1m.
Nine said that its share of TV advertising revenue in the period amounted to
41.2 per cent, and that underlying costs - once allowance was made for the
Winter Olympics - had been static.
The company said that it expected pre-interest operating profits to increase
by about 10 per cent in the current year. However, it warned that profits
after interest and tax would probably not show any growth because of higher
interest costs incurred to fund increased investments outside its main TV
business.
Nine holds much of the Packer stake in John Fairfax, the newspaper
publisher; 18.08 per cent of Village Roadshow; and a 29.5 per cent interest
in New Regency, the US film production company.
