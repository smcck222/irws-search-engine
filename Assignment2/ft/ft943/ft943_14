FT  08 SEP 94 / Taiwan accepts invitation to Asian Games in defiance of
China: Japanese hosts likely to face diplomatic embarrassment

Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui has accepted an invitation from the
organisers of the Asian Games to attend the event next month in Hiroshima,
in a move which will embarrass the Japanese government and anger China.
China insists it will boycott the region's premier sporting event if Mr Lee
is permitted to attend. China regards Taiwan as a rebellious province and Mr
Lee as its illegitimate leader.
Mr Raymond Tai, presidential spokesman, told a press conference in Taipei
yesterday that Mr Lee had accepted the invitation from Kuwait's Sheikh Ahmad
al-Fahad, president of the Olympic Council of Asia, in order to 'promote
world peace and harmony'. More than 7,000 athletes from 42 countries and
territories are due to compete in the games from October 2 to 16.
Taiwan's foreign ministry meanwhile issued a statement saying that Mr Lee's
acceptance had 'nothing to do with relations between the Republic of China
and Japan' and that the president merely wished to attend the event.
Tensions have been escalating over the matter for the last month. On Tuesday
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minister, said Mr Lee's visit to Japan
'may be difficult to realise'.
The absence of Chinese athletes, considered the best in the region, would be
a severe blow to the success of the games. Granting Mr Lee permission to
alight on Japanese soil, even as an ordinary tourist rather than as a head
of state, could also provoke diplomatic repercussions.
Japan switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1972,
officially affirming Beijing's claim that Taiwan is a part of China.
Taiwan has threatened to boycott the games if Japan prevents Mr Lee from
travelling to Hiroshima. 'We don't rule out the possibility of boycotting
the games if our national dignity suffers a serious blow,' said Mr Chang
Feng-shu, chairman of Taiwan's Olympic Committee.
Taiwanese legislators have urged Japan to allow Mr Lee to attend, arguing
that politics should not interfere with sport.

FT  08 SEP 94 / LDP in struggle to pick bank chief

Japan's Liberal Democratic party, the dominant member of the ruling
coalition, has launched a campaign to reassert its political authority over
the powerful financial bureaucracy.
A senior banker and former top finance ministry official claims the LDP is
trying to impose its own choice of a successor to Mr Yasushi Mieno as
governor of the Bank of Japan.
Mr Mieno is due to retire at the end of the year. The post is traditionally
arranged in an orderly manner between the finance ministry and the central
bank, which take turns to place their own candidate in the job. But this
time, an element of confusion has crept into the handover of power at one of
the world's most important central banks.
Mr Yasuo Matsushita, chairman of Sakura Bank, has increased his lead as
front-runner for the governorship, with the backing of Mr Noboru Takeshita,
the former LDP premier, who brought together the three-party coalition at
the end of June. The LDP has been seeking to make its mark since returning
to power, after a humiliating year in opposition, its first such experience
in nearly four decades.
Under the previous coalition government, support had been growing for Mr
Yoshihiko Yoshino, president of the government-controlled Japan Development
Bank, with the backing of senior finance ministry officials and of Mr Ichiro
Ozawa, the former government's backroom strategist. Both candidates are
former finance ministry officials, in deference to the fact that the present
central bank governor is a career central banker.
Numerous other rival candidates for the governorship are mentioned in the
Japanese press, a sign of the new openness of the power struggle between
politicians and the bureaucracy.
Senior finance ministry and central bank officials deny that the LDP is
interfering in the choice of central bank governor, which is expected to be
decided by Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister, in November.
Officially, Mr Yoshino has withdrawn from the race on health grounds and
because he feared that his spoken English was inadequate. Mr Matsushita also
has finance ministry support, though from a different group of officials
from those who backed Mr Yoshino.
What is clear, however, is that this change of governor at the Bank of Japan
is less smooth and more public than usual.
In another sign of the LDP's swiftness in bolstering its influence, the
party has found a new job for a senior Ministry of International Trade and
Industry official close to the party, who was deposed last year by the
former government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa.
Miti last month informally asked Sanwa Bank to hire the official concerned,
Mr Masahisa Naito, former director-general of Miti's industrial policy
bureau, as an adviser. A Sanwa Bank official said yesterday Miti's request
was unlikely to be refused.
Japan's Foreign Minister Yohei Kono is to discuss Japan's bid for a
permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council with UN Secretary
General Boutros Boutros Ghali in Tokyo.
Japan has expressed an interest in becoming a permanent member of an
expanded UN Security Council provided the move has the backing of
neighbouring Asian nations.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Cash-strapped Arafat seeks to hasten aid: His credibility is
linked with improving conditions for Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International aid donors meet Palestinians in Paris today to speed the
release of hundreds of millions of dollars of assistance vital to
consolidate fragile Middle East peace.
A new aid agreement, with considerably quicker mechanisms of disbursement,
has become the overwhelming priority of the cash-strapped Mr Yassir Arafat
in his struggle to build the foundations of a credible Palestinian state.
Tortuous negotiations with Israel over expanding limited self-rule, the slow
pace of international aid, the delicate internal political situation and the
overwhelming problems of poverty, unemployment and decayed infrastructure
all present formidable challenges to a sustainable peace.
On the positive side, the 9,000-strong Palestinian security forces appear to
have taken firm control. Mr Arafat is still enjoying the honeymoon of his
reunification with his people; the Palestinian National Authority is slowly
taking shape building its technical capacity; and the peace process is
moving forward with the extension of self-rule over the main services in the
still-occupied West Bank.
But economic expectations are high and the tangible achievements few. Some
economists believe the standard of living in Gaza has declined substantially
since Israel redeployed its forces out of the bulk of the Strip last May and
some prices have risen 50 per cent.
A large part of the responsibility for the deteriorating economic situation
rests with Israel, which continues to deny thousands of Palestinian migrant
workers permits to travel to their jobs in Israel.
But discontented Palestinians will blame Mr Arafat for their distress.
Running the decrepit Gaza Strip was never going to be easy but Mr Arafat has
been overwhelmed by the day-to-day difficulties.
First, he has had to learn some hard lessons about international economics
and the tortuous mechanisms of the aid community.
Mr Arafat believed that once he was back in Gaza, the millions of dollars of
aid pledged by donors would flow quickly. It has not and economics has
become both the buzzword and the major headache of his court.
Donors, reluctant to fund administration and policing costs from taxpayers'
money, and sceptical about the PLO chairman's financial dealings in the
past, have insisted on a complex system of accountability. Disbursements
from the Holst Peace fund, set up to finance the salaries and running costs
of the embryonic Palestinian National Authority and technically worth
Dollars 13m (Pounds 8.6m) a month, have been slow.
Donors have insisted on the presentation of audited accounts and receipts
before releasing tranches from the fund.
The Palestinian Finance Ministry took time establishing itself to meet the
requirements and is still constrained by a lack of technical expertise.
International aid for the security forces worth Dollars 11m has been
released but a regular system for funding has yet to be developed.
The United Nations is preparing to administer a 'cop fund' worth Dollars 7m
a month to pay salaries and running costs, but funds may be difficult to
gather. Donor-funded projects have also been slow in materialising.
Japan has agreed Dollars 15m for police housing and a general clean-up of
Gaza, the European Union signed a package contributing Dollars 1.5m to the
clean-up operation, and the World Bank yesterday signed a Dollars 30m loan
agreement for sewage, water, energy and transport projects.
Part of the problem is with Pecdar, the Palestinian agency responsible for
executing projects with donors over which Mr Arafat initially exercised firm
personal control. World Bank criticism forced him to cede some of this
control, . but Pedcar officials say international criticism encouraged
ministers to attack the agency and undermine its programme.
These issues will be discussed in Paris where it is hoped that the Holst
fund will be expanded by up to Dollars 6m-7m a month to help meet the
additional costs of taking over West Bank services and finance a revised
budget deficit of Dollars 25m a month. But continued failure to make quick
improvements in Gaza's living standards could have serious political
implications.
'We have to be patient but for how long?' asked Mr Nabil Abu Irdeineh, an
Arafat adviser.
'Expectations must be met and our people cannot wait for ever. Even Arafat
doesn't know what will happen. If things go on like this, it is giving good
material to the opposition.'
Although the Islamic Hamas group opposed to peace with Israel undermines the
Palestinian authority by providing better social services, the PLO, for the
moment, is still gaining from the popularity of its return and the removal
of the worse abuses of Israeli occupation in Gaza. But Mr Arafat must tread
carefully with Hamas, which ultimately is bent on destroying the PLO and
establishing an Islamic state from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean.
In the end, the strength of the opposition will depend on how successful Mr
Arafat is in removing the glaring economic conditions which breed discontent
and extremism. Pressing forward with democracy and winning more territorial
gains from negotiations with Israel will also be vital.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Tajiks agree to delay elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tajikistan yesterday postponed presidential elections scheduled for later
this month, bowing to pressure from Moscow to open the field to opponents
fighting a guerrilla war against the government.
The Tajikistan parliament voted overwhelmingly to delay the September 25
elections until November 6.
It was unclear, however, whether Mr Rakhmanov was genuine, given that he
failed to lift a ban on the main organised opposition, the Islamic
Renaissance party and the Democratic party. He merely told parliament: 'We
want as many candidates as possible to contest the elections, including
those from the opposition.'
If genuine, it would be a significant step toward ending a guerrilla war
with opponents based across the border in Afghanistan by drawing them into
the political process.
The vote follows intense pressure from Moscow and neighbouring Uzbekistan -
both worried about the spread of instability - to end the fighting. Mr
Rakhmanov is almost entirely dependent on Russian economic and military
support to prop up his government, particularly the 25,000 Russian troops
stationed in Tajikistan.

FT  08 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Celebrations have cautious overtones
</HEADLINE>

   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A few beers were being poured down the throats of British businesspeople in
Kuala Lumpur last night. The ban on British companies being given contracts
by the Malaysian government - contracts that are potentially worth many
hundreds of millions of pounds - had been lifted.
But the mood was not altogether joyous. Feelings of nervousness persist. One
businessman summed things up: 'Of course we are happy that it's over. But
all it needs is another incident where Mahathir feels his honour has been
slighted. The balloon could easily go up again.'
In recent years British companies have made considerable inroads in
Malaysia. But then came the ban. Companies saw all they had worked for in
danger of disappearing. Having courted the Malaysian bride for so long,
British business was worried it might not be invited to the wedding.
The ban was announced at the end of February this year. Malaysia had grown
increasingly upset about the controversy in Britain surrounding a Dollars
240m aid package for building a dam, and its linkage to multi million dollar
Malaysian purchases of British arms.
But the spark that caused the Kuala Lumpur government anger to explode was a
report in the London Sunday Times alleging that a British construction
company had tried to offer bribes to Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian
prime minister. Though the newspaper did not allege that Dr Mahathir had
accepted bribes or had in any way been directly involved, the prime minister
interpreted it in broader terms - a personal insult and an attempt to
undermine the integrity of Malaysia's leadership.
'We believe the foreign media must learn the fact that many developing
countries, including a country led by a brown Moslem, have the ability to
manage their own affairs successfully,' said the government statement
announcing the ban at the end of February.
Some Malaysians felt that their prime minister was over-reacting but had
little choice but to go along with the ban. Dr Mahathir, prime minister for
the last 13 years, is a very powerful figure, influencing virtually every
aspect of Malaysian life. From the beginning it was difficult to gauge
exactly what he wanted in order for the ban to be lifted.
'All I want is the truth,' said Dr Mahathir. 'But then the British media is
incapable of telling the truth.' Clearly the Malaysian government felt the
British government should do more to disassociate itself from the media
reports.
But the official British reaction only added to the confusion: on the one
hand Mr Major described the Malaysian action as 'not being remotely
justified.' On the other, Mr Major's ministers - in public at least - joined
with the massed ranks of British business in laying the blame for the
Malaysian action squarely on the British media.
There were other perplexing aspects to the ban. In many cases British
companies found it was business as usual. British exports to Malaysia rose
by about 80 per cent in the first six months of this year: ironically part
of the reason for the jump in exports was the delivery to Malaysia of
British defence equipment such as British Aerospace Hawker fighter aircraft,
which was part of the controversial aid/defence package.
But there are plenty of other contracts to win. Malaysia's economy has grown
by more than 8 per cent in each of the last six years. The country plans to
spend MDollars 40bn (Dollars 15.5bn) on various infrastructure projects over
the next four years, MDollars 70bn by the end of the century.
In 1981 Dr Mahathir, piqued at what he perceived as British high handedness
on issues ranging from trade to high fees for Malaysian students in Britain,
instituted a 'Buy British Last' policy.
It was seven years before that ended. This ban has lasted only seven months.

FT  08 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Boycott was no big deal, says UK industry
 -Relief among exporters as normal trade resumes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The seven-month boycott by the Malaysian government on British goods and
services does not appear to have lost the UK large amounts of business with
the exception of big construction contracts on the new Pounds 3bn (Dollars
4.6bn) Kuala Lumpur international airport.
Many companies have continued to negotiate for work, in the hope that the
ban would be lifted. These yesterday welcomed the Malaysian government's
decison.
The Confederation of British Industry said: 'Some companies will have lost
business as a result of the ban, but the immediate effect has not been
profound.'
The CBI said UK exports to Malaysia for the first six months of 1994 had
amounted to Pounds 667m, an increase on the same period in 1993 of Pounds
364m. Imports from Malaysia for the same period declined from Pounds 774m to
Pounds 582m.
A long running ban, however, would have threatened large scale construction
and development projects. Lord Prior, chairman of General Electric Company
said: 'Billions of pounds of British orders and contracts had been in
jeopardy until now. . . It is good that we have a level playing field
again.'
Malaysia is an important market for the group which was part of the
consortium which drew up development plans for the new airport. Lord Prior
said GEC had not lost work as contracts it had been bidding for had still to
be awarded.
Other companies have not been so fortunate. A joint venture between British
engineering groups, Trafalgar House and BICC, had been expected to win the
construction management contract for the airport.
The contract is understood to have been awarded to KLIB, a Malaysian state
body with which Trafalgar and BICC had been negotiating.
Tender lists for the Pounds 300m airport terminals also have closed without
any British companies being allowed to bid. Japanese, German and Korean
groups are thought to be among the 20 contractors seeking the work.
BICC and Trafalgar said yesterday they were considering tendering for other
large contracts at the airport which had still to be awarded. Both companies
have continued to carry out a Pounds 70m earthworks contract won just before
the ban.
The length of time it takes to negotiate and place contracts for big
projects such as roads, power stations and water treatment plants has meant
that UK companies will have missed few opportunities during the short-lived
ban.
Rolls-Royce's Parsons Power Generation Systems had submitted a bid to supply
turbine generators for the Port Klang power station before the ban.
Rolls-Royce said yesterday that it had kept in contact with the customer,
the Malaysia state electric utility and hoped negotiations would resume.
It also hopes that a joint venture with EPE Power of Malaysia to meet the
growing demand for power transmission equipment in Malaysia could also be
resumed.
The ban did not include private sector contracts, but it had been feared
that non-state owned Malaysian companies would follow the government's lead.
Mr Ian Campbell, director general of the Institute of Export said there was
no evidence that this had happened.
Major projects which had already started or had just been negotiated with
British companies also have been unaffected. The largest of these is a
management construction contract with Bovis for a Pounds 1.2bn Kuala Lumpur
city centre development involving the construction of twin towers of almost
1,500ft which would become the world's tallest buildings.
At one stage Bovis had feared that it might be replaced. A project
management contract with John Laing construction group for building and
civil engineering for two gas turbine combined cycle power stations at Pasir
Gudang and Paka also was signed just before the boycott was imposed. This
too has been unaffected.
John Laing has just finished a Pounds 25m contract at Sibu airport in
Sarawak and is due to complete a Pounds 150m contract for 12 hospitals next
year.
Taylor Woodrow which has previously managed the construction of sections of
the country's strategic north-south highway is involved in the construction
of the Pounds 300m first phase of a privately financed light rail system
linking Kuala Lumpur with surrounding areas. Taylor Woodrow owns 15 per cent
of the equity with its partner AEG Westinghouse of Germany holding a similar
stake.
Taylor Woodrow through its majority-owned Malay subsidiary is understood to
have maintained contact with the Malay authorities and hopes to win further
work when the extension to the railway is built.
Trafalgar House and BICC also have continued to work on contracts awarded
before the boycott including the controversial Pounds 400m Pergau Dam which
is due for completion in 1997. Trafalgar House is building a steel
fabrication plant in a joint venture with Edaran Otomobil Nasional which is
due to open next year.
Costain, another British contractor, said it had been pursuing work worth
about Pounds 1bn, including the airport terminal contract at Kuala Lumpur,
when the ban was imposed. It added: 'We will now be looking to see how much
of this work is still available. We are very hopeful.'
The UK Export Group for the Constructional Industries said yesterday it was
delighted by the lifting of the ban. 'We hope that the short-lived nature of
the ban means that little harm will have been done to British interests.'

FT  08 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Aircraft market expected to see recovery
in 1996
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The slump in world aviation markets is almost over and the industry can
expect orders for 16,730 new passenger aircraft worth Dollars 898bn over the
next 20 years, according to a market forecast issued yesterday by Deutsche
Aerospace (Dasa).
The Daimler-Benz subsidiary said it expected the market would start to
recover in 1996 and pinpointed the Asia-Pacific region as the most promising
market.
It predicted mergers or closures in the commuter aircraft business, which
would feel pressure from high-speed trains.
Global annual traffic growth for jets seating more than 70 was likely to
average 4.7 per cent - 3.2 per cent in North America, 4.1 per cent in Europe
and 6.3 per cent in Asia. Including 5,310 replacements, total orders would
reach 11,300 in this sector.
The European Airbus consortium, in which Dasa has a 37.9 per cent stake,
would maintain its market share at over 30 per cent for the rest of the
current decade, the company said.
Demand for a total of 5,430 mainly turbo-prop commuter aircraft, including
2,780 replacements, would be bolstered by an annual average traffic increase
of 5.5 per cent - 4.5 per cent in North America, 5.3 per cent in Europe and
7.7 per cent in Asia.
Dasa, which supplies the Fokker 50 and the newly launched Dornier 328
regional aircraft to this sector, expected worldwide annual deliveries to
average 270 commuter craft, rising to around 400 at the end of the forecast
period.
The company had already delivered 10 Dornier 328s, had orders on hand for 46
and had 50 options. It expected 350 orders over the next 10 to 15 years, a
spokesman said.
According to the Dasa forecasters, who studied more than 500 airlines with
an overall fleet of 13,290, competition from high-speed trains would reduce
potential demand from European airlines for commuter aircraft by 7 per cent
 -equivalent to 220 aircraft.
While the market for larger jets would be shared by Boeing, McDonnell
Douglas and Airbus Industrie as industry consolidation came to an end,
over-capacity and price competition would force mergers or closures among
the 10 existing commuter aircraft suppliers, Dasa predicted.
Average carrying capacity of jets would rise from 182 seats to 236 by the
end of the review period, while commuter aircraft would have 36 seats
compared with 33 at present.

FT  08 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Engine makers face hard choices, says GE
chief - The Farnborough Air Show
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Aero engine makers face a tough time deciding whether to produce engines for
all types of aircraft, Mr Eugene Murphy, the new chief executive of GE
Aircraft Engines, the aero engine subsidiary of the US industrial group,
said yesterday. He said manufacturers would have to decide whether to launch
new engine programmes or opt out of a given engine market if they felt there
was not room for three competing engines.
'Companies are going to have to make a difficult call. Can they afford to
offer engines on every aircraft,' he said.
GE is locked in battle with its two principal rivals - Pratt &amp; Whitney of
the US and Rolls-Royce of the UK - to supply a new generation of large
engines to power the Boeing 777 twin-engine wide-bodied airliner.
GE and its international partners are spending Dollars 1.5bn on the
development of the GE90 which competes against the Rolls-Trent 800 and the
Pratt &amp; Whitney BW4000 to power the new Boeing 777s.
Mr Murphy conceded that GE was facing a very tight schedule to meet the
certification timetable for the GE90, which has been selected by British
Airways to equip its new fleet of Boeing 777s.
But he insisted that while the GE90 programme had encountered some
'mechanical problems' there were no major design flaws in its ambitious
large engine programme.
He said GE was continuing to strive to improve productivity and reduce costs
to position itself strongly to capitalise on the eventual recovery of the
civil aircraft market.
However, he said he did not expect a recovery in the market until 1996,
echoing a similar forecast by his UK rival Rolls-Royce.
'We are hopeful the market will bottom out in 1995 and we will be on the
road of recovery the following year.'
Although the order outlook remains disappointing this year, he said GE in
combination with its French partner Snecma in the CFM International
aero-engine joint venture continued to account for more than 50 per cent of
new engine orders in the world market.
For the first seven months of this year, GE and CFM won around 70 per cent
of all new commercial aircraft engine orders for aircraft of more than 100
seats with firm orders for more than 210 engines. In contrast Pratt &amp;
Whitney had taken 25 per cent of orders and Rolls-Royce 3 per cent.
The International Aero Engine Group, in which Rolls-Royce and Pratt &amp;
Whitney are the main partners, secured 1 per cent of new orders in the first
seven months.
Mr Murphy said GE also intended to step up its globalisation efforts and was
targeting such markets as China and the former Soviet Union which he said
held strong long term prospects.

President Francois Mitterrand has endorsed Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing
president of the European Commission, as the left-wing politician best
placed to run in France's presidential election next year. Asked who would
be the most competent candidate, the Socialist head of state said in an
interview published today by the newspaper Le Figaro: 'On the left, Jacques
Delors, since he is the best-placed to win, everything points to this.'
Mr Delors, whose term as Commission president ends in January, has not said
whether he would stand, but Mr Mitterrand strongly hinted that he would. Mr
Mitterrand added that he saw Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, as the
main challenger from the right.

A German government spokesmen said yesterday that former Soviet leader Mr
Mikhail Gorbachev had backtracked on his denial that the Soviet Union had
insisted that Bonn must respect Communist land seizures as a condition for
the unification of Germany. The spokesman said Mr Gorbachev made clear in
talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn that his comments last week meant
only that he had not personally discussed the issue with Mr Kohl in the
unification negotiations in 1990. Soviet administrators took about 3.3m
hectares of land, much of it held by Prussian nobility, and gave it to
peasants and collective farms between the end of the second world war and
the founding of East Germany in 1949. The original landowners have since
tried to reclaim their property but Germany's constitutional court ruled in
1991 that the land could not be returned because Bonn argued its policy was
crucial to unification.

The Polish government is putting off until 1996 the indexing of pensions to
inflation rather than wages growth. The unpopular move, planned for next
year, would have cut pensions for affected 7m Poles before next autumn's
presidential elections. The decision upsets the budget projections of Mr
Grzegorz Kolodko, finance minister, and the government's promise to the
International Monetary Fund. The country's central bank yesterday reported
high money supply figures in August, for the second month running. Taken
with higher than expected inflation this summer, said Mr Witold Kozinski,
the bank's deputy head, they ruled out interest rate cuts. The finance
ministry is pressing for a 1 per cent cut in annual interest rates to reduce
the debt service burden on the budget.

BMW is to take on 700 full-time production workers in the German car
industry's most significant hiring move in three years. The company, which
yesterday also announced extra Saturday shifts for the rest of the year,
said strong orders for new models and rising demand across the rest of its
range demanded additional production capacity. Although most of the new
permanent jobs are to go to employees on short-term contracts, the move
appeared to mark an end of the steady erosion of the workforce which started
in 1992. However, it is unlikely to be matched elsewhere in the German
automotive industry, where reduction of payroll costs remains a priority.
Yesterday, Mr Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen's chairman, stepped up his
lobbying efforts for government subsidies to bolster car sales.

British officials, however, said they would consider 'a gradual lifting of
sanctions' only if Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic accepted UN
monitors on the border between Serbia and eastern Bosnia, a view shared by
the French and Germans. Belgrade has so far refused. Speaking in Berlin
after a meeting of the group, which comprises German, US, British, French

the world is against them. They must be treated as equal partners.' He also
warned that countries supporting the lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia

<TEXT>
European Union interior ministers moved a hesitant step further towards
creating a pan-European police agency yesterday, spurred in part by fears of
a trade emerging in weapons grade plutonium smuggled from Russia and the
former eastern bloc. But they remain sharply divided over the role and
nature of Europol, with Germany and France on opposite sides. The issue is a
top priority for Germany, which wants a range of responsibilities, including
plutonium smuggling, to come within the agency's remit. Spain insists that
counter-terrorism be part of Europol's intelligence sharing. France and
Britain want to go more slowly, and rule out any frontline role for the
agency. Both countries, with some support from Italy and Spain, are also
determined to keep Europol under national governments' control. Their
partners want to develop the Maastricht treaty 'third pillar' on
co-operation in justice and home affairs, which allot a still undefined role
to EU institutions. The meeting took up a suggestion by Mr Michael Forsyth,
UK home office minister, that a rapid assessment of the plutonium risk be
made.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Albania jails five ethnic Greeks for spying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON and KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TIRANA, ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Five ethnic Greeks were yesterday jailed for between six and eight years by
an Albanian court after being found guilty of spying for Greece and illegal
possession of arms.
The verdict follows a highly charged trial that has raised tensions between
Albania and Greece and will bring a further deterioration in relations
between the two countries.
However, Greek officials made clear there were no immediate plans to close
the border or impose a trade blockade against Albania similar to that in
force against Macedonia.
The five men are all leading members of Omonia, an Albanian political
movement which campaigns for the rights of the country's ethnic minority and
has close links to Greece, from where it receives funds. The five were
convicted of collaboration with the Greek intelligence service and
encouraging secessionist activities among the Greek minority in southern
Albania.
They were arrested in April following a border raid from Greece in which two
Albanian conscripts were killed. Their arrest opened up long-running
tensions between the two countries and revived claims by Tirana that Greece
had territorial designs in south Albania and by Athens that Albania is
persecuting its Greek minority.
The five were described by the judge as 'dangerous men who have worked
against this country'. Greece tried unsuccessfully to block the trial,
claiming it was politically motivated and aimed at discrediting Greek links
with the minority.
In Athens, the government spokesman, Mr Evangelos Venizelos, called the
verdict 'a very strong provocation, outside the bounds of international
legal practice and human rights', but said Greece would react 'coolly,
decisively and with foresight'.
The Greek ambassador to Tirana has been recalled for consultations, and the
government will make a formal protest to the United Nations.
However, no further measures against Albania were announced, although the
spokesman said those already in force - mass expulsions of illegal Albanian
immigrants and tighter security along the border - would be 'intensified'.
Since the case began on August 15, Greece has targeted Albania's fragile
economy, which is the poorest in Europe, in an attempt to have the trial
stopped. More than 40,000 illegal Albanian immigrants have been expelled
over the past few weeks.
Officials in Athens said Greece would also maintain its veto over Ecu35m
(Pounds 27.5m) in European Union economic aid to Albania.
Wages earned by Albanian workers in Greece are a main source of hard
currency to many of the country's households. Last year, total remittances
from Albanian emigres was more than Dollars 330m (Pounds 213m) compared with
Dollars 125m in visible export earnings.
The Greek government is under pressure to take a strong line against Albania
ahead of next month's local government elections, which will be the first
serious test of the socialist government's popularity since it came to power
last October.
However, it is reluctant to raise the stakes in the dispute, fearing that
the Albanian authorities could retaliate harshly against the ethnic Greek
minority.

The contest looks like providing the main political excitement of 1995. It
also looks set to cover so much ground, as both men try to outdo each other
in trying to be seen to do their utmost to create jobs, as to leave little
terrain free for other candidacies. Like, for instance, a possible Socialist
run at the Elysee by Mr Jacques Delors.
Neither Mr Balladur nor Mr Chirac has yet formally thrown down the gauntlet
in public. Both know the French voters want them to stay their hand.
Two-thirds say in opinion polls they do not want the campaign to start
before January - less than four months before the first round of voting on
April 23 (to be followed by the final round on May 7). None of France's
political parties has US-style primaries to select presidential candidates,
despite repeated suggestions by the interior minister, Mr Charles Pasqua,
that the governing parties of the RPR and centre-right UDF federation, adopt
such a system for 1995.
What France does have, in excess, is opinion polls. These put Mr Balladur
way ahead of Mr Chirac. A recent Ifop survey, for example, gives the prime
minister 60 per cent against 30 per cent for Mr Chirac in a two-man contest
for the Elysee. No wonder therefore that Mr Balladur feels he is sitting
pretty.
The periodic indisposition of President Francois Mitterrand, suffering from
prostate cancer, has given him a 'vice-presidential' aura and far more of a
headline-catching role in governing the country than normally falls to a
French premier. At the same time, the rumours surrounding Mr Mitterrand's
health, which shook the markets a bit yesterday, mean that no one can rule
out an earlier presidential election.
In these circumstances, it is no surprise that Mr Chirac is so nervy. He
himself is determined to try not to jump the gun. At a congress of young
Gaullists cheering 'Chi-rac President' last weekend, he appealed for loyalty
from his erstwhile protege, and declared himself a candidate 'in the great
national debate' on the presidency, but not actually for the presidency
itself. But his supporters went ahead and fired the starting gun anyway. Mr
Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, who is the RPR's secretary general,
openly put himself in the Chirac camp.
Each camp is now going on to a war footing, led by talented young
politicians - Mr Juppe in the Chirac corner, and Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the
budget minister and government spokesman, in the Balladur corner - who are
staking their careers on the outcome. There is no question that Mr Chirac
has a lock hold on the RPR party machine, which he built and has run for the
past 20 years. He inspires great affection among close supporters, and there
is a real possibility of the party splitting if Mr Balladur eventually
prevails.
The bitterness, typical of every civil war, arises out of the fact that Mr
Balladur now turns a deaf ear to Mr Chirac's appeals for loyalty. Mr
Balladur's supporters flatly deny any deal in 1993 whereby Mr Chirac let Mr
Balladur get the prime ministership in return for giving the RPR leader a
free run at the presidency.
'Balladur got the Matignon (the prime minister's office), because no one
else wanted it,' says a key Balladur strategist. Mr Chirac had occupied the
Matignon twice previously, and even if he had wanted it a third time he
would probably not have been nominated by President Mitterrand. He says
there is no loyalty in the track record of Mr Chirac, who led an
intra-Gaullist revolt against former prime minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas in
1974 that allowed Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing to win the presidency in that
year. He then showed his gratitude for being made prime minister by Mr
Giscard d'Estaing by running against the latter in 1981.
Mr Balladur may lack the party machine, but an increasing number of
individual RPR deputies are attending presidential strategy sessions at the
Matignon every Friday. In addition, he can count on most of the UDF, who
prefer him to their nominal leader, Mr Giscard d'Estaing. The long-term
result of a Balladur presidency could be the fusion of most of the RPR and
UDF into a united French conservative party.
Even the present vacuum in the Socialist party plays in Mr Balladur's
favour. 'Whether Jacques Delors decides in the end to run or not does not
matter,' says a Balladur supporter. 'What is important is the prospect that
Delors might run,' because the polls show the retiring Commission president
might run Mr Chirac very close, but would be clearly outdistanced by Mr
Balladur.
There is, however, a chance that Mr Balladur could find himself tripped up
by the economy in which he specialised as Mr Chirac's finance minister in
1986-88. For the moment, the prime minister dismisses the possibility that
the recovery in the economy - yesterday reported to have grown by 1 per cent
in the second quarter alone - could be choked off by recent rises in
long-term interest rates or by his austere budget plans for 1995. With rises
of 4 per cent in revenue and less than 2 per cent in spending, he plans a
budget deficit of FFr275bn (Pounds 33.5bn) next year, down from this year's
FFr300bn level.
This will please the international markets. But there is a danger point, an
adviser acknowledges. This could come after Germany 'rediscovers a certain
tranquillity' with the probable re-election of Chancellor Helmut Kohl next
month, and 'just as we go into the turmoil of our presidential election'.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Joker in central Europe's pack: But a change of image could
spring from Slovakia's election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Privatisation and the personality of Mr Vladimir Meciar, the first prime
minister of independent Slovakia, are emerging as the key issues in the
Slovak general election campaign which began this week.
For the next three weeks voters face a highly personalised campaign in which
Mr Meciar will use all his populist charisma to wrest back the power which
he lost six months ago after steering an increasingly erratic path through
the first 15 months of Slovak independence.
While the neighbouring Czech Republic forged ahead with mass privatisation
in 1993, Mr Meciar delayed privatisation for months only to push through
hurriedly a series of controversial deals in his last days in office which
opponents claim benefited close political supporters.
Mr Eduard Kukan, foreign minister in the outgoing coalition government
headed by Mr Jozef Moravcik, says that at least 45 such deals were secretly
agreed 'literally in the last hours' of Mr Meciar's administration. Several
were subsequently revoked by Mr Moravcik's government. As the election
campaign officially got under way this week the government was embarrassed
by failure to finalise the details of its privatisation programme.
But ministers and supporters continue to argue strongly that without
successful mass privatisation Slovakia will never throw off its image as the
joker in the central European pack.
'People want voucher privatisation, they like it,' says Ms Brigitta
Schmognerova, a deputy prime minister in the outgoing government. As
evidence she points across the border to the Czech Republic, where close
identification with voucher privatisation helped secure the re-election of
Mr Vaclav Klaus in June 1992 and helped create one of the strongest emerging
European economies.
Mr Meciar does not agree. He said last week that if he was returned to power
at the head of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) he would scrap
the government's voucher privatisation programme and 'start all over again'.
The outgoing government - a delicately balanced coalition of five parties,
ranging from the former communists of the Democratic Left Party (SDL) to the
veteran centrists of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) - wants to
prevent him from doing so. But Mr Meciar's threat is serious, and his words
are carefully aimed at his large constituency of mainly rural and small-town
voters who believe that privatisation is merely a way for politicians to
enrich themselves.
With considerable skill Mr Meciar, who likes to portray himself as the
battling underdog, pours scorn on opponents who claim that this is precisely
what happened with his own last-minute and secretive privatisation deals.
The HZDS has clearly entered the campaign as the best-funded as well as the
biggest of the 18 parties and coalition groups contesting and Mr Meciar's
image as the architect of independence is still a vote-winner. The party
leads in the opinion polls, and could win up to 32 per cent of parliament's
150 seats.
But the prospect of another Meciar government is unsettling many investors,
both local and foreign, who have declared an investment interest but are
keeping their money in the bank until after the election.
'Interesting things are happening here but everything hangs on the election
results,' the chairman of Robert Fleming's Czech and Slovak investment fund
said last week.
Even if the HZDS does re-emerge as the largest single party, however, Mr
Meciar, who finds it hard to share or delegate power and has a record of
personal and political clashes with former supporters and allies, could face
considerable difficulty in finding coalition partners.
Apart from various fringe nationalist groups his most obvious allies are in
the former communist SDL. But the SDL is split internally between its social
democratic wing associated with Mr Peter Weiss, the youthful SDL leader who
is no friend of Mr Meciar, and the old corporatist wing. The latter works
closely with the HZDS in rural areas and may steer the party towards the
HZDS to retain its hold on power.
Mr Weiss steered his party into the coalition which deposed Mr Meciar but
diplomats in Bratislava believe that 'the SDL is willing to jump either
way'. If this prediction proves accurate months of negotiations could take
place before a government is formed.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Luxury carmakers fight tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three leading European luxury carmakers - Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW -
have joined forces to seek European Commission action against the Italian
government to force changes in what they claim are discriminatory taxes on
large cars in the Italian market. Mr Nicholas Scheele, Jaguar's chairman, is
to meet Mrs Christiane Scrivener, commissioner for tax matters, in Brussels
today to press the companies' complaints which have the backing of both UK
and German governments. The carmakers claim five Italian taxes breach
European law and have undermined their sales of large cars while favouring
Italian manufacturers. The taxes introduced in 1992 and 1993 are based on
engine size, cars with engine capacity above two litres being penalised
particularly. All Jaguar cars have engines of more than two litres.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Five ethnic Greeks were yesterday found guilty by an Albanian court of
spying for Greece and illegal possession of arms after a highly charged
trial that has raised tensions between Albania and Greece. The five men are
all leading members of Omonia, an Albanian political movement which
campaigns for the rights of the country's ethnic minority with close
co-operation and funds from Greece. They were convicted of collaboration
with the Greek intelligence service and encouraging secessionist activities
among the Greek minority in southern Albania. Greece tried unsuccessfully to
block the trial, claiming it was politically motivated and aimed at
discrediting Greek links with the minority. Since the case began on August
15, Greece has expelled more than 40,000 illegal Albanian immigrants and
blocked European Union aid to Albania worth Ecu35m (Pounds 27.5m) to try to
stop the trial. Before the verdict was announced a defence ministry
spokesman in Athens said military patrols along the border had been stepped
up to prevent the expelled Albanians returning. The Greek embassy in Tirana
said the verdict was 'a joke. No-one proved anything and the verdict was
simply a reading of the indictment'.

</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French gross domestic product grew by 1 per cent in the second quarter
compared with the first three months, according to Insee, the national
statistics office. This was in line with forecasts, although several
economists said consumption and investment growth were at the top end of
expectations. Growth in the first quarter was 0.7 per cent, unrevised from
the figure given earlier this month. Industrial output gained 2.1 per cent
in the second quarter, Insee said , following a 1.2 per cent rise in the
previous three-month period. It was boosted by a recovery in energy output
and 'dynamism' in manufacturing, which rose 3 per cent (2.7 per cent).
Consumer spending rose 1 per cent after two stagnant quarters; investment
increased by a similar figure in a marked break with the recent trend.
Exports rose 2.6 per cent and imports by 2.8 per cent.
German M3 money supply growth was revised down by the Bundesbank from 9.9
per cent to an annualised growth rate of 9.8 per cent in July, final data
released by the Bundesbank showed. The bank said final data showed a 6.4 per
cent rise from the last quarter of 1993, after a provisional 6.5 per cent.
Italy's trade surplus with non-EU countries totalled L2,770bn (Pounds
1.14bn) in July, against L2,540bn in June and L3,920bn in July 1993,
reported Istat, the national statistics institute. Imports totalled L9,610bn
and exports L12,390bn. Istat said imports grew by 15.3 per cent compared
with a year ago while exports had increased 1.1 per cent.
The cost of living in western Germany edged 0.1 per cent higher in the month
to mid-August from a month earlier and was 3 per cent higher than a year
ago, according to federal statistics office figures.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Russian military in troubled mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The first extensive survey of Russia's senior military officers reveals a
group of men deeply disenchanted with Russia's place in the world and their
place in Russia - as well as fearful of the future and resentful of the
past.
Most officers on or above the rank of major thought that 'without
authoritarian rule we cannot overcome chaos'; that 'western types of
democracy are not suitable to Russia' and that the 'main foreign policy task
must be to re-establish Russia as a great power respected throughout the
world'.
The poll, carried out for the Friedrich Ebert Stifftung - the German
social-democratic think tank - by the Munich-based Sinus polling group in
co-operation with sociologists at a Russian military academy, is a unique
view of the mind-set of a sample of 615 senior officers, including 60
generals and admirals. Though it shows that they do not endorse the more
extreme nationalist politicians and parties - such as Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal Democratic party - they are
overwhelmingly in favour of a strong hand to guide the state and evidently
feel that such a hand is presently lacking.
When asked which political or military figure they trusted most, the only
two men to achieve more than 50 per cent (and to score less than 20 per cent
on a disapproval rating) were General Alexander Lebed, commander of the 14th
army based in the Trans Dnestr enclave of Moldova, and Mr Boris Gromov, the
deputy defence minister who was the last Red Army officer to leave
Afghanistan. Both of them are charismatic, hardline and critical of the
present regime.
Gen Lebed, who has called President Boris Yeltsin a 'nullity', said in an
interview in the FT on Tuesday that it 'is just not possible' to create a
democratic state in Russia and asked: 'What's wrong with a military
dictator?'
By contrast, Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, scored a little over
25 per cent, with a 50 per cent disapproval rating; and Gen Pavel Grachev,
the defence minister, scored around 20 per cent, with a more than 50 per
cent disapproval rating.
Mr Zhirinovsky scored around 10 per cent, with a 60 per cent disapproval
rating, while former Soviet president Mr Mikhail Gorbachev scored 2 per
cent, with a disapproval rating of around 75 per cent.
The most popular views of the immediate future were dark, even catastrophic.
More than half thought that there would be one of the following
alternatives: mass uprisings and strikes in different regions; the
reassertion of a dictatorship; an explosion in a nuclear power station; or a
military putsch. Very few believed in successful economic reforms or full
co-operation with Nato, though few foresaw a return to socialism, the cold
war or a planned economy.
Other less apocalyptic views reflected in the survey including a high rating
for Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko group in the state duma
(lower house) and a moderate reformist.
The most popular foreign policy goal, endorsed by 55 per cent, was the
re-establishment of Russia as a great power enjoying respect throughout the
world.
This goal scored just higher than agreement on a worldwide system of
security.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Major rejects proposals for a 'two-tier' Europe: 'There is
not, and should never be, an exclusive hard core of countries or of
policies'

<TEXT>
Mr John Major denounced calls for an inner core of EU states yesterday as
Britain and its main European partners locked horns over the community's
future.
Speaking in the Netherlands, the prime minister spelt out his opposition to
a 'two-tier Europe', warning this would lead to 'dangerous divisions' among
member states.
He defended his call for a reformed EU constitution that would give greater
flexibility to individual member countries, allowing them to decide how much
they should engage in specific projects such as monetary union and the
single market.
In a speech certain to appeal to Euro-sceptic Tory MPs, he also called for
clear limits to the amount of power that should be given to the European
parliament. He claimed that the parliament had 'a long way to go before it
wins respect and popular affection'.
Delivering the William and Mary lecture to the University of Leiden in the
Netherlands, Mr Major became the first EU leader comprehensively to reject a
call by the German Christian Democrats (CDU) for the creation of a hard core
of European states based on France, Germany and the Benelux countries.
Remarks last week by Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, were taken
as implying the same hard core. In Paris yesterday, however, Mr Balladur
distanced himself from the CDU position, defending his conception of
'variable geometry' in European integration, in which different groups of EU
states would come together to pursue faster integration in varying fields,
such as monetary, military and social policies. 'Where I differ from the
Germans is that I don't think there can be a central core of the same
countries pursuing faster integration in all fields,' he said.
But he stuck by his belief that the pace of EU integration should not be
dictated by the most reluctant members of the Union.
In Leiden, Mr Major acknowledged that the EU seemed 'temporarily to have
lost the self-confidence of the 1980s'. But he added: 'I see a real danger
in talk of a hard core, inner and outer circles, a two-tier Europe. There is
not, and should never be, an exclusive hard core either of countries or of
policies.'
He argued that the nation state must remain 'the basic political unit in
Europe', and that the European public was 'wary of over-centralisation and
of over-ambitious blueprints for a new European architecture'.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday stood firm, telling the Bundestag
the CDU 'is and will be the motor of integration in Germany and Europe'.
'We absolutely do not want that the slowest ship decides the pace of the
convoy,' the chancellor said, repeating the words used last week by Mr
Wolfgang Schauble, the leader of the CDU parliamentary party and Mr Kohl's
de facto deputy.
However, Mr Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister and leader of the Free
Democrats, said: 'There must not be a Europe of first and second class,'
adding that Germany would remain a 'reliable team player'.
Downing Street officials stressed that preparations for the 1996
inter-governmental conference, which will decide the future of Europe, were
still at an early stage and that Mr Major's comments should be seen as a
'contribution to a vigorous debate'.
But they admitted concern about a growing 'nostalgia' in France and Germany
for an EU centred once more on the community's founders. 'That cannot be an
option because the Union is committed to a policy of enlargement,' said one
official.
Mr Major also rejected calls from other governments for the 1996 conference
to increase the role of the European parliament. He argued that it would be
'premature' for the Strasbourg assembly to be given more powers and urged
stronger links between national assemblies and the European parliament.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Home Shopping Network, the leading US cable television shopping network, has
acquired Internet Shopping Network, a California start-up company, in a move
intended to create the first large scale on-line electronic shopping mall,
accessible to millions of personal computer users.
'The Internet, with its estimated 25m users, presents us with the
opportunity to expand our retailing expertise from television into this
important venue,' said Mr Gerald Hogan, HSN president and chief executive.
'We are planning a large-scale push into the digital environment.'
With sales in the first half of 1994 of Dollars 548m (Pounds 353.5m), HSN is
the biggest US television shopping company. Viewers order products
demonstrated on HSN by phone using a credit card.
ISN, founded in June 1993, has been selling goods over the Internet, the
global information network, for just three months. Sales figures were not
revealed but the company said more than 100,000 Internet users had used its
service. ISN offers some 20,000 computer-related products from nearly 1,000
companies. As an HSN subsidiary, ISN's on-line services will be greatly
expanded, company officials said.
'Through alliances with well-known retailers, branded manufacturers and
Internet service providers, HSN-ISN will be the pre-eminent electronic
merchant in on-line interactive retailing,' said Mr Jeff Gentry, president
of HSN Interactive, a newly-formed subsidiary responsible for developing new
interactive shopping services.
HSN sees the Internet service as a new electronic distribution outlet for
its own products as well as those from other merchants, retailers and
catalogue companies. 'We see on-line shopping as the forerunner of
inter-active television,' said Mr Peter Kern, HSN senior vice-president of
corporate finance and strategic planning. The acquisition would 'give us a
viable business in the near term and a leg up on interactive TV for the
longer term.
'There are many advantages for online users and operators - users can shop
whenever they desire from home or office, while providers avoid the expense
of producing and mailing catalogues and escape the overhead costs of store
facilities.'
The Internet Shopping Network is available at any time, from anywhere on the
Internet. Users with Macintosh, Windows or Unix-based computers, fitted with
a modem and communications software, can connect to ISN. To order goods from
ISN users must first provide the service with delivery and billing
information by telephone. This avoids sending sensitive data over the
Internet.
HSN already provides shopping services on Compuserve, a commercial on-line
service.

FT  08 SEP 94 / Malaysia lifts UK trade ban: British groups prepare to bid
for Pounds 2bn of work as decision brings an end to strained relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

TAYLOR

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia lifted its seven month-old ban on government contracts for UK
companies yesterday, in a move hailed by the British government as marking
the restoration of normal trade relations.
Malaysia gave no reason for ending the ban, imposed in February after the
Sunday Times alleged that a UK company had sought indirectly to offer bribes
to senior Malaysian politicians in an effort to win a construction contract.
Announcing the end of the ban, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime
minister and finance minister, said: 'British companies are now eligible to
participate fully in contracts and tenders. We will consider their bids on
merit and competitiveness.' Mr Anwar gave no indication of what prompted
yesterday's move. 'The Malaysian cabinet made the decision . . . there were
no conditions attached. We just felt the time was opportune.'
The decision appears to reflect concern in Kuala Lumpur that the ban was
adversely affecting its economy. It follows recent informal UK government
initiatives which emphasised the harm being caused to both countries.
Mr John Major said: 'I am delighted that the hiccup is now behind us and
that we are back to our traditional relationship.'
The Confederation of British Industry called the decision 'very good news'.
The CBI added that the ban had cost some British companies business but its
immediate impact had not been profound, and British exports to Malaysia had
risen strongly in the first half of the year.
Mr Richard Needham, the British trade minister, who has visited Malaysia
several times to seek to end the ban, said: 'It is a surprise but I'm
delighted at the news. There is at least Pounds 2bn of business going at the
moment in Malaysia which British companies can win. But you never get an
order by abusing your customer.' Mr Needham has strongly criticised some
British media reporting on Dr Mahathir's government.
The precise cost of the ban to British exporters is not known. But one of
its main results has been to exclude British companies, including GEC,
Balfour Beatty and Trafalgar House, from bidding for potentially highly
lucrative contracts for a new international airport south of Kuala Lumpur -
presently South-East Asia's largest infrastructure project.
British bidders have also been excluded from tendering for some contracts in
Malaysia's power sector and for some construction projects.
However, the ban has not prevented British companies from continuing to bid
for private sector business in Malaysia. That, along with sizeable shipments
of UK defence equipment, appears to have contributed to an increase in UK
exports to Malaysia to Pounds 667m in the first half of this year, up from
Pounds 364m in the same period of last year.
Malaysian exports to Britain fell to Pounds 582m from Pounds 774m in the
same period.
Malaysia relies heavily on foreign capital to finance an ambitious economic
development programme. Some British and other foreign investors have
expressed nervousness about doing business in a country which is perceived
to be highly sensitive to outside criticism.
In 1981 Dr Mahathir, angered at what he felt was British high-handedness,
imposed a 'Buy British Last' policy that ended in 1988.
In the following years, Malaysia became one of Britain's most successful
overseas markets.

FT  08 SEP 94 / UK relaxes Ulster security in response to IRA ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, JAMES BLITZ and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, LEIDEN, BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain yesterday scaled down security patrols in Northern Ireland and at
the same time appealed for an 'unequivocal' permanent ceasefire declaration
from Sinn Fein.
The appeal followed an apparent endorsement of Sinn Fein's good faith by Mr
Al Gore, the US vice-president, who said during a stop-over at Shannon
airport that Northern Ireland was at the top of the US foreign policy
agenda.
Mr Gore said Tuesday's joint statement by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish
prime minister, Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, and Mr John Hume,
Social Democratic and Labour party leader, 'speaks for itself'.
The statement, issued after a meeting in Dublin, said the three leaders were
'totally and absolutely committed to democratic and peaceful methods of
resolving our political problems'.
Last night Mr James Molyneux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said he
had been assured by Mr Gore in a telephone conversation yesterday that the
US was not acting as an intermediary in the peace process. Mr Hume said Mr
Gore had urged him to do everything possible to involve Unionists in the
process.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said the army and the RUC
had already responded to the reduced terrorist threat in Northern Ireland.
'Certain things are not in place that were,' he said. In a further
indication of British willingness to reduce the security presence, Mr John
Major said that 'a whole range of options' would be open once the government
was convinced that there would be no return to IRA violence.
But he said there could be no progress until Sinn Fein clarified last week's
declaration of a 'complete' end to terrorism. 'All that has to be said is
for Sinn Fein to say quite clearly, 'yes, under no circumstances will we go
back to violence'. That is all I am waiting to hear,' he said.
Mr Major refused to be drawn on Mr Reynolds' decision to meet Mr Adams. 'The
Taoiseach and I have worked together and I don't doubt his personal
commitment,' he said.
Sir Patrick told members of the Orange Order in Belfast last night there was
no question of the British and Irish governments imposing a solution on the
people of the province.
Mr Jim Rodgers, a Belfast councillor with contacts in the Loyalist
community, said he believed the Dublin meeting was viewed by some terrorists
as confirmation that republicans were influencing government policy.
Mr Rodgers claimed that the reduction in security announced by Sir Patrick
had been agreed at a secret meeting last week.
Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's ruling executive, said there
had been no reduction in security levels.
Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionists, accused Mr
Major of acting like a dictator, but said the party had no plans to ask its
supporters to take to the streets.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American Express has unveiled the first in a series of new credit cards it
plans to launch in coming months, signalling a renewed effort to compete
with bank card issuers in the US.
The company has seen its share of the plastic card market shrink in recent
years as growth in spending on its charge cards has failed to keep up with
bank credit cards.
Its first revolving credit card, Optima, proved a disaster, forcing the
company to take a large bad debt charge in 1991.
American Express's latest assault on the credit card market marks the first
time it has tried to sell credit cards to people who do not already hold one
of its charge cards.
It is also a reversal of the earlier 'one-size-fits-all' approach under
which the company relied heavily on its standard green charge card.
The company plans to launch a range of credit cards, each based on a
different combination of annual fee, interest rate, grace period before
charging interest and benefits.
The card unveiled yesterday, called the Optima True Grace Card, offers a
25-day interest-free period, no fees (provided the card is used at least
three times a year) and a low introductory interest rate of 7.9 per cent.
The new credit cards, like the recently launched corporate purchasing card,
indicate the intentions of Mr Harvey Golub, the company's chairman, to turn
American Express back into a high-growth company after a lacklustre period.

FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Two banks bid for Poland's
Interbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank and ABN Amro of the Netherlands have made separate bids to
purchase Interbank, an ailing private Polish bank, in response to the
country's central bank policy of attracting strategic foreign investors to
strengthen private and state sector banks.
The two banks are insisting on a 100 per cent takeover of Interbank, which
is currently managed by the central bank following a 80bn zloty (Dollars 3m)
rescue package involving a bond purchase.
Deutsche Bank and ABN Amro are among 10 foreign banks, including Chase
Manhattan, which have applied to open wholly owned subsidiaries in Poland.
However, the central bank has stopped issuing new licences to local or
foreign banks in order to encourage banking rationalisation through
takeovers.
Deutsche Bank has had a representative office in Warsaw since the autumn of
1989, while ABN Ambro is a shareholder in the IBP Bank, a joint venture with
Credit Lyonnais, the Banca Commerciale Italiana, the International Finance
Corporation and two local banks.
The central bank has made an exception for Dresdner Bank and Banque
Nationale de Paris, whose joint application to open a subsidiary in Poland
has been accepted and is awaiting finance ministry approval.
Dresdner played an important role in Poland's debt reduction talks with the
London club of commercial bank creditors, as head of the its steering
committee, and the approval is seen as recognising the German bank's
contribution to the deal. Due to be signed next week, it will reduce
Poland's Dollars 14bn commercial debt by almost 50 per cent.
Poland last issued a foreign banking licence three years ago. Nine banks,
including Citibank Creditanstalt, operate in the country as wholly earned
subsidiaries.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Russia will seek Dollars 4bn more from IMF: Moscow's
preparations for the next stage of economic reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government is to push for a further loan of Dollars 4bn from the
International Monetary Fund to support the stabilisation of its economy. It
argues that its success in bringing down inflation and curtailing the budget
deficit this year entitles it to move to the next stage of reform.
This initiative, now being discussed intensively within the government, is
planned to be launched at the IMF's Madrid summit next month by Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, and Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime
minister for the economy. They will also ask for a 10-year programme of debt
repayments to be agreed with the London and Paris clubs of creditors - a
normal consequence of an agreement on a stand-by loan.
Government officials and advisers will meet senior IMF officials in Moscow
this week in a round of talks aimed at determining Russia's readiness for
the next stage of economic reform. 'It's at a critical moment; a
breakthrough moment,' said one senior western official concerned with
Russian reform. '(The government) must avoid any temptation to go for a
quick fix. It must be careful not to fritter away the gains it has made but
which could so easily be lost.'
The IMF mission will examine the performance of the economy and especially
the government's plans for next year's budget - due to be presented to the
duma (lower house of parliament) later this month. On the results of that
examination will depend the disbursement of the Dollars 4bn, together with
other western aid promised but not to be paid until certain criteria are
met.
The budget outline calls for inflation to be reduced to 5 per cent a month
in the middle of next year and to 2.5 per cent a month by the year's end.
Duma members, who passed the 1994 budget with a minimum of debate, are
unlikely to be as accommodating this time and a bruising encounter is
expected.
The IMF's main concern is that the government has succeeded in observing the
tight guidelines agreed five months ago - after the Fund paid out a Dollars
1.5bn loan - only by cutting necessary expenditure and issuing promissory
notes. However, as western officials admit, the Fund and the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries face a hard choice between insisting on tighter
financial discipline and continuing to support reform, even if it is off
track.
A senior finance ministry official said yesterday that 'the government has
complied with the (IMF) programme, and it is the first time it has done so'.
He said that fears of a new explosion of inflation following the extra
credits agreed for agriculture and other sectors last month would not be
followed by further loosening of financial discipline later this year.
Instead, credits would be 'nailed down once more'.
There are now some clear signs of improvement in the economy, including
figures showing that the service sector has leapt ahead, accounting for a
larger share of gross domestic product than industrial output for the first
time since the early Soviet period.
But mushrooming debts among enterprises and lack of industrial restructuring
are causing real worry among both Russian and foreign officials - though Mr
Chernomyrdin has promised the issue will not be solved, as it has in the
past, by bailing out the nominally bankrupt corporations with more credits.

FT  07 SEP 94 / US displaces Japan as most competitive nation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After eight years as undisputed economic pacesetter Japan has lost its
ranking as the world's most competitive economy to the US. It has slipped to
third place after Singapore, according to the latest World Competitiveness
Report published today.
Three other East Asian nations - Hong Kong, Malaysia and Taiwan - make the
top 20 while Italy, with the world's fifth largest economy, comes an
ignominious 32nd out of 41 nations assessed - behind Turkey, Colombia and
Indonesia. Germany, the highest rated European country, comes fifth.
The rankings, which attempt to measure the ability of a country to
outperform its competitors, are compiled annually by the Swiss-based
International Institute for Management Development and the World Economic
Forum.
This is the first time industrialised and developing countries have been
included in the same scoreboard, although China and Russia were excluded for
lack of comparable information.
Countries are ranked in eight areas, such as domestic economic strength,
infrastructure and management, on the basis of 381 criteria which range from
computers per capita to alcohol and drug abuse. About a third of the data
comes from a poll of 2,850 business executives worldwide.
The US resurgence is attributed principally to the strong and early economic
recovery, coupled with high scores on entrepreneurship, internationalisation
and 'financial vitality'.
Japan's ranking has been hit by the worst economic recession in decades and
increasing disaffection with the political system, although it continues to
lead in management and technology.
Second-placed Singapore, which has consistently topped the competitiveness
rankings among developing countries, is rated first for the extent to which
government policies help competitiveness, and for the quality of its labour
force.
Hong Kong, which came fourth overall, remains handicapped by uncertainties
over China's repossession of the colony in 1997.
Germany and Switzerland head a fairly stable European pack. Britain came
14th in the global league but moved up two places in the European rankings
(from 11th to 9th) on the back of deregulation moves and economic recovery.
Italy's performance reflects a gloomy opinion survey due to 'the profound
disenchantment of the Italian people with everything which touches their
government or public institutions'. On government policies, Italy was rated
bottom among the 41 nations.
The latest rankings also show good performances by Chile, Mexico, Argentina
and Colombia.

FT  07 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bowater improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CLARE GASCOIGNE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paper group Bowater provided a glimmer of relief in the market as its
half-time results suggested a turnround in the hard-pressed packaging
sector.
The shares improved 19 to 492p after the company posted profits of Pounds
105m and gave a very confident statement. Broker Hoare Govett upgraded its
normalised profits forecast to Pounds 231m, and said margins were improving
and organic growth was coming through. However, some analysts refused to
believe that the company's past as an acquisition-led company was finally
behind it. 'Has the leopard really changed its spots or is it just saying
what the City wants to hear?' asked one.
Bank shares, among the market's strongest performers in the past couple of
weeks following a number of broker buy recommendations, made further rapid
progress after a positive review of the sector by Kleinwort Benson.
Takeover talk, involving the possible acquisition of a leading UK building
society or the bank itself being absorbed by an overseas buyer, continued to
promote heavy two-way activity in TSB shares, which ended unchanged at 233p.
Turnover in the stock reached 12m, easily the highest since January when the
company surprised the market with a 20 per cent dividend increase.
Barclays, finally unchanged at 595p and a Kleinwort favourite, was the
second most heavily traded bank stock, 8.8m shares being dealt. National
Westminster, where there was heavy activity in the options, rose 8 more to
511p on 8.3m shares traded. Lloyds put on 7 at 580p as the market continued
to speculate about a possible early sale of the bank's 4.7 per cent stake in
Standard Chartered.
Commercial Union was outstanding in composite insurances, climbing 11 to
564p on talk of an imminent broker buy note and following switching out of
Royal Insurance, which fell 14 to 284p. Sun Alliance dipped 12 to 340p, but
dealers are still hopeful of a good increase in the interim dividend when
the group reveals its results tomorrow.
Tate &amp; Lyle declined 5 to 444p after James Capel, the leading agency broker,
was said to have taken the stock off its buy list.
Iceland Group delivered one of the best individual performances in the
market, the shares racing up 20 to 165p after the better than expected
interim results, which included a 10 per cent increase in the dividend.
Pharmaceuticals group Medeva was the best performer in the London market,
jumping almost 18 per cent as investors responded to a sharp improvement in
interim results.
Even some of the more grizzled bears had to admit that a 70 per cent leap in
profits to Pounds 22.1m was encouraging. One commented: 'This might prove to
be a turning point in the company's stock market fortunes.' The shares ended
the day 23 higher at 151p.
A market-led fall in Wellcome shares masked a tussle between rival analysts
following a migraine conference presentation on its answer to the Glaxo
treatment Imigran. Lehman Brothers came away arguing that Wellcome's product
was as good as if not better than Imigran and could generate peak sales of
Dollars 500m. Hoare Govett concentrated on the treatment's sedative side
effects. The shares fell 14 to 685p, while Glaxo dipped 13 1/2 to 620p ahead
of figures due tomorrow.
The City tends to see rationalisation as improved profits rather than lost
jobs, and yesterday's announcement by Carlton was no exception.
News that the group is to combine its common broadcasting services,
commissioning and production arms with Central Television from January 1995
is estimated to lead to around 180 redundancies but a boost in profits of
some Pounds 5m. The shares rose 12 to 857p, although they were bouncing from
a low point and several brokers had begun to upgrade their recommendations.
Greene King, the brewer, improved 16 to 537p after selling its 28 per cent
stake in rival Morland. The 6.23m shares were placed with institutions via
Hoare Govett at 460p each. Morland shares fell 15 to 493p.
Disappointing car registrations for August depressed the vehicle
distributors sector. The 2.8 per cent rise from last year's level was much
less than expected and left Lex 12 cheaper at 384p, Cowie 5 lighter at 247p
and Inchcape off 9 at 459p.
IMI turned in interim results in line with expectations but not high not
enough to hold the share price, which came off 11 1/2 to 325p. Mr Zafar Khan
at Strauss Turnbull revised his full-year profits forecast from Pounds 80m
to Pounds 82m, excluding the exceptional write-offs.

FT  07 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trade in utilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CLARE GASCOIGNE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate activity continued to drive the utilities, with the regional
electricity companies (recs) again heavily traded after news of yet more
share buy-back operations.
But it was a restructuring programme announced by Manweb that caught the
market's imagination and drove its shares sharply higher. Analysts welcomed
Manweb's strategy, with Kleinwort Benson, in particular, said to have been
an aggressive buyer of the stock, which raced up 20 to 851p.
Analysts pointed out that Manweb had been the second worst performer in the
recs since the distribution review last month and that they had been
impressed by the details of the big cost savings after the restructuring.
South Wales Electricity rose 21 to 817p after stating that it had bought
back 500,000 of its shares at 815p, confirming recent speculation that such
a move was imminent.
And South Western moved back into the market to buy a further 750,000 of its
shares at 805p. It purchased 3.5m last week and has now acquired 3.4 per
cent of its stock. The company has shareholder authority to buy in up to
12.3m of its shares. South Western declined 7 to 803p.
Midlands Electricity, also expected to announce a big restructuring in the
near future, rose 10 to 799p amid talk of an imminent buy recommendation
from one of the leading UK broking houses.
The Scottish generators, Hydro-Electric and Power, were both under pressure
ahead of their own distribution review, with some analysts of the opinion
that any good news may well have been already factored into their share
prices. Both stocks retreated 9, Hydro to 398p and Power to 399p.

FT  07 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bond market worries drive share
prices lower - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market's worries over interest rates, allayed at first by favourable
statistics on UK industrial output, increased sharply yesterday afternoon
when the German bond market fell sharply. British government bonds quickly
followed suit and a stock market already showing a double-digit loss plunged
in the final two hours of trading to challenge the Footsie 3,200 mark.
At the final reading of 3,205.4 the FT-SE 100-share Index was down a net
36.1, and only a shade above the day's low. Trading volume, unexceptional at
first, gathered pace in the late sell-off and at least one sell programme
was reported. The brunt of the market setback came among the blue chips,
which were the most closely linked to selling in the stock index futures
sector. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 6.3 down at 3,782.4.
In very early deals, the Footsie gained more than 8 points as investors
continued to respond to indications that economic growth remains restrained,
and will thus put less pressure for higher interest rates at today's
scheduled meeting between the UK chancellor of the exchequer and the
Governor of the Bank of England. Market sources indicated at the end of last
week that some official advisers might be urging a pre-emptive rise in base
rates.
The same message appeared to be conveyed in the rise of a mere 0.1 per cent
in domestic industrial output in July. However, London was unsettled by the
evident uncertainty in German bonds as well as the weakness in both the
dollar and sterling. In the previous session, the UK market successfully
resisted the interest rate worries clearly present elsewhere in Europe. But
London was already succumbing to these worries yesterday morning, as became
only too clear when the German bund began to fall.
Although the Footsie was around 16 points off by early afternoon, gilts were
still steady and there was little pressure on the equity market. This
changed dramatically when German bond yields jumped to a 20-month high and
UK gilts fell sharply. US bonds also opened lower as the New York markets
reopened after Labor Day, although the Dow Industrial Average was only a
couple of points off when London went home for the day.
The speed of the reaction in the equity market appeared to confirm that
investors are now focusing on the view that the interest rate cycle in
Europe is on the turn - with the UK regarded as the first in line for a rate
uptick.
Seaq volume of 573.8m shares was moderate, and compared with 765.5m on
Monday when retail business slipped to return a value total of Pounds
1.29bn. Levels of retail business have proved a deceptive guide to
institutional activity over the past fortnight.
Business in second-line stocks dropped back yesterday to a more normal 55
per cent or so of the day's turnover as Wall Street's reopening brought the
big players back into the blue chip internationals. Currency factors kept
share prices on the defensive, however.
The biggest losses came in the retail, consumer and building industry
stocks, which are seen as the most vulnerable to interest rate worries.
There was some support for bank shares, however, as London brokers
recommended them because of the benefits for bad debt portfolios of the
economic recovery.
Although investors continued to respond to trading statements, actual or
pending, the final slide in the market took most sectors along in its wake.
Strategists commented that the market is now showing all the signs of an
expected tug-of-war between the benefits of higher company dividends and
profits and the prospect of increases in interest rates.
'By the end of this month we should have a better idea of which set of
factors is coming out on top,' commented one leading analyst.

FT  07 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aggressive selling in the futures and options market and rumours of a heavy
sell-off from a US hedge fund took the September FT-SE 100 contract down to
break through the 3,200 barrier, writes Clare Gascoigne.
The morning opened cheaply with the September contract at 3,246, after
closing at a premium on Monday, with expectations of a quiet day because of
the Jewish new year. But after touching the day's high of 3,248 it was
almost immediately traded down, taking the cash market with it to reverse
early morning gains.
The real weakness came through late in the afternoon, as the German bund
came under pressure and with the added burden of the US hedge fund rumours.
In spite of some buying from independent traders, it was not enough for the
September contract to recover, and after dipping briefly below the 3,200
level it closed at 3,201. Volume was good, with 16,415 contracts traded by
the close.
After-hours' dealing took the September contract down still further to
3,196, with around 1,500 lots transacted.
However, the December contract was more in favour and held its value better,
finishing at 3,215.
A busy day for options took turnover to 29,511 lots, with the banks heavily
traded; HSBC at 2,787 contracts was the most active stock option.

FT  07 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil sees 3.8% rebound
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sao Paulo rebounded 3.8 per cent as a new opinion poll showed that Mr
Fernando Henrique Cardoso had retained his lead in the presidential race,
and might even win at the first round of voting on October 3.
The market had plunged by 10.5 per cent on Monday amid worries that Mr
Cardoso's candidature would be damaged in the wake of the resignation of Mr
Rubens Ricupero as the economy minister.
The Bovespa index ended 1,846 up at 49,886 after publication of the poll,
conducted after Mr Ricupero's resignation.
In New York, however, Goldman Sachs lowered its weighting in Brazilian
stocks to neutral from overweight, on the view that Mr Cardoso was unlikely
to succeed in the election in the first round, although it still expected
him to win the presidency.
The financial markets will be closed today as the country celebrates
Independence Day.

FT  07 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Takeover talk fills gap as
trading slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Stocks drifted to mixed levels yesterday afternoon as a softer dollar
prompted further weakness in bonds, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 13.12 higher at 3,898.70, thanks
to strong showings by a few blue chip stocks. But the more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up just 0.87 at 471.86 and declining issues led
Big Board advances by 1,129 to 960. New York SE volume was a sluggish 199.9m
shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite edged ahead 0.46 to
456.00 and the Nasdaq composite hardened 0.25 to 759.48.
On the morning after the long Labor Day weekend, stocks had difficulty in
mustering any forward momentum. The negative tone which had dominated
Friday's session continued to hold sway, with the market still confused by
the damage which had followed the release of last week's employment data.
Even though the Labor Department report showed much weaker than expected
growth in payrolls last month, it also included some worrying signs of
incipient inflation. That news triggered a moderate sell-off in bonds, which
in turn dragged down share prices.
Yesterday, the decline in bonds showed no signs of abating. With no fresh
economic figures due out until the end of the week, attention instead
shifted to the foreign exchange markets, where the US currency slipped
against the yen and D-Mark.
As the Treasury bonds fell anew, stocks searched in vain for any news which
might lift sentiment.
Takeover speculation again helped to fill the void. In the session's most
attention-grabbing development, shares in Hilton Hotels surged Dollars 5 1/2
, or 9.3 per cent, to Dollars 64 1/4 on a published report which claimed
that an investment group was seeking to buy the hotel company and split it
up.
Meanwhile, Eastman Kodak climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 51 3/8 after
agreeing to sell its clinical diagnostics business to Johnson &amp; Johnson for
Dollars 1bn. J&amp;J softened Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 50.
Two other stocks helped to push the Dow Industrial Average firmly into the
positive side. American Express gained Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 30 1/4 as
investors welcomed the company's plan to issue a new credit card.
General Motors contributed to the index's upturn by advancing Dollars 2 1/8
to Dollars 52 1/4 after posting a 22 per cent increase in August car sales.
Chrysler appreciated Dollars 1 to Dollars 48 1/2 on a 9 per cent sales
improvement.
Technology shares were mixed. In semiconductors, Texas Instruments retreated
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 74 5/8 while Motorola moved ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 53 1/4 .
Canada
Toronto share prices were mixed in moderate trading, as late buying lifted
the key index into positive territory.
The TSE 300 composite index finished a slight 2.95 points ahead at 4,347.17
but losing issues outscored rises by 388 to 321. Volume amounted to 53.9m
shares valued at CDollars 593m.
Overall, eight of the 14 sub-indices ended higher, with the gold,
transportation and forestry groups leading the way. The gold shares index
put on 1.5 per cent as the New York spot gold price gained 80 cents at
USDollars 388.25 an ounce. Real estate stocks had the day's biggest decline,
1.0 per cent.

Gold shares again led Johannesburg higher, as fears of profit-taking after
recent gains proved unfounded.
Demand for commodity-based stocks was seen from local and offshore investors
in strong trade, with rises underpinned by institutional reluctance to

The decision by striking motor assembly workers to return to work from today
continued to support the industrial market.

FT  07 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dollar, bond weakness take
bourses down again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prevailing theme of this year's sickly but still expensive European
equity markets reasserted itself yesterday as the dollar and bond markets
weakened again, and bourses shuddered in their wake, writes Our Markets
Staff.
Professionals had been expecting a shift in transmission, from interest
rates to fundamentally driven markets, said a senior trader in Frankfurt
yesterday. But while some company results, such as those of Daimler and the
Big Three chemicals, had been adequate, the German corporate sector was
still stuck with weak profits performance from its financials, and the
ongoing weakness in bonds was not making the latter any more attractive.
FRANKFURT's moments of truth came in the last hour of Ibis trading. The DAX
index fell only 8.62 to 2,165.90 on the session, and held that general level
for a good part of the afternoon.
However, dealers were watching the September bund future in the last
half-hour of Ibis trading, as it broke through 90 on the downside to hit
89.99, recovered to 90 flat and then subsided again to around 69.95 at the
end of the equity day.
The Ibis-indicated post bourse close of 2,158.07 betrayed no obvious sense
of panic. But dealers were wary as turnover came out at DM4.9bn, against
DM4.7bn on Monday. Mr Detlev Klug at B Metzler in Frankfurt said German fund
managers would be more interested in equities at 2,200 than they were at the
present level; in the interim, he said, cash market volume was very low and
derivatives trading could have an undue effect on share prices.
Against this background, positive news from Volkswagen on car sales did
nothing for the shares, down DM2.50 at DM484.50, while Metallgesellschaft's
need for more capital, seen as a major sell signal by Mr Hans Peter Wodniok
of Robert Fleming late on Monday, left the MG shares DM16, or 8 per cent,
lower at DM184.
PARIS was more sensitive than Frankfurt to the drop in German bonds, but it
lost further ground towards the close on news that the chairman of St
Gobain, Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, was being questioned by an investigating judge.
The CAC-40 index fell 36.75, or 1.8 per cent, to 1,961.45 in turnover of
FFr2.7bn. St Gobain was the most heavily traded stock as it fell FFr28, or
4.2 per cent, to FFr638. Axa was involved in corporate deals in Belgium and
Hong Kong, but analysts said its fall of FFr9.70, or 3.8 per cent, to
FFr243.30 was simply a reflection of bond market weakness and its effect on
financials.
Among other big losers, Dior fell FFr11.80 to FFr434 on talk of an upcoming
equity issue and its parent, Bon Marche, suffered even more with a drop of
FFr35 to FFr755.
ZURICH paused after its strong run and the SMI index, which had risen by 5.7
per cent over the last fortnight, gave up 22.1 to 2,652.4. Trading was thin
in the absence of foreign demand, which had given support in recent days.
Roche certificates remained at the centre of attention, easing SFr60 to
SFr6,295. Among the chemicals majors only Sandoz bearers were firmer, adding
SFr1 at SFr714; but in the second tier, Ems continued its recent run,
climbing SFr20 to SFr4,230.
BBC bearers eased SFr16 to SFr1,181 as analysts said that a presentation on
Monday by the ABB chief executive Mr Percy Barnevik had provided no fresh
information.
MILAN trimmed early losses as some buying developed at the end of a session
weighed upon by fears of a renewed row between the government and the
judiciary, and still waiting for action on budget deficit cuts.
The Comit index finished 10.25, or 1.5 per cent, lower at 662.99 after a
government spokesman said that a magistrates' plan to speed corruption
investigations was unacceptable; but Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime
minister, gave it a cautious welcome later.
Blue chips were out of favour with foreign investors, while some domestic
selling was seen during the session.
Among the heaviest losers, Credito Italiano dropped L60, or 2.8 per cent, to
L2,095, while Pirelli was L90, or 2 per cent, off at L4,400.
BCI, under pressure in recent days, managed a L20 gain to L3,570 as its
L2,360bn capital increase continued.
AMSTERDAM fell sharply at the close as local investors and options dealers
sold heavily, following losses in bonds and other stock markets. The AEX
index shed 3.69 to 414.28.
Financials were all weaker, with Ing down Fl 1.80 at Fl 78.40, ABN-Amro by
70 cents at Fl 59.30 and Fortis Amev by 80 cents at Fl 74.00.
Ahold, the food retailer, jumped Fl 1.10 to Fl 48.40 in the wake of its
higher second-quarter net profit figures and a forecast of higher full-year
profits. Another food company, Nutricia, picked up Fl 2.40 to Fl 89.00 as
takeover rumours revived.
Boskalis, the dredging and engineering group, finished 70 cents down at Fl
41.20 after an announcement that its trust group had sold 4.6m ordinary
Boskalis shares to ABN-Amro Holding, at Fl 40.80.
The publishers VNU and Wolters Kluwer were both lower, at Fl 193.00, down Fl
4.20, and Fl 119.20, off Fl 2.10, respectively. VNU's loss was attributed to
profit-taking.
MADRID added a generalised sense of instability in the financial system to
its interest rate fears and the general index fell 4.42, or 1.5 per cent, to
295.08 in turnover of Pta23.9bn.
The obvious targets, interest rate-sensitives such as utilities and banks,
were selectively savaged, with Fecsa, Iberdrola and Endesa down by Pta25 to
Pta800, Pta30 to Pta823 and Pta150 to Pta5,300, and Bankinter and Popular
off Pta400 and Pta390 respectively to Pta11,300 and Pta14,350.
WARSAW, where the Wig index was above 20,000 in March, fell below the 10,000
level, the key index losing 851.8, or 8.2 per cent, at 9,565.4 following
more evidence of hostilities between Poland's finance minister, Mr Grzegorz
Kolodko, and its central bank president, Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz Waltz.

FT  07 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei continues easier
as Seoul rises to year's high

<TEXT>
Investors focused on the listing of Japan Telecom and the release of the
Bank of Japan's tankan, or quarterly survey on business sentiment, and share
prices lost marginal ground in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average lost 15.20 at 20,393.98. It saw a day's low of
20,331.37, just before the listing of Japan Telecom on the second section,
but rose to a high of 20,529.71 after JT fetched an initial trading price of
Y4.7m, its public offering price.
Japan Telecom ended its first day at Y4.65m after reaching a high of Y4.98m
in the morning session. The stock became the first privatisation offering to
close lower than its public offering price.
Buying by banks and investment trusts supported equities in the afternoon,
but many investors remained inactive ahead of the tankan release. The survey
failed to affect share prices as it revealed that negative sentiment among
large companies was easing, matching expectations.
Volume totalled 225m shares, against 272m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks dipped 5.31 to 1,613.15 and the Nikkei 300 shed 1.20 to
293.87. Declines led gains by 646 to 311, with 222 issues unchanged. The
ISE-Nikkei 50 index eased 3.73 to 1,309.65.
Telecommunications-linked stocks were lower, dragged down by JT. Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone fell Y13,000 to Y893,000 and DDI Y23,000 to
Y948,000. Kyocera, DDI's leading shareholder, slipped Y10 to Y7,360 and East
Japan Railway, a leading shareholder of JT, receded Y8,000 to Y513,000.
Steelmakers continued to meet profit-taking. Nippon Steel, the day's most
active issue, declined Y5 to Y372.
The rise of the yen above the Y99 level to the dollar hurt high-technology
issues, Fujitsu declining Y10 to Y1,080. Some defied the trend, Sony firming
Y50 to Y5,950 and TDK Y30 to Y4,390.
Fujitsu General, a home electronics maker, advanced Y26 to Y877 on
expectations of higher profits thanks to demand for its air conditioners and
refrigerators prompted by the summer's heat.
In Osaka, the OSE average relinquished 83.02 to 22,635.29 in volume of 26.1m
shares.
Roundup
Strong performance emerged in some Asian Pacific markets. Karachi was closed
for a national holiday.
SEOUL saw a persistent rally in primary blue chips, aided by liquid
institutions, lift the market to its high for the year, although other
issues remained weak on swift profit-taking. The composite index put on 7.89
at 977.50, surpassing the previous peak of 974.26 on February 2.
Samsung Electronics posted a record high, gaining Won3,000 at Won135,000.
Both Posco and Kepco - heavily weighted in the index - went the day's limit
up, adding Won2,500 and Won1,000 at Won88,700 and Won30,200 respectively.
Petrochemicals, papers and financials lost momentum on profit-taking
following recent sharp gains.
Brokers said that the central bank's easing of monetary policy ahead of
Chusok holidays, which fall from September 19 to 21, boosted investor
sentiment. An official at the central bank said that about Won3,000bn would
be released before that time.
SHANGHAI's A share index rose a further 7.0 per cent, smashing through
resistance at 1,000 points in record turnover of Yn16.37bn. The index surged
68.45 to 1,041.94, with blue chip issues based in the Pudong development
leading the market rise.
Shanghai's B share index rose 1.39 to 83.27 in response to the A market
climb. In Shenzhen, the A index gained 18.65, or 8.8 per cent, at 231.27 but
the B index lost 0.59 at 231.27.
COLOMBO jumped 3.0 per cent amid growing optimism over political
developments, the all-share index ending 32.27 up at 1,114.75 as volume
increased to 233.5m shares from Monday's 151m.
KUALA LUMPUR was higher as retail investors demonstrated their continued
confidence in the market. The composite index added 12.73, or 1.1 per cent,
at 1,172.24 in turnover of 434.1m shares.
Selangor Properties rose 34 cents to MDollars 3.82 as investors speculated
on a reverse takeover of the company.
HONG KONG encountered late bargain hunting which erased early losses and
pushed the Hang Seng index back above 10,000. It was finally up 73.93 at
10,035.97 as turnover dwindled to HKDollars 3.57bn in the absence of US
investors.
Most blue chips benefited from the late purchases, Sun Hung Kai Properties
gaining HKDollars 1.25 at HKDollars 57.75.
Demand for China-owned stocks or H shares intensified, sending the H share
index ahead 17.73, or 1.3 per cent, to 1,399.35.
SINGAPORE received a last-minute boost from a late push in Keppel after an
otherwise quiet day. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 10.49 up at
2,338.55 and Keppel put on 40 cents at SDollars 11.90.
BANGKOK fluctuated throughout the day to close slightly higher on buying of
small, cheap stocks. The SET index firmed 3.84 to 1,535.14 in moderate
turnover of Bt9.14bn.
The communications sector was firm as Shinawatra Satellite, which said it
was to launch another satellite to widen its service area on October 4,
appreciated Bt6 to Bt123.
TAIPEI ended weaker after institutional investors sold electronics and
plastics issues, but financials posted minor gains. The weighted index shed
35.85 to 6,830.47 in thin turnover of TDollars 57.03bn.
MANILA slid at the close as investors sold heavily to position themselves
for the much awaited listing of Petron Corp shares today, but brokers said
selected second-liners cushioned the fall. The composite index retreated
17.82 to 3,086.48, pulled down by declines in many blue chips.
SYDNEY was higher in thin trade following Monday's holiday closure of Wall
Street. The All Ordinaries index moved forward 8.2 to 2,103.6.
Dealers said that the stronger tone of the market was partly due to
technical factors, with bargain hunters targeting stocks that had been sold
lower in the previous two sessions.
WELLINGTON was dominated by trading in Telecom, which accounted for nearly
one-half of the market's NZDollars 48.4m turnover.
Telecom's 5-cent rise to NZDollars 5.39, on strong US demand, was also
mainly responsible for the NZSE-40 index remaining in positive territory, up
2.71 at 2,179.22.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Markets Report: EU talk helps D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The weak dollar and renewed focus on the outlook for European monetary union
yesterday boosted the D-Mark, writes Philip Gawith.
Recent discussion about a multi-tier Europe, the meeting of the EU monetary
committee, and comments from senior politicians and bankers, all encouraged
investors to switch from other European currencies to the D-Mark.
The German currency closed in London at L1,016 against the Italian lira,
from L1,011, and at FFr3.428, from FFr3.426, against the French franc.
The dollar was also a victim of the D-Mark, showing no sign of bucking its
recent weakness. It closed a pfennig lower in London at DM1.5426, from
DM1.5537. Against the yen it finished at Y98.695 from Y99.25. In New York it
ended trading at DM1.5438 and Y98.65.
The Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey of the economy provided no
support for the dollar, in spite of showing an acceleration of the economic
recovery. Some analysts had predicted that economic growth would help the
dollar, by curbing Japan's trade and current account surpluses.
Sterling finished 1 1/2 pfennigs down at DM2.3904, but was firmer against
the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5496 from Dollars 1.5481.
Analysts said the events of the past few days had reminded the market that,
at least among the political classes, the idea of European monetary union
was still alive.
The EU monetary committee yesterday discussed a European Commission report
recommending that 10 out of 12 member states take action to put their
finances in order.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, addressed the German parliament
on the same issue, telling members that Germany would ensure that the
Maastricht treaty's provisions on financial discipline 'are strictly
observed'.
Mr Tim Stewart, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley, commented: 'This has
highlighted the pressure on second tier countries to tow the line on policy.
Markets are starting to tier currencies and assets, punishing countries
which do not adopt convergent economic policies.'
Analysts said talk about a multi-speed Europe had reinstilled confidence in
the core currencies. The concern is that countries which drop out of the
core will be under less pressure to pursue virtuous economic policies.
One interesting development outside of the EU was the announcement by Ann
Wibble, the Swedish finance minister, that her Liberal party would join a
coalition with right or left-wing parties in order to ensure a majority
government.
The Swedish krona lost ground on Monday when opinion polls suggested that
the opposition SDP might not win an outright majority in the September 18
elections, as previously suggested.
Mr Stewart, however, sugg-ested that the prospect of an SDP in alliance with
a centrist party like the Liberals was probably preferable to it winning an
outright majority. 'It would take some of the heat off the SDP in terms of
dealing with the left of their own party,' he said.
The tankan report sent a clear message that the Japanese economy is
recovering quite rapidly. The key diffusion index rose to -39 from -50 in
the second quarter. This was better than Japanese companies themselves had
predicted three months ago, suggesting a quicker than anticipated pick-up in
demand.
Mr Graham Turner, economist at Tokai Bank Europe, said the survey showed the
Japanese economy was 'withstanding Y99 very well'. He added that the quicker
than expected pick-up in world economic growth, which had helped Japanese
exports, was a key engine of the upturn.
Mr Turner was sceptical about whether higher economic growth would curb
Japan's trade surplus. To the contrary, he said Japan's exports were
increasing across the board and forecast a 'quite dramatic' rise in Japan's
bilateral surplus with the US over the next 12 months.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade negotiator, will hold talks today and
tomorrow with Japanese ministers, but Mr Turner is sceptical as to whether
these can help the dollar. 'Trade imbalances laid the foundation for the
trade talks and they are far more important than the talks.'
Markets in the UK will be on alert in the next few days for any interest
rate move arising from today's monthly monetary meeting. The balance of
opinion has shifted away from an early policy tightening, reflected in money
market rates, which have barely moved in recent weeks. Three-month sterling
LIBOR continued to trade at 5 1/2 per cent.
In the futures markets, September and December short sterling contracts
benefited from the 'convergence argument' - that futures market rates must
converge on cash rates, as contracts near expiry. The September contract
closed at 94.34 from 94.32. The contract expires on September 21. Weaker
gilt prices depressed the longer dated contracts.
In its daily money market operations the Bank of England cleared a Pounds
400m shortage by providing Pounds 424m liquidity at established rates.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Maize shoots on the acid
savannah - A new grain option for the ranchers of Colombia and South America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I'm so excited, I feel drunk just looking at it,' said a farmer of flat
land in eastern Colombia as he looked at a crop of maize pushing its way
through the soil.
For the farmer this was the first time that a crop had ever grown on his
acid and infertile soil which is typical of South America's vast savannah
lands, traditionally used only for cattle ranching.
Seventeen years of research by the Cali-based International Centre for
Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and the Mexican-based International Maize and
Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT) has led to the development of a maize
variety that grows in savannah soils.
Called 'Sikuani' after the name of a Colombian tribe, the new variety could
increase the productivity of savannah land by allowing farmers to ranch
cattle and to grow a crop.
Dr Shivaji Pandey, a CIMMYT plant breeder, says: 'This revolutionary maize
tolerates acid soils. Sikuani also improves the soil quality, benefitting
the pasture or subsequent crops too.'
Scientists developed the new variety with germplasm - or genetic material -
from Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, Thailand and
Venezuela.
The Colombian Institute of Agriculture, the national agricultural research
body, and its semi-private branch, the Colombian Corporation of Agricultural
Research (CORPOICA), asked 15 Colombian farmers to test Sikuani in their
fields.
The result was that the variety yielded an average of 3 tons a hectare in
the acid soils. While this might be considered low on fertile soils, it
offers South American savannah farmers the chance of a much higher return
from their land than just ranching cattle.
Dr Ral Vera, leader of CIAT's tropical lowlands programme, says: 'Planting
Sikuani in the savannahs will have a revolutionary effect: a new economic
option, a new way of working.
'Farmers will see that integration of cropping and ranching can make the
whole system more productive. Farmers willing to experiment were the final
decisive factor in producing this variety.'
Two years ago CIAT scientists developed a rice variety that will grow in
acid soils. Savannah farmers now have options they could only dream of until
recently - to plant rice or maize, or both, on their land to complement
their cattle.
The new maize will grow in about 125 days and will give farmers the
opportunity to plant two crops a year - from September to January and March
to July. While some of the maize produced on the savannahs will be marketed
for human consumption, some will also be used for cattle feed in the dry
season. This will mean that savannah farmers do not have to buy maize from
outside sources.
The opportunity to use a crop-pasture system could open the way for an
increase in both crop and livestock production on South America's savannahs,
which cover almost half the continent's agricultural land.
Especially prevalent in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela, the savannahs are
one of the few land areas of the world not to have been exploited by
farmers.
'The savannahs represent most of the area in the world that can be expanded
for agriculture,' said Dr Richard Thomas, CIAT scientist.
Scientists point out that although there are large farms on the savannah
lands, there are also many small farmers who make only a meagre living on
the poor soils and that changing to a crop-pasture system offers them a real
hope of increasing their earnings.
There could also be environmental benefits. Many savannah pastures are
overgrazed and a crop-pasture system could mean that farmers reduce their
stocking densities and farm their land on a more sustainable basis.
Also, farmers whose land is more productive could be less tempted to expand
into forest areas and remove trees for agriculture.
CORPOICA released the new maize variety to farmers in Colombia at the end of
July. If savannah farmers become convinced of the benefits of both keeping
cattle and growing maize on their land, the problem could be that not enough
of the Sikuani seed will be available.
Two Colombian seed companies, and also CORPOICA, are planning to produce and
market seeds of the new variety, which is also being tested in Brazil,
Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rio Algom to boost copper at
Cerro Colorado by 50%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rio Algom, the Canadian diversified metals group, already has decided to
boost by 50 per cent production from its USDollars 290m Cerro Colorado
copper mine in Chile - which began commercial production only in June.
This year Cerro, located 2,600 metres above sea level in the Atacama desert
120kms east of the port of Iquique, will produce 40m lbs of copper. Next
year output rises to 90m lbs.
Mr Colin Macaulay, president, said in London yesterday that Cerro was built
with expansion in mind and by 1996, by spending only another USDollars 50m,
Rio would lift annual output by half from the present design capacity to
more than 130m lbs.
He said: 'We could not have brought Cerro into production at a better time'
because all the indications were that copper prices would remain reasonably
high for the next two years.
However, Rio was primarily focused on keeping production costs down well
below the industry average and Cerro, by using the low-cost
solvent-extraction, electro-winning (SX-EW) technology, would produce
cathode copper for about 53 cents a lb until the expansion was completed
when costs would fall to about 50 cents.
Rio is one of the mining industry's most consistent profit makers but its
main source of income until recently came from the Elliot Lake, Ontario,
uranium mines. Before Cerro started production, all of Rio's copper - 116m
lbs last year - came from a one-third stake in Highland Valley Copper of
British Columbia. Highland's cash costs for cathode copper are about 62
cents a lb.
Rio first took an option on Cerro from a Japanese exploration group in the
early 1980s and intended to develop a mine in partnership with Outokumpu of
Finland. But the copper price plummeted and Outokumpu's unions objected to
it operating in a country which then was a right-wing dictatorship.
'That was fortunate because then the new SX-EW technology came along which
doubled the size of the reserves, is much cheaper and cleaner,' Mr Macaulay
said.
RTZ, the world's biggest mining company which once controlled Rio, also had
designs on Cerro. But when RTZ sold to the public its 51 per cent stake two
years ago because of growing conflicts of interest, 'it could not find a
legal way to take it away from us,' said Mr Macaulay.
The impact of Cerro on Rio can be judged by the company's sensitivity to the
copper price - it does no forward selling or hedging but all production is
pre-sold to Japanese and German customers on terms based on the market rate.
At present a 10 US cents a lb change in the price affects Rio's earnings by
19 cents a share. This will increase to 31 cents a share in 1995 and to 38
cents in 1996 after the expansion.
Mr Macaulay said Rio was exploring for more copper in Chile and, like most
other copper producers, was talking to Codelco, the state-owned group there,
about possible joint ventures or taking over some properties. But this was a
slow process because it was politically difficult for the Codelco management
and the Chilean government which faced strong union opposition to such
moves.

Russia's private farmers are expected to harvest about 10m tonnes of grain
this year despite a shortage of fuel and agricultural equipment, the head of
AKKOR, the private farmers' association, said on Tuesday, Reuter reports
from Moscow.
'For the first time since 1917, private farmers will export grain to foreign
countries,' Mr Vladimir Bashmachnikov said.
Private farms produced about 5m tonnes of grain last year out of total
output of 99m tonnes.
Officials have predicted a total grain harvest of 90m-100m tonnes this year.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lead hits two-year LME high of
Dollars 625 a tonne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lead prices reached a new two-year peak on the London Metal Exchange
yesterday.
Its price has gone up by more than 70 per cent from the bottom of the trough
in October last year,rising from USDollars 357 a tonne to Dollars 625 at one
point yesterday.
Lead is already the best-performing LME metal since world economic recovery
began.
However, buyers yesterday backed away when LME copper prices began to slide
and lead for delivery in three months ended Dollars 2.50 down from Monday's
close at Dollars 619.
Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain &amp; Co., pointed out that seasonal demand
from the battery producers, who account for more than 70 per cent of lead
demand, was helping tighten the market, as was a fall in exports from China,
Russia and Kazakhstan. Mr Nick Moore, at Ord Minnett, suggested lead was on
course for a 25 per cent rise from last year's average price of Dollars 529
a tonne to an average of Dollars 661 in 1994.
He said: 'The fundamentals of the market continue to point to an exciting
price future for lead.'

Members of the IWA-Canada walked out at a big International Forest Products
saw mill at Coquitlam, BC saying they were angered by the forest industry's
offer of a 6 per cent pay increase over three years.
The luggers and saw mill workers last week lodged a demand for 18 per cent
over three years.
IWA-Canada negotiators said this was a bargaining position and demanded a
serious counter offer this week. Talks are now expected to restart on
Thursday.
The union is armed with a strike mandate and more mill walk-outs are
possible this week.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nordic pulp producers set price
increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leading Nordic pulp producers have announced their fifth increase in prices
this year because of continuing wood shortages and strong demand from paper
producers.
Their move will lift the price of northern bleached soft wood kraft (NBSK)
pulp, the industry staple, to Dollars 700 a tonne from Dollars 630 a tonne
and will take effect over the next few weeks. It means prices have risen by
80 per cent from a low of Dollars 390 a tonne at the end of last year.
Finncell, the Finnish marketing organisation, led the latest round of price
rises, but it has since been followed by several Swedish heavyweights,
including Stora, Europe's largest forestry group, and MoDo.
There is every sign that the increases will be accepted, suggesting North
American producers will push up their prices to the new levels.
The latest rise has been driven by shortages of wood, which are holding down
pulp mill operating rates, and a big rise in demand for fine paper on the
back of the recovery in the worldwide economy.
Mr Denis Christie, pulp and paper analyst at James Capel in London, said
wood producers were diverting timber to the saw mill industry, where prices
have risen sharply, and withholding supplies to pulp mills in anticipation
of higher prices.
He added that market pulp volumes had risen 5 per cent this year - around
three times the normal annual level - partly because of stockbuilding.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Recruitment: Drawing a line in the Blackpool sands - Jobs,
Trade unions seek clarification of the motives behind HRM practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sometimes uneasy relationship between trade unions and personnel
managers took a more hostile turn at this week's Trades Union Congress in
Blackpool as Britain's most famous seaside resort became the backdrop for a
showdown between the TUC and Human Resource Management.
The trade union movement, like a gunslinger who has long since put away his
sidearms, has been watching the antics of Britain's HRM hot shots through
half-closed eyes, wondering how it should handle them. A new TUC report on
HRM has demonstrated that the TUC is far from being as out of touch as some
employers may have believed.
Delegate after delegate mounted the podium at the opening day of conference
and declared they had just about had enough of HRM. They weren't scared of
it anymore and they weren't fooled by it either.
The main problem seems to be trade union suspicion of the motives behind HRM
practices. According to the TUC report, HRM is a 'slippery concept which
means different things to different people'. Although the report conceded
there was good and bad HRM, there were few such concessions on the
conference floor.
HRM initiatives appeared more frequently in unionised rather than
non-unionised workplaces, the report says. 'There is no correlation between
anti-unionism and the incidence of HRM. Indeed the more anti-union the
employer, the less likely it is that HRM techniques are being employed.'
Where trust appears to have broken down is over the use of HRM ideas to
replace collective bargaining. Mr John Monks, the TUC general secretary, has
accused hostile employees of using the language of HRM as a smokescreen for
anti-union strategy.
What is still not clear is just how many companies see advantages in
collective bargaining and how many see it as an impediment. The TUC's report
notes that 44 of the FT top 50 UK companies recognised trade unions for
collective bargaining purposes. Such companies, it says, saw the need for a
comprehensive strategy that may include many of the 'badges of HRM'. 'In
part this may be because they have to respond to international competitive
pressure, but it can be no coincidence that these companies also recognise
unions,' says the TUC report.
The trade unions should beware of rooting out conspiracies in every HRM
initiative. Neither should they assume that managements always know what
they are doing. There appears to be increasing evidence that some HRM
techniques have been introduced as ill-thought out panaceas that are
beginning to rebound on managements.
Delayering is a case in point. We had just become familiar with this term
for cutting out layers of mangement when out popped a piece of research from
Roffey Park Management Institute this week reporting a high degree of
cynicism among middle and junior management about its use.
The majority of some 200 managers surveyed for the report dismissed
delayering as nothing more than a cost-cutting exercise dressed up as an
efficiency tool.
Many employees in companies with delayered managements, the research found,
reported low morale and were cynical about the reason for its introduction.
They would have welcome allies at the TUC. The managers tended to be
dismissive about the idea that it speeds up decision-making and helps
companies become more responsive to customers.
Whole rafts of managers agreed with such arguments against delayering, says
Roffey Park. Junior managers, it found, were particularly hostile.
Linda Holbeche, the Roffey Park assistant director who has been carrying out
the study, found some organisations so disenchanted with the practice that
they were quietly reversing the trend. One organisation, she found, was
relayering by stealth, promoting certain individuals on the quiet so as not
to be seen that they were introducing a new tier.
Such an approach, she observes, appeared to conflict with company values
about treating people with honesty and integrity. Flattening the structure,
she notes, is only part of the method of changing the way an organisation
operates. In reality, she argues, 'few companies have found ways of working
more flexibly'.
How many times recently have we heard this observation about ideas such as
empowerment and profit-related pay? It seems that first there is the guru -
usually in the US - then there is the guru's lecture or book, or both. After
this we have the disciples who charge large consultancy fees for explaining
what their mentor is saying.
Next in the cycle come the companies whose executives are shepherded into
the new management fold, often by some bright management spark in a hurry.
As the Inland Revenue Staff Federation observed in guidelines to members on
delayering, 'managers responsible for delayering experiments are generally
ready to delayer any grade but their own'. Finally there is the pay-off: in
the case of delayering it is a swift impact on the bottom line.
The problem here is that where these principles are applied in isolation or
without adaption to suit the needs of the company and its business
environment, they can risk being rejected as readily as a body can react to
a transfusion of the wrong type of blood. It is not surprising therefore
that there seems to have been a flurry of recent reports questioning some of
the most popular HRM ideas.
British Telecom is one of the companies which has gradually introduced a
host of new initiatives on the back of business re-engineering over the past
10 years or so. Some ideas such as 'Living our values, saying thank you', or
LOVSTY, seem innocuous enough. In this case it allows the payment of gift
tokens for a good deed or job well done.
Some, however, appear to be hindering work rather than easing it. According
to one employee, 'you can spend all your time carrying out quality checks or
attending staff meetings about one thing or another. It has become a
self-perpetuating industry.' The company is now addressing the problem by
taking a fresh look at the way it runs its business.
Trade union criticism of HRM needs to be tempered because there are
companies which are effectively using combinations or components of many of
these principles. These are the companies which can tell the difference
between usefulness and fashion.
The Rover Group management, for example, was initially sceptical of Japanese
working practices when it first formed ties with Honda in the 1980s. What
helped change managers' minds was seeing how practices were adapted in a US
Honda factory. The result was a 'new deal' with unions and the introduction
of a series of HRM ideas that have so far proved successful. Not every idea,
however, has been wholly welcomed.
Far from being a scene of bloodshed, Blackpool may have injected some
welcome points into the HRM debate. If the trade unions can encourage some
greater caution about its use, their contribution should be welcomed; and if
it hastens the consignment of the most ineffective of management fads to
Boot Hill cemetery, the sooner the better.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Bund yields reach their highest for two
years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yields on 10-year German government bonds rose to their highest level since
September 1992 on fears that the rapid recovery in the German economy would
prevent the Bundesbank from cutting interest rates further.
The yield on 10-year bunds rose by 10 basis points to 7 1/2 per cent. Most
of the activity was in the futures market, where the December bund future
fell 0.63 to 89.09.
The rise in yields coincided with the Bundesbank's sale of Treuhand 10-year
bonds, which is estimated to raise a total of DM8bn. Yesterday, DM3bn was
alloted to the federal bond consortium at 100.95 to yield 7.36 per cent.
Analysts said the Bundesbank would have to offer a yield of 7 1/2 per cent
to ensure a smooth auction today.
Worries about the federal elections next month also weighed on the market.
Mr Holger Schmieding, senior economist at Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt, said
investors who had been anticipating a clear win for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
centre-right coalition are becoming nervous following his poor showing in
recent opinion polls. They are now hoping this weekend's state elections in
the east German states of Saxony and Brandenburg will produce a clear
majority for his CDU party.
The market is expecting confirmation of the speed of Germany's economic
turnround tomorrow when west German GDP data for the second quarter are due.
Gilts fell more than a point yesterday, pulled down by the decline in the
German market. Volume in the cash market was thin, however, as investors
stood on the sidelines ahead of today's meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England.
Analysts were divided on whether the meeting would produce a rise in
interest rates. Mr Andrew Roberts, at UBS, said: 'The market would be
surprised if there were a rate hike - there is very little inflationary
pressure just now.'
Mr Michael Pratten at Kidder Peabody said any rise in rates would probably
be after the Conservative party conference in October. 'We feel the
chancellor will hold off,' he said.
However, Mr Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers said there might be an
early rise: 'The case is there for a rise in rates in September or November.
The disadvantage of waiting for November is that it looks political,' he
said.
On Liffe, the December long gilt future reached 99 7/8 in late trading, a
fall of 1 1/8 on the day. There was little change in the yield spread
between gilts and German bunds, which was at 141 basis points in late
trading.
Spanish government bonds were dragged down by the fall in bunds and news of
the resignation of the fifth Ministry of Finance official in two months.
Ten-year bond yields rose 22 basis points to 11.39 per cent.
US Treasury bonds showed further weakness yesterday as a softer dollar
prompted traders to follow through on Friday's negative response to August
employment data.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was lower at 99
3/8 , with the yield rising to 7.546 per cent.
At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/8 at 100 1/16 , to yield
6.198 per cent.
With no fresh economic news to offer guidance, traders took direction from
the foreign exchange markets, where the US currency lost ground against the
yen and D-Mark.
With the weaker dollar raising concerns over the value of US-denominated
securities, bonds across the board slumped.
Traders also remained perplexed by the surprising effect of last week's
economic data on bond prices.
News of weaker than expected growth in jobs had failed to impress the
market, which instead focused on the worrying signs of inflation buried in
the Labor Department report.
Fears of inflation continued to dominate yesterday, in spite of reassuring
comments by Mr Alan Blinder, Federal Reserve vice-chairman.
Mr Blinder told the Market News Service that the central bank may have
succeeded in putting the economy on a 'glide path' of moderate,
non-inflationary growth.
Still, traders generally appeared unconvinced, with many preferring to put
off any big commitments until the release of producer price data at the end
of the week.

launched a Pounds 125m 10-year eurosterling offering in an active day of
issuance in spite of the fall in European government bond markets.
Demand for the bonds, which were priced to yield 75 basis points above the 6
3/4 per cent UK government bond due 2004, came almost exclusively from
UK-based institutional investors, lead manager NatWest Capital Markets said.
The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate dollars.
The Republic of Argentina launched a CDollars 100m three-year bond priced to
yield 229 basis points over the interpolated yield on two and five-year
Canadian government bonds. Lead manager Paribas said the bonds attracted
retail and institutional investors in Canada and continental Europe.
Despite the weakness of the currency on the foreign exchanges, several
eurodollar offerings were launched.
The City of Yokohama issued its much-anticipated deal, raising Dollars 250m
through an offering of 10-year bonds priced to yield 35 basis points over
10-year US Treasuries.
Lead manager Bank of Tokyo Capital Markets said the launch was successful,
with strong interest from European retail and institutional investors as
well as from some Asian investors.
However, syndicate managers had some doubts whether the bonds would remain
in Europe.
'Most will be snapped up by Japanese investors,' said one syndicate manager.
'European investors do not trust the liquidity of the issue.'
Credit Local de France tapped the shorter end of the curve with a Dollars
200m offering of four-year bonds targeted at retail investors in Europe and
Hong Kong.
The bonds were priced to yield 10 basis points above the interpolated yield
on three and five-year US Treasuries.
'This offers a wider spread than previous four-year dollar issues, which
have been trading through Treasuries,' said lead manager IBJ International.
Baden-Wurttemberg L-Finance launched a DM500m issue of four-year D-Mark
eurobonds priced to yield 5 basis points over the BOBL 108.
In a similar deal, SudwestLB Capital Markets also tapped the D-Mark sector
with a DM300m offering of four-year bonds priced to yield 15 basis points
above the 5 3/4 per cent German government bond due 1998.

<TEXT>
The Framlington Group has launched a Dollars 30.5m Maghreb Fund, the first
listed North African investment fund available to institutional investors in
the US, Europe and the Middle East.
One third of investment will be made in Tunisia, the balance in Morocco. The
investment targets include second-tier companies which are already listed on
the Tunis and Casablanca stock exchanges and companies which are not quoted
at present but are expected to be soon.
The Framlington Investment Fund, which is listed in Dublin, will provide
institutional investors with an opportunity to participate in markets which
have, until recently, been largely inaccessible to foreign investors.
The International Finance Corporation has taken a 20 per cent stake in the
fund and the Abu Dhabi Investment Fund 10 per cent. Most other investors are
London-based global emerging market funds.
The fund is advised by Framlingham Maghreb, in which Banque Commerciale du
Maroc and Framlington have a stake.

FT  07 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Czechoslovak bank raises
five-year syndicated loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka (CSOB), the re-capitalised and restructured
former Czechoslovak foreign trade bank, is raising Dollars 50m through a
five-year syndicated term loan managed by Sumitomo Bank at a margin of 70
basis points over Libor and with front-end fees of 30 to 35 basis points.
The bank, which has been re-organised as a general bank, raised billions of
dollars for the former Czechoslovak Socialist Republic in its former role as
the monopoly socialist foreign trade bank.
The latest borrowing is the bank's first foreign borrowing on its own
account, without a state guarantee, but is expected to benefit from
syndication among a network of relationship banks.
CSOB is one of the few joint Czechoslovak institutions to survive the
January 1992 disintegration of Czechoslovakia into the Czech and Slovak
republics.
Slovakia participated in a series of capital refinancing operations last
year and Slovak banks and other institutions retain a 25.6 per cent stake.
Czech banks and institutions own 72.75 per cent with the balance held by
employees. The bank is scheduled for privatisation.
The bank reported a gross profit of Kcs7.8bn last year but made an operating
loss of Kcs10.9bn after taking a charge for non-performing loans of
Kcs18.7bn.
After clearing its books of bad debt the bank received a Kcs4.05bn capital
injection, which restored its capital adequacy ratio to 6.49 per cent at the
end of 1993.
Standard &amp; Poor's recently upgraded the Czech Republic's credit rating,
reflecting the growing attraction for foreign investors of the country's low
foreign debt and single-digit inflation.

FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: McCain public feud intensifies

<TEXT>
The McCain family is again fighting in public over the future of its
Canadian-based frozen foods group, McCain Foods.
Earlier this year a New Brunswick judge tried in vain to mediate in the feud
between Mr Harrison McCain, 66, and his brother Mr Wallace McCain, 64,
co-chief executives and architects of the company's 35-year growth.
The shareholders, comprising 30 family members, were to vote on September 13
on a board resolution ousting Mr Wallace McCain. At issue is which branch of
the family will eventually assume company leadership.
Last week Mr Wallace McCain's sons Michael and Scott, both company
directors, went to court to have the resolution overturned. They argued it
violated company by-laws and any such change would require a two-thirds
boardroom majority. They claimed the Wallace McCain family had been
'excluded from full and meaningful participation in McCain Foods affairs'.
Mr Harrison McCain replied swiftly. In a public statement he said the
succession issue and whether to take the company public and appoint an
outsider as chief executive - as suggested by the judge last summer - should
be decided only by the shareholders.
'There is no magic and if shareholders representing a majority of the
company's stock want a new chief executive, they will have one,' he said.
'In the McCain family, the shareholders must rule and the will of the
majority must be respected.'
Mr Andrew McCain, chairman, said the board would fight the lawsuit launched
by Mr Wallace McCain's sons but would go ahead with the September 13
directors' meeting.

FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Optimism fades on HK-listed
China groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
When companies turn in profit rises of between 33 per cent and 278 per cent,
it seems churlish to find fault. But the surge in net earnings at the
interim stage reported by the 10 China enterprises listed in Hong Kong has
dampened the optimism that had led to a rally in the share prices before the
announcements.
Excluding Qingling Motors, the light-truck assembler which floated last
month and has not reported, only two of China's H shares performed markedly
better than market expectations - Yizheng Chemical and Shanghai
Petrochemical, whose net profits respectively rose 278 per cent to Yn460.6m
(Dollars 53.84m) and 35 per cent to Yn772.8m in the first six months of the
year.
The two chemicals companies produce commodities which are in short supply
(and therefore strong demand) and have big client bases, unlike the
machinery companies. They revealed strong balance sheets and an easing of
triangular debt, which has been choking profits at the state enterprises
since the resurgence of the mainland's austerity drive last year.
As credit lines tightened, so companies found their customers' ability to
pay for goods deteriorated. This in turn hurt the first company, which found
itself unable to pay off its creditors - hence, triangular debt.
Yizheng, China's biggest producer of polyesters, saw its performance
enhanced by the global shortage of cotton after poor harvests.
According to the company, it had orders for 567,000 tonnes of polyester in
the first half - approaching double its production capacity, which stands at
304,480 tonnes.
But there is a big question mark over the sustainability of both companies'
performances, which have been helped by state subsidies which guarantee both
the supply and price of important raw materials. The companies benefit from
rising costs on the sales side, while being protected on the supply side.
Mr Lawrence Ang, associate director with SBCI Finance Asia, says it is
becoming increasingly likely that the state will review its subsidy policy,
especially in the case of state-owned companies which are now in effect in
the hands of foreigners and therefore cannot justify financial protection.
Removal of the subsidies would slash profit margins.
'When these subsidies will be removed is the big uncertainty. Yizheng never
says when it might be lifted, but when Shanghai Petrochemical listed last
year the directors said the state would guarantee the supply of crude oil,
but only in terms of volume, not price,' Mr Ang says.
Economic data emerging from China since July suggest the country is in no
position to relax the credit tightening measures. Inflation continues to
rise, standing at 23 per cent (34 per cent in the cities), while fixed-asset
investment surged 73 per cent over the year to July. An unofficial meeting
of China's leaders last month agreed to continue the austerity programme
throughout the second half.
While the programme has hit the performance of most of the companies, only
Tsingtao Brewery - the pioneering H share - was hit by the unification of
China's exchange rates last January.
A winning card in the company's listing prospectus was its strong foreign
exchange earnings.
However, this has swung in the opposite direction as foreign exchange
receipts dried up in the wake of the unification, while imported raw
materials still have to be paid for in hard currency.
Tsingtao previously received payment for some 30 per cent of sales in
foreign exchange, due mainly to domestic sales at foreigners' outlets such
as hotels.
The company was able to stipulate payment in US dollars or Foreign Exchange
Certificates, the now-defunct currency designated for foreigners. As it is
no longer allowed to do this, it has moved to having a net foreign exchange
expenditure of around Dollars 3m.
The brewery group is now looking to expand its export markets in a bid to
soften the blow, but in the meantime its new vulnerability to foreign
exchange fluctuations - unseen so far, but a devaluation is forecast for
late this year or during 1995 - stands to hamper earnings.
Machinery and steel companies dominated the most disappointing results, with
Maanshan Iron and Steel - the biggest H share company by market
capitalisation - leading the pack.
Maanshan suffered from the decline in steel prices in China - a reaction to
Russian dumping - and earnings slid 30 per cent to Yn590.6m from the revised
1993 interim figure of Yn835.4m.
Mr Brian Leung, an analyst with W. I. Carr (Far East), reckons that while
steel prices are likely to remain weak in the second half, rising production
capacity and growing or flat demand for products should help profits.
However, the triangular debt problem will remain a big issue - the company
is now estimated to have accounts receivable of Yn2bn, compared with Yn1.2bn
six months ago.
The debt problem will also continue to rear its head at Beiren Printing
Machinery, where profits jumped 33 per cent to Yn55.5m from Yn41m, and
Kunming Machinery, up 155 per cent to Yn15.89m from Yn6.2m.
In a bid to stave off debts Kunming cut sales, and saw turnover slump 55 per
cent to Yn18.67m from Yn42.19m. Mr Leung estimates that just one-third of
the group's profits were generated by core businesses, the rest coming from
a Yn5.7m tax write-back and interest income from the proceeds of its dual
share offering in China and Hong Kong.
Kunming spent a mere one-quarter of the Yn390m raised and creamed interest
off the remainder, investing just a fraction of the figure quoted in its
listing prospectus on new machinery and tools.
The outlook for all the H-share companies in the second half is not
promising, although some analysts are recommending the chemical companies
and, for relative value, Dongfang Electric, whose conservative accounting
policy means that 70 per cent of whole-year profits are booked in the second
half.

<TEXT>
C. E. Heath International, the Australian liability insurer which was spun
off from its UK parent in 1992, yesterday posted an operating profit after
tax and abnormals of ADollars 6m (USDollars 4.4m) in the six months to
end-June. This compares with a profit of ADollars 18.7m in the same period
of 1993.
Heath's problems stemmed from the worsening investment environment - in
particular, rising fixed-interest markets which created unrealised
investment losses of ADollars 32.7m, when the portfolio was 'marked to
market value'.
This caused Heath to move to an operating loss before tax and abnormals of
almost ADollars 15m, compared with a ADollars 28.7m profit last time. The
loss was then partly offset by a ADollars 24.5m abnormal surplus, resulting
from the sale of Californian operations.
Heath added that its underwriting profit, net of expenses, rose from little
better than break-even in the first half of 1993, to ADollars 9.7m.

FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Hopewell earnings boosted by
CEPA sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopewell Holdings, the Hong Kong property and construction group controlled
by Mr Gordon Wu, yesterday announced a 20 per cent rise in net profits to
HKDollars 2.4bn (USDollars 310m) for the year to June 30, up from HKDollars
2bn in the previous year.
The company booked exceptional items of HKDollars 1.8bn, including HKDollars
1.2bn from the spin-off last November of Consolidated Electric Power Asia
(CEPA), a vehicle incorporating Hopewell's power stations.
The net result was HKDollars 1.6bn less than Mr Wu's forecast of a doubling
of profits, made at the time of the spin-off, but was in line with market
expectations.
Analysts say they do not expect to see quality recurrent earnings come on
stream until 1996, when CEPA and the Guangzhou-Shenzhen superhighway will
start making more significant contributions.
Earnings per share climbed 10 cents to 57 cents, and the directors are
proposing a dividend of 19 cents, an improvement of 1 cent on last year.
Profit at the operating level rose to HKDollars 795.5m from HKDollars
733.2m, reflecting the bigger role played by exceptional items in the
previous year. Then, property sales and other exceptionals totalled
HKDollars 2.1bn.
Hopewell benefited from a sharply lower tax bill this year, at HKDollars
105.6m compared with HKDollars 287.2m. This reflects the increase in its
share of earnings from overseas, which are not liable to Hong Kong tax.
CEPA's projects are mainly in China (where foreigners can enjoy tax-free
periods of around six years), the Philippines, and south-east Asia.
Deductions for minority interests also fell, to HKDollars 172m from an
abnormally large HKDollars 683m.
The previous year's figure was swollen by the sale of a property owned by a
company in which Hopewell had a 60 per cent interest.

FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: American Express launches new
card range
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American Express yesterday unveiled the first in a series of new credit
cards it plans to launch in coming months, signalling a renewed effort to
compete with bank card issuers in the US.
The company has seen its share of the plastic card market shrink in recent
years as growth in spending on its charge cards has failed to keep up with
bank credit cards. Its first revolving credit card, Optima, proved a
disaster, forcing the company to take a large bad debt charge in 1991.
American Express's latest assault on the credit card market marks the first
time it has tried to sell credit cards to people who do not already hold one
of its charge cards.
It is also a reversal of the earlier 'one-size-fits-all' approach under
which the company relied heavily on its standard green charge card.
The company plans to launch a range of credit cards, each based on a
different combination of annual fee, interest rate, grace period before
charging interest and benefits.
The card unveiled yesterday, called the Optima True Grace Card, offers a
25-day interest-free period, no fees (provided the card is used at least
three times a year) and a low introductory interest rate of 7.9 per cent.
The new credit cards, like the recently launched corporate purchasing card,
indicate the intentions of Mr Harvey Golub, the company's chairman, to turn
American Express back into a high-growth company after a lacklustre period.
The stock market took heart on yesterday's news, pushing the company's share
price up a further Dollars 1 1/4 , to Dollars 30 1/4 , for a rise of around
10 per cent in the past two weeks.

Valeo, the French vehicle components group, yesterday announced a 27 per
cent increase in first-half net consolidated profit to FFr487m (Dollars 91m)

The results confirm Valeo as one of France's more successful companies.
In the first six months of this year it was able to outperform the rest of
the French car components sector by growing faster in the rest of the world.
Turnover advanced 7 per cent in Europe, roughly in line with the general
increase in car sales, but by 10 per cent in South America, 24 per cent in
North America and 30 per cent in Asia.
As a result, Valeo made 59.1 per cent of its sales outside France in the
first half of this year, compared with 56.5 per cent in the same period of
1993.
The company said it had increased gross margins, operating income and net
profit, in spite of a rise in its tax rate, increased spending on R&amp;D and
capital equipment, and unchanged restructuring charges.
It also increased its foreign investments by nearly 10 times, to FFr330m in
the first half by acquiring Borg Instruments in Germany and taking majority
stakes in new subsidiaries and joint ventures in Argentina and China.
With stronger cash flow and a capital increase, Valeo's debt to equity ratio
stood at 5 per cent by the end of June, compared with 14 per cent last
December and 23 per cent a year earlier.

Microsoft, the leading supplier of personal computer software, has formed a
partnership with The Reader's Digest Association to develop and publish
multimedia software for home computer users, writes Louise Kehoe.
They will both market a CD-Rom (compact disc read-only memory) based on
editorial content from Reader's Digest's best-selling books.
Microsoft will have worldwide retail rights to the product. Reader's Digest
will sell the CD-Rom through direct mail.
The deal reflects the growth of home computer sales and surging sales of
CD-Rom software. In the first quarter of 1994, global CD-Rom sales totalled
Dollars 136m, up 366 per cent from the first quarter of 1993, according to
the Software Publishers Association.
The Microsoft-Reader's Digest title, due for release in the second half of
1995, will be based on Reader's Digest reference books.

Johannesburg Consolidated Investments, the South African mining house,
boosted attributable earnings by 73 per cent to R748m (Dollars 165m) in the
year to June, from R433.2m a year ago.
It was the last annual result before the conglomerate's planned unbundling
into three separate companies early next year.
Group turnover rose to R2.92bn, up from R2.63bn a year ago, and the dividend
was raised to 200 cents, up from only 132 cents last year.
Although the results were helped by R84.5m from the sale of Argus Newspapers
to Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers, equity-accounted earnings
before extraordinary items advanced 57 per cent to R912.9m from R582.4m.
The company has also decided to reverse its decision to write off R130m of
its investment in the HJ Joel Gold Mine after a sharp improvement in the
mine's prospects during the past year and its successful raising of R284m in
fresh capital.
Following last year's tax credit of R20.8m, tax paid rose to R62.3m on the
year.
Earnings from platinum holdings, which include the world's largest platinum
mine, Rustenburg Platinum, rose to R114.5m from R85.4m, while gold benefited
from an improved price to more than double earnings to R93.8m from R34.6m.
The group, which last week lost out in the bid to buy Randcoal, reported
that coal earnings rose substantially to R23m from R1.8m. Diamonds also had
a good year, with earnings rising to R104.2m from R79.2m.
Mr Pat Retief, chairman, said he expected all sectors of the company to
continue to perform well after unbundling.
Under the plan announced by JCI's leading shareholder, Anglo-American, the
platinum interests would be retained by Anglo-American while its diamond
interests would be bought by De Beers.
The rest of JCI would be divided into a mining company, comprising primarily
JCI's gold interests, and an industrial holding company, both of which are
due to be offered to black investors.
Although the transaction requires changes to legislation before it can be
approved by shareholders, Mr Retief said he hoped final unbundling would
take place early next year and be completed by April 1995.

<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest publisher of personal computer software, has
launched an ergonomically designed 'natural' PC keyboard to help users avoid
the dangers of repetitive stress injuries.
Microsoft makes no claims that the keyboard will cure or prevent any form of
RSI. Labels, affixed to the cable linking the keyboard to a PC and to the
bottom of the keyboard, warn users that 'Continuous use of a keyboard may
cause Repetitive Stress Injuries or related injuries'. Similar warning
labels were recently introduced by Compaq, the world's largest PC
manufacturer. The labels are seen as a move by the companies to avoid
liability for future injury claims.
Already, over 2,000 injury lawsuits have been filed against computer
manufacturers in the US.
The new Microsoft keyboard, which will be available worldwide next month at
a price of around Dollars 100, is designed to allow users to maintain a more
relaxed, natural position while typing. It can be plugged into any PC that
runs Windows 3.1 or more recent versions of the Microsoft software.
The keyboard is designed to encourage users to maintain a straighter wrist
position - avoiding one of the most common causes of discomfort and
injuries.
Microsoft will also provide an 'ergonomics guide'.
'In the last 10 years, computers have dramatically changed the workplace and
the ways in which people perform their jobs,' said Rick Thompson, manager of
the hardware business unit at Microsoft.
'Yet in that time, the design of the computer keyboard has remained
virtually unchanged.'

Generale de Banque, Belgium's biggest bank, yesterday announced net profits
8.6 per cent higher at BFr6.3bn (Dollars 197m) for the first half of 1994.
The rise compared with BFr5.8bn in the first six months of last year.
However, the 1993 half-year results included an exceptional gain of about
BFr2bn, following the sale of shares in ABN Amro, the big Dutch bank.
As a result, Generale de Banque said that the improvement in 1994 was
significant.
Gross profit was BFr21.25 bn, a decline of 7.7 per cent. Analysts
interpreted the fall to the failure to repeat the strong capital gains
achieved on government bonds in 1993, as well as the exceptional capital
gain on the ABN Amro shares.
However, write-downs and provisions were down by 31 per cent to BFr8.7bn.
Total assets were up 8.8 per cent to BFr3.939bn.

FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Roving Wallenbergs stay true to
home - Overseas expansion will not jeopardise family's commitment to Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sweeping industrial domain built up over 140 years by Sweden's
Wallenberg family is entering a new phase after overcoming most of the
debilitating effects of a long recession.
With profits again flowing fast in most of the companies under the family's
control, the Wallenbergs are looking to strengthen their presence in growth
industries and are eyeing investment opportunities overseas.
Individual companies, such as Astra, Ericsson, Electrolux and the forestry
group Stora, have the income to support long-term development strategies,
both in new technologies and new markets.
'Now the defence is over. We think the ship is in very good order and it is
time to be a bit more offensive again,' says Mr Claes Dahlback, chief
executive of Investor, the holding company that forms the core of the
Wallenberg sphere. He says Investor 'has the radar on' for new investments,
especially overseas.
The trend is set to move the empire away from its traditional dependence on
low-growth cyclical industries towards technology-based industries, such as
pharmaceuticals, medical technology, telecommunications and, perhaps, the
media.
Senior family members, however, will not be drawn on speculation about
individual companies - for example, whether they might sell out of SKF, the
ball-bearings maker, or float some of Investor's 100 per cent holding in
Saab-Scania, the vehicle and aircraft maker. The emphasis, however, will be
on evolution, rather than dramatic changes of direction.
They also stress that any move to build up holdings overseas will be limited
 -not more than 10 per cent of Investor's total portfolio - and will not
jeopardise the family's commitment to Sweden.
That commitment and the management capabilities of the Wallenbergs are now
more than ever important for Sweden, given the unprecedented dominance the
empire exerts over the country's industry. In annual turnover terms,
Wallenberg companies account for more than SKr500bn (Dollars 65bn), more
than the combined total of the next three largest owners, the state, Volvo
and Svenska Handelsbanken.
But the issue of how effectively the Wallenbergs have wielded their power
and whether such a hegemony is healthy for Sweden's industrial economy, is
seldom debated in public in Sweden.
There are, however, serious concerns that the Wallenberg record, though
impressive, has not always been flawless and that in the long term it is
perilous for the country to be so dependent on one family.
The LO, the federation of blue-collar trade unions, has voiced its concern.
'We need strong industrial leaders and we need stable ownership in Sweden,
but we have too few groups and too little competition,' says Mr Per Olof
Edin, chief economist at the LO. 'It would be good if more foreign owners
came to Sweden and established themselves as strong leaders of industrial
companies.'
There is also the criticism that the results of Wallenberg companies - like
those of all Swedish exporters - have been exaggerated by devaluations in
1982 and 1992. 'The situation is like a runner who sets a world record for
the 100 metres,' wrote Mr Per Afrell, business editor of the newspaper
Dagens Nyheter. 'The problem is he had a downhill slope, the wind behind him
and he ran only 80 metres.'
Critics also say the Wallenberg investment performance has been
unspectacular and would have been worse than the overall market without the
phenomenal performance of Astra, the high-flying pharmaceuticals group.
There are examples of questionable judgment within the empire. In the pulp
and paper industry, the Wallenbergs made expensive acquisitions just when
the cycle was turning down - most notably that of the German group Feldmuhle
by Stora in 1990 for DM4bn (Dollars 2.6bn). They also took full control of
Saab-Scania in 1991, just as it was heading into a trough.
More recently, Incentive, a Wallenberg industrial group, agreed in June to
sell its stake in Esab, the welding equipment supplier, to Charter, a UK
company, at SKr345 a share. Institutional shareholders maintained the price
was too low and forced Charter to raise its bid to SKr380.
'The Wallenberg dominance is very dangerous because nothing develops without
competition,' says a senior Swedish businessman. 'When things get too
intertwined it's like a group of children playing - nobody sticks their neck
out except one or two leaders. That will not lead to creative solutions
which Sweden badly needs at the moment.'
In spite of such reservations, the majority view in Swedish business is that
the Wallenberg record of successes over four generations, which is unmatched
by any other family dynasty, comfortably outweighs the failures.
SKF, which invented ball-bearings in the 1920s, and Electrolux, which first
produced a vacuum cleaner in 1912, were launched during the heyday of
industrial innovation. These companies have continued to evolve and hold
their own as market leaders. Electrolux has grown to become the biggest
supplier of household appliances in the world.
In the forestry sector, the Wallenbergs have transformed Stora, through
acquisitions and divestments, from a diversified group into Europe's biggest
pulp and paper company.
In the cases of Astra, the pharmaceuticals group, and Ericsson, the
telecommunications company, the empire has produced successes based on
modern technology.
Profits growth at Astra has outstripped turnover growth for each of the past
16 years. Ericsson ran into trouble in the 1980s as it got bogged down in
the computer business, but it sold out of computers, refocused on
telecommunications and has become a world leader in mobile telephony.
The Wallenbergs also steered Asea into the merger with Switzerland's Brown
Boveri in 1988, creating the engineering giant ABB. Half controlled by the
Wallenbergs, ABB was recently voted Europe's most respected company in a
Financial Times poll.
There is a strong belief in Sweden that without the Wallenbergs' commitment
to the country and their willingness to invest for the long term, Sweden
would not have produced such an array of international companies.
Wallenberg companies have invested heavily overseas in recent years, in some
cases retaining as little as 10 per cent of their production in Sweden. But,
unlike family concerns, such as the Ikea retail organisation of the Kamprad
family and Tetra Pak, the packaging group owned by the Rausing family, their
headquarters and ownership remains in the country.
Some fear that without the Wallenbergs much of Swedish industry would
migrate.
Hence, there is widespread anxiety in Sweden over moves within the European
Union - at present dormant - to rule against the kind of weighted share
structures that allow companies to be tightly controlled by minority
shareholders. Such a ruling would force the Wallenbergs to restructure their
empire dramatically.
'We simply don't have the capital to be able to control our own companies,
so we would face an exodus of ownership,' says Mr Magnus Lemmel, chief
executive of the Federation of Swedish Industries.
As long as that threat remains buried in the pile of shelved initiatives in
Brussels, the principal task remaining for Mr Peter Wallenberg, the keeper
of the fourth generation of Wallenberg entrepreneurship, is to manage the
smooth transition of the inheritance to Jacob and Marcus Wallenberg, his son
and nephew.
And he does not consider that inheritance to be any kind of burden on the
nation. 'As long as we perform at least as well or better than other
equivalent industries; as long as we behave as genuine Swedes in Sweden,
meaning that we live here, we pay this country's taxes and we fulfil all our
duties more than just the minimum, then we will do nothing that will be
against the best interests of the country.' This is the last in the series
on the Wallenbergs. The previous articles appeared on September 1 and 2.

FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Institutions agree to share
information on governance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A more structured approach to exchanging information internationally on
attitudes towards corporate governance issues has come a step closer, after
an agreement by organisations representing institutional investors.
Associations for institutional investors in a range of countries, including
the US, Canada, Australia, Germany and the UK, have decided to exchange
information on a more routine basis about questions such as directors'
remuneration and the duties of non-executive board members.
The associations, which include the Council for Institutional Investors, an
umbrella organisation for US pension funds, will pass each other copies of
papers setting out their broad attitudes towards governance issues, so that
each is more aware of the practice in other countries and can make that
information available to its members.
Some organisations would like to see that develop within the next year or
two into a network for exchanging more specific information.
This would not be intended to lead to the establishment of common positions
or to making recommendations on how investors should vote on issues.
Instead, the aim would be to ensure that, when questions arise for
shareholders to decide, institutional investors are in a better position to
know how the approach of a particular company compares with local practice.
It is already clear, however, that not all the associations which have
agreed to the first stage would want to be involved in dealing with
company-specific information.
In the UK, the National Association of Pension Funds and the Association of
British Insurers, whose members manage more than Pounds 550bn (Dollars
852bn) of investment funds, have been increasingly adopting a high profile
on corporate governance.
Last month, for example, the ABI wrote to a number of the UK's largest
companies expressing concern over large payments to former directors.
The question of handling corporate governance questions in an international
context will be raised next week at a conference on European investment
issues organised by the NAPF.

FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: LVMH net climbs 35% as luxury
goods sales recover
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The buoyant state of the luxury goods market was highlighted yesterday by
news that LVMH, one of the largest businesses in the sector, increased net
profits by 35 per cent during the first half of 1994.
LVMH, which will publish full interim figures later this month, confirmed
that net profits had risen to FFr1.26bn (Dollars 236m) in the six months,
from FFr935m in the same period of 1993. Sales rose 20 per cent to FFr12bn.
The group affirmed that 'if current trends continue' it was on course to
achieve the target of 20 per cent net profits growth for the full year set
by Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman. Analysts are expecting slightly higher
figures.
LVMH, which has extensive interests across the luxury goods industry,
including Hennessy cognac, Moet et Chandon champagne, Louis Vuitton luggage
and Christian Dior cosmetics, has reported sluggish profits due to the
depressed state of the fashion and cosmetics markets, the crisis in the
champagne sector and the recession in Japan.
LVMH said its first-half profits increase was due to a stronger performance
from all its interests and lower financial expenses.
Earlier this year, LVMH announced it was unravelling its cross-shareholding
agreement with Guinness, the UK drinks group, significantly reducing its
borrowings and cutting financial costs. Christian Dior is expected to stage
a capital increase to finance the Guinness transaction.
Mr Arnault has made it clear he plans to use LVMH's new-found financial
flexibility to increase its luxury interests. LVMH made its first
acquisition by taking control of Guerlain, the fragrance house in which it
held a minority stake.
However, Mr Arnault was foiled in his attempt to buy Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, the
Paris-based jewellers, by stiff competition from Chanel, the French fashion
house, and Van Cleef was eventually taken off the market.
Mr Arnault is now seeking other investment opportunities.
'From a financial perspective LVMH should be able to make a major
acquisition,' said Ms Joseline Gaudino, an analyst at the Societe Generale
securities house in Paris. 'The only problem could be a shortage of suitable
targets.'

FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Axa buys Victoire Belgium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Axa, one of France's largest insurers, is expanding its European interests
by buying Victoire Belgium from Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) for
FFr1bn (Dollars 188m).
UAP acquired Victoire Belgium last year as part of a complex deal which gave
it control of the international activities of Victoire, the Paris-based
insurer then owned by the Suez group.
The bulk of Victoire's domestic business has since been sold by Suez to
Commercial Union, the UK concern, as part of the ongoing restructuring of
the European insurance industry.
Axa, which trails UAP as the second force in French insurance, has been
steadily expanding its international interests. It already has a presence in
the Belgian market through its Axa Belgium and Mutuelle Patronale
subsidiaries, which had combined turnover of FFr2.35bn in 1993.
The acquisition of Victoire Belgium, which commanded an estimated 1.3 per
cent of the Belgian insurance sector with 1993 turnover of FFr920m, should
raise Axa's share of the Belgian market to around 5 per cent.
It will still lag UAP which, even after this latest disposal, remains the
number two insurer in Belgium, through its Royale Belge subsidiary. That
business had turnover of FFr9.3bn last year.
Vic-Life, the Luxembourg subsidiary of Victoire Belgium, has been exempted
from yesterday's transaction. Instead of going to Axa, it will become part
of the Royale Belge group, raising UAP's profile in Luxembourg by lifting
its annual sales to around FFr190m.
Axa and UAP are still intent on pursuing further international acquisitions.
Axa yesterday announced it was poised to clinch a deal to buy the The Wing
On Life Assurance Company in Hong Kong.
UAP has expressed interest in Asia, but is also seeking a non-life insurer
in the UK.

<TEXT>
The Italian Treasury has imposed fines on directors of various Italian banks
to remind them of their obligations under the country's banking legislation.
The fines are small - the largest is only L18m (Dollars 11,461) - but they
indicate the Treasury's determination to enforce the rules on Italy's
sprawling banking sector.
Directors of the Banca Popolare di Novara, which operates one of Italy's
largest branch networks, have each been fined L12m for minor omissions and
errors relating to its credit position and accounting situation. The
infringements were detected between March and October last year.
Fines were also imposed on Cofilp, a financial subsidiary of the Novara
bank; Credito Lombardo; Credito Commerciale; and Cassa di Risparmio di

FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft shares fall
8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Shares in Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals, engineering and
chemicals group, fell 8 per cent yesterday as investors reacted with
confusion to reports of possible moves to strengthen its share capital.
There was also concern about the likely extent of further restructuring,
especially on the non-ferrous metals smelting side. Shares in the company,
which almost collapsed after significant losses on US oil futures trading
last year, closed DM16 lower in Frankfurt at DM184.
Metallgesellschaft said on Monday night, after a supervisory board meeting,
that last week's deal releasing it from controversial oil refinery contracts
with Castle Energy of the US meant it would need to set aside more than the
planned DM1bn to cover losses.
Yesterday, the company said it was talking with share-holders and creditor
banks about improving its capital structure. It gave no details, but made it
clear that the process would take time, with any decision to be put to the
annual meeting next March.
The market was unsettled by discussion of a possible reduction in the
company's share capital - totalling 14.4m shares with a nominal value of
DM720m (Dollars 464.5m), worth DM2.65bn at yesterday's share price -
followed by a rights issue.
'This would have a huge negative psychological impact,' said Ms Lynn
Reinhardt, a Frankfurt-based analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK
investment house.
Metallgesellschaft also said on Monday that operating profits could exceed
DM100m this financial year. However, analysts said the outlook remained too
uncertain for clear investment judgments.
'There is at least one further step to go on the smelter side,' said Mr
Michael Geiger, an analyst at NatWest Securities in London. 'It's not yet
the end of the total restructuring and potential disappointments.'
The company's announcement this week also referred to an agreement in
principle for the sale of the company's headquarters in central Frankfurt.
It is believed that Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, the two main creditor
banks, are negotiating to acquire the property - unofficially estimated as
being worth some DM750m - to use or sell for development.
This solution would speed up the sale, expected to be concluded this
calendar year, and enable the proceeds to be booked retrospectively to
Metallgesellschaft's accounts for the year ending September 1994.
Also awaiting conclusion is the sale or placement of the 47 per cent of
Kolbenschmidt, the motor components manufacturer. Talks are taking place
with Dana of the US and T&amp;N of the UK.

FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: NYSE firms incur Dollars 404m
deficit in second term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The New York Stock Exchange said yesterday that member firms which do
business with the public lost Dollars 404m after tax in the second quarter,
a sharp decline from last time's Dollars 1.5bn profit and the Dollars 852m
profit recorded in the first three months of this year.
The results were achieved on total revenues of Dollars 16.4bn, down from
Dollars 17.9bn a year ago. For the first six months, NYSE member firms
earned an after-tax profit of Dollars 448m, compared with Dollars 3bn in the
first half of 1993.
The data, which cover the big Wall Street firms' domestic activities, are
the latest illustration of how rising US interest rates have disrupted
financial markets and undermined earnings in US securities.
The losses were not evenly distributed. Of the 302 firms which reported to
the exchange, 200 made a total profit of Dollars 888m. Those gains, however,
were overshadowed by losses at 102 firms totalling Dollars 1.5bn.
The NYSE members' results are not broken down, but they do include revenue
from sources, such as proprietary trading, interest and commissions.
Based on the individual results of the biggest publicly-quoted securities
houses, the worst-hit area has been trading, where falling bond prices and
volatile currency markets have left many big firms nursing losses in recent
months.
Wall Street has also suffered from a sharp downturn in underwriting
activity, as rising interest rates and falling share prices have deterred
many US and foreign companies from raising funds on the capital markets.
However, these results do not show up in the NYSE figures.
In spite of the problems at the big stockbroking firms, the NYSE's
'specialists', those which exclusively buy and sell shares for brokers and
their clients on the exchange's trading floor, were still profitable during
the second quarter, earning Dollars 29m after tax.

FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Kodak sells diagnostic business
to J&amp;J for Dollars 1bn
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eastman Kodak, the US photographic products group, continued along the
disposal trail yesterday with the Dollars 1.01bn sale of its clinical
diagnostics business to the US healthcare company Johnson &amp; Johnson.
With the sale of its drugs businesses to Sanofi of France and SmithKline
Beecham of the UK, the deal brings Kodak's total disposals since June to
more than Dollars 5.6bn.
The latest sale takes in Kodak's chemistry-based and immuno-assay
diagnostics products, which had sales last year of Dollars 535m.
As part of its strategy of concentrating on traditional strengths under new
chairman Mr George Fisher, Kodak is retaining its X-ray film based
diagnostic business, in which it claims world leadership.
Johnson &amp; Johnson, which two weeks ago announced the Dollars 924m
acquisition of the Neutrogena skin and hair care company, said the deal
would make it the world's third-biggest diagnostics company after Abbott
Laboratories of the US and Boehringer Mannheim of Germany.
Its existing sales of diagnostics are just over Dollars 700m. The Kodak
business, which includes the diagnostics business of the UK company
Amersham, acquired in 1990, would continue to be run as a separate company
on acquisition, Johnson &amp; Johnson said.
Mr Ralph Larsen, Johnson &amp; Johnson chairman, said that 'the acquisition will
add important positions in clinical chemistry and immuno-diagnostics to our
existing diagnostics business, and significantly broaden our customer base
in the hospital central diagnostic laboratories'.
The company said the deal would leap-frog it into third position worldwide,
ahead of Bayer of Germany.
The sale brings Kodak close to the end of its ambitious disposal programme
announced in May this year.
The final business to be sold is L &amp; F Products, encompassing household
products such as disinfectants and DIY products such as wood finishers.
Kodak announced last month that it would sell the two parts of L &amp; F
separately, having been unable to reach its target price - estimated by
outsiders at around Dollars 2bn - for the business as a whole.
The latest deal also brings Kodak close to its target of eliminating debt.

FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Dutch dredger in share placement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boskalis Westminster, the Dutch dredging group, placed around 18 per cent of
its outstanding share capital with Dutch and international institutional
investors yesterday, in a transaction worth nearly Fl 190m (Dollars 109m).
Boskalis Trust, a company trust which owns about half of the group's shares,
sold slightly more than 4.56m shares to ABN Amro, the Dutch bank, which sold
them on to investors at Fl 40.80 each.
The shares carry full rights to the 1994 dividend.
The company, which describes itself as the world's largest dredger, said the
sale was designed to widen ownership of the shares. The sale also brings to
an end the workforce's indirect stake in the company's share capital,
Boskalis said.
Trading in Boskalis shares on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange was suspended
briefly before the transaction was announced.
When trading resumed, the shares fell to close at Fl 41.20 compared with a
pre-suspension price of Fl 41.90, but this remained well above the private
placement price.

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ahold, the Dutch-based food retailing group, posted a strong 23.5 per cent
rise in second-quarter net profit, encouraging it to raise its forecast for
full-year earnings.
The company, which now expects 1994 results to be 'considerably' higher than
in 1993, said net profit rose to Fl 94.2m (Dollars 53.8m) from Fl 76.2m a
year earlier. Turnover was up 8.3 per cent at Fl 6.87bn.
The quarterly increase takes net profit for the first half to Fl 204.5m, up
18.6 per cent and at the top end of analysts' forecasts. The company's
shares rose by 2.3 per cent to close up Fl 1.10 at Fl 48.40.
Ahold attributed the sharp rise to higher operating results and a lower tax
burden. 'We consider the course of events in the first half, and
particularly the second quarter, as highly satisfactory and as indicative of
the developments for the entire year,' Mr Cees van der Hoeven, company
president, said.
Previously, Ahold, which generates about half of its turnover through six
supermarket chains in the US, had forecast only that profits would continue
to rise in 1994.
Ahold's dual-currency interim dividend was raised to Fl 0.19 and Dollars
0.09 per share, from Fl 0.17 and Dollars 0.06 last year.
In the US, operating profit rose 15.9 per cent to Dollars 45.1m in the
second quarter, outstripping the 9.9 per cent increase in Dutch operating
results, to Fl 68.2m.
Total operating profit increased by 15.2 per cent to Fl 171.6m. This
includes a 37.5 per cent increase in European results, to Fl 20.7m, mainly
reflecting buoyant profits in Portugal.
Mr van der Hoeven said Ahold's activities in the Czech Republic were
gradually approaching break-even. This point should be reached by the end of
1994, he said.

DG-Bank is to buy a majority stake in Deutsche Verkehrs-Bank from Deutsche
Bahn, the German railway, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
Deutsche Bahn said it had reached a basic agreement on the transaction with
DG-Bank but their supervisory boards and the Federal Cartels Office had yet
to approve the deal.
The railway declined to reveal the purchase price. It owns 65.1 per cent of
Deutsche Verkehrs-Bank, and is selling 50.1 per cent to DG Bank and 5 per
cent to Sparda, the German savings and loans group.
Deutsche Bahn will retain a 10 per cent stake in Deutsche Verkehrs-Bank, the
railway said. The Sparda group already owns 10 per cent of Deutsche
Verkehrs-Bank. The remaining shares are widely distributed.
'The sale is part of the railway's policy of concentrating on its core
business,' a Deutsche Bahn official said.
Deutsche Verkehrs-Bank mainly operates foreign exchange booths at railway
stations.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vodafone Group, the mobile phone operator, has bought a 20 per cent share in
Astec, an independent provider of mobile telephone services.
Vodafone's shares were unaffected by the news, remaining at 200p.
The total consideration is Pounds 16m, including loan capital advanced to
Astec.
Based in Cheltenham with 150 staff, Astec has some 50,000 subscribers
nationwide which use both the Vodafone and Cellnet works.
Vodafone and Cellnet, in which British Telecom has a stake, are the main
players in the UK cellular telephone market.
They are facing sharply increased competition following the launch of
Mercury's One-to-One cellular network and Hutchison Telecom's Orange
service.
Mr Gerry Whent, Vodafone's chief executive, said the reason for the
investment lay in Astec's skills in the provision of cellular telephone
services.
He said: 'We have always regarded service provision as one of the
cornerstones of the UK mobile telephone market.'
Mobile telephony is proving increasingly popular in the UK, with cellular
telephone connections moving ahead of traditional fixed telephone links.

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Manweb cuts workforce by 11% to save Pounds
20m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manweb is cutting 500 jobs, 11 per cent of its workforce, in a move expected
to save the Cheshire-based electricity distributor and supplier up to Pounds
20m a year by 1997.
The group is the second in the sector to respond to the regulator's recent
price review with job cuts and a wide-ranging restructuring.
Norweb announced just two weeks ago that it would shed 1,200 jobs over five
years. Most of the regional electricity companies are expected to announce
similar action to cut costs over the coming weeks.
Manweb said it would shed the jobs over three years with 400 coming from a
fundamental restructuring of the electricity distribution business into
three centralised divisions. The remaining losses would result from
efficiency savings.
Mr John Roberts, chief executive, said the restructuring was not simply a
knee-jerk reaction to the price review, which was widely perceived to have
hit Manweb harder than some of the other regional electricity companies.
'It is the next logical stage in the development of our strategy,' he said.
The first stage had been to cut costs afterprivatisation and the second was
to improve the quality. This, the third stage, was about holding the
improved quality and cutting costs yet further.
Analysts welcomed the cost cuts, which were largely as expected, with some
reservations. 'The regulator said they were a high-cost producer, so they
have got to take costs out,' said one. 'But even after this they will still
be among the highest cost producers.'
Mr Roberts said Manweb would continue to seek savings through innovation and
restructuring. Although cost cutting would get more difficult over time,
Manweb had no intention of developing an alternate earnings stream by
diversifying into non-regulated businesses.
He was confident Manweb would be able to continue delivering dividend growth
above the sector average for some time. Analysts speculated that Manweb
could deliver growth of up to 9 per cent above inflation, and still retain
cover of about two times by 2000.
The shares moved ahead by 2.4 per cent to 851p in a relatively flat sector.
Northern Ireland Electricity has called on staff in its Shop Electric
showrooms to accept new terms, including pay cuts averaging 6.1 per cent -
up to 14 per cent for some - or face the loss of 400 jobs.

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Success through an innovative approach -
SPL has carved itself a niche in the satellite communications business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High winds and hurricanes test satellite communications to the limit. Four
years ago, winds gusting to 70 mph and more raked a north American ground
station owned by Teleglobe, Canada's overseas telecommunica-tions utility.
Two of the three 100ft dish antennae had to be lashed down for safety. The
third featured controls built by Signal Processors, a small UK technology
company. Blown about so badly that the dish was forced onto its brake stops,
the system nevertheless returned the antenna to the right track and data
flow from the satellite continued uninterrupted.
Mr Robin Smith-Saville, co-founder and chairman of Signal Processors, tells
this story with relish as an example of European success in an industry
dominated by large US corporations.
Based on the Cambridge science park, the company is in two principal
businesses: ground station antennae controllers - electronics which ensure
the antenna is pointing at the satellite - and satellite data modems. Both
are key to the satellite communications business. Modems are the electronic
black boxes which translate analogue data signals into digital form and
vice-versa. Comstream of San Diego is one of the biggest players in this
market; SPL reckons to be the largest European satellite modem manufacturer.
Privately held, the company will turn over about Dollars 3.5m (Pounds 2.25m)
this year, 35 per cent up on last year. Mr Geoffrey Walker, finance
director, expects a further 30 per cent growth next year.
SPL was founded in 1982 as a spin-out from Cambridge Consultants by Mr
Smith-Saville, Mr Martin Smith, now technical director, and Mr Roscoe
Turner, production director. It has been profitable for 10 of its 12 years'
trading, albeit at a low level. Its growth has been steady, if unexciting.
Mr Smith-Saville blames chiefly the dollar exchange rate. The recession in
Europe has not helped.
It numbers among its customers AT&amp;T, British Telecommunications, the
European Space Agency, and both the US and UK defence departments. In 1993,
for example, it managed a Dollars 1.5m project for AT&amp;T involving the
retrofitting of five 32m and two 11m dishes with its controllers.
Now the company is looking ahead to the burgeoning data broadcasting market
 -customers in this field include financial dealers who want information
gathered across the world on their desks.
If there are growth opportunities ahead, there is no lack of competition. In
its core antennae control business, SPL faces stiffening opposition from
large US manufacturers like Comsat-RSI, which are beginning to offer antenna
and controller as an integrated package. This presents SPL with a marketing
problem. It supplies its controller as a plug-in unit about the size of a
large suitcase, but it does not manufacture dishes or the motors which move
them.
It points, however, to its record of innovation. It pioneered antennae
controls which track satellites through space by modelling their orbit
mathematically. American competitors are now beginning to use the same
technique: 'But we have 14 years of software development behind us,' Mr
Smith-Saville says.
SPL was the first to develop a low-cost method of correcting the errors
which inevitably creep into satellite transmissions; now it has developed a
printed circuit board which slips inside a conventional personal computer
turning it, when an antenna is added, into a satellite data receiver.
SPL's catalogue is a combination of 'me-first' products and 'me-cheapest'.
It has developed an antenna control system for the important VSAT (very
small aperture terminal) market, which is being used increasingly to provide
two-way communications services to businesses in the US and Europe. The SPL
system costs Dollars 5,000 while providing the facilities found in Dollars
25,000 systems.
Mr Smith-Saville does not believe the company will have to find new money to
fund what he sees as its expected growth and exploitation of the data
broadcasting market.
He is trying to balance equity, overdraft and medium term loans. Initial
funds of Pounds 75,000 were boosted in 1988 by a business development loan
from NatWest of Pounds 250,000 which will be repaid next month. A second
loan of the same amount was drawn earlier this year.
In 1989 MTI, a venture capital fund, bought 33 per cent of the equity for
Pounds 400,000. The investment has a fixed life and it is now time for MTI
to exit and close the fund.
Mr Smith-Saville says he is open minded about the future. It is entirely
possible that MTI could reinvest in the company; going public is another
option.
He favours, however, the replacement of MTI by a new investor who could help
to improve SPL's access to the satellite communications marketplace. It
would not necessarily be a UK company.

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 24m investment for Croda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Croda International, the chemicals and coatings group, yesterday announced
plans to invest Pounds 24m to exploit rising demand for its speciality
chemicals.
Buoyant chemical sales underpinned a 5 per cent increase in first half
pre-tax profits from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 19.5m, and contributed to
increased turnover of Pounds 210m (Pounds 191m) in the six months to June
30.
Underlying profits rose by 12.7 per cent after stripping out last year's
Pounds 1.2m pension credit, but the group admitted it had been hit by
capacity constraints at some plants.
In a bid to overcome those problems, it plans to spend Pounds 15m on new
facilities at its UK plants and invest sizeable sums on developing its
Pennsylvania factory in the US.
Shares in the group, however, fell 9p to 377p yesterday after the group said
its strong chemicals performance had been dented by losses in its cosmetics
and toiletries business and heavy environmental costs in the coatings
division.
'The cosmetics business has done badly and taken the shine off the results,'
said Mr Michael Valentine, chairman.
The division, which manufactures products such as lipstick and nail varnish,
reported trading losses of Pounds 500,000 - a Pounds 1m drop on last year's
profit.
Coatings, meanwhile, reported reduced profits of Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 2.4m)
following the disposal last year of most of its printing ink business and
rising environmental costs in the US.
The two divisions were, however, overshadowed by progress in the chemicals
business, which saw trading profits rise from Pounds 18.7m to Pounds 21.6m.
Mr Valentine said the improvement reflected rising demand for personal care
ingredients and the group's success in overcoming higher raw material
prices.
The Pounds 24m investment programme is expected to increase the dominance of
the chemicals business, and the group said it would sell US inks operations
and the cosmetics business 'at the right price'.
Earnings per share rose from 9.4p to 9.9p, and the interim dividend is 3.1p
(2.95p).
COMMENT
If Croda can resolve its capacity constraints rapidly, it should be set fair
for some time to come. The chemicals business, relying mostly on natural
ingredients, has weathered raw material price increases related to flooding
last year. With the cost of its ingredients set to fall, it should be able
to push up its margins in a buoyant market. With volume sales at the highest
level since 1974, however, the picture should be rosier than it is. Parts of
the coatings division and the entire cosmetics business are up for sale, but
finding buyers has not proved easy. Their weak prospects are expected to
hold full year profits at Pounds 42m and the shares - on a forward multiple
of 18 - look pricey. But they remain below the chemical sector average and
are probably worth holding on to for existing investors.

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Wimpey recovers to Pounds 7.5m -
Housebuilding profits increase fourfold as construction stays tough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wimpey, Britain's biggest housebuilder, yesterday confirmed that the
housebuilding revival was still on track as it announced a recovery from a
restated Pounds 200,000 loss to a Pounds 7.5m pre-tax profit in the first
six months of this year.
The company, which is paying a maintained interim dividend of 2p, held out
the prospect of an increase in the 3.25p final dividend at the end of the
year when it said it would review payments to shareholders 'in the light of
trading prospects for 1995'.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, said these had improved for most of the
group's businesses although conditions in construction remained very tough.
Earnings per share in the first half rose from a loss of 0.28p to 1.36p,
requiring a transfer from reserves of Pounds 2.3m to meet the cost of the
interim dividend. The company traditionally earns the bulk of its profits in
the second half.
Wimpey has changed its policy and now charges interest against discontinued
businesses against current profits rather than including them in provisions.
This led to last year's Pounds 1.1m first half profit being restated as a
Pounds 200,000 loss.
Mr Dwyer said that UK house sales, after faltering earlier in the summer,
had risen by about a quarter in August compared with the corresponding month
last year.
'This gives us confidence that the autumn, the second most important selling
season of the year, will be quite reasonable,' he said. Other housebuilders
have also reported a revival in sales in August.
Mr Dwyer said that a lull in the market had occurred at the same time as the
World Cup soccer finals. Even so, UK house sales since May were about 15 per
cent higher on average compared with the corresponding period last year.
The group expects UK completions for the year to increase to 8,000 from
6,936 in 1993.
Housebuilding profits, including the US and Australia, rose fourfold in the
first half, from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 10.5m, on turnover increased from
Pounds 195m to Pounds 246m.
Profits from the UK and US minerals division fell from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds
100,000 but this masked an improvement of more than Pounds 2m as last year's
profits included Pounds 6.7m of planning fees from the group's former waste
business.
The performance of the minerals division, boosted by price and volume sales
increases in the UK, was even more impressive given that US results were
depressed by severe winter weather, said Mr Dwyer. Construction profits, had
fallen from Pounds 5.8m to Pounds 3.8m. although the bottom may have been
reached in this market.
COMMENT
Margins on UK house sales should reach double figures by the end of this
year, leaving little scope for further improvement given the company's
emphasis on first time buyers. Wimpey should therefore be regarded as a
construction and minerals recovery play, where Tarmac, scores more heavily.
Wimpey's strength is in its superior balance sheet, where gearing is
expected to be only 15 per cent by the year end. Profits of Pounds 48m and
Pounds 68m would put the group on prospective multiples of 17 and almost 13,
indicating that it still has much to do before it closes the gap with its
rival.

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Macro 4 up at Pounds 11.2m despite subdued
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Macro 4, the systems software group whose products run on IBM or
IBM-compatible mainframe and mid-range computers, managed a 6.8 per cent
increase in full year pre-tax profits despite 'subdued' trading conditions
and lower interest receipts.
Pre-tax profits advanced to Pounds 11.2m in the year to June 30, up from
Pounds 10.5m the previous year on turnover which increased by a modest 4.8
per cent to Pounds 24.4m (Pounds 23.3m).
Earnings per share increased by 8.6 per cent to 34.2p (31.5p) and a final
dividend of 11.98p (11.48p) is proposed making a total of 20p (17.75p) for
the year.
Despite the profit improvement and 12.7 per cent increase in full year
dividend the shares, which have fallen sharply from a high of 723p in early
February, closed 12p lower at 543p reflecting the market's concerns about
the state of the mainframe software market.
Mr Terry Kelly, chairman, said the group had continued to make progress,
with turnover and contributions to group profit increasing in all the
group's established subsidiaries, albeit by small amounts in some countries.
He said the group was continuing to invest in its newer range of systems
software designed to run on IBM's AS/400 mid-range computers. This 'places
the group in a sound position for future growth'.
However Mr Kelly acknowledged that the software market was 'at a bit of a
crossroads' with customers uncertain about the future role of mainframe and
mid-range machines as the trend towards client/server computing gathers
pace.
'I continue to be cautious regarding the coming year's prospects against a
background of continuing change within the computer user enviroment, change
which is, partly at least, responsible for the continued rate of contract
cancellations within the group,' he said.
Nevertheless he predicted that the group would remain cash generative and
produce a further modest improvement in profits this year.
Operating profits increased by 8.1 per cent to Pounds 9.97m (Pounds 9.22m).
Interest earnings slipped to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 1.28m) reflecting lower
interest rates partly offset by interest on a delayed tax payment.
Group cash balances increased by Pounds 2.69m to Pounds 22.4m at the end of
June although both year-end figures benefitted from tax payments which were
delayed. On a comparable basis cash balances increased from Pounds 18.2m to
Pounds 21.3m.

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Depressed Europe leaves Scholl lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Scholl, the healthcare products group, fell more than 10 per cent
yesterday as the company reported lower interim profits and the imminent
completion of a business review.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 fell from Pounds 11.7m to
Pounds 9.96m, hit by depressed trading in Europe, higher spending on
promotion and interest payments. The shares closed at 164, off 20.
Mr Neil Franchino, chief executive, said the group had been studying changes
to its structure for the past 12 months, but had not fine-tuned the costs.
Definitive plans would be announced within three months.
There would be strong benefits from the restructuring in the medium term, he
said. 'The changes won't cost a dramatic amount and will be financed
internally.' They would be aimed at increasing efficiency and could involve
closing some of the 150 shops.
Total turnover improved from Pounds 94.1m to Pounds 100.1m, helped by growth
in south east Asia and sales from Septivon in France and Scholl Japan, both
acquired last year.
However, sales in the UK and Europe were down by Pounds 2.7m, and currency
movements cost a further Pounds 1.6m. In the UK, which accounts for about 20
per cent of turnover, sales to the trade were 3 per cent down following
consolidation of distribution networks.
Promotional spending increased from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 9.5m in the half,
mainly to give the two acquisitions a good start.
Interest payable was Pounds 327,000, compared with previous interest
receivable of Pounds 512,000.
Earnings per share fell from 8.2p to 9.8p. The interim dividend is unchanged
at 2.6p.

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Rec buy-backs gather momentum
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rush by regional electricity companies to buy back their own shares
before dealing restrictions take effect at the end of the month gathered
pace yesterday with purchases by South Wales Electric and South Western
Electricity.
South Wales bought 500,000 shares, representing 0.5 per cent of its equity,
for Pounds 4.1m at a price of 815p per share.
The company is widely expected to follow this first purchase with further
buying before the closed period takes effect at the end of the month.
South Western Electricity bought 750,000 shares at 805p, bringing the total
acquired in the last week to 4.25m shares, or 3.4 per cent of the share
capital.
The recs have the power to buy back up to 10 per cent of the issued share
capital. This would enhance both earnings and the potential to increase
dividends.
'If people are paying anything more than lip service to improving
shareholders' value, they ought to buy back the maximum allowable,' said one
industry source.
However, their opportunities are limited by restrictions on buying in
advance of results or prior to any announcement on the future of the
National Grid, in which they are shareholders.
Shares in South Wales jumped 21p to 815p after the announcement. South
Western shares fell by 7p to 803p.

The publicly quoted Portuguese group accounts for half of Portugal's

The Irish group is taking a 6.6 per cent stake, which is being paid for with
new shares in Independent Newspapers worth IRPounds 5.9m.
Mr Liam Healey, chief executive of Independent Newspapers, said the company
had made the investment because it believed that the Portuguese economy was

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Medeva rose 23p to 151p yesterday after the acquisitive
pharmaceuticals company announced a 70 per cent increased in first half
profits.
The improvement was fuelled mainly by increased US demand for
methylphenidate, its treatment for hyperactivity in children and young
adults, which helped lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 13m to Pounds 22.1m.
Sales of the drug more than doubled and accounted for 60 per cent of the
increase in turnover from Pounds 80.1m to Pounds 107m in the six months to
June 30.
Mr Bill Bogie, chief executive, declined to reveal the proportion of profits
derived from methylphenidate, but he warned that its recent growth was
unlikely to be sustained in the second half.
Mr Bernard Taylor, chairman, said the rising sales and share price showed
the group had recovered from its problems last year, when a profits warning
sent the shares tumbling from 216p to 116p.
The company also announced that Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, the co-founder and
former managing director, was standing down as a non-executive director.
Mr Gowrie-Smith said he had decided to resign because of possible conflicts
of interests with his activities at Brightstone, the consultancy firm formed
with Mr David Lees, his long-time business partner, who resigned as Medeva's
finance director in March.
Earnings per share rose 29 per cent to 4.9p (3.8p) and the interim dividend
has been increased to 1.1p (0.9p) with a scrip alternative.
COMMENT
Medeva is in danger of developing a dependency. Methylphenidate is thought
to have accounted for the bulk of profit increase, and it already has a
rival in the US, its main market. Having made a partial recovery from last
year's profits warning debacle, further acquisitions could also be a little
hasty as it has not yet fully bedded down its existing products and
infiltrated important markets such as Italy. Nevertheless, seasonal sales of
its respiratory and asthma products should lift full-year profits to about
Pounds 58m. The shares are pretty inexpensive on a forward multiple of about
11, but Medeva has lot to prove.

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Burford Holdings more than doubles to
Pounds 5.12m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Burford Holdings, the acquisitive property group, yesterday reported interim
pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 1.93m to Pounds 5.12m. The
company also announced the issue of a Pounds 100m mortgage debenture,
primarily to pay for the Trocadero Centre in London's West End, which was
purchased over the summer.
Turnover showed a similar increase, rising from Pounds 5.11m in the same
period last year to Pounds 11.5m. Earnings per share advanced by a more
modest 34 per cent to 1.6p (1.19p), reflecting February's Pounds 100m rights
issue.
Besides the Trocadero deal, which cost Pounds 94m, Burford spent Pounds 103m
on a commercial property portfolio from Ladbroke during the first half.
Together with some smaller deals, Burford estimates that its annualised
rental roll will be Pounds 35m at the end of the financial year, double its
expectation a year ago. Rental income at the interim stage had increased
from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 10.8m.
Mr Nigel Wray, chairman, said the refurbishment of the Trocadero, on one of
Europe's busiest thoroughfares at Piccadilly Circus, would begin as soon as
the company took possession later this month.
The company intended to strengthen the centre's entertainment facilities,
taking advantage of its vacant 120,000 sq ft of office space. He estimated
the refurbishment cost at about Pounds 7m.
The debenture would allow the company to continue its strategy of pursuing
moderately large investment opportunities, he added.
An interim dividend of 0.75p, against 0.65p, was declared.

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Peek profits show 57% rise to Pounds 3.26m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance from the field data systems division helped Peek, whose
principal business is traffic systems, to lift interim profits sharply.
They rose to Pounds 3.26m for the six months to June, from Pounds 2.07m in
the corresponding period last year, when there was a loss of Pounds 554,000
on the disposal of discontinued businesses.
Total group sales grew by 28 per cent, from Pounds 44.3m to Pounds 56.6m.
Mr Allen Standley, chief executive, said that the field data division had
benefited from improving markets and wider acceptance of the company's newer
products, including the Husky hand-held computer.
Net cash totalled Pounds 158,000 in the period, compared with net borrowings
of Pounds 1.9m in the year-earlier period. Interest payable was Pounds
11,000, compared with Pounds 194,000 received previously. Earnings per share
improved from 1.11p to 1.75p. The interim dividend is unchanged at 1.05p.

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: New cars boost Appleyard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'A healthier market', especially in new cars, helped Appleyard, the
Yorkshire motor dealer, lift pre-tax profits 61 per cent in the first half.
The rise from Pounds 2.61m to Pounds 4.2m was also underpinned by a sharp
increase in the operating profits contribution to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds
545,000) from a 50-50 joint venture with Barclays on the contract hire side.
Group turnover rose 42 per cent to Pounds 251m (Pounds 177.2m), including
Pounds 27m from acquisitions.
Mr John Atkin, business development director, said that, excluding
acquisitions, the group's sale of new vehicles was up 20 per cent, against a
14 per cent rise in the national market. The sale of used units grew 15 per
cent to about 10,500.
In the period, the group spent Pounds 18.3m on acquisitions, having raised
Pounds 16.4m in a September 1993 rights issue. It now has 94 franchises -
including five marques new to the group - on 62 sites.
Earnings advanced to 4.5p (3.7p) per share and the interim dividend is 2.9p
(2.6p).

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Wates City drops down to Pounds 1.3m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The slow recovery in the commercial property market continued to exact a
toll on Wates City of London Properties, which yesterday reported an interim
pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.3m against a profit of Pounds 900,000.
The company attributed part of the fall to charging rather than capitalising
interest in its associated companies, where losses increased from Pounds
159,000 to Pounds 1.9m.
Operating profits for the six months to end June dropped 51 per cent to
Pounds 2.79m (Pounds 5.68m). The loss per share came out at 1.01p, compared
with earnings of 0.43p.
Again, no interim dividend was recommended and the board said it did not
expect to pay one for the full year.
Mr John Nettleton, managing director, said the downturn was a result of the
company's strategy of selling its income producing properties in favour of
keeping its development interests.
'We continue to believe that there will be a strong upturn in the property
cycle when our policies will be vindicated.' He added that several large
developments would begin producing rental income over the next 12 months.

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Greene King sells Morland stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greene King, the East Anglian brewer, has sold for Pounds 28.7m its 28.8 per
cent stake in Morland, the Thames Valley brewer it failed to acquire in
1992.
Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, bought the 6.23m shares for 460p a share and
placed them with institutions. Greene King had paid an average of 450p a
share for them during the abortive bid, with the bulk coming from the
Whitbread Investment Company.
Greene King will book an exceptional profit of Pounds 600,000 before
expenses but it had already taken a Pounds 2.7m charge for the bid costs in
its 1992 results. It will use the proceeds to cut its debt to Pounds 66m
from Pounds 95m. Gearing will fall by 10 percentage points to 30 per cent.
Greene King was attracted by Morland's pub estate in the Thames Valley. It
also hoped to close Morland's Abingdon brewery and use the site as a
distribution centre for its own beers such as Abbott and IPA.

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Promotions help Iceland to Pounds 32m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Iceland's shares jumped 14 per cent to 165p yesterday as the frozen and
chilled food retailer announced a 10 per cent increase in the interim
dividend and a 7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 32.1m.
Helped by strong promotional activity and new stores, sales advanced 12 per
cent to Pounds 621.5m for the 26 weeks to July 2. The payout was increased
from 1.2p to 1.32p. Earnings per share rose 6 per cent to 7.67p.
Mr Malcom Walker, chairman and chief executive, said the 'Great Iceland
Giveaway' - in which the group offered free food with certain purchases -
had helped to return like-for-like sales growth in a fiercely competitive
sector.
At one stage during the first six months, weekly like-for-like sales had
been down 4 per cent, Mr Walker said. At the same time, customers were
spending some 3 per cent less per visit, about Pounds 6.70p per basket.
While the spend had not improved, promotional activity helped Iceland finish
the first half with an overall 0.5 per cent increase in like-for-like sales
volumes. Food sales were running approximately 1.5 per cent ahead of last
year. The promotions had an adverse effect on operating margins which
slipped from 5.9 per cent to 5.6 per cent.
The bulk of the growth in turnover came from new stores, which saw a 14.2
per cent increase in food sales. The group has opened 35 new stores, with a
further 20 planned to bring the total to 705.
Mr Walker said that although customers continued to search for value, the
price pressures which have afflicted the food retailing sector for the last
two years were expected to ease in the second half. Although competition
would remain intense,
Mr Walker was confident that Iceland's role as a second-stop shop would
protect it from the worst of the competition. 'The supermarkets might be
reaching saturation, but we have identified 1,500 sites we can trade from,'
he said. 'Saturation is not a word in our vocabulary.'
COMMENT
This was a decidedly more subdued Malcolm Walker than has been seen in the
past. For all his insistence that the bloodletting between superstores does
not affect Iceland, the group has introduced attention-grabbing promotions
and commissioned market research to look into declines in volume. Yet the
company has nevertheless delivered the goods. That may be why the shares,
which have languished in recent months, moved ahead so strongly. Forecasts
of Pounds 70m pre-tax this year make the shares look pretty cheap on a
prospective p/e of about 11. While there may be a little upside left on the
back of these results, longer-term questions over the durability of
promotion-led sales gains and the company's discount retailing strategy are
likely to overhang the stock.

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: More jobs go at Central as Carlton
restructures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carlton Communications moved to integrate its Central Television acquisition
more closely - a restructuring that will cost a further 180 jobs and lead to
savings of more than Pounds 15m a year.
Carlton UK Television, the UK's largest commercial television company,
broadcasting to 20m people in London and the Midlands, was formed following
the Pounds 758m acquisition of Central last November.
The programming commissioning and production arms of Carlton and Central
will be integrated into Carlton UK Productions, under Mr Paul Jackson as
managing director. Broadcasting services will combine under Mr Clive Jones.
The ITV company also confirmed its intention to move its Birmingham
broadcasting centre to a new purpose-designed building in the city and to
transfer some operations to its Nottingham studios.
The restructuring will lead to 40 job losses by the end of this year. When
the new Birmingham centre is in operation about 90 jobs will be transferred
to Nottingham, and the overall workforce will be reduced by a further 140.
Union representatives said yesterday they were 'devasted' by the further job
losses - 50 jobs had already gone since the merger.
Ten years ago Central alone had 2,400 staff. When the present restructuring
is complete, the combined Carlton UK Television will have a total of about
1,000 although a large number of independent producers are employed
indirectly.
Mr Andy Allan, chief executive of Carlton UK Television, said the
integration and job losses were necessary to create the sort of company that
could compete not just in Europe but in the rest of the world.
From January 1, Birmingham-based Central Television and London-based Carlton
Television will be known as Central Broadcasting and Carlton Broadcasting.
'Strong regional boards and management will ensure that regional services,
including news and regional programmes, will maintain their distinctive
character and be of the highest quality,' Mr Allan said. The aim was to
increase the amount of production at the Nottingham studios, not just making
programmes for ITV but eventually for other countries. He added: 'If the BBC
is interested we would be delighted to talk to them.'
At the time of the takeover it was suggested that Pounds 10m-Pounds 15m a
year could be saved by rationalisation. Mr Allan expects savings of Pounds
15m a year.
Mr Mark Beilby, media analyst at SG Warburg, said that with little real
growth in advertising revenues expected over the longer term, ITV companies
had to cut costs.
Carlton's share price gained 12p to close at 857p.

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Stagecoach buys two London bus companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stagecoach Holdings, the acquisitive Perth-based bus operator, has succeeded
in buying two of the 10 companies that run London's red buses for Pounds
25.3m in cash.
Stagecoach, which was floated on the Stock Exchange in April last year and
had originally put in bids for all the London bus companies, said it had
acquired East London Bus and Coach Company for Pounds 15.8m and South East
London and Kent Bus Company for Pounds 9.5m. In the year to March 31 the two
companies had a combined turnover of Pounds 82.7m and posted pre-tax profits
of Pounds 2.4m.
The acquisitions are expected to enhance group earnings in the current
financial year as improvements in the operating margins of the new
subsidiaries and the benefits of economies of scale are achieved.
East London and Selkent, the second and third London bus companies to be
privatised, will represent slightly more than a fifth of Stagecoach's
expanded turnover and will give Stagecoach a significant presence in the
London region which represents about 20 per cent of the UK market. Following
the acquisitions the enlarged group will have around 11.5 per cent of the UK
bus market.
Commenting on the two acquisitions Mr Brian Souter, executive chairman,
said: 'In the period since flotation we have set out a clear acquisition
strategy designed to provide shareholders with longer-term enhanced
earnings. Stagecoach was previously concentrated on provincial operations
but we have succeeded this year in building a major presence in large urban
areas where we believe our proven operating strategies can succeed equally
well.'

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Davis Service Group 29% ahead to Pounds
10.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Davis Service Group increased by 29 per cent from Pounds
8.47m to Pounds 10.9m for the first six months of the year as the business
services company reported a moderate upturn in trading.
The headline figure was boosted by profits of Pounds 783,000 arising from a
property disposal. Without this, the rise in underlying profits was 19 per
cent, similar to the increase in turnover, which improved to Pounds 151m
(Pounds 128m).
Earnings per share of 7.51p compared with 6.51p last time, although adjusted
for the property disposal, earnings were 6.74p, a rise of 3.5 per cent.
A good proportion of the increase came from a full interim contribution from
HSS Hire Services, which Davis bought 15 months ago.
Mr George Boyle, finance director, said that otherwise the company's
divisions had seen only a gradual improvement and that the recovery remained
patchy.
Elliott Group, which provides portable building units, showed sales slightly
ahead, and Mr Boyle said the division's steel manufacturing capacity was
being strengthened. In the linen hire business, firmer occupancy rates in
the London hotel market were offset by weakness in the provinces. Workwear
was also proving a tough environment.
The support services arm, which undertakes cleaning and catering contracts,
was affected by margin pressure, due mainly to government employment
legislation in the public service sector.
The interim dividend is increased to 2.87p (2.73p). Mr Boyle said he
anticipated last year's final dividend of 7.98p would be maintained.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at CRH continued their strong growth in the six months to
June 30 advancing 60 per cent from IPounds 25.1m to IPounds 40.1m (Pounds
39.7m) on turnover up 12 per cent at IPounds 725.7m, against IPounds 647.3m.
The Dublin-based construction and building materials group said an increase
in construction activity in the company's core market in the Irish Republic,
compared with a depressed first half of 1993, had contributed to the growth.
They were further helped by improvements in the UK and increased
contributions from two US associates in the tempered glass and masonry
industries.
Mr Tony Barry, chief executive, expected more moderate growth in the second
half, but said 'we do expect a good improvement in the results for the year
as a whole'.
There was net interest receivable of IPounds 129,000, against charges of
IPounds 2.77m, reflecting the benefits of last year's rights issue and
strong cash flow. The period end debt:equity ratio was 19.6 per cent.
Mr Jack Hayes, managing director for finance and development, said that by
the end of the year the group would have IPounds 100m in cash for
acquisitions, which could be enhanced by borrowing up to IPounds 200m.
Earnings per share rose 37 per cent to 9.26p (6.77p), and the interim
dividend is raised to 2.5p (2.27p).
Dublin analysts anticipate full-year profits of between IPounds 110m and
IPounds 115m for earnings of 25p-27p per share, giving a prospective p/e of
about 15.

Shares in Telspec fell 18p to 285p yesterday in spite of the manufacturer of
advanced telecommunications equipment announcing a 30 per cent increase in
first-half pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.94m to Pounds 2.52m.
Mr Garth Riley, chief executive, said the market may have reacted to a
mention of a margin squeeze, and stressed that this referred only to a small
proportion of the recently floated group's business. Manufacturing costs
were being reduced, with the benefits expected by the year-end.
The profits rise was struck on turnover 61 per cent ahead at Pounds 13.7m
(Pounds 8.53m). The maiden interim is 1.2p, payable from earnings of 5.49p,
a rise of 17 per cent.

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Boddington declines to Pounds 13m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boddington Group, the pubs, hotels, nursing homes and drink distributor,
reported pre-tax profits for the 26 weeks to July 3 almost halved at Pounds
13.1m, against Pounds 25.2m which included a gain of Pounds 13m from the
sale of its stake in Devenish.
However underlying profits grew by 6.4 per cent despite patchy recovery in
consumer spending.
'All the economic indicators are set in the right direction,' said Mr Denis
Cassidy, chairman, but cautious consumers still needed to justify to
themselves 'the need to spend'.
Trading profits rose to Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 14.7m) with all four divisions
increasing profits. Turnover rose 14 per cent to Pounds 129m (Pounds
113.2m).
Its estate of 477 pubs, all in north west England, produced a 4 per cent
rise in profits to Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 10.3m) on turnover up 6.5 per cent
to Pounds 53.5m (Pounds 50.3m). Managed pubs showed an 12 per cent rise but
tenanted profits were down 11.3 per cent on 8.2 per cent fewer pubs.
Beer volumes in its regional market fell 3.9 per cent with the fall in the
managed pubs limited to 2.1 per cent on a like-for-like basis while tenanted
pub volumes fell 4.9 per cent.
Liquid Assets, the drinks distributor, lifted profits by only 5.8 per cent
to Pounds 3.04m (Pounds 2.87m) despite a 20 per cent increase in turnover to
Pounds 59m (Pounds 49.2m).
Leisure hotels rose 51 per cent to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 1.13m) on turnover up
30 per cent at Pounds 9.4m (Pounds 7.18m). Healthcare, consisting of 17
nursing homes in the south east of England, reported a 3.4 per cent increase
to Pounds 1.66m (Pounds 1.6m) on turnover ahead 10 per cent at Pounds 7.1m
(Pounds 6.41m).
The interim dividend is lifted to 3.15p (2.86p) from earnings per share of
8.4p (18.5p) or 8.2p (7.6p) excluding property and exceptional items.
COMMENT
Boddington produced the good results expected from a group which had spotted
early the benefits of selling its regional brewery to concentrate on pub
retailing. But two weaknesses are apparent, tenanted pubs and drinks
wholesaling. It must move faster to switch to higher margin managed pubs and
to expand its estate. On the wholesaling side, it has yet to show that
volume growth can bring economies of scale. On full-year pre-tax profit
forecasts of Pounds 30.5m and eps of 19.4p, the shares are on a prospective
multiple of about 15. That is a fair rating until Boddington makes more of
its pubs and distribution businesses.

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: IMI shows 4% rise to Pounds 37m - Sales
volumes up 8% and order books at strongest level for 4 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong demand for replacement copper plumbing systems in eastern Germany and
a surge in orders for betting chips from new casinos set up on indian
reservations following the discovery of a quirk in US gaming laws both
helped IMI, the Birmingham-based international engineering group, lift first
half profits.
Pre-tax profits grew by 4 per cent to Pounds 37m in the six months to June
30, up from Pounds 35.5m a year earlier, but were held back by an Pounds
8.3m trading loss on the Redwood International computer software company,
which was finally sold in July. Turnover grew by 5 per cent to Pounds 574m
(Pounds 546m) including Pounds 6m (Pounds 17m) from discontinued operations.
Operating profits from continuing operations increased by 20 per cent from
Pounds 40.6m to Pounds 48.7m reflecting an improved performance by the
group's four core businesses as the benefits of internal cost reduction and
the broadly based improvement in trading conditions came through.
The interim dividend, which has been held steady for the past four years, is
being increased from 4.2p to 4.4p reflecting the board's growing confidence
in the outlook. Earnings per share rose to 7.3p (6.9p).
Mr Gary Allen, chief executive, said order books were at their strongest
level for four years, and sales volumes had risen by an average 8 per cent
across the group. However, he added that prices had not shown any real
improvement.
Mr Allen said demand for copper plumbing materials in eastern Germany
following re-unification was the main factor behind an 8 per cent growth in
sales to Pounds 165m and 26 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds
14.1m in the building products division.
Copper was considered a strategic material by the former communist regime in
East Germany, and the plumbing systems installed in most buildings were made
of inferior steel. He said IMI had sent six copper plumbing system display
trucks into eastern Germany 'as soon as the Berlin Wall came down', and
orders had come flooding in.
Although several businesses in the special engineering division continued to
make small losses in the first half, the division as a whole lifted sales by
4 per cent to Pounds 125m and profits by 6 per cent to Pounds 8.6m.
Among the operations contributing to the improvement were IMI's two casino
tokens businesses in the US, where demand for chips has soared recently
following the discovery of a loophole in Federal law which has enabled
Indian reservations across the nation to set up gaming establishments.
COMMENT
With almost 70 per cent of its sales overseas and leading market positions
in many of its businesses, IMI should benefit as the world-wide recovery
gathers pace. However, IMI's well-deserved quality rating is already
reflected in its share price. Headline pre-tax profits this year will be
depressed by a Pounds 35m exceptional charge related to the sale of the
computer software operations. Excluding this, profits of about Pounds 85m
look possible, producing earnings of about 16.7p. Hold.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Kodak furthers disposal plan with diagnostics sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eastman Kodak, the US photographic products group, took a further step in
its disposal programme yesterday selling its clinical diagnostics business
to the US healthcare company Johnson &amp; Johnson for Dollars 1bn (Pounds
600m). With the sale of its drugs businesses to Sanofi of France and
SmithKline Beecham of the UK, the deal brings Kodak's total disposals since
June to more than Dollars 5.6bn.
The sale to Johnson &amp; Johnson includes Kodak's chemistry-based and
immunoassay diagnostics products, which had sales last year of Dollars 535m.
Kodak's retention of its X-ray film-based diagnostic business, in which it
claims world leadership, is in line with the strategy announced in May by
new chairman, Mr George Fisher, of concentrating on its traditional
strengths.
Johnson &amp; Johnson, which two weeks ago announced the Dollars 924m
acquisition of the Neutrogena skin and hair care company, said the deal
would make it the world's third biggest diagnostics company after Abbott
Laboratories of the US and Boehringer Mannheim of Germany.
Its existing sales of diagnostics are just over Dollars 700m. The Kodak
business, which includes the diagnostics business of the UK company Amersham
acquired in 1990, would continue to be run as a separate company, Johnson &amp;
Johnson said.
Mr Ralph Larsen, Johnson &amp; Johnson's chairman, said 'the acquisition will
add important positions in clinical chemistry and immunodiagnostics to our
existing diagnostics business and significantly broaden our customer base in
the hospital central diagnostic laboratories'. The company said the deal
would leapfrog it into third position worldwide ahead of Bayer of Germany.
The sale nearly completes Kodak's ambitious disposal programme. The final
business to be sold is L &amp; F Products, consisting of household goods, such
as disinfectants, and DIY products such as wood finishers. Kodak announced
last month it would sell the two parts of L &amp; F separately, having been
unable to reach its target price - estimated at around Dollars 2bn - for the
business as a whole.
The latest deal also brings Kodak close to its target of eliminating debt.
Group borrowings at the mid-year stood at Dollars 6.4bn, compared with the
Dollars 5.6bn of disposals announced or concluded since then. Kodak spent
Dollars 150m last month buying out its equal partnership in Qualex, the
photofinishing company.

FT  07 SEP 94 / LVMH enjoys the luxury of 35% profits advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The buoyant state of the luxury goods market was highlighted yesterday by
news that LVMH, one of the world's largest luxury businesses, increased net
profits by 35 per cent during the first half of 1994.
LVMH, which will publish full interim figures later this month, confirmed
that net profits had risen to FFr1.26bn (Pounds 151m) in six months, from
FFr935m in the same period of 1993. Sales rose 20 per cent to FFr12bn.
The group affirmed that 'if current trends continue' it was on course to
achieve the target of 20 per cent net profits growth for the full year set
by Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman. Analysts are expecting slightly higher
figures.
LVMH, which has extensive interests across the luxury goods industry
including Hennessy Cognac, Moet et Chandon champagne, Louis Vuitton luggage
and Christian Dior cosmetics, has reported sluggish profits due to the
depressed state of the fashion and cosmetics markets, the crisis in the
champagne sector and the Japanese slowdown.
LVMH said that its first-half profits increase was due to a stronger
performance from all its interests and lower financial expenses.
Earlier this year LVMH announced that it was unravelling its
cross-shareholding agreement with Guinness, the UK drinks group,
significantly reducing its borrowings and cutting financial costs. Christian
Dior is expected to stage a capital increase to finance the Guinness
transaction.
Mr Arnault has made it clear that he plans to use LVMH's newfound financial
flexibility to increase its luxury interests. LVMH made its first
acquisition by taking control of Guerlain, the fragrance house in which it
held a minority stake.
However, Mr Arnault was foiled in his attempt to buy Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, the
Paris-based jewellers, by stiff competition from Chanel, the French fashion
house, and Van Cleef was eventually taken off the market.
Mr Arnault is now searching for other investment opportunities. 'From a
financial perspective LVMH should be able to make a major acquisition,' said
Ms Joseline Gaudino, an analyst at the Societe Generale securities house in
Paris. 'The only problem could be a shortage of suitable targets.'

FT  07 SEP 94 / Bowater expects further recovery: Raw material price rises
passed on to customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bowater, the packaging and printing group, yesterday reported a recovery in
important markets and said higher raw materials prices were largely being
passed on to customers.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 rose 2 per cent from Pounds
103m to Pounds 105m - at the top end of expectations. Excluding exceptional
gains of Pounds 8m last year, and a loss on disposals of Pounds 4m this
year, the underlying increase was from Pounds 95m to Pounds 109m, a rise of
15 per cent.
Mr David Lyon, chief executive, said an upturn in demand in the US, UK and
some continental European markets had led to price rises for Bowater's main
raw materials - paper, and resin for plastics - of about 20 per cent between
April and June.
'We have generally been able to pass these increases on to customers,
although there are some timing delays,' Mr Lyon said.
He said raw materials prices were expected to increase by up to another 10
per cent by December, with shortages of some commodities forecast, although
prices remained about 25 per cent below their peak in the late 1980s. This
was likely to lead to a further year-on-year improvement in the second half.
The positive outlook - which contrasted strongly with Bowater's downbeat
assessment of future trends after last year's strong results - lifted
Bowater's shares 19p to 492p.
Mr Lyon said Bowater's acquisition of healthcare packaging manufacturers DRG
and Cope Allman in 1992, and of Specialty Coatings International last year,
had given it critical mass in several target markets with strong growth
opportunities.
Group turnover rose 14 per cent from Pounds 1.02bn to Pounds 1.16bn, with
the group operating margin up from 8.8 per cent to a record 9.2 per cent.
After a difficult second half last year, the packaging and print businesses
staged a recovery with sales up 3 per cent to Pounds 580.7m, and operating
profits of Pounds 49.8m against last year's Pounds 50.9m. Cosmetic packaging
performed well in the UK and continental Europe, but food packaging prices
remained under pressure from price competition among food retailers.
Healthcare packaging enjoyed 'buoyant' demand.
The acquisition of SCI greatly increased the contribution from Bowater's
coated products division, with sales up from Pounds 194.2m to Pounds 280.3m,
and operating profits from Pounds 22.5m to Pounds 32.7m.
Both sales and profits also increased in Bowater's building and engineering
businesses, and its tissue business in Australia.
Earnings per share, including exceptional items, increased from 12.3p to
14.2p, and the interim dividend is raised by 9 per cent from 5.3p to 5.8p.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Quality is the key to a more upbeat tempo: German piano
makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the heart of east Berlin the sounds of students practising their scales
in the Hans Eisler music school are relished by Mr Karl Schulze, manager of
Bechstein, one of Germany's oldest piano manufacturers based in nearby
Moritzplatz.
'The number of students now learning the piano at the music schools in
Germany has increased from 100,000 in 1991 to over 140,000. People are
rediscovering the piano again. This is good news for Bechstein,' he said.
A year ago Bechstein was holding talks with lquidators. Its losses had
exceeded DM1.5m (Pounds 622,000) and the banks were unwilling to extend
fresh credit. There were even fears that Zimmermann, the east German piano
maker which Bechstein had purchased, wuld to the wall as well. 'I wanted to
save Bechstein, revive its reputation and make the marriage with Zimmermann
work. So I decided one of the ways to raise cash and get out of debt was to
sell 6,500 sq m of our land here near Checkpoint Charlie to the Berlin
Senate for DM30m,' said Mr Schulze.
His restructuring also cut the workforce and he went to the Czech Republic
to obtain parts for his pianos. 'By working with the Czechs, I reckon my
labour costs have been reduced by 20 per cent. Our order books are full
until the middle of 1995,' said Mr Schulze. If all goes well combined
turnover this year will total DM28m and Mr Schulze expects a profit of about
DM1.5m.
Bechstein's turnround from virtual collapse has been keenly watched by
Germany's other long-established piano makers. All of them - Bluthner in
Leipzig, Schimmel in Braunschweig and Steinway in Hamburg - were hit by the
downturn, yet most agree that they are emerging from the recession much
quicker than they had expected. This is despite a fall in total, worldwide
piano sales from a peak of 1.1m in the mid-1980s to about 600,000 in the
early 1990s as well as competition from Japan and cheaper models,
particularly from China and eastern Europe.
'We went through a bad patch during the recession,' said Mr Wilhelm Nikolaus
Schimmel, whose family company was founded in 1885 and today has a 11 per
cent share of the German market. 'In the mid-1980s, we had an annual
turnover of DM65m, two-thirds earned from exports. But sales fell to about
DM47m in the early 1990s, and we were making heavy losses. We had to
restructure.
'Three years ago, we employed about 520 people. Today, we have 260 people on
our books. But we made one major decision. We were not going to compromise
our quality. I think this has paid off.'
Germany's piano manufacturers unanimously agree that their industry would
not have recovered had it gone downmarket. 'The competition from south-east
Asia has been really tough,' said Mr Schimmel. 'Japan is our major
competitor. But we had to respond by continuing to provide high quality and
design. This is what we trade on. This has what has underpinned Germany's
piano tradition. If you change that you undermine your own reputation.'
Mr Ingbert Bluthner-Haessler, manager of Bluthner, who was catapulted into
the market economy after being subsidised by the east German state for more
than four decades, said the recession made the industry more aware of
marketing. 'We had to hit home the message that we are producing quality,'
he said. This year, Bluthner, which exports 50 per cent of its 400 uprights
and grands, expects to lift its turnover 10 per cent to DM5m which will
allow it to enter the black.
Despite the revival in piano-playing, not everyone can afford a Bluthner
upright, which costs between DM16,000 and DM23,000, or a Steinway, whose
grand pianos start at DM61,900. Mr Roger Willson, managing director of the
UK-based Whelpdale, Maxwell and Codd, the piano manufacturers and the sole
importer of Bluthner, said: 'The recession had the effect of changing the
habits of our customers. Parents either bought a cheap Chinese piano - if
you call Pounds 1,200 cheap - or opted for the second-hand market for
quality pianos in which demand has increased sharply.'
Over the past year, Mr Willson has noticed that people are returning to the
quality piano market again. 'I reckon worldwide sales will increase by about
4 per cent this year.'
Steinway, which occupies the top end of the market, is surprised at the pace
of recovery. 'The recession forced us to cut back. And music schools had
their budgets reduced - so they were not buying pianos. But we did not
expect to come out of the recession so fast,' said Ms Barbara Ascherfeld,
Steinway's spokeswoman.
About half of Steinway's production turnover of 1,200 units (1,000 grands
and 200 uprights) is earmarked for music conservatories and the rest for
individuals. About 30 per cent of its grand pianos are exported to Japan.
Steinway recently made a special contract with its trade union so that its
employees can work longer hours to meet demand.
Mr Schimmel and his colleagues believe the German piano industry and the
west European market is finally stabilising. 'But,' warned Mr Schimmel, 'the
lesson we learned from the recession is that you cannot make short-cuts with
quality.'

FT  07 SEP 94 / Tiphook chairman's bank got Pounds 3.5m fee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Institutional shareholders are unhappy over a Pounds 3.5m payment which
Tiphook, the debt-laden transport leasing company, made to a merchant bank
boutique in which Tiphook's chairman, Mr Rupert Hambro, has an indirect
shareholding.
Mr Hambro, a non-executive director of Tiphook since 1990, took over as
interim non-executive chairman of the group in March and will step down this
month, although he will continue as non-executive director.
His family company has a minority stake in JO Hambro Magan, which received
its fee for advising on the recent Pounds 722m disposal of Tiphook's
containers division, which saved the group from collapse. A leading
institutional fund manager said that, as a matter of policy, he did not like
to see non-executives involved in a financial advisory role.
Tiphook said Mr Hambro had no executive role in Hambro Magan, which had
fully earned its fee by introducing the group to the eventual buyer of the
container division, Transamerica, the US financial services group. The whole
transaction had been supervised by the group's non-executive directors,
merchants bankers and lawyers.
Mr Alton Irby, deputy chairman of Hambro Magan, said: 'We identified
Transamerica, brought the deal to the table and negotiated one hell of a
price. At least for now, we've saved the company. In one way, one wonders if
we got enough.'
Mr Hambro, who was paid Pounds 62,000 by Tiphook last year, has already been
at the centre of controversy in his role as chairman of Tiphook's
remuneration committee. There was an outcry last month when the group's
annual report revealed that directors saw their total remuneration increase
from Pounds 3.96m to Pounds 6.41m in the year to April, a period for which
Tiphook reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 331m.
Mr Robert Montague, Tiphook's chief executive, was the highest paid of the
directors, with a bonus of Pounds 250,000 helping push his total pay from
Pounds 1.17m to Pounds 1.34m. Mr Montague, who recently stepped down as
chairman, agreed to a substantial cut in pay from an Pounds 816,000 package
down to Pounds 200,000 as of March, but will receive a total minimum bonus
of Pounds 250,000 over the next five years.
The bonus was to recompense Mr Montague for his agreement that he would not
compete with Transamerica's container operations for five years.

FT  07 SEP 94 / EU monetary head sees hope on single currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EU member states have turned a corner and could realistically consider the
prospect of a single European currency, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, president
of the European Monetary Institute, forerunner of the European Central Bank,
declared yesterday.
Falling interest rates, low inflation and close monetary co-ordination among
EU central banks had substantially reduced currency instability, Mr
Lamfalussy said. In one or two years, there could be some 'pleasant
surprises' among countries aspiring to join the planned economic and
monetary union.
Mr Lamfalussy's upbeat remarks to the European economic and social committee
in Brussels came ahead of weekend talks among EU finance ministers in
Lindau, near Lake Constance. They will discuss the procedures for dealing
with big national budget deficits, one of the most important tests for Emu
membership.
Germany, which holds the rotating EU presidency, has signalled it is unhappy
with the European Commission recommendation to exclude Ireland from the
'excessive deficits' rules. Luxembourg, the only country which meets
Maastricht's deficit criteria, is also excluded.
The Commission supports a generous interpretation of the debt rules because
Ireland has in recent years held its annual budget deficit within the
Maastricht target of 3 per cent of gross domestic product. But Germany does
not want to create a precedent that will make it easier for countries with
bigger debt problems, such as Italy, to become full Emu members.
The EU's secretive monetary committee, meeting in Brussels yesterday, was
said to have approved Commission proposals for deficit reduction procedures
by EU states other than Luxembourg and Ireland.
Mr Lamfalussy steered clear of the controversy over proposals to create a
'hard core' of five nations committed to faster integration in the EU.
Germany's ruling Christian Democrat party and its CSU coalition partner
proposed last week that the hard core should consist of France, Germany,
Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.
Mr Lamfalussy stressed it was too soon to predict which EU members would be
ready to form a monetary union by 1997 or 1999, the two dates named in the
Maastricht treaty.
Without mentioning Italy, Spain or the UK, the EMI president paid tribute to
countries which seemed to have escaped 'the infernal cycle of inflation',
even while allowing their currencies to depreciate during the monetary
upheaval of 1992-93.

FT  07 SEP 94 / US ousts Japan as world's most competitive economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After eight years as undisputed economic pace-setter, Japan has lost its
ranking as the world's most competitive economy to the US. It has slipped to
third place behindSingapore, according to the latest World Competitiveness
Report published today.
Three other East Asian nations - Hong Kong, Malaysia and Taiwan - make the
top 20 while Italy, with the world's fifth largest economy, comes an
ignominious 32nd out of 41 nations assessed - behind Turkey, Colombia and
Indonesia.
Germany, the highest rated European country, comes fifth. Britain ranks 14th
in the global league but moves up two places in the European rankings (from
11th to 9th) on the back of deregulation moves and economic recovery.
The rankings, which attempt to measure the ability of a country to
outperform its competitors, are compiled annually by the Swiss-based
International Institute for Management Development and the World Economic
Forum.
This is the first time industrialised and developing countries have been
included in the same scoreboard, although China and Russia were excluded for
lack of comparable information.
Countries are ranked in eight areas, such as domestic economic strength,
infrastructure and management, on the basis of 381 criteria which range from
computers per capita to alcohol and drug abuse.
The US resurgence is attributed principally to the strong and early economic
recovery, coupled with high scores on entrepreneurship, internationalisation
and 'financial vitality'.
Japan's ranking has been hit by the worst economic recession in decades and
increasing disaffection with the political system, although it continues to
lead in management and technology.
Second-placed Singapore is rated first for the extent to which government
policies help competitiveness, and for the quality of its labour force.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Mexican banking chief sought on fraud charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican government has ordered the arrest on fraud charges of Mr Carlos
Cabal Peniche, head of one of the country's largest banking groups and of
Del Monte Fresh Produce, the international fruit company once owned by Polly
Peck International.
The finance ministry immediately took over Mr Cabal's Banca Cremi and Banco
Union - which have combined assets equivalent to nearly Dollars 11bn (Pounds
7bn) and deposits of Dollars 9.8bn - and their subsidiaries, including a
foreign exchange house, and leasing and factoring companies. It said the
alleged irregularities suspected so far did not affect the banks' ability to
meet their obligations, but all depositors would be protected under the law.
A government official said yesterday that Mr Cabal had not yet been
apprehended, with reports circulating that he may be in Europe.
However, the official said that four of Mr Cabal's senior executives had
been arrested, and about 10 people connected to the case were in custody.
The first casualty of the charges against Mr Cabal may be his intended
purchase of Del Monte Foods, the San Francisco-based canned food company. In
June, Mr Cabal and his investor group agreed to buy the US company for
Dollars 277m in cash and about Dollars 700m in debt. However, according to
Mexican government officials, the transaction has not yet been
Mr Pedro Aspe, Mexico's finance minister, announced on Monday night that the
attorney-general's office had issued an arrest warrant against Mr Cabal,
accusing him of having illegally lent himself money from his banks to
acquire various business interests.
Mr Cabal is being sued by Eastbrook, a now defunct US trading house, which
alleges that he defrauded it of Dollars 70m of loans. Mr Cabal has
vigorously denied these allegations.

FT  07 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Bowater
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For once, Bowater's managers were able to present a set of results without
shooting themselves in the foot. Last time they reported, their unjustified
pessimism about prospects for margins overwhelmed a good set of figures,
sending shares tumbling 8 per cent on the day. In fact, fears that the
company would prove incapable of passing on increases in raw material prices
to customers proved, on the whole, unfounded. With hindsight, managers'
undue gloom destroyed a premium rating.
Yesterday, the group lacked adequate ammunition to inflict such self-damage.
The results, above expectations, contained scarcely a blemish. Margins
reached a record high, and the company achieved double digit growth in
sales, operating profits and pre-tax results. An upbeat chairman's statement
completed the rosy package.
Equally significant in yesterday's 4 per cent rise in the shares - against a
falling market - was the management's indication that Bowater had reached a
strategic turning point. The company, managers indicated, will no longer
expand through acquisition. Growth will be achieved organically and through
cost-cutting. There may be some bolt-on acquisitions, but these are likely
to be small and not to require equity funding. Given Bowater's privileged
position in fast-growing niches and the absence of additional equity issues
in the foreseeable future, the shares should prove attractive for those
looking to switch out of cyclical companies and into growth stocks.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bulls of the Irish equity market are proclaiming that the latest rise in
share prices has little to do with the IRA ceasefire. The economic
implications of peace - if it lasts - would be complex. A recovery in
Northern Ireland asset values and increased tourism in the Republic are
among the possible outcomes. While there has been no rush to upgrade
earnings forecasts, though, the ceasefire has certainly been good for
sentiment and helped focus the attention of international investors on
favourable fundamentals.
While the Irish economy was stronger than most of its European peers through
the recession, growth was driven by multinationals using Ireland as a base
for exports. Yesterday's results from CRH, the building materials company,
show that domestic demand is now starting to take over. Against that
background the market looks cheap on a multiple of around 12 times this
year's forecast earnings - even allowing for the large proportion of
lowly-rated financial stocks in the market's capitalisation.
The lingering doubt is that a market driven higher by international capital
flows must also be vulnerable to a sudden change of sentiment. A further
appreciation of the Irish punt - perhaps beyond parity with sterling - would
raise fears about competitiveness. Still, if peace in Northern Ireland gives
international investors one less reason to take fright, the market's latest
gains should be sustainable.

FT  07 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: UK contracting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A note of despair tends to enter the voices of contracting industry bosses
when they are asked when margins will improve. Mr Joe Dwyer of Wimpey put on
a brave face yesterday but the best he could offer was that his contracting
business would hold its own this year. Last year it made just Pounds 2.2m on
turnover of Pounds 658.8m. The bind is that even if volumes pick up, there
will still be too many companies bidding for the available work.
The recession has caused few casualties among leading companies, with
several of the near-dead kept alive by their bankers. The barriers to entry
are also low, thanks to the system of up-front payments which means
contractors operate with negative capital employed. Although it requires
enormous cultural change it is in the interests of the large contractors to
encourage a trend away from high up-front payments, so squeezing out
financially weaker rivals. Some customers, including the government, are
making modest moves in this direction.
Strong balance sheets will be more important still if the hoped-for growth
in privately-funded infrastructure projects materialises. Raising the
barriers to entry could then lead to consolidation in what is, by
international standards, a fragmented industry. Some observers even dream of
the day when UK utilities will follow the continental model and acquire
large contractors. Given the utilities' dismal record in contracting, the
City would view this with alarm. Yet without some structural change the
prospects for the UK contracting industry are grim.

FT  07 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Developing Kodak
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Kodak is coming into focus. Yesterday's Dollars 1bn disposal of its
clinical diagnostics business is the group's third billion dollar-plus asset
sale since June. Not only has Mr George Fisher, who took Kodak's helm last
December, exceeded investor expectations by the speed with which he has shed
its peripheral health care businesses; the prices achieved are also
surprisingly good - no doubt helped by the current worldwide enthusiasm for
acquisitions in the sector. So far, disposals have brought in Dollars 5.6bn.
L&amp;F, Kodak's household products arm, is expected to realise a further
Dollars 2bn. The total proceeds will virtually wipe out Kodak's debt.
Mr Fisher now faces an even tougher challenge - expanding Kodak's core
imaging business. That will determine whether it can shake off its
reputation as a technological giant that lost its way. Mr Fisher, who in his
time has worked at AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories as well as running Motorola, has
sketched out an exciting vision of how Kodak can apply its photographic
expertise in emerging multimedia markets.
Undoubtedly, image processing has a bright future, and Kodak has developed
strong technological positions in fields such as image processing software
and digital sensors. But the company has a poor track record in bringing
such inventions to market. It also faces stiff competition, particularly
from Japanese groups such as Fuji, Canon and Sony. The real test will be
whether Kodak can put together alliances that provide it with access to
additional technologies and markets. But given Mr Fisher's proven ability to
spring favourable surprises, he deserves the benefit of the doubt.

Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute,

among EU central banks had substantially reduced currency instability, Mr

surprises' among countries aspiring to join the planned economic and
monetary union.
Mr Lamfalussy's upbeat remarks to the European economic and social committee
in Brussels came ahead of weekend talks among EU finance ministers. Their
meeting in Lindau, near Lake Constance, will discuss politically sensitive
procedures for dealing with big national budget deficits, one of the most
important tests for Emu membership.
Germany, which holds the rotating EU presidency, has signalled it is unhappy
with the European Commission recommendation to exclude Ireland from the
'excessive deficits' rules. Luxembourg, the only country which meets
Maastricht's deficit criteria, is also excluded.
The Commission supports a generous interpretation of the debt rules because
Ireland has in recent years held its annual budget deficit within the
Maastricht target of 3 per cent of gross domestic product. But Germany does
not want to create a precedent that will make it easier for countries with
bigger debt problems, such as Italy, to become full Emu members.
The EU's secretive monetary committee, meeting in Brussels yesterday, was
said to have approved Commission proposals for deficit reduction procedures
by EU states other than Luxembourg and Ireland.
Mr Lamfalussy steered clear of the controversy over proposals to create a
'hard core' of five nations committed to faster integration in the EU. The
ruling Christian Democrat party and its CSU coalition partner proposed last
week that the hard core should consist of France, Germany, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg.
France, Germany and the Benelux are often viewed as the most likely nucleus
of the planned monetary union. But Mr Lamfalussy stressed it was too soon to
predict which EU members would be ready to form a union by 1997 or 1999, the
two dates named in the treaty.
Without mentioning Italy, Spain or the UK, the EMI president paid tribute to
countries which seemed to have escaped 'the infernal cycle of inflation',
even while allowing their currencies to depreciate during the monetary
upheaval of 1992-93.
This turbulence, which led to the widening of fluctuation bands in the
European Monetary System in August 1992, appeared to be over, said Mr
Lamfalussy. However, he insisted that the wider EMS bands should be
preserved in order to defend currencies against speculative pressures.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Byte of the new bank managers: The rise of in-house
computers - rather than humans - as financial supervisors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They sit, gleaming and humming, on the trading floor of every large bank in
the world. They are consulted by traders before decisions are taken to buy
and sells bonds or shares. They trace curves plotting the price of options,
the financial contracts giving the right to buy and sell other securities.
They are 'black boxes', the high-powered computers that no large bank which
trades securities can now afford to be without.
Software 'models', run on these machines and used to analyse masses of data
to predict prices, now have a substantial impact on financial markets. By
telling banks which securities to buy and sell, at what price, they have
become the new masters of many trading floors. But they are now set for even
greater recognition. Central banks and other banking supervisors worldwide
are working on plans to allow banks to use their models to fix how much
capital they need to keep in reserve to support their trading.
The implications are large. By accepting the use of banks' own models in a
regulatory role, supervisors would be taking a big step towards a new form
of oversight. Instead of the traditional close, human, examination of
individual transactions, they would instead monitor the way in which banks
use computers to control risk. They would do so as part of new capital
requirements for trading activities.
The financial impact of these new rules could be enormous. Since 1988, when
the Basle Committee of international bank supervisors agreed the first
global standards on capital needed to back lending, banks have built up
stronger reserves. They have also cut the types of lending, such as loans to
companies, which are rated as requiring a lot of capital under the Basle
accord.
But the growth of banks' trading activities in the 1990s has been encouraged
by the fact that they are not yet required to allocate any capital to cover
the risks of trading in financial instruments. In practice the risk of
default on securities is low - so that under Basle rules only minimal
capital needs to be allocated. Yet banks risk losses from falls in the price
of securities - as they found to their cost this year when European interest
rates rose.
Supervisors have wanted to plug this gap since 1988. Their first effort to
do so came 18 months ago when the Basle group published its 'market risk'
proposals. Supervisors say that these could add up to 1 percentage point to
the average 8 per cent capital-to-assets ratio required for lending risks.
This would have required big UK banks alone to hold a total of Pounds 400m
more capital, and could lead to banks restricting some forms of trading.
The original Basle proposals provoked alarm among banks. Instead of using
what banks regarded as state of the art modelling methods, the Basle
supervisors proposed a set of pre-determined rules to calculate capital
requirements. Different products such as equities and bonds would be treated
separately. In the case of bonds - a complex area - banks would have to
allocate capital to cover their risk of loss in each of a set of 13
timeframes.
'The proposals came from an era when you added up positions on a piece of
paper,' says Mr Steven Hellinger, director of research at the State of New
York banking department. 'Banks had constructed ways (of using computers) to
measure risk at no small expense, and it seemed as if they would get no
recognition for that,' says Mr Mark Brickell, head of derivatives strategy
at US bank JP Morgan, which uses some of the most sophisticated computer
models.
Such models have developed through necessity. Because the pricing of
instruments such as financial derivatives - products that derive their value
from that of an underlying security or index - depends on mathematical
theory, banks have to use models to understand them.
Banks now use models to measure the total risk of loss in trading
portfolios. Mr Charles Taylor, executive director of the Group of 30, an
association of senior bankers, says that models can not only aggregate
different forms of risk but are 'much more analytically rigorous than the
old rules of thumb that bankers used to use'.
Such arguments lay behind the banks' objections to using the Basle formulae
instead of their computer models. They had two main complaints:
First, it would add to their costs. Although banks could rewrite software to
collect the data required by the Basle committee, it would not be simple.
Models add together the risks of different products, and give an immediate,
rounded picture of the total trading risk the bank is running. 'It is hard
to collect extra data that puts a portfolio into different boxes,' says one
supervisor.
Second, by treating all banks equally, it might discriminate against the
more sophisticated institutions. Banks argued that they would have to hold
less capital if they had better risk management methods. This argument was
received sympathetically by supervisors. 'Standards of sound practice are
moving forward all the time, and we want to encourage banks to be in the
front line,' says another bank supervisor.
These arguments persuaded the Basle committee to change its mind. At
meetings in March and June, it decided to examine whether banks could use
their own computer models as an alternative to the standard rules. The
difficulty for supervisors is to construct a framework for approving
computer models. If rival banks' models led to them allocating different
amounts of capital for the same trading activities, it would distort
competition. Banks might also be able to rig their models to ensure that
they needed less capital. A free-for-all of this kind would be very alarming
for supervisors.
Supervisors have now drawn up a draft set of rules with which models would
have to comply. This includes regulations on the number of years of past
market movements against which banks' portfolios would have to be tested.
Supervisors will shortly start testing models by running the same trading
pattern through each model, and seeing if they produce a similar capital
requirement. If they do not, the framework will be tightened.
There is no guarantee of success. The regulator which has come the closest
so far to allowing the use of models to measure risk is the Securities and
Futures Authority in the UK. But the SFA only allows models to translate
financial derivatives into bonds and equities with comparable risks. These
are then judged according to a set of rules similar to the original Basle
list. The latest Basle approach is more ambitious.
Allowing the comprehensive use of models envisaged by bank supervisors would
be tricky even if they were tried and tested. In practice, they are a recent
innovation, and are still being developed. It is not clear that they can
assess properly the risks of instruments such as options, the most complex
form of derivatives. Some supervisors say options will have to be treated
separately in new Basle proposals, which could undermine their coherence.
The supervisors are working against time. They would like to see common
capital standards not only for banks across the world, but for both banks
and securities firms. But capital requirements for European banks and
securities firms have been set in the European Union's capital adequacy
directive that will come into force in 1996. It could only be amended to fit
with the Basle framework before then.
But probably the greatest challenge for bank supervisors is to ensure that
they do not weaken management controls by allowing banks to use internal
models. 'It would be intolerable if a company started to market its models
as 'central bank approved',' says a supervisor. 'People get hooked on
mathematics, but the most important thing is that the management understands
what is going on.'
Mr Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, chairman of the Basle committee, admits there is
a danger that approval of banks' models will be misunderstood. 'If internal
models were accepted, it would not amount to a relaxation of supervisory
standards. If there is a misunderstanding about this, it will have to be
clarified,' he says. Black boxes already rule some bank trading floors;
supervisors will have to watch how their influence spreads.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Mr Berlusconi's looming deficit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When Silvio Berlusconi promised voters an 'Italian miracle' back in March,
resolving a fiscal crisis was probably not what he had in mind. But a
pain-free solution to Italy's structural debt problem would be just that.
The world's financial markets are not looking for a miracle, but their lack
of confidence will inflict its own pain if the government does not start
being similarly realistic.
The Italian cabinet yesterday began the process of agreeing the details of
the budget package it should present to parliament by the end of the month.
Judging by some of the recent public squabbles between ministers, the
negotiations over how to finalise the budget plan announced in July will not
be peaceful. But the mood outside, among financial investors, is not
tranquil either.
Investors' lack of faith in the Berlusconi government's fiscal resolve has
led to a steady rise in the gap between Italian and German long-term
government bond yields. Italian long rates, now around 12 per cent, are some
470 basis points higher than German ones, compared to a gap of just over 300
at the beginning of the year. Stock prices have caught the same malaise: the
Milan stock price index has fallen more than 8 per cent over the past three
months.
Italy, of course, is not the only country to have sparked financial market
jitters in recent months. Indeed, at first glance the distrust of the
markets seems overdone. The measures of fiscal retrenchment achieved by Mr
Berlusconi's predecessors helped make Italy the only country in the Group of
Seven, apart from Japan, to run a primary budget surplus in 1993. This meant
that revenue exceeded expenditure by some 2 per cent of GDP, before
deducting interest. Yet Italy's more profligate past, coupled with
recession, mean that over a fifth of total spending is taken up with such
payments, while the level of public debt, now the equivalent of more than
125 per cent of GDP, continues to rise.
Fiscal woes
It is not merely the size of Italy's debt problem that is concerning
observers. Nor is it the usual fear, that the government will look to
inflate away the debt. Inflation has been subdued in recent months, and
there is little to indicate that it will pick up in the near future. The
Bank of Italy sent its own signal that it would not allow monetisation of
the country's fiscal woes with its 'pre-emptive' interest rate increase on
August 11. The action had a dual target, Mr Berlusconi and the markets. It
certainly failed to reassure the latter: the lira promptly fell to further
record lows against the D-Mark. But this was largely because it is not clear
that the message to Mr Berlusconi has hit its mark.
Economic recovery
Though economic recovery is now well under way, its delay in arriving helped
to send the 1994 budget deficit above its target level of L145,000bn. This
means that the primary budget surplus for 1994 is likely to be well under 1
per cent of GDP, and the debt, once projected to stabilise in 1995, probably
will not reach its peak until the following year at the earliest, at 130 per
cent or more.
The government's long-awaited response to this, the deficit reduction plan
aimed at saving L45,000bn over 4 years, is of the right order to keep the
debt on its previously intended path. As yet, however, the plan has been
uncomfortably short on detail, and what detail there is hints at one-off
reactive measures, not the kind of systemic reform, above all of the bloated
state pension system, which long-run fiscal health will require.
It would take some selling by the prime minister to convince a majority of
the cabinet, and the public at large, of the need to return to these
questions so soon after the pain of the past two years. The recovery is
fragile, and Mr Berlusconi has made little effort to ready them for further
sacrifice. Indeed, on economic matters, he maintains much the same
determined stance against higher taxes that he used to win over voters on
the campaign trail.
The contradiction between what he must do and what he seems willing to do is
not lost on the financial markets. But falling investor confidence, by
pushing up interest rates, can only make the gap wider, and the need to
bridge it even more urgent.

A revolution is about to erupt in that normally placid market, dictionary
publishing. Chambers is publishing an Encyclopedic (sic) English Dictionary
combining both lexical and encyclopaedic information and definitions. So
'bonzer' (Australian slang meaning good) will nestle close to
'Bosnia-Herzegovina' (Serbo-Croat for oh what an awful mess).
It must surely rank as one of the fastest-to-go-out-of-date publications in

books about the British Broadcasting Corporation. A tantalising biography of
John Birt, the BBC's director-general, should soon arrive.
Meanwhile, those needing a quick fix could do worse than dip into The Battle
for the BBC by Steven Barnett and Andrew Curry, academic and former BBC
hack, respectively. No major surprises or scoops, just a respectable
analysis of the BBC's fate over the past decade.
But it has its nuggets. One delightful passage considers the Birtian
'method', employed when he ran features and current affairs at London
Weekend in the days when Weekend World was essential viewing.
Birt always required a fully drafted, painstakingly prepared script, right
down to knowing exactly what every interviewee would say, before any filming
happened. A good way of saving costly film stock, but obviously open to
abuse. Say the authors: 'This sometimes meant coaching (interviewees) in
what they were supposed to be saying even if  - as could happen - they had
changed their minds . . . There were reliable punters who would be prepared
to come on at short notice and deliver the agreed formula. Andrew Neil, then
industrial editor of The Economist, was one.'
So what can one expect from Neil's latest exploit, namely his programme for
Rupert Murdoch's Fox TV station entitled Full Disclosure?

Among the aristocrats, military generals and multi-millionaires who grace
the International Olympic Committee, Craig Reedie, a Glaswegian independent
financial adviser, constitutes a breath of fresh air.
Better known to sportsmen as the chairman of the British Olympic
Association, Reedie has just beaten runner-turned-MP Sebastian Coe to become
the second Briton on the IOC (alongside the Princess Royal), replacing Dame
Mary Glen Haig.
A law graduate from Glasgow University, Reedie has still been spending most
of his time working for DL Bloomer &amp; Partners, the firm he joined nearly 30
years ago, where he is now the partner flogging pension plans.
But his IOC election is good news not solely because it means one persuasive
salesman with less time to spend on your doorstep. More than most, he has
been sensitive to the fragmentation of British sports administration. With
his hugely enhanced kudos, he can surely win a more powerful role for the
BOA.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Personal View: Ulster - not an issue for compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By J. ENOCH POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peace is preferable to war, and persuasion is preferable to force. Those are
truisms which politicians need to respect - as much as, or more than, anyone
else. But those who voice doubts about so-called progress (progress to
what?) being made as a result of the IRA ceasefire are not breaking that
rule. They have solid reasons for their scepticism.
The beginning of wisdom in approaching Northern Ireland is to clear the mind
of everything conjured up by the term 'sectarian'.
If terminology there must be, it is not Catholics who are confronting
Protestants - on that basis one could make no sense of the voting pattern at
elections - but Irish nationalists confronting unionists. It is nationality,
not race, not religion, which is at stake.
On the issue of nationhood - that is, the question by whom are we to be
governed - there cannot be peace through compromise or negotiation, and in
Northern Ireland that is the great paramount issue. The British parliament
ruled Ireland - or, what comes to the same thing, Ireland was ruled under
the British parliament - from long before the parliamentary union of 1800
seated Irish representatives at Westminster. At the general election of 1918
the inhabitants of the north east of Ireland continued to send
representatives to parliament, while the inhabitants of the rest of the
island refused. The south voted itself out. Just as surely, the so-called
north, meaning the six counties of Ulster, voted to stay in.
That determination has not changed on either side since then. Listen to
Gerry Adams, and you hear that. Look at the voting at general elections in
Ulster, and you see that. The dispute is about nationality - about whom we
are to be governed by. That is why it can only be ended if one side or the
other is set upon giving way.
The impression that there has been a deal done in secret which has not yet
been revealed is thoroughly logical. The unionist people of Ulster are not
fools. They know that what is at issue is an absolute, and they treat those,
from the prime minister downwards, who talk about talks, about political
progress, and about compromise and concession, as necessarily dishonest.
Short of inventing a method whereby 'a man can serve two masters' there can
be no peace in Northern Ireland so long as the right of the majority to
their nationality is open to question. All down the years the perception
that the British government really wanted rid of Northern Ireland has
caused, maintained and fuelled violence.
The Irish nationalists are not fools any more than the unionists. They know
that the ballot'box will not put them into the nation to which they claim to
belong. Ergo alternative methods must be used to bring the desired result
about.
The true disturber of the peace in Northern Ireland is the stance of British
governments which have continually behaved as if they wished Ulster out of
the UK. The Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985 was a prime example. Under it,
Britain agreed to govern Northern Ireland only in combination with the Irish
Republic.
Certitude as to the future is the precondition of peaceable living in
Northern Ireland. The superficially hard-faced reassertion, in practical
terms, that Northern Ireland belongs for good and all to the UK is the sole
condition on which tranquility will return. In the end it may be hard to
foresee the UK formally withdrawing from the citizens of the north east of
Ireland the right they have possessed from time immemorial to be governed
within the UK.
The day is long past for looking for a wheeze to disguise or to deny that
right. That way lies more bloodshed and not less.

IRA last week is finely judged. The prime minister's insistence on a
copper-bottomed guarantee that violence has been permanently renounced is
quite understandable. This is not a matter of mere semantics. As the
Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, has intimated, the use of
the word 'permanent' is of less importance than the desirability of
extracting an undertaking from the military wing of Sinn Fein that it does
not intend to take up arms again. Anything less would feed the suspicions of
Ulster Unionists.
The anxieties of Irish nationalist politicians are all the other way. Rush
to embrace Mr Gerry Adams, their actions suggest, or the peace will be lost.
The president of Sinn Fein was seen by many only a week ago as the public
face of a two-headed organisation steeped in blood. Now the world is asked
to regard him as the man who talked the IRA into laying down its weapons.
The Irish view, reflected in Washington, appears to be that that historic
decision must be rewarded by at least the appearance of political momentum,
or the conflict may be reignited.
Extraordinary scenes
Whatever its merits, this argument can be the only explanation of
yesterday's extraordinary scenes in Dublin, when Mr Albert Reynolds welcomed
Mr Adams, along with Mr John Hume, to discuss preparations for a 'National
Forum for Peace and Reconciliation'. The Irish prime minister is undoubtedly
devoted to ending the violence. So is Mr Hume, who as leader of Ulster's
Social Democratic and Labour party has risked a great deal to bring the
IRA/Sinn Fein into democratic politics. As to Mr Adams's commitment, the
jury is still out.
In short, yesterday's apparent rift between London and Dublin need not
damage the prospects for lasting peace. It could indeed be helpful. Nothing
said by Dublin or Mr Adams will persuade the terrorists on the 'loyalist'
side to cease their murderous activities; what the British government says
or does could be decisive. Each government must address its own set of
intransigents according to its own circumstances.
The British way is, rightly, to avoid euphoria within the first few days of
an IRA announcement. Mr Major may be at odds with the ultra-unionists within
his own party, but he has the support of Mr Tony Blair, who has moved Labour
away from its pro-nationalist tilt, and, for the Liberal Democrats, their
spokesman Lord Holme. Backed by the two principal opposition parties, and
his own cabinet, he should be able to resist the blandishments of
well-meaning peacemakers in the US and Ireland.
Self-determination
Optimists may therefore regard the events of the past few days as
constructive, provided that the terms of the Irish-British declaration
issued at Downing Street last December are not breached. The essence of that
important document is that the right to self-determination of the people of
Ulster is recognised.
On this page Mr Enoch Powell writes of a conflict of nationalities; the
declaration stands as a guarantee that the people of the six counties will
be ruled under the British crown unless a majority of them freely consent to
a change. In those circumstances there will be a united Ireland; otherwise
not. If Sinn Fein rejects this, its entry into the democratic process will
not be permanent.
Perhaps both sides, nationalist and unionist, need further coaxing before
they will accept the merits of the declaration. This will require much
talking. Fortunately, there is much that could be talked about.
In the spirit of the Anglo-Irish agreement concluded by the then Mrs
Margaret Thatcher, there is the prospect of allowing the people of Ulster to
govern themselves, while reassuring the Catholic community that the old
Protestant ascendancy would not be restored. In today's language, what is
required is a series of agreements that would construct a relationship of
variable geometry. An elected executive in Belfast could negotiate
cross-border arrangements with Dublin. Both could do political business with
London. The possibilities could be limitless. The risk is a collapse of the
peace; the potential reward a permanent end to a long nightmare.

FT  07 SEP 94 / False alarm in Cairo: Women's education, not ideology, is
key to population control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While doing voluntary service as a teenager in French-speaking Africa, I
shocked a Senegalese friend, a primary school teacher, by urging on him the
virtues of contraception. 'Faut pas empecher les gosses de naitre, wai],' he
expostulated: You mustn't stop kids being born. (Wai], an all-purpose
vernacular exclamation, added emphasis to his statement.)
A Moslem, though by no means a fundamentalist, my friend had unwittingly
given a succinct summary of Catholic doctrine. I had trouble with it then,
and I have trouble with it now. I've always thought the Catholic Church has
a better case on abortion than most liberals and feminists are willing to
allow: it hardly makes one an irrational fanatic to describe the deliberate
destruction of an embryo human being as the 'taking of human life'. But the
Church weakens its case enormously by pushing it back before conception. At
that stage there is no individual human life to be taken: only a myriad
potential combinations, almost all of which nature will rule out anyway. Nor
is it obvious that the methods of avoiding conception which the church
recommends are any more 'natural' than those it condemns.
At the Cairo conference on population and development, Vatican delegates are
struggling to remove 'pregnancy termination' from the list of things covered
by 'reproductive healthcare' in the UN draft document and to salvage a
phrase about 'taking appropriate steps to help women avoid abortion, which
in no case should be presented as a method of family planning'. Vatican
delegates have wisely avoided taking a stand on the contraception issue.
They are not helped by TV footage from the Philippines, where last month
Catholics, led by Cardinal Jaime Sin, demonstrated against the conference
and their government's family planning policy, with banners proclaiming:
'Contraception = abortion = murder.'
Similarly the conference's organisers must have been less than pleased with
newspaper headlines yesterday suggesting that Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the
Norwegian prime minister, won a standing ovation by calling for abortion to
be legalised worldwide. They have taken pains to establish that this is not
the conference's agenda. Mrs Brundtland herself complained that the agenda
had been misrepresented, suggesting that the term 'reproductive healthcare'
could not 'possibly be read as promoting abortion as a means of family
planning'. But she clearly meant to take on the Vatican with two of her
statements: that 'morality becomes hypocrisy if it means mothers suffering
or dying in connection with unwanted pregnancies and illegal abortions and
unwanted children'; and that morality cannot 'only be a question of
controlling sexuality and protecting unborn life'.
It is a false quarrel about a false alarm. A false quarrel, because each
side is attacking the other for a position which, in this conference at
least, it is not attempting to defend. And a false alarm because the current
prospect for world population growth is less catastrophic than the headlines
suggest.
In an essay just published in the New York Review of Books, Prof Amartya
Sen, a leading expert on the economics of famine, reminds us that the rate
of world population growth has fallen in the last two decades from 2.2 to
1.7 per cent, and 'is expected to go steadily down until the size of the
world's population becomes nearly stationary'.
The number at which it will eventually stabilise, around 10bn, still sounds
alarmingly high. It is, but not - as many imagine - because most of those
people will be hungry and poor: per capita incomes are rising and food is
getting cheaper in those parts of the world where most of them are being
born. The danger is the opposite: sooner or later most of them will be able
to afford western lifestyles and consumption patterns, putting an
unsustainable strain on the world environment.
That problem will not be solved by population control alone, but anything we
can do to accelerate the fall in the birth rate should help to make it more
manageable. But Prof Sen makes a strong case that coercive or 'override'
methods - those in which 'the family's personal decisions are overridden by
some agency outside the family' - are unnecessary and perhaps ineffective,
as well as being inhumane. The fall in China's birth rate since 1979 may, he
suggests, be due less to the authoritarian one-child policy than to 'more
collaborative and participatory' policies which have made education and jobs
outside the home available to many Chinese women. The Indian state of
Kerala, with 29m people, has reduced its birth and fertility rates below
those of China without any state coercion. It is among the poorer Indian
states (so economic growth is not in itself the solution, as is sometimes
argued), but it resembles China in having 'high levels of basic education,
healthcare and so on'. Most strikingly, it has higher rural literacy rates,
male and female, than any Chinese province.
China and Kerala have the advantage of being neither Moslem nor Catholic.
But the birth rate is also falling rapidly in Iran (where there is good
basic healthcare, and the authorities came round to family planning in 1988)
and in most of South America. The Tablet, the British Catholic magazine,
even claimed last month, with a certain chutzpah, that because it favours
women's education 'the Catholic Church should be regarded as one of the most
effective organisations in the world for reducing the rate of population
growth'. In other words, the Pope should be congratulated for educating his
female followers to the point where they can ignore his advice.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: High cost of legal monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GREVILLE WARWICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If Lord Mackay is to consider the appropriateness of legal aid for the
Maxwell brothers he should also consider the reason why otherwise very
wealthy people cannot afford legal representation in Britain's courts
('Cheap ride on trial', August 30).
The truth is barristers and solicitors have exploited their unique monopoly
position to price everyone out of the market. Only government, with monopoly
taxation powers, can provide the millions for fees.
Ian and Kevin Maxwell are entitled to expect a fair trial and fair,
reasonable and controllable legal costs. Under present conditions that is
not possible, so legal aid must continue to pour into the bottomless pit of
lawyers' earnings.
This is now a serious political issue. How can it be that a single case and
a mere handful of lawyers and their experts can mean financial wipe-out for
most firms and practically all private individuals.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Resources wasted through energy
policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D L BULMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr David Porter's call for more competition in the European Energy
market is to be welcomed (Letters, August 31).
However let us hope that moves to introduce more competition take account of
the grave defects of energy deregulation as witnessed in the UK since
electricity privatisation.
The UK experience has seen the introduction of a system that gave the
generators a broad portfolio of generating plant but no guaranteed market,
and the regional electric companies secure markets but no plant. The
commercial decisions that stemmed from this - the dash for gas - effectively
did for the UK coal industry because, although in the main cheaper than gas,
the generators' mark-up rendered purchase from this source by the regional
electricity companies unattractive.
Valuable coal resources and coal generating plant have been squandered on
the back of this policy to the detriment of the consumer.
Similarly, let us hope that any moves to greater energy price transparency
in the European Union allows for equal treatment between fuels, as compared
to the UK situation where the government's regime provides a substantial and
anti-competitive subsidy to nuclear energy through the non-fossil fuel levy.
Indeed, this leads to the sad fact that the UK purchases French nuclear
electricity at substantially higher costs to the consumer than would be the
case without the non-fossil fuel levy.

<TEXT>
Sir, Perhaps Samuel Brittan has read something in Peter Drucker's latest
venture, Post Capitalist Society, which I missed - as the conclusions which
he draws from the work seem very optimistic ('Aim at the climate, not the
weather', September 5).
If Drucker is read in conjunction with Beyond the Limits, by Meadows and
Meadows - inspired by the Club of Rome - the idea of market forces
prevailing in a world where global communications has produced ungovernable
and perhaps, despite what Drucker suggests, unmanageable superstates is not
such a rosy prospect.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Body Shop: a cowardly attack, and a
salutary experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL P DAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Body Shop's commitment to environmental, animal welfare and
conservation issues is well established. Is it not remarkable that, in a
world so consumed by avarice and capricious self-interest, the US presumes
to enlighten us with a piece of such pure altruistic delight?
John Entine's cowardly attack on the achievement of Anita Roddick (and Co)
should be treated with contempt. The market has responded thus and rightly
so.
The critically endangered Siberian tiger would be one step closer to the
edge were it not for the brave foresight and initiative of the Body Shop. A
strange irony when a certain petroleum company of highly questionable
environmental pedigree has all but discarded its tiger mascot on to the
refuse tip of extinction.
Michael P Day,
chairman of the board of
trustees,
The Tiger Trust,

Suffolk IP29 5RG
From Mr Rupert Pearson
Sir, I refer to the letter from Mr Robin Bines and others ('Allegations
against the Body Shop lack any real evidence', September 1). The letter
could well have been written by industry in response to the 'unproven
allegations and the facts blown out of all proportion' which are so often
levelled by the environmental movement against sectors of manufacturing
industry. It will perhaps be a salutary experience for the environmental
movement to be subjected to the sort of treatment which it so often metes
out to industry, frequently based on unproven allegations, selective 'facts'
and inaccurate information.
I congratulate you in having the courage to publish the reports on the Body
Shop which I have read with great interest. Perhaps it may lead to further
critical questioning and challenges to other organisations parading their
green credentials.
For too long, industry and others who contribute to the health, prosperity
and the well-being of society, have been on the receiving end of
unsubstantiated green claims without the green movement and its claims being
subjected to the same scrutiny.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Eastern comrades strike back: Unions in the ex-Soviet bloc
are regaining some vigour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the weekend, the threat of strike action was enough to win a 55 per
cent pay increase for the unionised employees of Romania's public television
station. Bulgarian trade union leaders may take industrial action in the
autumn to protest at the government's austere social policies. And in Russia
coalminers are threatening to go on strike because of month-long delays in
the payment of their wages.
This rash of industrial action throughout eastern Europe signals a change in
the role played by unions in the post-communist world.
In the initial rush to build market economies that followed the collapse of
communism, unions seemed to be relegated to a bit part. But there are signs
that post-communist trade unionism is now beginning to find its feet. 'We
are like a youngster learning very fast,' says Mr Richard Falbr, president
of CMKOS, the Czech trade union confederation.
The reformed former communist unions and those that have been set up more
recently face an uphill struggle to win credibility with employers and
workers in an uncertain economic climate.
Western trade unions would recognise the low prestige of many of their
opposite numbers in the east and the concentration of their influence in a
shrinking public sector.
'Trade unionism has a bad image from the decades when it was just a
transmission belt in the factory for (Communist) party instructions,' says
Mr Falbr. Even basic trade union concepts, such as 'worker solidarity', have
negative associations - conjuring up the image of having to work an extra
Saturday morning shift for some far-away, anti-imperialist struggle.
In Russia, where the unions have changed little since Soviet times, a recent
poll found that 73 per cent of workers thought them ineffective at defending
workers' rights. The existence of state-imposed incomes policies - in the
form of limits on wages - in Russia and elsewhere in the region adds to the
feeling that the unions make little difference in workplaces. And continuing
rows between the old unions and the new reduce what little collective power
the unions might be able to muster.
Moreover, the labour market shake-out - supported by most mainstream
political parties - does not make fertile ground for trade unionism.
Excluding Russia, where formal unemployment is still less than 3 per cent,
employment has fallen by an average of 20 per cent in the former eastern
bloc in the past four years and average real wages in most countries are
only now regaining their pre-transition levels. In Russia, Ukraine and some
other countries of the former Soviet Union, they are still substantially
below that level.
Despite guidance from western unions on recruitment strategy, unions remain
weak to non-existent in the private sector, which now employs more than 50
per cent of workers in more advanced states such as Poland and Hungary.
'Subject to state regulations, it appears that private employers can set pay
levels, pay structures and employment conditions unilaterally,' says a
recent World Bank survey.
Mr Guy Standing, head of the International Labour Organisation's Eastern
Europe unit in Budapest, says this is a worrying long-term trend. But there
are countervailing factors - economic and political - which should ease his
fears.
As big, strongly unionised plants are moved into the private sector through
accelerating privatisation programmes, the union foothold there may
strengthen. Thanks to the distribution of shares to workers in many
countries, as part of the privatisation process, several large companies now
have an important element of worker ownership. The better organised unions
are exploiting that to influence ement decisions.
Further, despite the free-market rhetoric of many governments, there are
national tripartite commissions (governments, unions and employers) of
varying influence in most countries. The newly elected Polish government has
raised the status of its tripartite commission. Similarly, the left of
centre government in Hungary wants to strengthen the voice of organised
labour in revising the country's labour law.
In pay setting, too, union influence may be growing. Though their strength
lies in the public sector, unions may be affecting wage levels in the
private sector. Mr Simon Commander of the World Bank says average wages in
the two sectors are almost identical throughout the region, with the
exception of Russia.
At workplace level, unions are scoring successes in some countries. Mr
Christoph Drzewicki, a senior official of Solidarity, says the Polish union
recently won an important recognition battle at Elgaz, a private sector
heating company. He also points to the new co-operation between Solidarity
and its ex-communist rival, OPZZ, in a strike, recently ended, at the
Italian-owned Lucchini steel plant.
In Russia, unions may be weak but they remain relevant in millions of
people's lives. The enterprise remains an important source of welfare
services and even of food and housing, and in most big plants the unions are
still allowed to play an important role by managers, who see maintaining
high employment levels as a crucial part of their job. The Russian
Confederation of Trade Unions, with more than 60m members, lobbies alongside
managers to maximise subsidies.
The mass membership and substantial resources of the unions also give them
potential clout in a region where political parties have only tiny
memberships. The percentage of workers in unions ranges from a low of about
40 per cent in Poland to a high of 75 per cent in Bulgaria.
The influence of unions in some pockets of the economy can be considerable.
Workers in the Fiat and GM plants in, respectively, Poland and Hungary have
also been asking for wages to be raised in stages to western levels. Most
foreign employers expect wages to rise, given the proximity of much
better-paid western Europeans.
In the Czech Republic, for example, Mr Falbr, the union leader, is pushing
hard to lift wage levels. 'At present our productivity is about one-third
western levels, but our pay is about one-tenth western levels. That cannot
last,' he says.
Official Czech unemployment is lower than anywhere in the region apart from
Russia. That is partly because wage and non-wage labour costs are lower than
in Poland and Hungary (where non-wage labour costs are about 50 per cent of
wages costs), unemployment pay is less generous, and there has been less
corporate restructuring.
He rejects, however, the claim by union leaders elsewhere that the Czech
unions are among the weakest in the region. 'We may have been less militant,
but we still have a lot of influence,' he says, pointing to a successful
lobby to reform a recent pension law.
In the long run, Mr Falbr would like to see Czech industrial relations
following a German model of works councils in companies and union
representation on company boards, but he recognises this is some time away.
Others, such as Mr Drzewicki of Poland's Solidarity, suggest that the French
model - with low union presence in factories and offices, but strong labour
laws and an influential voice for labour at national level - is a more
realistic long-term option.
Just as trade unionism in Asia has not followed practice in Europe or
America, so in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union a new model may
emerge. Despite the tough times the unions are going through, one thing
seems certain: they are here to stay.

<TEXT>
Sir, Whenever there is talk of a multi-speed Europe ('Europe at odds over
integration', September 3/4) there appears to be an automatic assumption
that the UK would be in the slow lane. To examine just two areas where the
UK is often labelled a laggard: the UK has implemented more social and
employment directives than any other member state, and is the closest to
meeting the convergence criteria for Emu. The multi-speed approach is
already a fact of European life, and its recognition is a pragmatic response
to the challenges of enlargement. It is not the multi-speed approach which
threatens the UK, but the danger that one of those speeds might be reverse.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Arts: The Playboy of the Western World - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watching and hearing JM Synge's celebrated play The Playboy of the Western
World - in my case for the second time in 15 days - is an astonishment. So
simple a story, dramatised with such surprising ambiguity. I have plenty of
reservations about Lynne Parker's new staging at the Almeida, but I take it
that the full-throated approval of the first-night audience denotes pleasure
in the play itself. Which is as it should be.
The most vital of all the play's layers is its language. There is the
infectious skill with which Synge makes ordinary Irish talk intoxicatingly
poetic. And it is Christy Mahon, the lying playboy, whose talk is the most
infectious of all: '. . . there's torment in the splendour of her like, and
she a girl any moon of midnight would take pride to meet, facing southwards
on the heaths of Keel.' Not that his words are all lies. From his capacity
for poetry we glimpse his capacity for courage; and it is he who changes
most during the play.
The finest poetry arises from the romance between Christy, the dark starving
stranger who arrives from the cold, and Pegeen Mike, the daughter of this
house in County Mayo. Sometimes Synge makes their love sound as predestined
and potent as if they were Siegmund and Sieglinde in Wagner's Die Walkure -
and yet he also satirically debunks it. For this is only County Mayo, where
people, including Pegeen, are daft enough to hero-worship Christy for his
tale of having killed his own father. And he is only Christy, whose lies may
make him the all-conquering 'playboy' on his arrival, but who is still
scared of the father who is only too alive. Synge has us laugh at all these
characters - up to a point. The final, beautiful twist of his play, is that
their base coal can indeed be turned to diamond. For Christy really does win
the village games, and then does beat his father; and Pegeen really has lost
her heart to him.
Lynne Parker's direction has great virtues. All the characters are
three-dimensional; Christy (Aidan Gillen) is, correctly, not the gorgeous
hunk that the village women all make him out to be; and the loneliness of
Pegeen and Christy is unusually touching. On the other hand, the
production's tempo is frequently too deliberate, its tone too carefully
distilled. Where Synge's lines cry out to be spoken with spirit and speed,
they are often here taken slowly and softly.
Other reservations? Christy, on arrival, is too clean; everything and
everybody (save Pegeen) looks - in Kathy Strachan's designs - too prosperous
and modern for 'the wild coast of Mayo in 1907'; Pegeen's father and the
other Mayo men are too sober; and Pegeen and the Widow Quin (Gina Moxley)
are sometimes inaudible. And to frame the play with one of McCormack's
Irish-song records - between scenes as well as at the start and end - adds a
heavy note of polite nostalgia not to be found in Synge's play.
There are, none the less, rewards enough here. Until Christy's exit, Aislan
O'Sullivan brings Pegeen to life - her boredom, longing, temper  - with
first-rate body-language. Gillen is pretty well the kind of raven-haired
shrimp that Synge's playboy should be, a weak son whom every woman will
motheringly adore, yet with just enough steel to surprise. And at every
point the absence of Oirish cuteness and blarney is pure tonic.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Arts: A seasonal display of dirty linen - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Does anybody remember television quite as dreadful as we have been having
for the past couple of weeks? Of course any week that contained the pilot
for Chris Tarrant's game show (can that really be the right phrase?) The
Opposite Sex would be pretty bad. The billing told us that couples would be
'airing their dirty laundry in public' and anyone who thought this was a
subtle piece of wordplay indicating a stage beyond washing their dirty linen
was rapidly disillusioned by the information that there would be 'a studio
audience comprising of couples only'. Such solecisms should have served as a
warning. Sure enough women were induced to object to men leaving the
lavatory seat up, and men to complain about the time women took in preparing
to go out. Goodness knows how the BBC justifies spending our licence fees on
such trash.
Nor was it just that. There have been dustbin loads of repeats and a poor
response from news and current affairs programmes to the cessation of
violence by Irish republican terrorists. Perhaps I was consistently unlucky,
and it was like a game of Grandmother's Footsteps: every time I switched
channels to find a better report, impressive activity promptly occurred
behind my back. Maybe. But the reports I saw seemed wholly unprepared for
what had happened, and obsessed with the absence of the word 'permanent' in
the ceasefire declaration, virtually to the exclusion of all other
considerations. In particular there was a marked failure to explain how this
event had come about. Were the American visiting politicians influential?
Was it John Major's doing? Had John Hume's work paid off? Having believed in
violence for 25 years, why had the terrorists changed their minds? Not only
did nobody seem to have the faintest idea, nobody on television seemed
willing to ask.
At other times of the year when there is so much more to distract the
attention you might be able to get away with showing a ragbag collection of
episodes from ancient ATV series, pretending you were serving a demand for
retro television. After all, nobody accuses the National Film Theatre or the
Hampstead Everyman of showing 'repeats'; they are in the serious sounding
business of repertory cinema. However, there is an important difference. The
NFT and the Everyman select the best of what has survived, whereas
broadcasters usually seem perversely interested in the worst. It was not a
bad idea to have Michael Grade interview his uncle for The Persuader: The TV
Times Of Lord Lew Grade, because Lew Grade did have a significant effect on
British television in the 1950s and 60s. Some of his series - The Muppet
Show for instance, and The Prisoner - were unusual and well worth reviving.
Moreover it was fascinating to see the episode of Danger Man in which
Patrick McGoohan played a shadowy agent, sent abroad to a mysterious
self-sufficient village where the mundane was overlaid with a powerful sense
of sinister totalitarianism, since this was so clearly the model for The
Prisoner in which McGoohan played the title role and also produced. There
are no such good reasons for showing odd episodes from The Buccaneers, The
Adventures Of William Tell, The Persuaders and a lot of other ATV series
which are banal, repetitive and best forgotten. They looked like Polyfilla,
shoved in to fill gaping summertime cracks.
Is this all cause or effect? Are these heaps of repeats and ghastly pilots
pushed at us in August because everybody who can afford to has left for
Tuscany (or, for a touch of real class, Umbria) or do all those people shoot
off to Italy because August is a dead month, not least on television?
Whether the chicken or the egg came first, it is time the broadcasters gave
up their nasty habits and accepted that even though Coronation Street
attracts 'only' 16m viewers in August instead of 19m in the winter, 16m
people are not to be sneezed at. Having said which, the autumn season is
creeping in even as I write. Sunday brought the first of a new season of
'Screen One' filmed dramas on BBC1, A Breed Of Heroes, written by Charles
Wood. Concerned with a British Army unit in Northern Ireland in 1971, this
has been widely described as a comedy but is surely no such thing. Wood, a
one-time regular soldier, seems to be simultaneously fascinated, impressed
and appalled by professional soldiers and soldiering. He wrote the movie The
Charge Of The Light Brigade and - his most outstanding work to date -
Tumbledown. Like those, A Breed Of Heroes is concerned with the paradoxes of
military behaviour: obedience and rebellion, valour and stupidity, brutality
and compassion. The central character, young Lt Thoroughgood, is not the
most memorable. It is Nicholas Farrell's Lt Col Gowrie who sticks in the
mind, the man who is mad enough to scream at the gravy in the officers' mess
but sane enough to declare of the local population 'I swear I'm going to
make them behave like human beings'. The main mistake with this drama is to
assume it is about Ireland: it is about the military mind.
We have also seen the start of Channel 4's series 21st Century Airport,
about Kansai International, which seems to be sailing dangerously close to
hagiography where architect Renzo Piano is concerned; and, on BBC2, the
first episode in the American comedy hit Murphy Brown. Given the scarcity of
good comedy, it is difficult to understand the idea of screening this at a
time - six o'clock on Mondays - when most people are still travelling home.
Most promising of all we have seen the beginning of BBC2's eight-part series
White Heat which is described as 'charting the history of technology' but
which turns out to be nowhere near as dry and educational as that makes it
sound. The opening episode made the point that the difference between man
and other animals is not tool use (otters swim on their backs, holding flat
stones on their chests to use as anvils for smashing open mussel shells) but
the symbolism which is built into so many of man's tools, even when they are
as seemingly utilitarian as, say, a gun.
Tonight brings the first episodes in BBC1's new drama series about dustmen,
Common As Muck, and ITV's drama about politics, sex scandals and arms
dealing, Faith. Give the broadcasters a week or so and they will be lobbing
new programmes at us so fast that none of us will be able to keep up.
Politicians may have fought their way clear of the old boom-bust cycle but
not broadcasters. This is the way they believe things should be: famine in
August and glut in September.

Today's Short Stories documentary is about nutty enthusiasts, almost
invariably surefire material for television. Until two years ago, Swansea
Aero Club was run by the local council. Then money problems brought the
threat of closure and a group of flying enthusiasts decided to buy it and
run it as a private company (8.30 C4). Witness is another C4 documentary,
this time about Boris Zolotov, a Russian who runs four-week seminars and, we
are assured, uses his telepathic powers to bring rooms full of people to
orgasm. Jolly useful (9.00). Michael Gambon, Susannah Harker, Connie Booth,
Gemma Jones, and many more, including Ken Livingstone as himself, appear in
Faith, a thriller wrapped around News At 10 today and tomorrow which
combines politicians' sex scandals and arms deals (9.00). William Ivory's
Common As Muck will inevitably be compared with 'The Dustbinmen', not just
because both are about dustmen but because the 1969 series was written by
Jack Rosenthal. That was a comedy of course, whereas the series starting on
BBC1 today is a six-part drama (9.30).

FT  07 SEP 94 / Arts: Liberating theme for Lucerne - Andrew Clark concludes
a two-part report from Switzerland's premier music festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lucerne has long prided itself on its programme themes, but few have been so
liberating or so intelligently pursued as this summer's 'Forms of
Interpretation'. At first glance, it seemed little more than a convenient
way of wrapping up whatever was available on the international festival
circuit. After all, when is musical performance not a form of
interpretation?
On closer examination, the theme has clearly stimulated the imagination of
Lucerne's festival director, Matthias Bamert. At one extreme, he invited a
clown and an 'alternative' musician to give their own bizarre
interpretations of traditional concert form. At another, he devoted a whole
evening to orchestral arrangements and transcriptions, those dubious
vehicles which composers use to interpret the thoughts of their noble
predecessors.
Gennady Rozhdestvensky conducted one bloated hybrid after another with
impish pleasure, but it was hard to decide which was worse - Hamilton
Harty's soporific suite from Handel's Fireworks Music, or the turgid
orchestration which Liszt made of the slow movement from Beethoven's
Archduke trio. The more sound you add, the more you bury the spirit of the
original. The only composer to emerge with credit was Schoenberg, whose
subtle, respectful arrangement of two Bach chorale preludes underlined the
whole point of interpretation - to divine the character of a work, and
filter it through the personality of the interpreter.
Ravel and Webern, two other master-arrangers, were well represented
elsewhere in the festival. So too were Beethoven's Leonore overtures - a
vivid example of a composer struggling to interpret himself. And there was
no shortage of period-instrument specialists to illustrate the changing
fashions of interpretation. But the biggest single interpretative focus was
Winterreise: Peter Schreier sang the original Schubert; Hans Zender and
Klangforum Wien presented a 'composed interpretation' of the song-cycle; and
a new Winterreise opera received its premiere.
With music by the Austrian composer Ingomar Grunauer and a libretto by
Francesco Micieli, the opera gives a 20th century political resonance to the
chill despair described by Schubert. Set in the Pyrenees in September 1940,
it is a psychological study of the German poet Walter Benjamin, on the night
before he committed suicide while fleeing from the Nazis. In 11
interconnected scenes, he hallucinates, dreams of the past, and sways
between the angels of life and death. The music, hyper-expressive rather
than poetic, is scored for small orchestra and chorus, and maintains a lean
Bergian flow. Its impact was considerably enhanced by Philipp Himmelmann's
semi-abstract production and the vivid performance of the American tenor
Neil Wilson.
That was one of the more original 'Forms of Interpretation' at Lucerne this
summer. Without being dogmatic, the theme underlined again and again that
interpretation is never definitive, it can never be fixed. In an age which
likes to see music recorded in tablets of stone, it was a salutary reminder.
The choice of Klaus Huber as composer-in-residence was a mixed blessing. A
neat and sprightly 70-year old who has spent much of his professional life
outside his native Switzerland, Huber has had more influence as a teacher
than as a composer (Brian Ferneyhough being his best-known pupil). His music
is difficult and expensive to perform, and does not sit easily in mainstream
concert programmes. The festival did its best by commissioning a piano
concerto, which Andras Schiff played in the same programme as Mozart's K595.
Entitled Intarsi, it tries to echo a Mozartian world in a succession of
trills and half-tones, like a precisely calculated miniature. But it offers
the soloist little more than sophisticated doodling.
In other events, Huber's idiom came over as wearisomely dated. His
idealistic engagement with politics and religion was represented by a
performance in the Hofkirche of Cantiones de Circulo Gyrante (1985), and a
film of the 1983 Donaueschingen premiere of the oratorio . . . Erniedrigt,
geknechtet, verlassen, verachtet . . . Both require a vast auditorium to
create the necessary spatial effects, and both employ a narrator to declaim
portentous texts, against a background of gloomy choral intoning. Both sound
like muzak for purgatory - a complete contrast to Huber's small-scale works,
of which the soulful, suggestive Plainte for viola d'amore (1990) was the
most impressive. Les Jeunes Solistes and Ensemble Recherche were the
faithful interpreters.
My own festival impressions were dominated by Felicity Lott's ravishing
account of Chausson's Poeme de l'amour et de la mer, accompanied by the
Suisse Romande Orchestra under Armin Jordan; and by Heinz Holliger
conducting the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie in Mozart's Prague Symphony (in
the same programme as the Huber piano concerto). Holliger's artless podium
manner, his natural sense of style and sheer verve were a joy to behold,
because they transmitted themselves intuitively to the players and were
placed entirely at the service of the music. Now there was an interpretation
to remember.
The Lucerne festival runs until Saturday. Box office: tel (41) 233080; fax

FT  07 SEP 94 / People: McKinlay dives out of the Pool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Margaret McKinlay, the chief executive of the Electricity Pool, surprised
the power industry yesterday by announcing that she is leaving to take up
the new post of head of compliance at British Gas.
The move will stir considerable interest in energy circles since the Pool
and British Gas are both in the public eye these days. But the 43-year-old
McKinlay felt it was time for a change, both from her point of view and that
of the Pool.
'When I took on this job five years ago I wanted to make sure the Pool was
capable of working, and I think I've done that,' she said. 'It can always be
improved, but it would be better for another person to do that.'
A graduate of Edinburgh University, McKinlay joined the Department of Energy
in 1977, and worked on electricity and oil licensing before becoming private
secretary to the minister of state. After a spell in administration, she
moved to the coal division during the miners' strike before returning to
electricity to oversee privatisation.
In December 1988 she helped create the Pool, the new wholesale market for
electricity which formed the heart of the privatised industry, becoming
chief executive in 1990.
Although the Pool has evolved as the focal point of the electricity market,
it has been criticised for containing imperfections, and a number of reforms
are being introduced under McKinlay's guidance.
At British Gas, McKinlay will play a key role in introducing a regulatory
compliance regime in the wake of last year's monopoly report. In particular,
she will be responsible for ensuring the effective separation of British
Gas's transportation business from its trading operations - the key feature
of the new structure which will have to pass muster with the gas regulator
and the company's customers.
McKinlay will be based at British Gas's corporate centre and report to a
main board director. She admits that she has had only limited contact with
the gas industry - still very much a man's world - though she has met Clare
Spottiswoode, the gas regulator, with whom most of her dealings will be.
No moves have yet been made to find a successor at the Pool. One member said
yesterday: 'She will be very hard to replace. She is extraordinarily
conscientious, and would never leave a job half done.'

FT  07 SEP 94 / Business and the Environment: Green leather in fashion -
Tomas Larsson visits a Laos tannery which is trying to be as environmentally
friendly as possible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOMAS LARSSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A once defunct tannery in Laos, south-east Asia, has won its first orders by
selling itself to western leather buyers as an environmentally friendly
operation.
While much industry along the Mekong River is still pumping out effluent and
dumping waste, the Simon Lao factory is capitalising on greater
environmental awareness among western consumers.
Simon Lao in Vientiane, the Laos capital, is the country's only tannery. It
was built by the government in the late 1980s with funding from the United
Nations Development Programme but was mothballed on completion. The plant
never opened for business because there was no further funding once the aid
programme ceased.
But commercial production began as soon as the tannery was privatised last
year, and sales are now up to Bt2.5m (Pounds 64,600) a month. The government
sold 75 per cent to Bangkok-based Simon &amp; Associates, an Australian-Thai
joint venture. It is one of Thailand's largest makers of leather furniture,
with sales of more than Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) a month.
Simon Lao made it a marketing policy to become a 'green' leather niche. It
is now hailed as one of the most environmentally-friendly tanneries in
south-east Asia.
Keen to buy from such a supplier, Ikea, the Swedish group, recently placed a
Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.2m) order for leather furniture from Simon &amp;
Associates.
Ikea says it would like to buy more furniture from the parent company, but
the tannery is running at full capacity and cannot deliver any more at the
moment. But the company says it has 'many more leather articles which can be
shifted to the Lao tannery. And we are in the process of adapting our
furniture - to give it a new look - to further fit their production.'
Laos is perhaps not the most obvious of investment destinations in Asia. As
a late industrialiser, the country is not trying to attract foreign
investment by agreeing to environmental 'dumping' - but rather the opposite.
Jean-Francois Renaudin, general manager of Simon Lao, says: 'Simon &amp;
Associates was very interested in this tannery, first because it could
supply them with water-buffalo leather, which is getting hard to find in
Thailand.
'Second, Ikea, which is a very large customer, has to watch what it does in
terms of the environment. Simon identified that if it could get a tannery
that was clean at the start, and then make it cleaner and greener, surely
Ikea would be interested in that. Mind you, it is a gamble - it's not a deal
with Ikea - that is part of the marketing strategy of Simon.'
Renaudin believes the plant's success so far is because of its cleanliness.
'We are one of the few tanneries in south-east Asia to have a dedicated
effluent treatment plant. And it is the biggest one I've ever seen. In fact,
we could probably increase production capacity by 10-15 times and the system
would still be able to cope.'
The plant has a modern waste water treatment plant, imported from Europe,
which chemically removes dangerous chemicals from the water used in the
tanning process.
Bernhard Meyhofer, a German consultant working with Thailand's ministry of
industry on a series of environmental projects, agrees that the Simon Lao
tannery is cleaner than most. 'Compared with the 150 tanneries in Thailand,
the Lao tannery is definitely much cleaner. They are doing one very
important thing right: separating chromium-containing waste water from the
other waste water streams and removing the chromium by precipitation.'
Chromium is used in the tanning process.
The resulting sludge is disposed of in drying beds on the plant site. A
heritage from the UNDP days, the tannery is equipped with a chrome recycling
system, which could eliminate the need for a more suitable site for
end-disposal of the chrome-filled sludge. But the system has never been
fully operational. It would require further investment to open and Renaudin
is not convinced that using recycled chrome would have no effect on the
quality of the leather.
Renaudin's gamble, as he puts it, appears to be paying off so far. He is now
embarking on a project to improve further the plant's environmental record -
to eliminate what the industry calls 'wet blue' shavings. The shavings,
which contain chromium, are produced when the hide is shaved to produce a
uniform thickness.
Simon Lao will introduce a two-step tanning process. The shaving of the
hides will in future be done in a pre-tanning stage called wet white, before
the usual chrome-tanning process.
'In the west,' explains Renaudin, 'tanneries dump the wet blue shavings at
disposal centres specialised for toxic waste. A small tannery such as Simon
Lao produces perhaps 200 kilos of shavings per day - and in Laos they didn't
even have a rubbish tip when we came here.'
In contrast, the new tanning process, expected to be up and running by the
end of the year, involves only organic compounds (aldehydes) and the
shavings can be used as animal feed. 'We will probably be the first tannery
in the world to use the wet white process for 100 per cent of our
production,' says Renaudin. 'And Laos will certainly be the only country in
the world where all tanneries use this technology - because we're the only
tannery here.'
But not all factories in Laos are as environmentally aware. Local villagers,
for instance, have to tread with extreme care to avoid hurting themselves
when struggling through heaps of broken bottles, rusty bottle caps and
copious amounts of rubbish and effluent. Heavy rain flushes much of the
waste into the relatively pristine waters of the Mekong. If the success
stories of companies seeking out the 'green' buyer in Laos continue, this
practice may finally come to an end.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Business and the Environment: Accounting for the birds, bees
and trees - Why economic indicators must reflect degradation of natural
resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How much is the air you breathe or the forest you hike in worth? Can a
monetary value be put on them, or are they priceless?
As pressures for conservation of natural resources mount worldwide, planners
and policy-makers are increasingly confronted with such questions. The
result is that economic valuation of natural resources and environmental
accounting are achieving greater prominence.
Much of the theoretical groundwork has been done by scholars such as Robert
Repetto of the Washington-based World Resource Institute and David Pearce of
University College London. International conservation agencies, among them
the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Commission on
Environment and Development, have endorsed the objectives of resource
valuation and environmental accounting.
The economies of many developing countries are especially resource-dependent
 -oil-exporting countries, for example - and thus have an interest in
determining the value of their inventories, or reserves.
Recently the UN Statistical Office published guidelines for environmental
accounting; this is likely to help developing countries incorporate the
value of resources into national accounts.
Conventional accounts can give a misleading picture of a nation's output by
failing to show depreciation as resources are depleted or to reflect the
contamination of natural resources. Thus, the output of products such as oil
are overestimated, as there will come a time when the oil runs out and
income will cease. Such natural resources have neither been considered
productive capital nor been subject to depreciation.
Just as a lumberman loses capacity to produce timber if he cuts trees
without reforesting, an economy's productive capacity diminishes with the
degradation of biological resources. The World Resources Institute argues
that if natural resources, like other assets, are diminishing they should be
subject to depreciation.
Theodore Panayotou at Harvard's Institute for International Development says
that the price of commodities, such as fish and crops, often 'reflects only
the opportunity cost of labour and capital used in their production, not the
opportunity cost of scarce natural resources used in their production.'
The implications of economic indicators that do not reflect such degradation
are many. They result in a deceptive measure of economic growth. A country
exporting large amounts of timber, for example, may record considerable
growth, as reflected in gross domestic product. But if economic figures do
not reflect a decrease in the inventory of natural resources - its forests -
and a reduction of future productive capacity, such growth is overstated and
unsustainable.
A study of forestry schemes in Britain, sponsored by the World Wide Fund for
Nature, found that: 'Economic analysis of forestry is, in practice, purely a
financial assessment of profitability.'
Misleading income measurements create the illusion that growth was created
without cost to the environment, says Omar Noman, senior research economist
at Oxford University. An indicator of economic growth is needed that is
adjusted for environmental costs.
Based on the concept of sustainable development, 'net growth' would be based
on income generated by economic activities that do not reduce a country's
productive capacity in an unsustainable way. It is calculated by subtracting
the cost of degradation from gross domestic product.
Case studies of resource degradation have shown that the market often fails
to reflect the social and economic cost of environmental degradation. For
example, although natural stocks of fish worldwide are dwindling, fish
prices are not rising enough to inhibit consumption to a sustainable level.
A number of methodologies to value natural or biological resources have been
proposed. The simplest approach is to assess the market value of
commercially harvested products, such as timber or medicinal plants. It
calculates the value at current prices while taking into account
unconventional uses such as eco-tourism. But this approach does not consider
the value of products that do not pass through a market. For an Indian
tribe, firewood, game meat and fish are products that are not marketed, so
have no market value.
Even more elusive is the attempt to assess indirect values of ecosystems.
What is the worth of a forest's function in regulating the climate, as a
source of water or sequestering carbon emissions?
So far such valuation techniques have been applied largely to limited
geographical regions or specific resources within an economy. As Repetto
says: 'The idea of an all-encompassing inventory of natural assets has
generally been discarded.'
In Papua New Guinea, the World Bank and the UN Statistical Office conducted
case studies to see how data on natural resources could be integrated into
the existing system of national accounts. Environmental impacts were
assessed in agriculture, forestry, mining and energy sectors. The
environmentally adjusted net domestic product (EDP) was calculated in two
stages. The economic depletion of natural resources was calculated; then the
degradation of environmental quality and of non-marketed environmental
services was assessed. Total EDP equalled 90 to 97 per cent of net domestic
product.
Ultimately, economic valuation of natural resources does not prevent their
unsustainable use. However, it identifies and determines the cost of
unsustainable economic growth. It is a further step in providing economic
indicators that reflect the state of the environment.

FT  07 SEP 94 / People: Ian Reynolds' return ticket
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Association of British Travel Agents, which acts as both watchdog and
industry association for the UK travel business, has just appointed a new
chief executive: Ian Reynolds.
Reynolds, 50, has previously spent 26 years with IBM (UK) in a multitude of
roles. He joined the company in 1968 as a trainee salesman in London, after
studies at the London School of Economics. He became regional manager for
the Midlands and North, and group director of administration in Paris in
1982.
He returned to the UK in 1983 to lead a division concerned with information
systems, but Paris once more beckoned in 1986, where he returned to be
general manager responsible for the Benelux, Spain, Switzerland and east
European territories.
Back to the UK in 1987, Reynolds took over as director of marketing and
services for three years. Clearly, however, Paris got into his system, as he
returned there in 1991 to be vice-president, communications, dealing with
government and media relations, as well as internal communications. He
finished his career with IBM as director of personnel and corporate affairs,
back in the UK. He retired from IBM earlier this year.
Given that he enjoys tennis, golf, skiing and sailing, and he now has some
spare time to pursue those activities, why is Reynolds taking on the tough
role of steering ABTA, which has had its ups and downs in the recent past?
'Travel is a high-growth industry, soon to be the world's largest. ABTA is
in a good position to provide the necessary leadership for that industry;
it's a challenge too good to miss,' says Reynolds.
ABTA currently has 2,900 main members, though that increases to 7,000 when
counting all retail outlets. Reynolds is taking over from John Dunscombe,
who resigned earlier this year.

Regret in the City yesterday over the departure from Cowie, the car-leasing
and motor-trading group, of Iain Jane, 49, the director responsible for the
motor division, after 15 years with the company.
Analysts said it was sad to see the break-up of the experienced management
team which had built the Sunderland group into one of the industry's biggest
companies. Last year Sir Tom Cowie, 71, stepped down after 45 years as
chairman of the company he founded and was replaced by Sir James MacKinnon,
previously director general of Ofgas.
Cowie refused to comment on the reasons for Jane's departure, but analysts
believe he may have lost out in the race to succeed Gordon Hodgson, 62, the
chief executive, who now assumes overall responsibility for the motor
division.
The succession was always thought to lie between Jane and Neil Pykett, 46,
the director responsible for Cowie contract hire and leasing business, which
makes the bulk of group profits. Another possible factor is that Jane is a
very hands-on manager, who may have felt cut off by the layer of divisional
management which grew with Cowie.

The Colloque Franco-Britannique, a select forum set up three years ago by
Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, and Gerard Worms, chairman
of Suez, has been described rather unkindly by some observers as 'a group of
serious people shooting the breeze'.
But the annual meeting of leading industrialists, journalists and academics
does have some practical uses, too. It was at one such gathering that a
senior member of SG Warburg met Yves Cannac, the president of Cegos, a
French consultancy specialising in professional and management training.
He was so impressed with the 59-year-old Frenchman, who was also executive
chairman of Havas, the French media group, from 1978 to 1981, that he has
been hired to advise Warburg on how to develop its business in France.
Warburg clearly believes that retaining senior figures with good local
knowledge and contacts is a winning strategy. It has similar advisers in
Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Australia and Canada and two in Japan.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Survey of Enterprise in Wales (11): Private sector helps to
revitalise small towns - Some distinctive schemes for supporting businesses,
and communities, are examined by Rhys David
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RHYS DAVID
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years after it was set up as a semi-autonomous unit, Business in the
Community in Wales is finding there are activities and campaigns which it
can adopt in response to local issues which are not possible within the
larger UK framework - as well as national schemes that are not appropriate
to Wales.
The main distinctively Welsh thrust has been towards building public and
private links in a number of small towns through business partnerships. A
year ago BITC was asked to help involve the private sector in Llandudno
which had been badly hit by floods. Following a number of meetings, the
Aberconwy partnership, under the chairmanship of Mr George Newson of Quinton
Hazell, the automotive components company, has been set up, with a brief to
come up with ideas for strategic development of the town.
A similar exercise is now being undertaken in Tredegar, south Wales.
Businesses ranging in size from the self-employed to more than 150 employees
were brought together in July under the sponsorship of Swalec, the Welsh
utility company, to talk with other local organisations and the local
authorities about ways of revitalising the valleys town, and about the forms
of co-operation which might best achieve this.
The next step will be the creation of a town forum which will give business
in the town a vehicle for discussion with the public authorities. As in
Llandudno, the aim is to develop a strategic partnership.
In Caernarfon, where a Pounds 43m scheme to improve the urban environment is
planned, a dialogue has also begun, with the Welsh Office keen for the
private sector to back up public sector pump-priming. At present, however,
the local authorities are expressing greater enthusiasm for an informal
rather than a formal link with business.
In education, BITC in Wales has mobilised companies behind
business-education partnerships. The Japanese, big investors in Wales, have
been particularly supportive of Aim High, an educational initiative which
encourages young people to raise levels of achievement in education and
training. Sony, Panasonic, Toyota, Brother, Hitachi, Aiwa, Hoya, Zeon and
Takiron are among the groups which have participated.
Business leaders have also been taken, as in other parts of the UK, to see
what is happening on the ground, under the Seeing is Believing programme. A
group of senior business leaders visited Cardiff earlier this year to be
briefed on Track 2000, a project for collecting and recycling old
appliances, backed by ASW, the steel products group. As a result, other
businesses, including Marks &amp; Spencer and British Gas became involved.
Similarly, the idea of professional firms donating time has been adopted in
Wales. In two years, services worth Pounds 175,000 have been donated, and a
new group for north Wales is being started.
One of the big differences according to Mr Simon Knighton, BITC Wales
director, is the smaller number of big companies compared with some English
regions, which as a result puts a bigger onus on the 50,000 small and
medium-sized enterprises in Wales.
What Wales does have, however, is a separate political and government
dimension and this, according to Mr Knighton, can shorten communications and
expedite action. The move to unitary authorities in Wales under local
government reform is also seen as likely to make it easier for companies to
become involved in working with the community. There is overlap, however,
between the aid and support agencies, which he believes needs to be
rationalised.
At a much more local level another organisation, Abergavenny-based Community
Enterprise Wales (CEW) co-ordinates the work of groups and individuals
seeking to develop community-based enterprise activity. Such businesses,
which must be owned and controlled by the local community, can be service or
manufacturing operations, and examples within Wales include a local
supermarket, cinemas, printing and publishing, catering and childcare.
For a small fee the 130 groups in membership - the target is more than 300
by the end of the current financial year - gain access to advice and
information and to courses and seminars run by CEW, which is funded by a
three-year grant from the Welsh Development Agency. Just as importantly, CEW
acts as a voice for community groups and lobbies for them.
Some of the most successful enterprises have been established in the south
Wales valleys where local groups have come together to bring back into
community use former miners' and workmen's halls, and to provide specialised
transport services for the disabled and elderly. Other businesses have been
set up to recondition white goods so as to provide low cost products to low
income families, and renovate old buildings. In some places community
businesses are managing workspace, thereby helping to create further jobs.
Close links have in many cases been established with local authorities which
have seen the community businesses as a way of creating jobs and bringing
back self-respect to areas suffering from the decline of traditional
industries.
In central Cardiff, Packet Promotional Services, a company set up with local
authority help, has created jobs for people with learning disabilities,
packing promotional literature for a big national group, while on the city's
Ely Estate businesses repairing garden tools and upholstery have been
created. In nearby Barry, an area badly affected by closures in the chemical
industry, a community enterprise is providing catering at a South Glamorgan
county council leisure centre.
'We look to see what local services can be provided to get the economy going
again. People gain skills which they can use in the community and their
friends and neighbours are encouraged to do likewise,' Mr Peter Lewis,
finance director of CEW, observes. 'Local authorities now see this as a way
of delivering part of their economic development strategy and of helping the
most marginal communities.'

MBO - Rhys David charts the success story of community-based enterprises

Mrs Alison Knight, a ceramic artist, found herself becoming a small
businesswoman when she needed factory floorspace to lay out the tiles she
had agreed to make for an architect working on a pop star's swimming pool.
The contract fell through, but after discussions with the council covering
the Ystradgynlais area, north-east of Swansea, she decided to start up on
her own to make ceramic products.
Six years and numerous business courses later, she has a projected turnover
this year of more than Pounds 300,000, and a staff of 15. Her husband has
joined her to help run the business, and the factory is being purchased. The
outlets for her product - a range of perfumed pomanders - have expanded from
craft shops in tourist centres to some of the biggest high street outlets,
including the Body Shop, Boots, and from next year Marks &amp; Spencer, with
mail order also being added.
Mrs Knight's company, Alexander Ceramics, is one of a number of success
stories in a part of Britain which - admittedly from a low base - has bucked
the trend of declining manufacturing employment.
New starts, re-starts, expansion schemes and management buy-outs - some
involving incomers and others local people - have made it possible for
employment to grow in the decade since 1981 by just under 19 per cent. The
population of the area is now back over 200,000, reversing 100 years of
decline.
The attractions of mid-Wales to the independently-minded, keen to start up
on their own are obvious, but the challenges of operating from the area have
meant that only those with determination have survived.
At Alexander Ceramics, turnover in the first year was a mere Pounds 6,000
and just double that in year two. The product line had to be pruned and
effort concentrated on smaller items - ceramic shells, fish and farmyard
animals - before growth really began, and as Mrs Knight points out, she has
had to be involved as owner- proprietor in every aspect of running the
business, from design through marketing to cleaning. Staff have had to be
flexible, hand-painting her range of figures one moment, packaging them the
next.
With the exception of modest grants and loans from the local council and the
Development Board for Rural Wales (DBRW), finance has so far been generated
internally. The company is now preparing to scale up its operations,
introducing products using non-ceramic materials, meeting bigger customer
orders and servicing overseas markets.
Several miles away at Abercraf, Mr Peter Taplow and his partner, Mr Nigel
Bruce, are operating at a different end of the scale - making a success of
their management buy-out of the remnants of what was until 20 years ago a
substantial part of Britain's automotive instrumentation industry.
Caerbont Automotive Instruments was established in the village of the same
name, near Abercraf, to carry on the manufacture of automotive instruments
on a much smaller scale after Lucas, the former owners, had decided on a new
product line - wire harnesses - for the former Smiths Industries plant it
acquired in the early 1980s in nearby Ystradgynlais.
By the end of the 1980s ownership of the Caerbont factory had passed into
the hands of German company, VDO, which had decided to move into the UK to
supply the new Japanese car plants then being built.
When, after a change of sourcing strategy, VDO decided in April last year to
close the surviving Caerbont plant - at that stage down to a workforce of
100 - Mr Taplow persuaded the company it would be less costly to sell it to
him and his partner for a total of Pounds 250,000.
The partners' first stop was the DBRW which paid for a feasibility study by
Touche Ross in Cardiff. 3i's Cardiff office eventually provided 25 per cent
of the capital with a mixture of equity and mezzanine finance, but with the
big banks and other financial institutions less than keen, the two partners
had to find the remaining finance themselves.
So far, the gamble is working. Caerbont supplies the spares market for the
British instruments once fitted to all UK-made cars, as well as original
equipment for Leyland Trucks, Land-Rover Defenders and LDV, the vans buy-out
from Leyland Daf Trucks. (It also has a number of interesting niche markets,
including one supplying the original, large-size, Austin Mini speedometer
for retrofitting by Japanese enthusiasts into new Minis).
The company is now making a profit on a turnover of more than Pounds 6m and
has a strong current order book and sales well ahead of plan. Employment is
up to 130 people from 105, investment is planned in research and
development, new products are being introduced, engineers are being hired,
and a modest drive will be made into export markets.
The challenges faced by Caerbont and Alexander Ceramics are those of
entrepreneurs everywhere. High interest charges have (temporarily) ceased to
be a concern but sceptical banks, made cautious by the lending disasters of
the 1980s and focused on security, are still a worry.
For both companies the support given by the DBRW has been important, a point
also made by other companies moving into the area, such as Beacon Foods -
which in less than two years has grown to supply a total of more than 5
tonnes a week of pureed and peeled garlic, ginger and other products to food
manufacturers and restaurants from a factory in Brecon  - and Brook
Thompson, which has been supplying generating equipment for the plant hire
industry, also from Brecon, since 1979.
For many companies uncertainty over DBRW's remit has, therefore, been a
cause of concern. Under plans announced by Mr John Redwood, the Welsh
Secretary, the board is retaining its promotional and development role but
handing over its grant-giving functions to local authorities. A new grants
administration structure has yet to be put in place, however, causing some
businesses to put expansion plans on hold.
The problems are being resolved but it is a reminder that confidence can be
fragile. The concerns of businesses in the area are important, too, because
of the continuing size of the task in mid-Wales. Most of the successes have
been in the eastern part of the region, closest to the English border, but
high unemployment still affects the western parts of the territory, and in
south Snowdonia a big gap in the local economy will be created by the
closure of the Trawsfynydd nuclear power station.
More entrepreneurs will have to be encouraged to set up or expand businesses
in these areas if the board's objective of bringing the region up to
European Union levels of prosperity are to be realised.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Survey of Enterprise in Wales (9): New life in the valleys -
Roland Adburgham reports on the partnership approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM

<TEXT>
The Victorian edifice, inscribed 'Messrs Nixons' Workmen's Institute,
Library &amp; Public Hall', has seen better days. The building, in Mountain Ash,
Mid-Glamorgan, is derelict and its once-handsome yellow and red brick
frontage is sprouting weeds.
Mountain Ash is in Cynon Valley, in the heart of Mid Glamorgan and at the
heart of attempts to revitalise the south Wales valleys. Once there were 50
collieries in Cynon Valley alone and there was a population of 100,000.
Today, the population is 67,000 and male unemployment is about 30 per cent.
This year, British Coal stopped production at Tower, its last deep mine in
south Wales, at the northern end of the valley.
Nixons typifies the challenge: it ran one of the collieries near Mountain
Ash. Though the pit closed more than 40 years ago, its black scars remained
until recently. Today, the memory of Nixons is being consigned to the past:
on the pit's reclaimed land, there is the Cwm Cynon business centre.
This flagship centre, opened last year on a 60-acre development site and now
fully let, symbolises the efforts being made to revitalise the south Wales
valleys.
It is one result of a joint venture, launched in 1991, of the borough
council, county council and Welsh Development Agency. In the wake of the
Tower closure, the WDA investment in the venture has been increased to
Pounds 28m over the next two years.
As elsewhere in the valleys, a partnership approach is seen as the best
means of co-ordinating measures to repair the damage to the environment,
regenerate the towns and lever in private capital to create jobs.
At Merthyr Tydfil, for example, a joint venture includes the borough
council, Mid Glamorgan county council and WDA in association with Merthyr
Business Forum. To encourage the growth of local companies, a business
centre was opened last November. The partnership has come up with a scheme
to develop five key sites which would be linked with each other and the town
centre by monorail, to help counter the drift away of retail spending.
In Gwent, the Victoria Partnership - formed by the WDA, Blaenau Gwent
council and the county council - is transforming 80 acres of the Ebbw Vale
garden festival into an urban village and, it is hoped, eventually local
employment for 1,100 people. Many of the festival features are being
retained, including the wetlands and woodland areas.
'We are still getting 100,000 visitors a year and the reaction has been
excellent - that they have not returned to find a derelict site,' says Mr
Alan Nicoll, of the WDA and head of the partnership. The target year for
completion is 2000 and all 50 of the houses in the first phase have sold.
Redrow Homes is the lead developer for the second phase of the village
centre, which will have about 200 houses. 'The scheme is now seen by people
as a success, and people want to jump on the back of success,' Mr Nicoll
says.
Also in Gwent is Tredegar Action, a partnership of the WDA, Blaenau Gwent
borough council and county council, which involves a Pounds 3m refurbishment
of the shopping centre by TBI, the Welsh-based property developer.
In another town regeneration scheme, the Land Authority for Wales has signed
a Pounds 20m contract with Boots Properties to transform the shopping centre
of Caerphilly in the southern part of Rhymney Valley. It took seven years
for the authority, which assembles difficult sites for development, to
unravel the complex land ownerships.
Mr Ian MacVicar, Rhymney Valley's economic development officer, says: 'What
we are finding is that the valleys as a whole are now regarded as a place
where industry can prosper. The old problems of poor transport and the
legacy of the industrial revolution are largely things of the past.'
Visitors to the valleys cannot but be unaware of the land reclamation, urban
renewal and road improvements (the Welsh Office is giving a high priority to
the dualling of the A465 Heads of the Valleys road, which will speed links
with the English Midlands.) The need is obvious - a decayed environment is
only a mask hiding deeper economic and social problems.
The woe-begone appearance of Mountain Ash is not untypical. Old-fashioned
shops, with such names as Plain &amp; Fancy, Home Comforts and Rita's Fashions,
are next to estate agencies offering terraced cottages for as little as
Pounds 20,000. Though the valley's employers include Hitachi, AB
Electronics, Pirelli and Gooding Sanken, 42 per cent of the workforce are
employed elsewhere.
To widen the industrial base, the Cynon Valley partnership hopes to attract
25 new businesses by 1998, and to set up 200 local businesses. Last year, a
technology training centre was opened with over 300 places. At the southern
end of the valley and close to the M4, Navigation Park, a 15-acre business
site, is being developed. Other money is going on land reclamation, tree
planting, refurbishing the housing stock and improving the valley's
principal town, Aberdare (where Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm, has
been asked to investigate a controversial land deal).
'We're keen to improve the built environment quickly as quality sells,' says
Mr Andrew Dakin, the WDA project director. 'We are taking a holistic view on
regeneration - it's not just factory building or jobs  - it's everything
nowadays.'
Mr Chris Burns, the council's economic development officer, is realistic.
'The jury is out on us until we start to deliver the jobs. If we don't, then
we have failed.' But there is confidence that the partnership is doing the
spadework. Mr Dakin remarks: 'In the property world some of the key players
are starting to be aware of the existence of Cynon Valley - before, no one
knew.'
Mr Tony Roberts, the borough council's chief executive, points to the kudos
of the Royal Opera House siting its Pounds 4m scenery store near Aberdare.
'They trawled the UK for a site,' he says. 'We're very competitive on grants
and land prices and I think others will follow. We have the locations,
communications, available land and factories, and labour. We have all the
pieces of the jigsaw. We are now able to compete in the marketplace.'

FT  07 SEP 94 / Survey of Enterprise in Wales (8): The elite from outside -
Business and the Welsh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RHYS DAVID

<TEXT>
One of the things which puzzles visitors to Wales is why so few people whom
they meet running small businesses or tourist facilities are Welsh. The fact
that newcomers have so evidently prospered in Wales in recent years suggests
the opportunities are there, but the low profile of the Welsh, and in
particular the country's 500,000 Welsh speakers, suggests the locals are not
taking advantage of them.
This apparent lack of entrepreneurialism - in both language communities -
has been the subject of academic research in recent years and is behind the
formation of Menter a Busnes (Enterprise and Business) which has a brief to
help Welsh speakers to develop their economic potential and so bring renewed
economic vitality to parts of Wales where unemployment and migration of
young people remain high.
Their Protestant background should perhaps have predisposed the Welsh to
enterprise, but historians believe other, less favourable influences have
been at work. Though Wales was among the most industrialised parts of the
world in the 18th and 19th centuries, the pattern of land ownership resulted
in a largely non-Welsh elite controlling, and deriving most of the benefits
from, mineral extraction. This, Mr Merfyn Jones of University of Wales,
Bangor, points out, prevented the emergence of an indigenous entrepreneurial
class.
Social mobility among Welsh people has until comparatively recently been
associated not with business but with learning - education, the law,
medicine and the church. The dominance of two industries in the Welsh
economy - iron and steel, and coal - and their eventual state control after
the war added a further dimension, encouraging many Welsh people to see the
public sector as offering the best career prospects.
M a B has done its own probing which has analysed this legacy. Its study of
80 Welsh businesses - 40 run by Welsh-speakers and 20 each by
English-speaking Welsh people and newcomers, spread across four small towns
 -has found significant differences in the types of business in which the
groups are represented and, indeed, in the personalities of those running
them, with the biggest differences occurring between the Welsh-speakers and
the newcomers.
On the whole, Welsh-speakers tended to be traditional in their approach to
business, reluctant to take on extensive borrowing, and anxious to keep
activities within safe and stable boundaries. Product ranges were
conservative, with changes often customer-driven, and prices were set in
line with competitors. Because customers were often known, there was a
willingness to advance credit.
The newcomers, partly because many were starting up in a new area where they
had few contacts, found they had to be more innovative. This was manifested
in a willingness to borrow, a reluctance to extend credit, and a much more
aggressive approach to marketing and product pricing.
The Welsh-speakers were also less self-confident and more anxious, and
tended to see their business in subjective terms. 'Non-Welsh speakers feel
that it is possible to improve their business by adding to their education
or by going on courses. Welsh speakers blame the weaknesses of the business
on their own personal shortcomings,' Mr Hywel Evans, director of M a B,
observes.
With this evidence to hand and using detailed census information on Welsh
job characteristics, M a B has devised programmes to change attitudes and
get more Welsh people to think about going into business. After only five
years, there are signs that subtle changes are being achieved.
The Welsh language broadcast media have been encouraged to feature business
more prominently in their programmes, and by focusing on successes to create
positive role models as an antidote to the previously negative images of
business and business people.
Welsh language course material suitable for use from primary through to
further education has been devised, and community groups have been
encouraged through a business game, Chwylbro] to make business issues a
natural topic of discussion.
The signs, according to Professor Phil Cooke, of University of Wales,
Cardiff, are that a turnround in attitudes has begun. Studies undertaken for
M a B in 1993 by Beaufort Research showed Welsh speakers had become more
aware of successful business role models and thought of Wales more
positively as a business location. In addition, the Welsh language had come
to be seen by both language groups as offering business advantages.
Other positive signs have emerged, including greater interest among Welsh
businessmen and women in banding together to exploit opportunities. In
Gwynedd the Welsh-language market has created a strong print sector but this
was under threat from English printers willing to compete for local - and
even Welsh language - trade. Rather than retreat, as might have happened in
the past, the Welsh companies are coming together to mount their own joint
marketing venture.
Another indication of the new self-confidence of Welsh speakers in business
has been the emergence in Cardiff of a business group working in
professional services. The group, Cwlwm Busnes Caerdydd a'r Cylch, has a
mailing list of more than 300 members who meet regularly throughout the
year.
One of the prime movers, Mr Dafydd Hampson-Jones, director of Celtic
Henderson Crosthwaite in Cardiff, part of Bank of Yokohama-owned Guinness
Mahon, offers investment advice through the medium of Welsh - making it
necessary to invent a new range of terms (such as breingyfrannau di-fuddran
or zero dividend preference shares).
He recently placed what is probably the first bilingual tombstone
advertisement for a share placing involving a north Wales TV production
company, and estimates 25 per cent of his company's private client business
is conducted through the medium of Welsh.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Survey of Enterprise in Wales (7): Springboard for
prosperity - Roland Adburgham on efforts to encourage enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Explaining why the Wales 2010 report, commissioned by the Institute of Welsh
Affairs, had advocated a 'Wales - Land of Enterprise' campaign, Dr Gareth
Jones says: 'We felt it critically important to create a positive view of
enterprise.'
The report, produced last year by a group chaired by Dr Jones, set out to
identify how Wales could become one of the most prosperous regions of Europe
by 2010. It advocated 'keynote years' with themes to stimulate progress
towards this target - beginning with the Land of Enterprise.
The campaign has been slow to gain momentum - a launch conference originally
proposed for May will take place next month - but Dr Jones stresses it is a
springboard for a long-term plan to change the image of Wales over the next
decade.
Outside Wales, he says, there remains a perception problem. 'There is still
an image of miners going home from the coalpit. There are still elements of
churches, chapels, harps and singing.'
Within Wales, Dr Jones states, 'our aims are the creation of an enterprise
culture, to encourage innovation and technology, and to improve education
and training. But it is a mammoth task to try to change the culture of a
nation stuck in a pattern for 200 years - you can't change it overnight or
in a single year.'
The need, he emphasises, is clear. 'Wales has the lowest regional income of
any region and it has not advanced because the emphasis has been on 'a job
is a job is a job'. We want a highly educated labour force which will have
higher added value.'
He acknowledges the difficulties in convincing people of the campaign's
merits. 'Always - particularly in Wales - there is a certain amount of
scepticism. It is quite an ambition - but what we are doing has widespread
support. We were very concerned to ensure we involved organisations which
already existed as part of the process - not to go off on our own tack.'
In consequence, a broadly-based, if unwieldy, steering group was set up with
over 20 members drawn from leading organisations in the public and private
sectors. Mr John Webb, president of Wales Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
chairs it.
The Wales 2010 report concluded that growth in the Welsh economy would come
increasingly from smaller companies, and to achieve this growth there needed
to be a climate in Wales that was supportive of enterprise. An emphasis of
the campaign, Dr Jones states, is to encourage small and medium-sized
companies not only to grow but to remain in Wales. 'There are so many
examples of businesses being started and then 'sold over the bridge',' he
says, referring to the Severn crossing between Wales and England.
There is general concern in Wales at ownership of companies moving outside
the principality. Price Waterhouse Wales points out that until Biotrace
International of Bridgend floated last November, and the reverse takeover in
March of the property company Markheath by TBI, based at St Mellons, five
years had elapsed since Wales had had a new quoted company.
Dr Owen Jones, who chaired the enterprise taskforce for Wales 2010, comments
that, with inward investment likely to play a less vital role in future, 'it
is most important to have more companies with their corporate headquarters
and decision-making in Wales'.
A central objective of the campaign is to set up an enterprise foundation.
Although this would require substantial public sector funding to get it off
the ground, the foundation would be intended ultimately to make Wales less
dependent on public sector leadership.
Dr Gareth Jones adds: 'We want to get the young people of Wales by 2010 to
say: 'We want to set up our own business.' Attitudes in schools have got to
change.' The conference, to be held in Cardiff on October 20, will
especially target the 16-25 age group with seminars run by people who have
set up their own businesses. Training and enterprise councils in south Wales
will participate to promote the Investors in People programme.
The effective delivery of advice, whether to young people setting up
businesses or to established companies, is an important factor in
encouraging enterprise. To simplify matters, the Department of Trade &amp;
Industry has been encouraging one-stop shops in England called Business
Links, but the Welsh Office is more guarded about this concept.
Although the Welsh Office promises start-up funding, it has warned that
additional tiers of administration and separate legal entities should not be
created - nor should there be new premises. Local authorities, Tecs and
others have been invited to submit proposals by the end of this month. 'I
only want a response if you can offer a better service with less confusion
and bureaucracy,' Mr John Redwood, Welsh Secretary, told them.
What has been described as a 'one-stop shop for engineering', and which was
welcomed by Mr Redwood, is the Engineering Centre for Wales. This was set up
in March - with pump priming from the Welsh Office, Welsh Development
Agency, Engineering Council and Royal Academy of Engineering - to enhance
the quality of the industry and encourage young people to become engineers.
'We need a new generation of mad inventors and great entrepreneurs,' Mr
Redwood said at the centre's launch in a speech recalling Brunel's Great
Western railway and Stephenson's Rocket. Neither engineer was Welsh, but
that young Welsh people can show entrepreneurial spirit was shown in July,
when a team of 11 girls at a Barry comprehensive school won the UK Young
Enterprise competition, sponsored by Midland Bank.
The company they had formed concerns a faster means of communications than
the railways - it makes computer mouse mats.

Roland Adburgham looks at the industrial base

For Wales, one of the coups this summer was the announcement that
Tech-Board, a Pounds 40m start-up UK company, would site a hardboard mill,
employing 200 people, near Ebbw Vale in Gwent.
Mr Malcolm Graham, Tech-Board's chief executive, explained why. 'The
region's strong manufacturing heritage and the availability of a quality,
highly motivated workforce played a major part in our decision,' he said.
'The excellent communications with the rest of the UK and continental
Europe, via the Heads of the Valleys road and the M4, were also important.'
Other key factors, he said, were the support of the Welsh Office, local
authorities and the Welsh Development Agency. British Coal Enterprise, the
job creation offshoot, put in Pounds 250,000 of the venture capital.
Similar stories from other companies explain why Wales continues to attract
manufacturing investment. The combination of welcoming local authorities,
active development agencies and the availability of grants helped Wales to
be the only UK region to increase manufacturing's share of gross domestic
product between 1980 and 1992.
Inward investment has played a crucial part in enabling Wales to retain a
manufacturing base, despite the contraction of its traditional heavy
industries. There are about 350 overseas-owned manufacturing plants in
Wales, nearly 100 more than in 1985, and employment by these has risen by 50
per cent.
While competition to win such projects has become tougher, inward investment
has not stopped. In May, for example, the Canadian company Fisher Gauge
opened a European headquarters at Welshpool, Powys, to make small die-cast
components. Mr Bill Fisher, president, said it chose Welshpool because of
'its good transportation links and good working environments'. In July,
Nippon Electric Glass and Schott Glaswerke said it would site a Pounds 200m
manufacturing plant at Cardiff Bay.
Fears that the world recession would make Wales vulnerable to cutbacks of
'branch-plants' appear overstated. There has been retrenchment: Wella, the
German group, is closing its Ondawel hair cosmetics unit at Pontyclun, near
Cardiff, with the loss of 150 jobs. Compton Webb, a uniforms maker with
several UK plants, shut its Newport factory with 230 redundancies to reduce
capacity. The closure this year of BP Chemicals' ethylene cracker plant at
Baglan Bay meant 600 jobs were lost.
However, non-Welsh companies are continuing to invest in their businesses in
Wales. This spring, Sony opened a frame-making operation at its Bridgend
television plant, increasing its Welsh workforce to about 2,700. Another
Japanese company, Sharp, is investing Pounds 5.5m in its microwave oven
plant at Wrexham, Clwyd.
A criticism of many inward investments has been that they have provided only
low-paid assembly-type work. But Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, chairman of the Welsh
Development Agency, comments: 'Overseas companies, once established, are
becoming more committed to Wales, viewing the principality as the best
location for European headquarters, research and development and
manufacturing. This is, in turn, improving both the number and the quality
of jobs.'
Such projects this year have included a Pounds 2m European research and
development centre for Calsonic International, the Japanese-owned radiator
company, at Llanelli. Automotive components have become one of the
principality's key industries, ranging geographically from Ford's engine
plant at Bridgend in south Wales to Toyota's engine plant on Deeside, north
Wales. It is estimated about 20,000 are employed in the sector.
It is often overlooked that the steel industry, where there has been huge
investment, remains one of the biggest employers - British Steel has a
workforce of more than 14,000 in Wales. Aerospace has also become a sizeable
industry. Its labour force is over 11,000 people, spurred recently by the
British Airways Pounds 75m maintenance base at Cardiff-Wales airport and
Pounds 23m avionic component repair business at Llantrisant.
In a different sector, an interesting turnround has been achieved at CP
Pharmaceuticals, which a management buy-in team acquired last year from
Fisons. Mr Andrew Coveney, finance director, says the company - based at
Wrexham and making hospital and generic products - had been under threat of
closure after multi-million pound losses.
'Since then, we have gone from strength to strength, having changed from
being an outpost of a big plc to become a medium-sized, thriving, profitable
and totally independent company.' The 194 jobs were retained and 20 more
people have since been recruited.
Another company in a growth industry is Nimbus Manufacturing at Cwmbran,
Gwent. It made the first compact disc in Britain 10 years ago and now
produces over 35m annually. It is investing Pounds 2.5m in its plant, which
employs 300 people, this year and sees immense potential for CD-ROMs, the
discs which store text, video, sound and graphics. Mr Howard Nash, managing
director, describes Cwmbran as a good location for its road distribution -
though, like other south Wales businessmen, he is concerned at the
possibility of future motorway tolls.
Wind farms are another novel - but controversial - industry, with a belated
recognition that there needs to be tight control over their siting. Europe's
largest wind farm, with 103 turbines, is at Llandinam, Montgomeryshire.
Among investments this year by indigenous businesses has been that by
Control Techniques, a leading producer of electronic drives and controls. At
Newtown in mid-Wales, it is spending Pounds 8.5m to expand its European
headquarters, R&amp;D and production. Stephens &amp; George, which prints about 100
magazine titles, is investing Pounds 3.7m at its Merthyr Tydfil plant. Halo
Foods, at Tywyn, Gwynedd, has a Pounds 3.25m expansion to meet demand for
its Halo chocolate snack bar.
There are signs, as the recovery gains ground, of increasing activity. The
venture capital group 3i put Pounds 8m into 17 Welsh companies in the year
to March. It reports a 'noticeable increase in the level of growth of
capital funding, as businesses moved to strengthen their balance sheets to
take advantage of post-recession opportunities'.
Made, the valleys enterprise agency, advised in 1993-94 on 182 business
plans with an overall funding need of Pounds 10.5m, three times the amount
sought in the previous year. As big businesses continue to reduce their
workforces, much will depend on the growth of such smaller, indigenous
businesses.
One need is for more component suppliers and the Source Wales programme, run
by the WDA, encourages links between companies. Another scheme, organised by
the Welsh Office and Wales Quality Centre (a non-profitmaking company to
promote quality improvement), is 'Inside Welsh Industry'. This is a series
of visits to selected companies to enable business people to learn from
their techniques and technologies.
To promote technology transfer, Transtech International fair, organised by
the WDA, is to be held in Cardiff in early December. It will enable academic
and research organisations to meet companies so as to encourage partnerships
for product development.

When Admiral Insurance, which specialises in over-the-telephone motor
policies, set up in Cardiff in January 1993, it was uncertain if it could
recruit the people it needed.
There were many positive factors: the transport links with London, an
enthusiastic county council, cheap and available office space, and grant
support of Pounds 1m.
A stumbling block was the difficulty of persuading managers to relocate
because of the dwindling disparity in house prices between the south-east
and Wales, and a shortage of executive houses (a frequent complaint by
relocating companies). But the big imponderable, because it was hard to
research in advance, was the quality of the local labour.
After 19 months, Mr David Stevens, Admiral's marketing manager, gives his
verdict. 'We've been very pleased with the quality of the labour force,
notably their reliability and stability. The level of turnover of staff is
much lower, and the staff's longer-term commitment to the company is higher,
than we would have experienced in the south-east.'
In manufacturing industry, Mr Alfred Gooding, head of Gooding Group, is an
equally keen advocate of the virtues of Welsh workers, which is one reason
why his new joint venture with Grundig, the Germany consumer electronics
company, is sited at Llantrisant near Cardiff. Many other employers in Wales
talk of the flexibility and reliability of their staff. Last year, days lost
per 1,000 employees due to industrial action were 21, compared with a UK
average of 30.
However, while unemployment in Wales has been reduced to about the UK
average, this disguises higher levels of male unemployment. In pockets this
is severe, with consequent social problems.
A survey last year of a randomly-chosen street on a housing estate in
Blaenau Gwent found only 22 adults were working and 60 were out of work.
Disability or long-term illness was common. One man had been out of work for
17 years and several for seven to 10 years. Of those in work, many were on
low incomes.
The survey was published in 'The politics of poverty in Blaenau Gwent', by
Llew Smith, the local Labour MP, Lynda Bransbury and Sarah Gillam. The
authors remarked: 'An overwhelming number of households complained about
being in debt and failing to manage on benefit levels.'
In Wales as a whole, gross earnings of full-time employees last year
averaged Pounds 281 a week, only 89 per cent of the figure for Britain. For
workers to raise their incomes, there is an obvious need for higher skills.
For companies, a shortage of skilled labour is seen as a constraint on
expansion as the recovery gathers pace.
In one initiative, the Welsh Office announced in June it would fund a Pounds
3.6m scheme to support 550 engineering apprenticeships, provide engineering
equipment for colleges, and instruct workplace trainers. Sir Wyn Roberts,
then Welsh minister, commented: 'Manufacturing is a key sector in the Welsh
economy, but a common theme in my discussions with industrialists is the
shortage of trained people at craft and technician levels.'
The need is also for better school results. Welsh boys have lagged behind
their English and, in particular, Northern Irish and Scottish counterparts
in gaining A-levels (or the equivalent). This year, the chief inspector of
schools in Wales reported that although there had been 'a steady improvement
in pupils' performance within GCSE at every level . . . much
under-expectation of pupils remains.'
There has been a big rise in the numbers of those in Wales who go on to
further education, from 36 per cent in 1988-89 to 53 per cent. However,
female students - who achieve better school results than males - also
outnumber them in further education by 20 per cent.
In spite of this, fewer women are economically active than in other parts of
Britain. Yet the proportion of women in work has risen sharply in recent
years, partly because of part- time working. A survey by the Welsh training
and enterprise councils, published this year, showed 57 per cent of
employees were male and 43 per cent female, but in small firms the balance
was almost equal. Nearly three times as many women as men worked part-time.
Among the full-time workers, female weekly earnings in Wales were on average
27 per cent below male earnings in 1992. 'People and Prosperity, a Challenge
to Wales', published last November by the Welsh Office, pointed out that
both men and women tended to follow stereotyped vocational routes. 'Women
are much more likely than men to be in unskilled and semi-skilled jobs, and
in jobs without long-term career prospects,' it said.
'They are in turn under-represented at the senior levels of industry, public
service and the professions as compared with UK averages.' The report added:
'Employers in Wales are losing by this waste of resources.'
One determined attempt to reduce this waste is Chwarae Teg, the women's fair
play organisation launched in 1992. This year, it received Welsh Office
funding of Pounds 50,000 with a commitment for two more years. Chwarae Teg,
which has become a non-profitmaking company, aims to encourage good practice
in training, flexible working and better childcare to enable women to return
to work or training. It has become a role model for similar initiatives in
England.
Women in Enterprise, an independent networking support group, was launched
in 1990 to raise the status of women in business and the professions. It has
corporate and individual members and does not exclude men - 'We do not
believe it is realistic to survive in a one-gender vacuum,' says Ms Jeannie
Hainsworth Lamb, the chairman. But she points out that Wales still has a
male-dominated culture. Women are under pressure to conform to domestic
roles and find it hard to be promoted.
'Lip service is paid to equal opportunities,' she says, 'but what is wanted
is more practical help.'

Cardiff Property

Delight - mixed with some relief - swept through the Cardiff Bay Development
Corporation in July when Nippon Electric Glass of Japan and Schott Glaswerke
of Germany announced they would locate a 500,000 sq ft new plant costing
Pounds 200m near the city's waterfront.
Delight that one of Britain's biggest inward investment schemes this year,
creating up to 750 jobs over five years in a high technology industry making
glass components for the television industry, was coming to the area; relief
that after a long gap a 'headline' scheme had been attracted against
international competition, possibly opening the way for other companies to
follow.
Cardiff Bay's biggest successes to date - headquarters buildings for NCM, a
credit insurer, and for the Welsh Health Common Services Agency - were
announced in 1992. Both buildings will be occupied shortly. Though there
have been other developments, including a relocation by Axa, the French
insurance group, to a 44,000 sq ft building, Meridian Gate, on the fringes
of the area, a new supermarket by Tesco on the Penarth side of the bay, and
Techniquest, a Pounds 7.5m science centre due to open next year, the weak
economic environment of the past few years has put a brake on the hoped-for
relocations .
Yet the measured pace at which the huge area - a total of 2,700 acres,
equivalent to one-sixth the size of Cardiff itself - has been attracting
development, may turn out to be an advantage. In London docklands
development took place ahead of infrastructure, a mistake which Cardiff,
with its ambitious target of attracting Pounds 2.5bn over a 10-15 year
timescale, has been able to avoid.
The centrepiece - a two-thirds of a mile long barrage which will impound a
500-acre lake and help to create an eight-mile waterfront - was started in
February, and is expected to be completed in 1998. The peripheral
distributor road which will take traffic through the bay has been largely
completed from the west and will emerge from a tunnel section into the heart
of the bay area by the end of the year. Another section taking traffic east
to connect with the M4 should be completed before the end of the decade.
Other parts of the jigsaw, creating a mixed-use development in an area which
offers outstanding waterfront opportunities and also takes in Cardiff's
docklands and older industrial areas, are being put in place. On the site of
former car scrapyards Wilson Bowden, the Midlands developer, plans a Pounds
50m retail and leisure scheme, including Pounds 10m worth of infrastructure;
TBI, a local development joint venture, has recently started the first phase
of a 140,000 sq ft speculative industrial scheme; housing schemes, including
the provision of some social housing and involving local and national groups
such as Beazer, Wimpey and Barratt are going ahead at various sites; and
Associated British Ports' property arm, Grosvenor Waterside, is hoping to
put a 100,000 sq ft new office development, Scott Harbour, out to tender
shortly, for a 1995 start. The development - for which at least a partial
pre-let is being sought - will be available to a single occupier, or split
into up to five units of 10,000 sq ft or more.
The shape of the area around the old Pier Head, now called the inner
harbour, is also becoming clear. Next to ABP's south Wales docks office a
new hotel is planned, together with an opera house, the design for which is
now being selected from a shortlist of eight. It is hoped the opening next
year of a silver service Harry Ramsden fish restaurant will encourage the
growth of a food quarter like those in Boston and Baltimore in the US.
An important issue, however, is the impact that work on this scale is going
to have on the rest of Cardiff, and in particular whether the redeveloped
bay will be a natural graft or present the existing city centre with a
damaging rival.
Demand for offices in Cardiff - the likely main determinant of the success
or otherwise of the bay - has averaged in recent years around 200,000 sq ft
a year. Though there is a substantial surplus of space in central Cardiff at
present, much of it is in secondary locations and not high quality. Room for
further expansion in the city centre is limited.
However, demand remains relatively weak, and because of a narrowing of the
once substantial gap between London and Cardiff rents - and an overhang of
space in other provincial cities - relocations are unlikely in the medium
term to provide a significant boost to indigenous demand.
Nevertheless, the concept is right, says Mr Peter Kelly, regional chairman
of property agents, DTZ Debenham Thorpe. 'Cardiff needs a new business
quarter. The city centre is full and the bay is already proving attractive
to tenants.'
Whether the two areas can grow together beneficially is going to depend also
on the solution of transport problems. A big growth in office development in
the bay area - soon likely to be employing more than 4,500 office workers -
could lead to serious traffic congestion if adequate public transport is not
put in place.
Various studies have pointed to the need for a light rail system which could
be linked to the extensive Cardiff suburban and valleys rail network.
Decisions have yet to be taken, however, in part because of the lack of an
overall transport planning authority for the region and the likely cost.
There is another physical constraint which the bay planners have been
seeking to overcome. Cardiff is bisected by the main London railway line, to
the south of which the bay area lies. There are plans to give the city's
main station a new southerly entrance and to create a large new square - the
Bridge area - which would link the two parts of the city but design of this
scheme has proved difficult. Delays also seem likely on another city-bay
connector, the broad avenue to run both sides of the rail link into the
docks.
Nevertheless, the Cardiff bay authorities are confident the problems can be
overcome, and a deadline may concentrate their minds. The corporation is due
to wind up at the end of 1999, but, perhaps even more importantly March 1 is
pencilled in as the opening date for the new opera house.
For this to be a truly gala occasion, a grand entrance and and a matching
backdrop will need to be in evidence.

Industrial Sites

The concrete blocks of Trawsfynydd nuclear power station in Gwynedd are in
gaunt contrast to the surrounding beauty of Snowdonia national park. Its
closure, announced in July last year, has threatened an equally gaunt future
for its workforce, and for local young people who have lost a potential
place to work.
Wales has had to come to terms with the rundown in its traditional
industries. In Gwynedd, for example, over 15,000 people used to be employed
in slate quarries; today there are only 300. It is ironic that as recent an
industry as nuclear electricity should create similar difficulties. The
power station was the largest local employer, with 600 staff at its peak,
but by 1997 only 50 will remain for site security.
Like the heavy industries, Trawsfynydd will leave a legacy for generations -
Nuclear Electric is expected shortly to announce its decommissioning
strategy. While there will not be the need, as in south Wales, to repair
land dereliction, what has to be ensured is that incoming industries do not
damage Gwynedd's spectacular environment. Few nowadays would expect a power
station to be built in a national park.
A strategy for regeneration has been devised by South Gwynedd Partnership,
which includes the county and district councils and development agencies.
The region qualifies for European structural funds and has assisted area
status; the partnership is also bidding for an enterprise zone and funding
under the Welsh Office's strategic development scheme.
The Development Board for Rural Wales, one of the partners, is creating a
landscaped 29-acre Snowdonia business park and, making a virtue out of
necessity, says the power station closure provides 'a major opportunity for
employers seeking reliable and responsible staff'.
There are different challenges in the northern part of Gwynedd, where the
dualling of the A55 road has improved the link with the M56 and Manchester
airport. The Welsh Office is giving strategic priority to extending the A55
across Anglesey to Holyhead, with its ferry services to Ireland.
Taking advantage of the improved route are two new business parks near
Bangor established by the Welsh Development Agency. Glyn Rhonwy, with 135
acres at the foot of Snowdon, has attracted the American company Euro/DPC,
which makes medical diagnostic kits. Parc Menai, with 75 wooded acres, is
described by National Westminster Bank, which has a business centre there,
as having 'excellent communications and a superb setting.'
On Parc Menai is Snowdonia Business Innovation Centre, which provides advice
and support for the commercial development of new products and technology.
One current project is to develop a commercial kiln for converting slate
into lightweight aggregate. Dr Tom Parry Jones, inventor of the
breathalyser, is chairman of the centre, which is a member of the European
network of over 100 Bics.
Also based at Parc Menai is Mr Hugh Edwin, the county council's media
development officer, a post which reflects a thriving film industry in
north-west Wales. His office can access the British Film Commission's
national database for finding locations. Sean Connery, Richard Gere and Sir
Anthony Hopkins are all filming in Gwynedd this year. The making of
television programmes for S4C, the Welsh language channel, has stimulated
the local industry which includes Barcud, a production facilities company
which has purpose-built studios in Caernarfon.
In South Wales, Cardiff Bay and its barrage have drawn most attention in the
rejuvenation of land for commerce and industry. But the capital is not alone
in having ambitious plans. Nearby Newport awaits a decision after a public
inquiry into a proposed barrage across the river Usk. While the scheme has
met with vigorous opposition because of its possible effect on river life,
the intention is similarly to provide a better environment for business in a
decayed dockland area.
The rundown docklands at Barry, south- west of Cardiff, are also being
redeveloped by a partnership of the WDA and Associated British Ports. In
March, a parallel partnership - of Vale of Glamorgan borough council, South
Glamorgan county council and the WDA - launched Barry Action. This project
is to improve the town centre, upgrade communications, smarten the area's
appeal for tourism and aid job creation.
Swansea, the second city of Wales, already has its own barrage, across the
river Tawe, and has developed a maritime quarter around a 600-berth marina.
To promote the commercial possibilities, the city hosted presentations
including one at London's Ritz Hotel.
'If you do things to lift your profile, you get the City of London saying,
'What's going on there'?' says Mr Michael Burns, economic development
officer at Swansea Centre for Trade &amp; Industry.
The city will come into further prominence next year as host of the UK year
of literature and writing. The derelict Victorian Guildhall is being
restored to create a national centre of literature due to open in March. By
then, the city will be benefiting from completion of the 'missing link' of
the M4 - the new business opportunities are to be marketed next month at
Swansea Bay industry week.
In the next stage of the city's redevelopment plans, a joint venture of the
city and WDA is putting in the infrastructure for Swansea Vale, which will
become a suburb of 470 acres next to the motorway. About a quarter of the
land will be for industrial and commercial use, and there is space for 1,800
homes and a golf course.
Further along the coast, and also gaining from the motorway completion, is
Llanelli, where the borough council and WDA have an impressive, well-
advanced regeneration programme. The town suffered when Duport steelworks
closed in 1981 and 1,200 jobs were lost.
The two main aims of the partnership are to regenerate 750 acres of disused
industrial land along the coast - two centuries of industrial waste and
dozens of derelict sheds and factories have had to be cleared  - and to
upgrade the town centre.
Over the past four years, the seashore stretch has been transformed, with
three lakes and a wildfowl and wetland centre. A 'coastal village' and
business parks are being created. In the town, a Pounds 20m shopping
complex, developed by Monarch Properties, is due to open in 1996.
'In short,' the partnership confidently states, 'Llanelli means business.'

FT  07 SEP 94 / Survey of Enterprise in Wales (3): From slagheaps to
showpieces - Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To suggest a holiday in industrial South Wales would have seemed an unkind
joke a decade ago, despite the nearby attractions of the Brecon Beacons and
the Pembrokeshire and Gower coasts. Nowadays, a drive up the former mining
valleys shows how much the character of the area has altered in a few years.
Preconceptions of valleys scarred by slagheaps, abandoned steelworks and an
air of hopelessness are soon dispelled. Over Pounds 136m has been spent on
greening the countryside and developing tourist attractions, and beautiful
hills and parkland now cover most of the ugly coaltip scars. There are
forest walks, heritage parks and industrial and craft museums to attract the
visitor.
The valleys of industrial south Wales are joining the glories of the
coastline, the mountains of the north and the green solitude of mid-Wales to
embrace the tourist.
Tourism has always been an important part of the Welsh economy, but until
recently it was relatively low key, fragmented and under-capitalised. It
consisted mostly of traditional family summer holidays in Llandudno and Rhyl
in the north or Tenby and Porthcawl in the south, plus hikers and others
attracted to the national parks of Snowdonia, the Brecon Beacons and the
Pembrokeshire coast.
Two factors have changed attitudes dramatically, however, and led to a much
more coherent, structured study of the industry and how it should be
developed.
The first has been the steady decline of traditional industries such as
coalmining and steel in south Wales, agriculture in rural mid and north
Wales, and more recently, defence industries and air bases in west Wales.
With a need to create jobs, the principality had to exploit its tourist
assets: a beautiful countryside, historic castles, churches and Roman and
Celtic antiquities, plus a distinctive language and culture.
The second trigger for reform and development is the changing holiday habits
of the British. As people began to opt for the guaranteed sunshine of Spain
and Greece, Wales found itself too dependent on the traditional family
summer holiday. Hence, it had to offer fresh attractions.
In its first development plan launched over five years ago, the Wales
Tourist Board put up Pounds 23m of pump-priming capital, which stimulated
investment of Pounds 171m. That helped create 3,500 full-time equivalent
jobs. Tourism is now an increasingly significant industry, employing 95,000
or 9 per cent of the workforce, and earning Pounds 1.3bn for the Welsh
economy. Some 9m people visit Wales a year.
The intention, revealed earlier this year in a study called Tourism 2000, is
to create 10,000 more jobs directly or indirectly, turning tourism into a
Pounds 2bn a year industry by the turn of the century.
Mr Paul Loveluck, WTB's chief executive, says: 'We will target our efforts
at certain overseas markets and at increasing the range of attractions for
those seeking short breaks or second holidays.' Development programmes are
planned for coastal resort regeneration in Tenby, Porthcawl and Llandudno;
in the historic town of Caernarfon; for country holidays; customer care; and
for golf, walking and cycling holidays.
A prime requirement, particularly in the coastal areas most vulnerable to
changing holiday patterns, is to attract visitors more evenly throughout the
year. There are indica tions this is beginning to happen. In general, the
'shoulder' months of May-June and September-October have seen a slow but
steady growth from second holidays and short breaks. In recent years, there
has been a decline in visitors in the peak holiday months, together with a
trend towards later booking and discounting.
However, this year's fine weather and the economic upturn have brought an
increase in hotel occupancy figures over the very poor 1993 season. For
example, Mr George Pearsall, proprietor of the Plas Morfa hotel on the coast
between Aberystwyth and Cardigan, has seen a rise of 25 per cent in
occupancy rates so far this year.
Another major requirement is to attract visitors who spend more money in the
principality. This is being achieved by targeting overseas visitors,
developing areas of tourism such as golf and yachting, and by improving
hotel accommodation and car parking facilities. There are relatively few top
class hotels in Wales, but the standard of accommodation has been improved
greatly by the introduction of a quality grading system.
Wales has fared relatively badly in attracting foreign visitors, with under
4 per cent of the UK total compared with 9.5 per cent for Scotland, and
efforts are being made to improve this. Two years ago the WTB was allowed to
market itself overseas separately from the British Tourist Authority,
something Scotland has done for a decade.
The key target market is the US, and a network of 1,500 travel agents has
been built up in east and west coast cities to promote Wales as part of a UK
tour or as a destination in its own right. Over 300 US travel agents have
been brought to Wales for training visits and they receive regular updates
on new attractions and facilities. Seminars on tourism in Wales are being
held throughout the US next month.
Other markets being researched are Australia, Canada, Germany, the
Netherlands, France, Ireland and Japan. (There appeared to be a big increase
in Dutch, German and French car numberplates in the byways of rural
mid-Wales this summer.)
Over the next three years the WTB plans to double its overseas marketing
budget from Pounds 750,000 to Pounds 1.5m. Mr Loveluck expects overseas
visitors to increase by 6 per cent compared with a 2.5 per cent rise in UK
tourists.
It is accepted that tourism development must not be allowed to harm the
environment or the heritage that draws visitors to Wales. But even this can
be controversial territory. Plans to clear and green some of the remaining
slagheaps around Ebbw Vale are now being criticised for destroying the
country's industrial heritage.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Survey of Enterprise in Wales (1): A portent of recovery -
Though the optimism is tinged with caution, signs from the Welsh economy are
encouraging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM

<TEXT>
When work on the long-delayed Pounds 150m barrage across Cardiff Bay finally
started earlier this year, it could be seen as a portent that the
long-heralded recovery was at last under way in Wales.
Although the business community is careful to tinge optimism with caution,
there has been a string of encouraging signs. That optimism, according to
surveys by the Confederation of British Industry, has risen in the
principality for seven successive quarters. An analysis published last month
by the CBI and the consultancy Business Strat- egies found that
manufacturers had higher expectations for orders and output than in any
other region.
'Wales has weathered the recession quite well and better than some people
might have expected,' says Dr Elizabeth Haywood, director of CBI Wales. And
Mr Robert Ellis, senior partner in south Wales of Touche Ross, the
accountancy firm, comments: 'Confidence is moving slowly in the right
direction.'
A recent Touche Ross/Western Mail survey of business opinion found a third
of companies expected to employ more people in six months' time and only one
in 10 fewer. While 700 redundancies announced last month at Swansea's Driver
and Vehicle Licensing Centre show that big employers are still shedding
jobs, the unemployment rate was down to 9.6 per cent in July (compared with
the UK average of 9.3 per cent).
There are other signs of a pick-up in activity. Mr John Mitchell, chief
executive of Principality Building Society, says the 'feel good' factor has
increased in recent months. 'This year our mortgage lending will break all
previous records.' In July, Cardiff-Wales airport handled a record 144,000
passengers, a rise for the 15th consecutive month. Lending by the Bank of
Wales to manufacturers has increased by nearly 50 per cent over the last 12
months.
Mr Paul Guy, chief executive of TBI, the Cardiff-based property group which
became a quoted company this year, believes business has much improved. But
he warns: 'The market won't help you out in the 1990s like in the 1980s. To
be a success, you have to prove you have a better management team in place.'
The more positive picture cannot disguise the fact that Wales still lags on
a range of measures. The country is seen as having the potential to become
one of Europe's most prosperous regions. First, it has to catch up with
other parts of Britain. Gross domestic product per head was only 86.1 per
cent of the UK average in 1992; remarkably, in view of the restructuring
which has taken place, the gap is just 0.3 per cent narrower than a decade
earlier. Income per head in 1992 was lower than in any other UK region.
The corollary is that Wales would be much worse placed had it not moved from
dependency on coal and steel to a broader-based economy. While service
industries such as tourism are crucial (and agriculture still employs 65,000
people), the revitalised manufacturing base helped the country through the
recession. Steel remains a large employer but, as Dr Haywood says: 'There is
now a very diverse range of industries from biotechnology to textiles.'
Having managed this change, Wales needs a further transition: to foster an
enterprise culture in which small and medium-sized businesses flourish.
There are indications that this can happen. Self- employment has risen by
more than a third since 1979 to 15 per cent of the workforce. Companies
employing fewer than 100 people account for over 90 per cent of
manufacturers. But entrepreneurs are a rare breed and, as elsewhere, many
family-owned firms are content to stay the same size.
As a catalyst, a Land of Enterprise campaign was launched this year in the
wake of the Wales 2010 report for the Institute of Welsh Affairs. A central
objective is to raise educational and training standards. While exam results
are improving, it is significant that, even at this stage of the recovery,
skills shortages are starting to emerge. 'Excellence in education and
training are essential to Wales' success in the next century,' Mr John
Redwood, the Welsh Secretary, said last month. 'We will earn our living more
by our brains than our brawn, more by our own enterprise than by the works
of government.'
One work of government affecting business is the reform of local
authorities, with shadow elections next May to the unitary councils which
will replace the existing two-tier structure. While there is support in
theory, there is less enthusiasm in practice - one council chief executive
describes it as 'an absolute mess.' Mr Michael Rees, director in charge in
Cardiff of Chesterton, the property consultancy, is among those critical of
the decision to have separate authorities for the capital and Vale of
Glamorgan. 'The ability to deliver Cardiff as a major European capital will
not be achieved without the formation of a greater Cardiff.'
The reforms have reinforced pressure for an all-Wales assembly, to which the
Labour party is committed. With Conservatives holding only six of the 38
parliamentary seats, an assembly is advocated as a democratic corrective,
especially in view of the growth of non-elected public bodies, or quangos.
The Council of Welsh Districts estimates there are nearly 350 quangos in
Wales, controlling a fifth of public expenditure.
The most prominent is the Welsh Development Agency. Publicly flayed for past
practices, the WDA retains much support within the business community. It is
admired for its wooing of foreign investors, land reclamation and fostering
of partnerships in urban renewal - the decrepit state of many Welsh towns is
at last being tackled. In mid-Wales, business people this year also sprang
to the defence of the Development Board for Rural Wales when its future was
threatened.
The DBRW has survived, although Mr David Rowe- Beddoe, the WDA chairman, has
also become its chairman to improve co-ordination. Meanwhile, he has
revamped the WDA's management and decentralised the agency's structure. The
aim is to improve co-operation with councils and give more support to
indigenous businesses. 'Small and medium-sized enterprises are our greatest
potential strength for the future,' he has said.
Recognition that there should be more emphasis on these businesses is echoed
by the Welsh Office. One reason is that inward investment, while remaining
important, is not a panacea. Successes continue - notably by Cardiff Bay in
winning a Japanese and German Pounds 200m joint venture - and foreign
companies are investing in their existing Welsh plants. But parts of Wales
lost competitive advantage in the government's review last year of assisted
areas.
Mr Rees of Chesterton warns that Wales faces a difficult task in trying to
keep up its inward investment record. He says: 'Moves out of London are
slowing down because of the abundance of special offers and rent-free
accommodation in the south-east. The differentials between Wales and the
south-east are narrowing, particularly when taking into account the Severn
crossing tolls.'
As the recovery gathers pace, the need for the second Severn bridge, now
under construction, will become even more apparent in combating the
peripheral view of Wales in Europe. Despite other improvements such as the
imminent completion of the M4 near Swansea, and the dualling of the A55 in
north Wales, weaknesses in the road, air and rail network remain. By the
time the new bridge opens in 1996, Welsh enterprises will have discovered to
what extent these weaknesses are further exposed by the Channel tunnel.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Management: From sexual simile to sexual 'crime' - Stuart
Bentley on the dangers of a politically correct definition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART BENTLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few modern plays have generated as much controversy as David Mamet's
Oleanna. It portrayed a disastrous series of miscommunications between a
male college professor and a female student which finally destroyed the
professor's career.
In a disturbing example of life mimicking art, a male college professor at
the University of New Hampshire is now on indefinite suspension without pay
following a sequence of events remarkably like those portrayed in Mamet's
play. The events raise important questions about academic freedom,
individual rights and 'political correctness'.
Donald Silva, 59, pillar of the local Congregational Church, and a faculty
member at the University of New Hampshire since 1972, taught a course on
technical writing. In one of his lectures, he compared an aspect of the
creative process to sex. The simile was based on the to and fro quality of
the movement and the sense of fulfilment that came at the end.
On another occasion, when discussing the use of similes, he suggested that
the movement of a belly dancer might be described as being 'like Jell-O on a
plate with a vibrator under the plate'. These sexual allusions offended some
of the female students who complained to the university authorities.
Was this all there was to it? Apparently, yes. In subsequent enquiries it
was reported that some female students felt the professor stood too close to
them on certain occasions, but there was no definition of how close was too
close.
An administrative tribunal nonetheless found Professor Silva guilty of
sexual harassment, defined in this case as 'creating a hostile and
intimidating atmosphere' in his class. The professor was suspended without
pay for a year, during which time he was required to undergo psychotherapy -
at his own expense - to correct his supposedly deviant tendencies.
He chose instead to bring legal action against the university, demanding
reinstatement to the faculty, compensation for lost income and undisclosed
damages. He thus remains suspended without pay pending the outcome of his
law suit.
The Silva case has split the University of New Hampshire community into
those who see it as a question of academic freedom and those who see it as a
question of women's rights. Both positions have merit and are defended
passionately: an unlikely basis for rational dialogue.
The university administration is understandably reticent about discussing
the case but Eve Goodman, head of the university's sexual harassment and
rape prevention programme, is prepared to comment. She says that if female
students felt afraid to go to a professor's lecture, then 'we got a problem
here'.
We certainly have. As an American academic, I feel a personal interest in
the Silva case, but its ramifications extend far beyond the confines of
American academia. Sexual harassment is becoming an increasingly important
issue throughout the developed world and definitions of what may or may not
constitute sexual harassment have profound implications for working
relationships in general.
With attempts to define the limits of acceptable behaviour comes the image
of a society dominated by politically-correct thought police.
While such a prospect may be interesting as a dramatic premise, does it have
any basis in reality? In the light of events at the University of New
Hampshire, I am less complacent than I was. In my day-to-day dealings with
students, I find myself increasingly aware that even the perception of
'inappropriateness' could be disastrous. This is especially true with female
students, in whose company I now feel a level of personal vulnerability more
appropriate to a minefield than a classroom.
This is not paranoia. Official guidelines in most private and governmental
organisations in the US include 'creation of a hostile and intimidating
atmosphere' under the general heading of sexual harassment.
The Silva case shows clearly that even casual references to personal bodily
functions - especially those pertaining to reproduction - may be deemed to
create such an atmosphere, constituting grounds for censure. This censure
carries the same stigma as a conviction for indecent assault.
The question of stigma is crucial to this debate. What is important in the
Silva case is not what he was accused of but what he was not accused of.
There was no suggestion, for example, of improved grades in exchange for
sexual favours. No mention of groping, fondling or even 'inappropriate
touching'.
And if his similes generated an environment that his accusers found 'hostile
and intimidating', where might these women feel comfortable? Surely not on
the campus of a modern university, where ideas are expressed freely -
sometimes even offensively - and established opinions are open to constant
challenge. Most important of all: is the academic equivalent of a death
sentence reasonable punishment for the 'crime' of using sexually-suggestive
similes?
It is now up to the courts to decide. Meanwhile, I am reminded of a song,
extolling the politically-incorrect delights of 'standing on the corner
watching all the girls go by'. I remember particularly the line that goes
'you can't go to jail for what you're thinking'. Such optimism may soon be
out of date.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Management: Making fairness work - Richard Donkin on an
impending review of UK industrial tribunals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine a divorce court ordering a husband to be reunited with a wife who
cannot stand the sight of him. The decision would be unworkable.
Yet a review of the UK industrial tribunal system ordered by the Department
of Employment is expected to consider re-instatement of employees in the
workplace as an alternative to compensation for unfair dismissal. Like the
saving of a marriage, it sounds attractive in theory. But in practice, as
with non-consenting partners, it seems fraught with difficulty.
While enforced re-instatement is thought to be one of the ideas the
government is considering for inclusion in a consultative document expected
to be published later in the autumn, it may have been dismissed already as
unworkable and unacceptable to employers.
Nor may business be enamoured with the German approach, which has been
scrutinised widely in Britain. In Germany companies must give appropriate
justification to works councils composed of elected employee
representatives. Although a works council cannot prevent a dismissal, its
opinion is taken into account in any subsequent proceedings at a labour
court - the more powerful German equivalent of the UK's tribunals.
Some organisations had been lobbying for a review for years. When it was
announced by Ann Widdecombe, the employment minister, in a reply to a
parliamentary question in April, she said the move was intended to identify
any changes that would help tribunals cope with the rising volume and
complexity of cases, to reduce delays, and to contain demands on public
spending.
Industrial tribunals, conceded the government, had grown too cumbersome and
costly. The annual number has more than doubled from 34,000 in 1989-90 to
upwards of 71,000 in 1993-94. Most of these were unfair dismissal cases,
very few of which led to re-instatement orders and fewer still to actual
re-engagement. Under present legislation employers cannot be forced to
re-employ someone if they choose to ignore an order of the tribunal.
Although reform has been an issue for years, the timing of the review may
have much to do with the European Court of Justice's decision last year to
remove the ceiling on compensation awards in sex and race discrimination
cases. One result has been a series of six-figure awards to women who were
dismissed from the armed services after becoming pregnant. The cases have
sounded alarm bells in Whitehall, faced with a Pounds 100m bill if all the
appeals prove successful.
The government is thought to be deliberating compensation ceilings because
of the discrepancies that have arisen. While unfair dismissal cases are
limited to awards of Pounds 11,000, there is no limit on race and sex
discriminations cases. The Employment Appeal Tribunal, the equivalent of the
civil Appeal Court, has already laid down detailed guidance on the MoD cases
and cautioned against such high payments.
The underlying need for reform arises from the numerous piecemeal changes
made in the system since tribunals were established in 1964. Initially their
role was to hear complaints from employers against the 'training levy' -
levies on each industrial sector to pay for training. They were wrenched
from obscurity by the 1971 Industrial Relations Act, which gave them
jurisdiction over unfair dismissal claims.
They have gradually acquired more status and power as arbiters of the
various employment discrimination laws, to the extent that they now give
judgments on 60 types of claim. Today, because of diminishing union power
and representation among many employees, the tribunal has become the chief
and in some cases the only recourse against unfair treatment in the
workplace. Tribunals have recently been given the power to judge contractual
disputes, but there is a ceiling of Pounds 25,000.
The format of industrial tribunals is largely similar across the country.
They tend to be held in two or three characterless rooms in an office block.
The proceedings are deliberately informal. With a presiding lawyer acting as
chairman, the sides are divided into applicants (aggrieved employees) and
respondents (employers). Each can be formally represented but often choose
to forego lawyers because of cost; legal aid is not available.
The result is that individuals inexperienced in advocacy tend to stumble
through their questioning, taking up almost as much time as lawyers. Often
the parties are allowed to lead their witnesses in a way that would not be
allowed by a Crown Court judge. Case backlogs and the length of hearings are
leading to too many split hearings, where the beginning and end of a case
may take place months apart.
Two years ago full-time tribunal chairmen were given powers in certain
circumstances to sit alone, but they appear to be reluctant to dispense with
their panel of two lay people. 'The presence of lay people with practical
experience is an important check and balance,' says Digby Jacks, a national
officer of MSF, the technical union.
Jacks is among a growing lobby who believe that the government-funded
Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service should have a greater
involvement in cases. Currently, it is available for consultation, but some
believe that if its powers were extended to those of mediation or
arbitration it could prove a more efficient filtering process. Other ideas
being considered by the government include a system for employees to meet
both sides' costs if they pursue frivolous claims. Examples of the
trivialising of tribunals are legion, and include complaints about the way a
brigadier's cook fried eggs.
While the badinage of workers who called their Ulsterman colleague a 'thick
paddy' was arguably trivial, it won the employee Pounds 6,000 in
compensation for hurt feelings, and may have had a broader social influence
in the way that people behave at work.
So may have sex discrimination cases - which, more than anything else, have
raised the profile of industrial tribunals in the media. Last month Samantha
Phillips, an insurance broker at Willis Corroon, won Pounds 18,000 in
damages after claiming sexual discrimination and unfair dismissal. 'I think
the case will send strong vibrations down the spines of some managements,'
says Jacks.
One fear about the consultative document among organisations that have been
urging reform is that the government's prime concern is cost, and that its
recommendations may dilute the powers of tribunals. Peter Martin, legal
officer at the Engineering Employers' Federation, says: 'I fear the document
may be too narrowly focused when what we want is a broader review.'

FT  07 SEP 94 / Private finance projects 'need bigger return'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rates of return on privately financed infrastructure projects will need to
be 10 per cent to 15 per cent if schemes are to proceed, the government was
warned yesterday by one of Britain's biggest construction companies.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, said the expectations of potential
investors of a reasonable rate of return remained higher than those of
ministers.
The government, which is under severe pressure to reduce public borrowing,
last year sponsored a Private Finance Working Group led by Sir Alastair
Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, in an attempt to resolve some of the
difficulties preventing privately financed schemes from going ahead.
Mr Dwyer said yesterday: 'The gap between us has narrowed but it needs to be
closed further if investors are to be persuaded to support these projects.'
Contractors such as Wimpey have taken the lead in bidding individually and
forming consortia to tender for privately financed roads, railways,
hospitals, prisons and student accommodation.
Mr Dwyer said: 'In spite of a lot of debate, very few schemes have started.
We need some positive examples if investors are to be persuaded that the
rewards will be worth the risk.' Investors would expect higher internal
rates of return than the 3 per cent or 4 per cent expected by utilities.
'There is a lot of risk involved if contractors and investors are to be
expected to take on the liability for the cost of a prison riot when they
might have no control on what prisoners they took,' said Mr Dwyer.
He expected many of the first privately financed schemes to be smaller
projects such as prisons and hospitals rather than large road and rail
schemes. Large transport schemes often involved complex planning and
political issues which made them difficult to cost and involved a higher
risk for investors.
Wimpey is among a number of UK and continental European companies bidding
for four privately financed road schemes costing a total of Pounds 380m.
They were announced last month by Mr John Watts, roads minister.
Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman of Amec, which is also among the bidders for the
four road schemes, said: 'We are getting closer but more progress needs to
be made. Potential investors need to see that there are some winners out
there or they won't bother.'

FT  07 SEP 94 / DTI rejects Labour plea on Archer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday rejected
Labour claims that a report from his department on Lord Archer's Anglia
Television share dealings could be published.
Mr Heseltine said the Financial Services Act gave him 'no power' to publish
the report, compiled by DTI inspectors after MAI paid Pounds 292m for Anglia
earlier this year.
Labour dismissed Mr Heseltine's interpretation of the act, accusing him of a
blatant attempt to avoid 'matters of genuine public concern'.
The report was compiled by DTI inspectors earlier this year after Lord
Archer, the novelist and former Conservative party deputy chairman, placed
orders for Anglia shares on behalf of an associate shortly before the MAI
bid was announced.
After taking legal advice on the report, Mr Heseltine decided not to
prosecute Lord Archer.
The London Stock Exchange decided to take no action against Lady Archer, a
director of Anglia, under its Yellow Book rules aimed at preventing the
leakage of price-sensitive information.
Labour claims that section 179 of the Financial Services Act allows the
trade and industry secretary to publish an inspector's report if those named
give their consent.
But Mr Heseltine said the inquiry was carried out under section 177 of the
act, which provides for investigations to determine whether a criminal
offence of insider dealing has been committed.
'Thus, inspectors' reports, as well as detailing the facts as they find
them, set out their judgments.' he said in a letter to Mr Robin Cook, shadow
trade and industry secretary.
The DTI would not say if Lord Archer was asked for permission to publish the
report. He was not available for comment.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Housing benefit cuts 'hit renting'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cuts in housing benefit could halt the fragile recovery in the UK's private
rented housing sector, a government adviser warned yesterday.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, Treasury chief secretary, said on Monday that the
fast-growing housing benefit budget was a target for cost-cutting in the
autumn public spending round. The means-tested benefit pays some or all of
the rent for low-income households.
However, Professor Peter Kemp of York University told a conference organised
by Shelter, the housing charity, that cutting benefit levels would reduce
the demand for private rented housing and decrease the supply.
Prof Kemp has been commissioned by the Social Security Department to carry
out research into how other countries have contained the costs of subsidies
on rents.
The private rented sector has increased since 1988, Prof Kemp said, after
three-quarters of a century of almost continuous decline. However, some of
the increase had been caused by the decline in the housing market, which had
forced many homeowners to rent out homes they could not sell, and had
discouraged potential first-time buyers.
The return for landlords from letting residential property was already too
low in comparison with alternative investments such as commercial property,
he said. Without the underpinning on rents offered by housing benefit, some
would leave the market.
There would also be a reduction in the number of people prepared to pay the
higher rents common in the private sector without housing benefit.
The cost of housing benefit has risen from Pounds 3.75bn in 1988-89 to
Pounds 8.8bn in 1993-94, and is forecast to rise to more than Pounds 11bn by
1996-97. Ministers have been examining ways to cap the growth, which Mr
Aitken called 'exponential'.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Technology fails to impress bank customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumers show a marked lack of enthusiasm for technological developments
such as home banking, and appear to prefer conventional banking methods,
says a a survey published yesterday.
Within the general level of caution, there was greater interest in
technological services from the under-35 age group.
The poll by Mori for computer company ICL, revealed that three-quarters of
those questioned would not use a home banking service if it was available.
One-third of respondents said they had never used a cashpoint machine.
The most popular single extra service which customers would like to be
available through cash machines is the sale of postage stamps.
The survey also shed light on consumers' views of financial institutions.
When consumers were asked which organisations other than banks or societies
they would trust to look after their money, 24 per cent said insurance
companies. There should be a single regulator for building societies and
banks, Mr Peter Birch, chief executive of Abbey National, the home loans and
banking group, said yesterday at a Chartered Institute of Bankers' seminar.
This might mean the Building Societies Commission becoming part of the
supervisory department of the Bank of England.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Leak reveals plan to axe post offices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Post Office is planning cuts in its branch and sub-post offices in the
next five years, according to an internal document leaked yesterday by the
Union of Communication Workers.
Mr Bill Cockburn, Post Office chief executive, said the paper painted a
'worst-case scenario' that was unlikely to happen because of the
government's plans to give the corporation commercial freedom in the private
sector.
He said the document was prepared earlier in the year to show what would
happen if the Post Office did not achieve the commercial freedom it needed
to develop.
However the union said the document was drawn up in May and sent to Post
Office regional managers on August 15, two months after publication of the
government's consultative document.
Mr Cockburn said some rural sub-post offices were closing because they were
too small to run profitably, but added: 'The government's decision to allow
post offices to sell a wider range of services has secured the rural
network.' He pledged to help open 40 to 50 part-time rural post offices a
year.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, backed the Post Office
management's desire for commercial freedom in the private sector in a green
paper published before the summer break. It set out the government's
'preferred option' of a sale of 51 per cent of the Post Office. A further 10
per cent would go to employees and sub-postmasters.
The leaked forecast suggests branch or crown offices would have to be cut
from 717 in this financial year to 397 by 1998-1999 with a reduction in the
number of sub-post offices from 18,055 in this financial year to 17,005 by
the end of the decade.
The document says this would ensure Pounds 70m of savings in the next five
years. It forecasts a corresponding increase in the number of 'converted' or
franchised post offices from 800 to 1,180 in the same period.
The union said the figures were a 'recent projection of how the network will
shrink if the government's preferred option of break-up and privatisation
set out in the green paper on the postal services is introduced'.
Mr Cockburn said the document showed that there would be more post offices
in five years because of the increase in franchising, which had led to the
opening of post offices in supermarkets.
He said he would monitor carefully the future of post office franchising on
a 'case-by-case, community-by-community basis'.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Scotland speeds up commerce cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Court of Session, Scotland's supreme civil court, is to try to speed up
its handling of commercial cases, which has been heavily criticised by
companies for its slowness.
Lord Hope, the Lord President, who is the senior judge in Scotland's legal
system, yesterday nominated Lord Penrose, one of the 27 judges of the Court
of Session, to concentrate purely on commercial cases. Two other judges,
Lord Cullen and Lord Coulsfield, will supplement him.
Lord Hope said there was great reluctance among Scottish companies to bring
commercial litigation in the Court of Session. They considered it
time-consuming and found the court lacking in expertise. He wanted them to
stop feeling that they had to take their civil actions to England, 'which
would be a great misfortune'.
Although much Scottish law differs from English law, most of the law
governing commercial matters applies to the whole of the UK. The judges of
the Court of Session administer both civil and criminal cases, and
commercial cases are often delayed because the judge has to hear criminal
cases.
Under the new system, which comes into effect this month, commercial
litigants will be able to opt for a faster procedure. The same judge will
handle all stages of a case and will take an active role in pushing cases
forward rather than allowing the parties involved to set the pace.
The summons needed to start a commercial action will be expected to be short
and non-technical, and to identify the issue which the litigant wishes to
have resolved.
When the case comes to the main hearing in court, parties to the action
should expect the judge to be familiar with the documents and not need to be
taken through them stage by stage.

FT  07 SEP 94 / One regulator urged for banks and societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There should be a single regulator for building societies and banks, Mr
Peter Birch, chief executive of Abbey National, the home loans and banking
group, said yesterday.
Mr Birch told a Chartered Institute of Bankers' seminar that, in spite of
the differences in ways of operation, he believed it would make sense for
the two types of organisation to be regulated by a single body.
This might mean the Building Societies Commission becoming part of the
supervisory department of the Bank of England.
The question of regulation is set to arise as a result of the consultation
document on societies which the government is due to publish this month.
The Treasury, however, is likely to address the point only obliquely, and
may argue that changes in societies' powers and duties do not necessarily
imply a change of regulator.
Abbey National used to be a building society, and Mr Birch has been among
the most outspoken critics of the arrangements by which building societies
are accountable to the millions of customers who own them.
He used his speech to press once again for further duties on society boards
to put all takeover and merger offers to their members in a way they are not
obliged to do at present.
Mr Birch also suggested that as mutual organisations, societies should not
make so much profit, and should return surplus profits to their members,
perhaps through dividends.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Stench of sleaze is enveloping Tories, says Straw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A stench of 'sleaze, cronyism, insider dealing, waste and corruption' was
enveloping the Conservative party, Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment
secretary, said last night.
He said no soap powder or deodorant would be able to remove this 'smell-bad'
factor before the next general election.
Mr Straw, speaking in Nottingham, saw no likelihood that the Conservatives'
political fortunes would improve with the help of continuing economic growth
and falling unemployment.
'Whatever happens to the economy in the next two years, anxiety, fear and
insecurity have gone too far to make people 'feel good' about the
Conservative party,' he said.
Mr Straw said the Conservatives were in such bad odour because they had
taken positive steps to reduce the scope of democratic institutions and
replace them with an unaccountable and unelected 'quango state'.
In an apparent response to earlier Conservative attacks on 'loony left'
Labour councils, he said that for every pound lost in elected local
government, Pounds 60 was lost in quangos and central government through
fraud, corruption and serious mismanagement.
Mr Straw said a Labour government would establish an elected regional
council for the east Midlands, where Pounds 2,379m of taxpayers' money was
being spent by 169 quangos and unelected boards.
Where appointed bodies remained there would be far tighter rules on
conflicts of interest. A Labour government would also 'clean up the rules on
insider trading, party political funding and the honours system'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was accused yesterday of allowing the commercial interests of
foreign manufacturers of tele-communications equipment to override the needs
of up to 8m partially deaf phone users in the UK.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour spokesman on consumer affairs, alleged that the
Department of Trade and Industry had bowed to concerted lobbying and had
agreed to a new specification for the earpiece of phones which would reduce
the volume level by 25 per cent.
He claimed that leaked documents showed that the change had been agreed by
the DTI and the British Standards Institute 'in secret' to avoid a public
outcry.
Mr Griffiths said: 'The DTI's handling of this issue is an insult to deaf
people. I am seeking a meeting with the prime minister to demand that this
policy is reversed.'

Archer placed orders for Anglia shares on behalf of an associate shortly
before the MAI bid was announced.
After taking legal advice on the report, Mr Heseltine decided not to
prosecute Lord Archer, the novelist and former Conservative party deputy
chairman.
The London Stock Exchange decided to take no action against Lady Archer, a
director of Anglia, under its Yellow Book rules aimed at preventing the
leakage of price-sensitive information.
Labour claims that section 179 of the Financial Services Act allows the
trade and industry secretary to publish an inspector's report if those named
give their consent.
But Mr Heseltine said the inquiry was carried out under section 177 of the
act, which provides for investigations to determine whether a criminal
offence of insider dealing has been committed.
'Thus, inspectors' reports, as well as detailing the facts as they find
them, set out their judgments on these facts,' he said in a letter to Mr
Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, who is on holiday.
'For example, they typically consider possible motives underlying the
actions of those they have investigated and their state of knowledge, and
they express their views about the prospect of securing a conviction in the
criminal courts.
'Such reports are prepared on the basis that they are not for publication,
but that they are instead confidential reports to the secretary of state to
enable him to decide whether there is a basis for criminal proceedings.'
Mr Heseltine said it was 'clear' that parliament did not intend such reports
to be published.
The DTI would not say whether Lord Archer had been asked for permission to
publish the report. Lord Archer was not available for comment.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Watchdog raps anti-nuclear ad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Advertising Standards Authority, the advertising watchdog, today accuses
Greenpeace, the environmental group, of 'gross over-simplification' and
'poor taste' in an anti-nuclear power advertisement in some national
newspapers earlier this year.
The advertisement featured a photograph of a baby with an enlarged head and
was captioned 'Kazakhstan nuclear test victim'.
The text claimed that radiation-linked diseases in children 'have already
been seen near to nuclear installations such as Sellafield' and that '2,000
will die because of the radioactive discharges from Sellafield over the next
10 years'.
The ruling published today said there was no proof that the baby was a
nuclear test victim, and the figure of 2,000 deaths had not been
substantiated. It also ruled that it was 'unfounded' to describe the nuclear
industry as 'intent on spreading radiation and the means of mass destruction
around the globe'.
However, the authority rejected complaints about the linking of the nuclear
industry and childhood diseases.
It stated: 'The authority sought expert advice and understood that, while
there were measurable excesses of childhood leukaemia and related cancers in
the vicinity of Sellafield and some other nuclear installations, a causal
link with the UK civil nuclear industry had not been established.'
'It considered, however, that this was a matter of public controversy and
that readers would therefore recognise, particularly given the advertiser's
identity, that this was an expression of the advertiser's opinion based on
the available evidence.'
The British Nuclear Industry Forum, the trade body, said the advertisement
had 'done much harm' as the the government is conducting a review of the
industry.
Greenpeace said it stood by the advertisement.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Primary school reforms 'failing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government attempts to raise educational standards by introducing widespread
reforms have had little effect on how primary school pupils spend their
time, says a paper presented to the British Association yesterday.
Mr Ian Plewis of the Institute of Education described how children aged
seven at London primary schools divided their time between activities during
the school day.
He compared the activities of children in the same group of primary schools
in 1986, before the sweeping 1988 Education Reform Act - and last year,
after its implementation.
He also compared the results from last year with the recommendations of the
Dearing report on the school curriculum, published last May, about how
pupils' time should be divided between subjects.
Time devoted to science doubled, although with only nine minutes a day it
was still receiving only half the time recommended by Sir Ron Dearing.
History and geography, which did not figure at all in 1986, took about four
minutes a day last year, still only a quarter of the recommendation.
The biggest increase, from seven minutes to 28 minutes, was in the time
children spent having their activities explained to them. This occupied
almost as much time as science, history, geography and reading combined.
To compensate for these increases, time allocated to art and craft fell from
39 minutes to 17 minutes.
Using computers to study other subjects occupied two minutes a day - less
than a quarter of the Dearing recommendation of nine minutes.
One surprise was that time spent reading increased very little, from six to
eight minutes a week. Moreover, the extra time was devoted to pupils reading
to each other, not to adults.
According to Mr Plewis reading to adults is thought to be important for
developing literacy. Although teachers spend a great deal of time listening
to children reading, each child reads for only a very short time.
In spite of these apparent shortcomings the vast majority of parents are
satisfied with their children's schooling, according to a paper by Dr Martin
Hughes of the University of Exeter. But their reasons for satisfaction have
more to do with their perceptions of the social atmosphere in the school
than with educational standards.
While satisfied with the education of their own children, a substantial
percentage of parents felt that standards generally were in decline.
They felt that reducing the size of classes was more important than changing
the curriculum.
Both Dr Hughes and Mr Plewis said that, in spite of the vast amounts of
money that had been devoted to changing the education system, very little
had been spent on eval-uating the effect of the changes.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Gene therapy success claimed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first UK trial of gene therapy to treat cystic fibrosis is giving
'encouraging' results, the British Association meeting in Loughborough heard
yesterday.
Dr Duncan Geddes, who is in charge of the trial at the Royal Brompton
Hospital, London, said the first phase showed 'approximately 20 per cent
correction of the CF defect' in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, a
debilitating lung disease.
CF is the most common serious inherited disease, and one of the first
disorders to be treated experimentally by gene therapy - inserting correct
copies of the defective gene into patients. Many scientists believe gene
therapy will eventually be used to cure many diseases that cannot be treated
effectively with conventional drugs, including some cancers.
Scientists in the US and UK started human tests of CF gene therapy last
year, only four years after identifying the defective gene responsible for
the disease.
The US researchers used a common virus known as adenovirus to carry correct
genes into the patients' lungs. But the virus turns out to have a serious
side-effect: it provokes an unpleasant immune reaction.
The UK trial, a collaboration between the Royal Brompton Hospital and St
Mary's Hospital Medical School, uses tiny fat-like particles called
liposomes instead of virus to carry the genes.
'We are now convinced that the system we are using is safe and we will go on
to the next stage of the programme,' said Dr Geddes.
He and Professor Bob Williamson, head of the St Mary's research team,
yesterday refused to discuss their results in detail because they had not
yet been published in a scientific journal.
But Prof Williamson said the viral and the liposomal approaches seemed to
have complementary advantages and drawbacks.
'The critical thing now is to combine the safety of the liposome with the
efficiency of viral transmission,' he said.
'We all remain convinced that gene therapy will work, but there are still a
number of years of research before it is available as routine treatment,' Dr
Geddes said.
In Prof Williamson's opinion, 'gene therapy will become part of the
treatment for cystic fibrosis within the next four to five years'.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Asthma 'strikes 1,000 workers a year'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asthma is an increasingly serious occupational illness, with more than 1,000
workers developing the disease every year in Britain, scientists from the
Health and Safety Executive told the British Association meeting in
Loughborough, Leicestershire.
The executive unveiled a twofold strategy for fighting occupational asthma:
new guidance for employers to control 'sensitisers' that cause the disease,
coupled with research to develop tests for quick diagnosis in the workplace.
Dr Andrew Curran, a senior scientist on the executive, said exposure to
sensitisers at work was causing asthma in increasing numbers of people who
had never suffered in childhood.
A survey by the executive found 1,000 new cases a year, but this understated
the true extent of the problem, he said.
Asthma results from a combination of genetic susceptibility and
environmental exposure.
For reasons that scientists do not understand, it is becoming more common
among the general population as well as in the workplace.
'Occupational asthma doesn't just cause a bit of a wheeze and a cough,' Dr
Curran said.
'It can be completely debilitating, causing a significant reduction in the
quality of life in those who suffer from it, and in extreme cases it has
been known to cause death.'
Some 200 different substances are known to cause occupational asthma. They
fall into two broad categories, according to Dr Curran.
One type of sensitiser consists of large molecules and organic dust
particles. Workers in food-processing and farming are particularly
vulnerable to these.
Prawn-processing plants are a notorious case.
High-pressure water jets, used to separate the meat from the shells, create
an aerosol of tiny meat particles which enter the lungs. Up to 30 per cent
of the workforce may succumb to asthma.
The second category of sensitiser consists of small chemical molecules.
These include isocyanates used in spray paints, acid anhydrides used by the
electronics industry in curing epoxy resins, and fumes from soldering.
Asthma caused by breathing in small molecules is relatively difficult to
diagnose and is the main subject of the executive's research.
Dr Curran and colleagues have developed a test that identifies changes in
the cells of asthmatic patients when exposed to sensitiser chemicals.
'Speedy diagnosis is extremely important,' said Dr Mike Topping, a health
policy specialist with the executive. If sensitive workers could be removed
quickly from harmful exposures, permanent lung damage might be avoided, he
said.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Microscope can manipulate atoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new type of microscope, which can not only 'see' individual atoms but also
manipulate them, could be used in making electronic circuits on the smallest
scale possible.
Dr Bernard Richardson, a physicist at the University of Wales, Cardiff, told
the British Association meeting in Loughborough that Scanning Tunnelling
Microscopy enabled scientists 'to home in and pick up individual atoms'.
Using STM, 'we ought to be able to write the whole Bible on the sharp tip of
a pin', he said.
Of more practical use, the electronics industry is experimenting with
writing circuits by STM. That could produce silicon chips with lines 10
times thinner than those made with today's technology - another step towards
packing more computing power into smaller and smaller components.
As well as conventional semiconductors, STM could be used to make 'quantum
devices'.
These have novel properties because the electrons are confined in such a
small space. Dr Richardson gave the example of making high-efficiency
tunable lasers from quantum wires.
'I don't see why we shouldn't have a working system in five to 10 years'
time,' he said.
The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council is spending Pounds
4.5m on STM research for academic and industrial applications in the UK.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Sizewell B start-up likely in December
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nuclear Electric, the state-owned generator, is expected to apply within two
weeks for permission to load the first uranium fuel into Sizewell B,
Britain's first pressurised-water reactor power station.
Staff from the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, who are scrutinising
safety systems on the Suffolk site, are expected to give the go-ahead for
fuel loading subject to satisfactory completion of outstanding work.
Sizewell B, which has been built within its Pounds 2.03bn budget, was
expected to begin generating electricity during the summer.
However, the complexity of the commissioning process and delay in obtaining
authorisation to discharge radioactivity into the environment means the
plant is unlikely to be started up before December.
The delay has resulted in the failure of Nuclear Electric to meet the
commitment it gave the government to build the power station and load fuel
within 72 months - that period expired on August 31. Nuclear Electric had
set itself a target of 63 months.
Officials blame commissioning delays on the fact that, although Sizewell B
was modelled on the US Westinghouse design, it is in many respects a
prototype.
Even if fuel loading goes ahead later this month, the reactor cannot be
activated until the pollution inspectorate grants a discharge authorisation.
Further complex commissioning procedures also have to be approved by the NII
before generation can begin.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Economy enters benign phase: The chancellor and Bank have a
breathing space
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fortune has smiled on Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie
George, governor of the Bank of England.
Today they hold their first monetary meeting since before the summer
holidays against a background of diminishing expectations of a rise in
interest rates.
It was a brave analyst who, just three weeks ago, did not forecast an
imminent rise in base rates from the 5.25 per cent in effect since early
February.
However, fears of monetary tightening have eased on signs that the UK may be
close to steady non-inflationary growth - the holy grail of economic
policymakers over the past four decades.
Yesterday's news of disappointing car sales in August, and this week's
figures showing slower growth in money supply and consumer credit, as well
as a fragile housing market, suggest little by way of inflationary pressure
from consumers.
Instead, the economy appears to be in a benign phase, with exports and
investment supporting growth rather than consumer demand, as was the case in
the first two years of recovery.
This news should be especially welcome to Mr Clarke. Recent minutes of his
monthly meetings with Mr George show he has been more relaxed about
inflationary pressures and less inclined to raise interest rates than the
governor.
Mr George, who has built up an image as a doughty inflation fighter, may
feel at a tactical disadvantage. Recent published data has been better than
the Bank's short-run projections of inflation.
Last month, the year-on-year inflation rates for July, as measured by the
retail prices index and the government's target measure of underlying
inflation (RPI excluding mortgage interest payments) were well below 2.5 per
cent. This put them safely within the government's 1 to 4 per cent target
band for inflation.
But the benign economic background could make today's discussions more,
rather than less, difficult. The government is committed to having
underlying inflation in the lower half of the target band by the 'end of
this parliament'.
As the next general election has to be fought by spring 1997, and the Bank
believes monetary policy decisions operate with a two-year lag, the
discretionary monetary policy in force since sterling's forced exit from the
European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 is entering a critical
phase. The Bank's August inflation report concluded it was 'probable that
inflation would gradually rise into the top half of the target range' if
official interest rates remained unchanged over the next two years. This
implied that the Bank saw a need to raise rates in the months ahead to
prevent such a development.
News concerning prices has been mixed in the five weeks since the report.
While growth in consumer demand seems to have slowed, second-quarter growth
as a whole was revised upwards to a year-on-year rate of 3.7 per cent from
3.3 per cent previously. Such growth is well above the 2 per cent to 2.25
per cent 'trend' rate considered compatible with stable prices at full
capacity utilisation.
If sustained, such 'above trend' growth will absorb unused economic
capacity, producing inflationary pressures in the future.
The problem facing Mr Clarke, MrGeorge and their advisers is that nobody
knows the size of the UK economy's unused capacity, or 'output gap'. Neither
the Bank nor the Treasury publishes estimates, although officials are
thought to have been preparing today's meeting on the assumption that the
gap is around 3.5 per cent of gross domestic product.
Even with annual growth of about 3.5 per cent, it will be some time before
the UK economy runs into the inflationary buffers. Moreover, growth may slow
because of further fiscal tightening between now and April 1995 as a result
of measures in Mr Clarke's November 1993 Budget.
Such thoughts sustain economists who believe today's meeting will decide
against raising rates. 'There is no justification for an early interest rate
increase, and so I think the chancellor and governor of the Bank of England
will take a view there is no need for a change,' says Mr Gerard Lyons, chief
economist in London at DKB, the Japanese bank.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at the London office of Salomon Brothers,
differs. 'With rising price expectations, above-trend growth and the
authorities' bias to raise rates earlier than in previous cycles, we suspect
that a September rate rise is still probably slightly more likely than not,'
he says. However, he does not expect 'more than a single 0.5 per cent rate
hike this year'.
Analysts agree on one thing - UK official interest rates are at the bottom
of their cycle. The first upward move in base rates for five years is just a
matter of time.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Exchange reins back drive for deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange yesterday took a step back from its most radical
ideas on trading in small company shares when it published a consultative
document on the new lightly regulated market.
An early draft of the exchange's proposals were to 'strip back' regulation,
but it has concluded that companies should provide interim financial results
as a requirement of a quotation on the planned Alternative Investment
Market.
The draft had argued for waiving this obligation, but the exchange judged
that the cost of compliance for companies was outweighed by the extra
security provided to investors and the need to boost liquidity.
'One of the things that most deadens a market is no information,' Mr Michael
Lawrence, chief executive of the exchange, said yesterday. 'We need periodic
information. I am afraid that we are going to require interim results.'
Yesterdays' proposals will also ensure that directors abide by relatively
strict rules on the trading of company shares. Directors would also be
locked into a company for two years after quotation to guard against
unscrupulous people using the AIM to defraud investors.
Companies will be subject to the normal requirement to publish
price-sensitive information promptly and inform the exchange simultaneously.
Trading on the AIM will be subject to the same standard of surveillance and
supervision as activity on the market for listed shares.
Regulation carries with it higher costs - the exchange had hoped that
companies on the AIM would have to pay an annual fee of only Pounds 1,000.
The cost is likely to be considerably higher.
In spite of the changes in the exchange's thinking, the overall tone of the
blueprint for the new market for small and growing companies, the successor
to the Unlisted Securities Market, remains generally liberal. Sponsorship of
quoted AIM companies will be optional in spite of pressure on the exchange
to make it compulsory. While companies must arrange for a member firm to
support trading, any further links will be left to the discretion of the
companies.
The deregulated small company market will also have what the exchange
believes to be the lowest barrier to entry of any stock market. No
thresholds are envisaged for market capitalisation, length of trading record
or the percentage of the shares in public hands.
While the regulators will ensure that companies do not fail to submit
documents, company directors will be left with the responsibility of
ensuring that documents are accurate, and investors with the task of
checking that they are.
Exchange officials said yesterday they had been motivated above all by the
desire to strike a balance between simplicity of entry for companies and
investors' need for regulation. 'We are not in a motherhood game here,' said
Mr Lawrence. But he added: 'If you have too open a market and the first two
or three companies that go through it crash, that kills the whole market.'
Organisations which the exchange is consulting said it was too early to give
a detailed reaction to the proposals, but most tentatively welcomed the
initiative. 'A clear attempt has been made to strike a balance,' said Mr Ian
Peters, deputy director of the Confederation of British Industry responsible
for small companies.
The Unlisted Securities Market, which grew quickly in the 1980s with 784
companies joining, was undermined by regulatory changes in the early 1990s
and is to be merged into the listed securities market at the end of 1996.
The continuing need for an alternative, lightly regulated market has been
underlined by the success of the 'Rule 4.2' market, exchange officials
maintain. On this, exchange members can trade unlisted and unquoted shares.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Straw accuses 'sleazy' Tories
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A stench of 'sleaze, cronyism, insider dealing, waste and corruption' was
enveloping the Conservative party, Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment
secretary, said last night.
Mr Straw, speaking in Nottingham, saw no likelihood that the Conservatives'
political fortunes would improve with the help of continuing economic growth
and falling unemployment.
Mr Straw said the Conservatives were in such bad odour because they had
reduced the scope of democratic institutions and replaced them with an
unaccountable and un-elected 'quango state'.
He said a Labour government would establish an elected regional council for
the east Midlands, where Pounds 2.4m of taxpayers' money was being spent by
169 quangos and un-elected boards. It would also 'clean up the rules on
insider trading, party political funding and the honours system'.

FT  07 SEP 94 / BT hopes for video link are scorned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications was accused yesterday of being 'wildly
optimistic' over its plans for video-on-demand services, Raymond Snoddy
writes. CIT Research, the London-based communications analysts, said BT
might be greatly overestimating potential demand.
CIT based its judgment on an internal BT memo leaked at the end of last year
which suggested that the company, due to begin extensive trials of the new
services next year, hoped to have a base of 8m subscribers, each paying
about Pounds 250 a year at current prices.
Ms Liz Baker, CIT's project director, said that even if BT launched the
service at the beginning of 1996, which was highly optimistic, the
organisation would have to achieve a growth rate of 2m sales a year. 'That
would be four times faster than the take-up of the satellite TV dish, which
is the fastest-selling consumer electronics item ever launched in the UK,'
she said.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Output of N Sea oil down 4.9% in month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A change in the timing of North Sea maintenance work led to a monthly drop
in oil and gas output in July which slightly depressed the overall
production figures.
The Central Statistical Office yesterday said that the output of the oil and
gas sector fell by a seasonally adjusted 2.9 per cent between June and July.
The production of the offshore oil sector alone fell by 4.9 per cent in this
period.
The fall came after several months of strong growth, resulting in a record
level of North Sea output in June.
Measured on a three-monthly basis - a figure regarded as a better guide to
the trend - North Sea output rose 4.4 per cent in the three months to July
compared with the previous three months, and was 30.1 per cent higher than
the same period a year before.
The main reason for the monthly fall, the CSO said, was North Sea
maintenance work, which was carried out in July this year.
In recent years most maintenance has been carried out in June, which has
been correspondingly factored in the CSO's system of seasonal adjustment.
However, recent changes in the petroleum revenue tax regime have reduced the
incentive for oil companies to carry out their maintenance in June.
The CSO said yesterday that it was seeking to adjust its seasonal adjustment
series accordingly. However some analysts suggested that the timing problems
may have exaggerated the rise in the production in June and suppressed it in
July.
Elsewhere, the drop in North Sea production in July was offset by a strong
performance from the manufacturing sector. Within this sector the output of
factories producing investment goods and intermediate goods - a category
which provides the raw materials and fuel for industry - continued to
perform better than consumer goods industries, suggesting that the recovery
is becoming more broadly based.
Measured on a three-monthly basis, the chemicals and basic metals sector
each showed a healthy growth of 1.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively
in the three months to July compared with the previous three months.
The engineering sector grew slightly more slowly, with a 0.7 per cent rise
in production in the three months to July compared with the previous three
months.
However, there were sharp discrepancies in this area, the CSO noted, with
the IT and telecommunications areas continuing to outstrip other areas.
The performance of the textile sector was also slightly slower in spite of a
rise in the output of men's shirts and underwear, the CSO said.
The textile sector grew by 0.7 per cent in the three months to July compared
with the previous three months.
The explosion at Texaco's Milford Haven refinery in July created a
noticeable dent in the UK manufacturing data, and is expected to have an
even larger impact on the following month's figures, the CSO said yesterday.
Production at the refinery temporarily ceased after a lightning strike
caused a 36-hour blaze.
The loss of output from the plant resulted in a 7.4 per cent drop in
production in the coke, petrol-refining and nuclear fuels sector between
June and July.
Although this sector is only a small part of overall output, the scale of
the drop reduced the manufacturing index by 2 percentage points in July
compared with June and the overall index of production by 1.7 percentage
points.
Partial production is expected to reopen this month. Nevertheless, the CSO
warned that the explosion is also likely to affect August's data.

Northern Ireland Electricity has called on staff in its Shop Electric
high-street showrooms to accept new employment terms, including pay cuts
averaging 6.1 per cent - up to 14 per cent for some - or face the loss of
400 jobs.
To cushion the impact of the pay cuts, NIE Retail has offered full-time
staff Pounds 8,750 in compensation and a phasing-in of the reduction for
those worst hit.

FT  07 SEP 94 / CBI calls for boost in school spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish Office was urged yesterday to consider giving primary and
secondary education a bigger share of funding compared with that devoted to
university and other tertiary education, James Buxton writes.
The recommendation is one of 51 in a CBI report in Scotland, which has the
broad aim of reversing the decline of Scotland's manufacturing industry.
The report, prepared by the manufacturing group of the CBI in Scotland,
points out that the UK spends 144 per cent more per head on tertiary
education than the OECD average, but only 88 per cent of the average on
secondary education and 78 per cent on primary education.
The report welcomes the recent growth of university education, but points
out that Scotland has a low place in the OECD ranking of overall skill
attainment needed to support a thriving manufacturing sector.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Ford and Vauxhall lose market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford and Vauxhall, the leaders of the UK market for new cars, both lost
market share during August, the most important month for sales of new cars,
as did most Japanese carmakers.
The biggest gains were achieved by Mercedes-Benz, the German executive and
luxury carmaker, and Honda of Japan. Both increased sales volumes by more
than 60 per cent year-on-year in an overall market where registrations rose
by only 2.8 per cent.
Fiat of Italy and the Volkswagen group of Germany, which includes Audi, Seat
and Skoda, also gained ground, as sales of imported cars rose strongly to
account for 60.2 per cent of August sales compared with a share of 58.3 per
cent a year ago.
Japanese carmakers, with the exception of Honda and Subaru, all suffered
sales declines in August with their price competitiveness under heavy
pressure from the appreciation of the yen.
The Volkswagen group, whose fortunes have wavered in the UK market in recent
years, is regaining lost ground supported by significant price cuts during
the past year for its VW and Audi brands.
Sales of the VW brand in August rose by 27.3 per cent year-on-year. Seat,
the group's Spanish subsidiary, increased its registrations by 52.3 per
cent, helped by the launch of the Ibiza and Cordoba small-car ranges.
Sales to private buyers, which in previous months had been running 10 per
cent higher than the previous year, fell by 4.4 per cent year-on-year in
August to 268,298. In the first eight months sales to private buyers rose by
4.2 per cent to 730,830.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Blair refuses to back rail strike: TUC warms to works
councils - Union chiefs attacked on pit closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair yesterday refused to throw his support behind the rail signal
workers' strike in a move calculated to distance the party from industrial
conflicts.
He called on the government to free both sides - the RMT transport union and
Railtrack - to negotiate a settlement of the 13-week conflict. If this
failed it should go to arbitration under existing agreements for the railway
industry, Mr Blair said. The Labour leader said he had 'considerable
sympathy' for the justice of the signal workers' cause, but had to look at
the dispute from 'the public interest'.
However, Mr Blair's suggestion of arbitration has not found favour on either
side of the rail dispute. Both the RMT and Railtrack are strongly opposed.
Moreover his refusal to intervene on the side of the signal workers has
disappointed union leaders.
Mr Blair emphasised that politicians should not become involved in
industrial disputes. 'If I started intervening or interfering I would be
doing precisely what I have criticised the government for doing.'
There was widespread support for the RMT and its general secretary Mr Jimmy
Knapp at the TUC congress yesterday. He secured 1.6m votes in his first
election for the TUC general council in the smaller-union section.
A congress debate on the RMT strike will take place today. The TUC plans a
mass rally of support tomorrow, when the signal workers will be on strike
for 24 hours.
Mr Paul Gallagher, general secretary of the AEEU engineering and electrical
union and a member of the Health and Safety Commission, said he was calling
on the Health and Safety Executive to investigate the training of British
Rail staff who will be working in signal boxes on strike days.
Mr Gallagher said: 'I want to know how, after less than two weeks' training
or retraining, it is possible for Railtrack to say a person is competent to
work in a signal box when it takes nine months to train a signal worker.'
A growing number of train operating companies have stopped making automatic
ticket refunds to travellers affected by the dispute because of the
increased frequency of special strike-day services.
In some areas ticket staff have been making refunds to season ticket holders
in spite of the fact that travellers have been able to use the reduced
services on strike days.
BR said a decision on refunds was up to train operators. Rail users' groups
said refunds should still be paid on routes where services started late or
finished early.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Scargill urges move back to the 1970s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The TUC congress came alive for a few minutes yesterday when Mr Arthur
Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, mounted the
rostrum and called for the trade union movement to go 'back to the 1970s'.
During an impassioned speech supporting an NUM motion urging the repeal of
all Conservative trade union legislation since 1979, Mr Scargill called on
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, to 'stop waffling' and to give his
'unequivocal support' to the striking signal workers.
Last night the Labour leader - in Blackpool dining with the TUC general
council - said he would make it clear to union leaders that while they could
not expect any special access to a future Labour government, they would get
'fairness'. He added that the unions themselves were asking only for
fairness.
Mr Scargill used the debate on union legislation to attack his colleagues on
the general council for failing to call for action to stop mine closures.
He argued that industrial action against the law was an effective trade
union movement policy.
'We didn't get rid of the Industrial Relations Act by simply passing
resolutions that have a degree of anonymity,' he said.
He reminded the conference that the movement had been prepared to strike
against the law when it took action in 1972 to free a group of imprisoned
dockworkers who became known as the Pentonville Five.
With some nostalgia he recalled the days when TUC delegates could not move
for photographers and international media. Today, he said, 'we have been
marginalised, not by the Tories, but by our own unwillingness and inability
to fight back'.
He added: 'I'd love to go back to the 1970s.'
However, the general council election results showed a short while later
that, in spite of attracting warm applause, Mr Scargill was eighth in the
poll - the first seven were elected.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Scotland speeds up commerce cases
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Court of Session, Scotland's supreme civil court, is to try to speed up
its handling of commercial cases, which has been heavily criticised by
companies for its slowness.
Lord Hope, the Lord President, who is the senior judge in Scotland's legal
system, yesterday nominated Lord Penrose, one of the 27 judges of the Court
of Session, to concentrate purely on commercial cases.
Lord Hope said there was great reluctance among Scottish companies to bring
commercial litigation in the Court of Session. They considered it
time-consuming and found the court lacking in expertise. He wanted them to
stop feeling that they had to take their civil actions to England.
Although much Scottish law differs from English law, most of the law
governing commercial matters applies to the whole of the UK.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Hertfordshire set to keep structure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Local Government Commission for England yesterday proposed that no
change be made to Hertfordshire's local government structure.
The proposal is subject to local consultation for two months before a final
recommendation to the government.
The commission also proposed, as a second preference, that four unitary
councils could be created in Hertfordshire, based on mergers of the present
10 borough, city and district councils.
These would be: Eastern Hertfordshire, merging the present Broxbourne
borough with East Hertfordshire district; Northern Hertfordshire, merging
Stevenage borough with North Hertfordshire district; Central Hertfordshire,
merging Hertsmere borough, St Albans city and Welwyn Hatfield district; and
Western Hertfordshire, merging Watford and Dacorum boroughs with Three
Rivers district.
This unitary option would cost between Pounds 29m and Pounds 34m to start
up, creating annual savings after that of between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Receivers to Swans say sale is remote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price Waterhouse, the receivers to the Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter,
said yesterday that the prospects of selling the yard were now remote, Chris
Tighe writes.
Mr Gordon Horsfield, joint receiver, said there were at this stage no
serious bidders. Price Waterhouse, he said, would now begin looking at
offers received for parts of the business, in parallel with any approaches
for the whole.
The receivers, he added, would try for a whole sale right up to the
departure of the Type 23 frigate Richmond, the last vessel on Swans' books,
on November 2.
Following Monday's collapse of hopes of a sale to Constructions Mecaniques
de Normandie, the receivers are considering a CMN proposal to sub-contract
work for some weeks to Swans' design team. Mr Horsfield said that, if
agreement could be reached within 48 hours, the Friday deadline for making
Swans' 100-strong design team redundant would be lifted.
It emerged yesterday that the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation, North
and South Tyneside and Newcastle councils and private-sector interests had
formulated a proposal, should no going-concern sale be possible, to acquire
Swans as a subsea oil and gas exploration and production base. The
initiative, costing around Pounds 20m, would require government support.
Organisation Management and Survey, a Manchester-based engineering
consultancy, also confirmed it was interested in buying Swans as a going
concern.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Motorola to invest Pounds 250m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Motorola, the US electronics group, is to invest Pounds 250m in expanding
its semiconductor plant at East Kilbride, near Glasgow, to meet increasingly
heavy demand for its products.
The expansion will be the third, and by far the biggest the company has made
at East Kilbride in the past three years. In 1992 it announced a Pounds 40m
project and followed it last year with a Pounds 50m expansion, which was
opened yesterday by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary.
The new project involves building a further 35,000 sq ft of factory space in
addition to the existing 400,000 sq ft, and adding 250 people to the plant's
payroll of 2,300. The new building will begin manufacturing late next year
and be in volume production in 1996.
Motorola's expansion at East Kilbride is in response to growing demand for
micro-controllers and digital signals products, semiconductors which are
used in a wide range of products such as cellular telephones and fax
machines, as well as engine controllers and smart cards.
Part of the plant's increased output will go to other Motorola plants, such
as its mobile telephone plant at Easter Inch in West Lothian, while the rest
of the production will be sold to other manufacturers.
The new facility, Motorola says, will enable the plant to produce the most
powerful silicon wafers in Europe and among the most powerful in the world.
It will add triple-layer metal semiconductors to the double-layer metal
products it already makes at East Kilbride and increase the plant's
potential to produce advanced 32 bit microprocessors.
Mr Chris Galvin, Motorola's president and chief operating officer, who
attended yesterday's opening of the earlier expansion, said: 'We are
constantly in pursuit of excellence.
'The decision to spend this colossal sum of money in East Kilbride shows
that the facility enjoys the highest reputation for quality and is a key
player in the global market. Scotland is clearly an important part of the
Motorola success story.'

FT  07 SEP 94 / IRA ceasefire clarification unlikely in medium term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDONDERRY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Republican sources indicated yesterday that the IRA had no intention in the
medium term of being more specific about the meaning of its ceasefire for
tactical and political reasons.
Last week's IRA statement declaring a total cessation of military operations
was the product of intense debate within the republican movement, worded to
draw in hardline activists opposed to a ceasefire. It is feared that being
more specific would risk creating fresh divisions within the IRA.
The sources said the IRA was tactically and politically committed to
ensuring that the ceasefire holds to pave the way for further political
concessions from the British government.
Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's governing executive, said in
an interview in yesterday's Derry Journal that 'there was no doubt that the
ceasefire has moved the debate surrounding demilitarisation along
significantly'. He added: 'The British government should reciprocate
accordingly.'
Meanwhile Downing Street yesterday confirmed that Mr John Major had held a
45-minute meeting with Admiral William Crowe, the US Ambassador to Britain.
The meeting came amid speculation of a visa being granted to Mr Gerry Adams,
the president of Sinn Fein, to revisit the US.
Downing Street said a 'general discussion about Ireland' had taken place,
adding that it was not aware that Mr Adams had applied again for a US visa,
'but we made our position clear before'.
The last time Mr Adams visited the US, Britain indicated it did not want a
visa to be granted.
Separately, republican strongholds appeared to be stepping up their campaign
to force security concessions from the government.
Sinn Fein supporters yesterday picketed the main police barracks in
Londonderry and organised the latest of a series of demonstrations to remove
security barriers from secondary roads near the Irish border.
The protest outside the police station was in response to a series of raids
by the Royal Ulster Constabulary on republican homes in the Bogside area on
Monday night.
As a result of the raids, one man was arrested under the Prevention of
Terrorist Act. The RUC said the arrest was in connection with an
investigation into past terrorist incidents, although there was regret among
some security sources that the raids had fuelled republican propaganda
against alleged police harassment.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Consultation 'to be transformed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Court judgments in June requiring UK employers to consult employee
representatives on redundancies and business transfers, even where they do
not recognise unions, could transform worker consultation in Britain, says a
TUC legal opinion.
Lord Wedderburn says companies will not be able to form committees for
consultation and then dissolve them at will. Vehicles for consultation will
require adequate resources and proper independence from the employer.
The government is wrestling with how to implement the judgment with the
least inconvenience to business.
The Wedderburn analysis is included in an interim report on representation
at work which was strongly supported by the congress yesterday.
The report takes another significant step to TUC acceptance of
Continental-style rights at work and works councils, but attempts to combine
that with an important role for union organisation.
The report says: 'This twin-track approach would give legal rights to
individuals and unions. At the workplace level all employees would have
rights to representation, rights to trigger arrangements for information and
consultation and rights to be a union member.'
It also spells out a staged process of union involvement from a right to
represent all workers in individual grievances to full union recognition for
collective bargaining.
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, introduced the
interim report. He reassured those suspicious of individual rights that the
proposals would not undermine union organisation.
He said: 'We cannot import a model from another country whose tradition of
industrial relations is different from ours. Neither can we say they have
nothing to teach us.'
Mr Tony Dubbins, general secretary of the GPMU print union, warned that
works councils might not be appropriate in smaller companies. 'It would be a
monumental own-goal if these new rights make it more difficult for unions to
organise,' he said.
The Confederation of British Industry was yesterday urged to reach agreement
on a European 'framework agreement' with unions which would provide for a
minimum of five days of vocational training each year.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Shephard call for review of GCSE grades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, yesterday called for an
investigation into 'apparent discrepancies' between the grades awarded by
different boards in this year's GCSE exams.
Her announcement followed a proposal by the School Curriculum and Assessment
Authority, chaired by Sir Ron Dearing. The authority's external assessors
observed the GCSE examination procedures for the first time this year, after
a new code of practice was introduced by Mrs Shephard's predecessor, Mr John
Patten, to combat fears that standards were eroding.
Pass rates have improved swiftly since 1988, when the GCSE qualification
replaced the O-level for 16-year-olds in England and Wales. The proportion
of entrants gaining at least a grade C - equivalent to an O-level pass - has
increased by 33 per cent since that time, while the numbers gaining a grade
A have increased by 94 per cent.
The authority will interview all the boards' examiners about the reasons for
their decisions, and analyse different scripts to see if they have been
consistently marked.
The authority attempted to play down the significance of the investigation,
saying that it had expected to do work of this kind in the first year of a
new system.
Sir Ron said: 'I don't start with any presumption that anything has gone
wrong.'
If the authority cannot find a good explanation for the discrepancy,
however, it has the power to put new procedures in place.
Mrs Shephard said: 'The examining groups are independent and responsible for
marking and grading. But they are publicly accountable. It is essential that
GCSE grades are consistent and fair across the country.'
The government has promised that future editions of the Parent's Charter
will confirm a parent's right to educate their child at home. The move came
after the charter, distributed three months ago, told parents they had a
duty to make sure their child went to school.
The pressure group Education Otherwise welcomed the pledge, but regretted
that ministers had not said they had made a mistake.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Simpler payments to victims suggested
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes in the law to make it easier to pay damages in instalments to
victims of personal injury are recommended in a report published yesterday
by the Law Commission.
The commission, which advises the government on law reform, says changes are
needed that would allow insurers to buy annuities to make the payments
direct to the victim tax-free.
Many victims of accidents prefer the payment of some or all of the damages
in instalments. These structured settlements often involve a lump sum up
front, with payments for the rest of their lives.
The commission says regular payments offer victims greater certainty about
their financial future than a lump sum. Furthermore, they can be tailored to
the victim's needs.
The recommendations would allow the payments to be made direct to the
injured person, without deduction of tax. The insurer would then be able to
close its books on the case.
The report also proposes that the victim should have the same rights under
the Policyholders' Protection Act if the life company making the annuity
payments collapses.
The commission rejects giving power to the courts to order that damages be
paid in structured form. It says that the voluntary system should be
encouraged.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Walker denies signing documents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Walker, former head of the Brent Walker property and leisure
group, yesterday disputed prosecution claims he signed documents relating to
an associated company involved in the alleged fraudulent inflating of Brent
Walker profits.
Mr Walker, in his second day in the witness box at the Old Bailey, denied
that he had signed documents concerning Alberta, a joint venture involving
Brent Walker.
The prosecution alleges Alberta was used by Mr Walker to launder money to
disguise bogus film rights transactions that increased the profits of the
Brent Walker film division.
Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, the former Brent Walker finance director,
both deny charges of theft, fraudulent trading and conspiring to falsify the
company's accounts.
Questioned by his barrister, Mr Colin Nicholls QC, Mr Walker said he could
not be sure that he had signed some of the documents. He was unsure the
signatures looked like his, and one letter was on headed paper he would
never have used.
As chief executive of Brent Walker he signed so many documents he could not
read them and had to trust the senior executives responsible, he told the
court. 'Some weeks I got so tired my fingers could not hold the pen,' he
said.
Mr Walker also complained about the lack of support Brent Walker received
from the banks throughout its history. He was often asked to provide
security for loans from his personal assets. This, he said, was virtually
unheard of for public companies.
Mr Walker said flowcharts prepared by prosecutors from the Serious Fraud
Office concerning the alleged profits boosting made no sense to him. 'This
is an accountant's wonderland - an accountant's dreamland,' he said.
According to the charts, the banks concerned had never imposed any charges
for transferring large sums of money. This was never the case, said Mr
Walker.
The trial continues today.

Two of the larger London bus companies, East London and Selkent, were
yesterday sold to Stagecoach Holdings for a total of Pounds 42m.
This brings the number of bus companies sold to three with a further seven
still to be sold. CentreWest was sold to its management for just over Pounds
25m last week.
Two more companies are expected to be sold this month, and London Buses
expects to complete the sale of all its operations by next year.
The purchases by Stagecoach represent its first move in London and will give
the Perth-based company a total share of about 11.5 per cent of the UK bus
market.
Stagecoach will pay Pounds 28m for East London and Pounds 14m for Selkent,
which operates in south-east London. The two companies will account for 20
per cent of the group's increased turnover.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Lacklustre recovery under way in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A lacklustre economic recovery is under way in Japan, hampered by a weak
jobs market and a continued decline in corporate investment, the Japanese
central bank reported yesterday.
Businesses are slightly more confident than they expected to be last spring,
stocks of unsold inventories are falling, and companies are finding it
easier to borrow money, the Bank of Japan's latest Tankan quarterly survey
of business conditions reveals.
The survey 'shows economic recovery quite clearly,' said Mr Yasushi Mieno,
central bank governor. But Mr Kagehide Kaku, head of the central bank's
research and statistics department, added: 'This backs our judgment the
economy is heading to recovery, but falls short of brushing out economic
fragility.'
The lacklustre upturn depicted by the most authoritative indicator of
Japan's short-term economic outlook is expected to lessen the central bank's
inclination to tighten monetary policy, motivated by its fear of repeating
the run-away rise in asset prices that foreshadowed the recession.
Government bond prices strengthened in response.
It fuelled speculation in Tokyo that the government's Economic Planning
Agency would declare an official end to the three-year recession when it
publishes its monthly economic report on Friday.
The Tankan index of big manufacturers' business confidence improved from -50
in the previous review in May, to -39 in August. The index records the
change in the balance of companies citing a better and worse business
outlook, from a sample of 10,000 businesses.
It continues the improvement shown in the previous survey in May, the first
upturn in confidence recorded by the Tankan for five years. This suggests
the recession touched bottom for the survey in the final quarter of last
year.
The balance of businesses reporting excessive inventories fell from 23 in
May to 17 in August, while the ratio of those reporting that banks' lending
stance was getting easier rose from 17 to 19 over the same period.
But the balance of companies with surplus employees remains high at 25,
compared with 26 in May. Another disappointment is that leading companies
plan to cut capital investment by 3.8 per cent this year, only slightly less
bad than the 3.7 per cent reduction forecast in May. Small businesses are
even more cautious, forecasting a 14.3 per cent investment fall this year.
The recovery will be fragile and uneven, according to yesterday's review.
Manufacturers expect a sharp profits rise this year, led by exports to the
recovering economies of the US and Europe and helped by a moderate rise in
domestic demand. But poorly-competitive service companies think profits will
fall again, squeezed by increased competition.
For large manufacturers, that means a forecast 16.1 per cent rise in profits
this year, better than the 14.9 per cent expected in the previous survey,
and a sharp turnround from their 26.3 per cent profits decline last year.
They forecast a small rise in sales this year, 0.3 per cent, reflecting a
fall in prices.
Large service companies believe profits will fall 5.1 per cent this year,
slightly worse than the 5 per cent decline they were expecting in May and
much worse than the 17.9 per cent earnings decline they recorded in 1993.

FT  07 SEP 94 / China wrings 'water' from statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
There are lies, damned lies and, it seems, Chinese statistics.
The China Information newspaper has reported that in 1993 alone there were
60,000 cases of 'false statistics' reports in 30 provinces, regions and
cities.
A recent statistics supervision conference held in Qingdao, south-east of
Beijing, was told there was 'a lot of water' in industrial output reports,
that birth statistics were frequently understated and grain stockpiles were
often exaggerated. In an effort to guard against false reporting, a 1984
'Statistics Law' is being strengthened to include penalties for falsifying
records. Among the main culprits are government officials seeking to add
lustre to their performances as local administrators.
Mr Li Gang, deputy director of the Policy and Law office of the State
Statistical Bureau, said problems arose because 'grassroots officials needed
to fulfil production as well as birth control quotas in order to retain
their positions or get promoted'. 'Serious cases are under investigation,'
he added. 'Those who add 'water' to the statistics will be punished
according to the law.'
He said problems of false statistics had become more prevalent in this
transition phase in the Chinese economy from a centrally-planned system to a
market-oriented one. 'When the (1984) law was being drafted there was
basically only one economic structure in China. Today there are several
economic systems.'
But false and exaggerated statistics are nothing new in China. During the
Great Leap Forward of the 1950s agricultural production figures were wildly
exaggerated to conform with overheated propaganda about the success of the
communist system. In reality the Great Leap was a disaster and millions are
believed to have starved to death as China's communist rulers were
proclaiming the triumph of the system.
Western economists in Beijing say they approach Chinese statistics warily,
but inflation figures appeared to be a reasonable reflection of price
trends; although the 'collection methods (of statistical information) is not
what we would expect in the west,' said one.
The Qingdao conference heard that the two worst-offending provinces were
Hebei and Shanxi in the north where 20,000 cases of falsifying records had
been uncovered in 1993. In one county in Hebei province the birth rate had
been under-stated by half to avoid censure over the failure of local
officials to curb population growth.
Among the most prevalent examples of false reporting in Hebei and Shanxi was
an over-statement of per-capita income of peasants. This was to avoid
revealing the extent of impoverishment and allied to that the failure of
local official to improve living standards.
In other areas, such as the wealthier coastal regions, peasant incomes were
under-stated to minimise tax.
Speakers at the Qingdao conference criticised the present law which lacked
'teeth' to punish violators; did not give representatives of the central
State Statistical Bureau the automatic right to 'audit' local statistics;
and was inadequate for the requirements of a rapidly evolving market
economy, especially in the monitoring of a fast-growing private sector.

The Hong Kong government yesterday admitted for the first time that the
colony's multi-billion dollar airport would not be fully operational by the
time British rule comes to an end in mid-1997, Simon Holberton reports from
Hong Kong.
Mr Hank Townsend, chief executive of the Provisional Airport Authority, the
government corporation responsible for the building of the airport, said
contracts to build the terminal building and services would not be finished
until mid-way through 1997.
Award of these contracts, which have a combined value of about HKDollars 8bn
(Pounds 670m), was taken a step closer on Monday when the PAA said 16
international consortia of construction companies had qualified to bid.
China appears to have balked at a UK request to approve financial agreements
between the Hong Kong government and the PAA and the Mass Transit Railway.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Delfin Lazaro, Philippine energy secretary credited with resolving the
country's chronic electricity shortages, has resigned, President Fidel Ramos
said yesterday, Jose Galang writes from Manila.
The resignation, from September 20, came on the eve of Mr Ramos's trip to
Europe and the public listing today of Petron Corporation, which Mr Lazaro
had steered to privatisation.
Mr Ramos said Mr Lazaro was leaving 'because he has done his job and has
fulfilled his commitment'. He is known to have offered to resign as early as
last June, reportedly because of conflicts with other energy officials.
Mr Lazaro was given emergency powers in 1992 to tackle an energy crisis
responsible for 10 to 12 hour daily rationing. Businesses losses ran to
about 7bn pesos (Pounds 172m) a month. With the aid of emergency powers
granted by Congress, the government was able to skip bureaucratic tangles
and gave priority to 'fast-track' power stations.
Mr Lazaro will be replaced by Mr Francisco Viray, president of the state-run
National Power Corporation, which owns most of the country's generating
capacity.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Syria warns Israel over Golan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Syria warned Israel yesterday that it was a waste of time to talk about a
partial withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights, and said no Middle East
peace agreement would last unless it was fair, balanced and comprehensive.
Mr Farouq al-Shara, Syrian foreign minister, on an official visit to London,
accused Israel of trying to gain as much as possible from the negotiations,
while seeking to deny Arab aspirations. 'Such an unbalanced solution would
not survive. It would be a truce, not a lasting peace,' he said. Total
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan area had to precede the normalisation of
relations, he insisted. 'You cannot have normal relations while your land is
still occupied.'
Israel has demanded Syria provide evidence of its pledge to establish full
diplomatic relations before it would indicate how much of the Golan it was
willing to withdraw from. But Mr Shara warned that the longer it took Israel
to pull out of the Golan, the longer would be the delay in establishing
normal relations.
He hit out at Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman,
and King Hussein of Jordan for 'killing' the joint Arab approach to peace
negotiations by signing separate agreements with Israel. 'King Hussein
participated in killing the Arab co-ordination, but it was Arafat's Oslo
agreement which made him do it,' Mr Shara said. Unless the West wanted a
resumption of the civil war in Beirut there was no question of Lebanon
signing a separate deal with Israel.
During talks with Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, Mr Shara appealed
for an end to the European Union's arms embargo against Syria and for a more
active European role in the peace process. Syria was still optimistic about
an eventual agreement, he added.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Consensus near on abortion draft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European and US delegates said last night they hoped to clinch by today an
effective consensus on one of the most controversial passages on abortion in
the draft document of the International Conference on Population and
Development, despite sustained Vatican opposition.
Approval of the section, which urges governments to 'deal openly and
forthrightly with unsafe abortion as a major public health concern' would be
a victory for western and other participants at the conference, determined
to win the broadest possible consensus behind its final document.
Many such representatives also believe the religious row over abortion which
has dominated the meeting threatened to obscure the thrust of the document,
which aims to provide a broad-based global programme for population
stabilisation into the next century.
Mr Tony Baldry, British foreign office minister, said 'very considerable
progress is being made', on the text, adding that he believed the
controversial language would win approval during last night's session. EU
delegates said a version of the text already contained in the draft, and
which states that 'in no case should abortion be promoted as a method of
family planning' was winning 'broad consensus'.
Both Mr Baldry and Mr Timothy Wirth, US assistant undersecretary for global
affairs, said progress had also been made in talks with Islamic and Roman
Catholic countries in agreeing on language which had been interpreted as
condoning homosexuality and advocating adol-escent and extra-marital sex.
Passage of the contentious abortion text would, however, be only the first
round in what most delegates believe will be tough negotiations in the next
few days. The Vatican yesterday issued a statement in which it repeated its
absolute objection to abortion, saying that while it recognised many women
suffered 'difficulties' in pregnancies, 'such difficulties do not warrant
the violation to the right to life'.
The Holy See 'cannot give explicit or implicit support to those parts of the
document regarding abortion,' the statement said. Vatican delegates were
yesterday busy on the floor of the main committee room rallying opposition
to the text. 'They were yanking out Catholic delegates and getting them in a
corner - there was a lot of strong-arm tactics,' said one African delegate.

FT  07 SEP 94 / World Trade News: BAe-Matra missile divisions nearer to
merger deal - Farnborough Air Show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FARNBOROUGH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Matra, the French missiles group, said yesterday that it expected
negotiations with British Aerospace over the merger of their missile
interests to be completed by the end of this year. Mr Noel Forgeard, head of
Matra Defence and Space, said that such deals were a practical way for the
European defence industry to respond positively to the consolidation of US
companies.
Speaking at the Farnborough Air Show, Mr Forgeard said that all operational
and strategic issues had been resolved. However, he added that several
technical problems remained, including those over differing accounting
standards.
It is thought that BAe and Matra have agreed to form a 50-50 joint venture
of missile operations. However, as Matra's order book is larger than BAe's,
the British company will have to pay to gain an equal shareholding in the
joint company. Strong disagreements over the size of the payments are also
thought to be blocking the deal, which has been under discussion for the
past 18 months.
Mr Forgeard said that unlike some defence industry leaders he thought that
Europe had to respond to the consolidation and cost reduction currently
going on in the US industry, but that Europeans also had to be realistic and
accept that there were greater barriers to consolidation in Europe.
Companies should accept that pooling interests into joint ventures, as with
BAe-Matra, was a sensible next step, and that greater efforts had to be made
to cut costs.
Speaking at Farnborough, Mr Forgeard attacked Sweden's recent decision to
buy medium-range air-to-air missiles from Hughes of the US rather than
Matra. He contradicted official Swedish reports which said that the French
missiles were less capable and more expensive than the US alternative.

FT  07 SEP 94 / World Trade News: US and Japan struggle to escape the import
impasse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A 70.3 per cent rise in Japanese vehicle imports last month should bring
cheer to US trade representative Mickey Kantor and Japanese trade minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto, as they meet in Washington today for critical talks on
the bilateral framework negotiations.
The Japan Automobile Importers Association yesterday said total vehicle
imports were 23,391 last month. Of these 21,297 imported cars accounted for
10.7 per cent of Japan's overall car sales. Imported vehicle sales for the
year are expected to reach 250,000, compared with 201,480 last year.
Ford, arguably the most aggressive exporter, though not the biggest, more
than doubled its exports from America last August to 903, while Chrysler
achieved a 72 per cent gain from a year earlier to 1,007. The reversal in
Ford's fortunes in Japan is precisely the kind of change the framework talks
were designed to bring about.
But there is little hope in Japan that these changes will help to break the
impasse in the trade talks by inspiring the US to soften its demands that
Tokyo commit itself to ensuring greater foreign imports in certain priority
markets.
'There is a recognition in both the US and Japan that the framework talks
are the most important in managing the US-Japan relationship. Nevertheless
they have dragged on because of US insistence on a results-oriented approach
to which Japan cannot agree,' says a Japanese foreign ministry official.
Ever since the two countries agreed to launch the talks, the issue over what
the Japanese government will or will not do to help foreign imports
penetrate Japan's markets has been the central stumbling block to an
agreement aimed at removing a particularly prickly thorn in bilateral
relations.
As the fourth Japanese trade minister since the talks began meets his US
counterpart, the issue of whether Tokyo will ensure a significant increase
in imports of foreign products and services ranging from cars and flat glass
to insurance, and in government procurement of medical and telecoms
equipment, remains a formidable barrier to an agreement. 'The position of
both sides is so far apart,' concedes an official at Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry. 'If things continue like this we will just
be running along parallel lines.'
Both sides have agreed that no specific deadline for conclusion of the talks
should be set, but on September 30 the US is committed to deciding whether
to name Japan as an unfair trade partner and start sanctions procedures
under the Super 301 trade bill.
A discouraging outcome to this week's meetings will not do much political
good for a hard-pressed President Bill Clinton or for the shaky coalition of
Japan's prime minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama. The optimistic view is that
given the risks involved, both sides will work at all costs to avoid a
further rift in relations.
Mr Walter Mondale, the US ambassador to Japan, said yesterday that the US
hoped to avoid imposing sanctions on September 30, but that Japan needed to
show a stronger commitment to reducing its trade surplus with the rest of
the world.
'We need to make solid progress on the economic agenda,' Mr Mondale said in
a speech in Washington. He said there had been progress on government
procurement and insurance issues, but the question of cars and car parts was
not close to a settlement.
Raising expectations of a high-level bargaining session at the last minute
before the September 30 deadline, Mr Mondale also said that President
Clinton would meet Mr Yohei Kono, Japan's deputy prime minister, at the
United Nations later this month.
Japanese authorities hope the US will agree to work out a partial deal that
will at least enable the two to avoid a showdown and continue negotiating in
areas where significant differences remain.
On the vital issue of government procurement, the main point that precludes
agreement is again whether Tokyo will commit itself to a 'significant
increase' in foreign penetration or whether it will be allowed to get away
with a promise of 'change'.
The danger is that, given the incentive to reach some kind of agreement and
avoid a further fall-out, the issue will be resolved by simply fudging the
wording so that each side can read the agreement in a way that suits its
purposes.

FT  07 SEP 94 / World Trade News: US super-salesmanship discounts human
rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
When the dust settled on last week's whirlwind business mission to China led
by Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, it was clear that a fractious
Sino-US relationship had been jolted in new directions far removed from the
human rights preoccupations of the early days of the Clinton administration.
While critics looked askance on Mr Brown's old-fashioned cheer-leading on
behalf of American companies, the US official was proclaiming a 'new era' in
Sino-US relations. 'Commercial diplomacy' would now be paramount in guiding
a difficult relationship.
After fiddling over China policy for its first year, the administration
appears to have decided that, in spite of its misgivings about human rights
abuses, it would have to compete more aggressively with its competitors in
Europe and Asia for a share of the world's fastest growing market.
How far Washington's emphasis on super-salesmanship will prove compatible
with other objectives in its relations with Beijing remains to be seen.
At one point in a speech organised by the US-China Business Council, Mr
Brown sounded more like a football coach than a government official. 'We
intend to compete in this market, and we intend to win,' he said to applause
from hundreds of American businessmen, including the chief executive
officers of 25 large corporations. Some of these corporation heads had
signed deals with the Chinese contributing to a Dollars 6bn package of
contracts and memoranda of understanding concluded during the Brown visit.
It is hard to imagine a Republican administration embracing with greater
enthusiasm commercial possibilities in China. Mr Clinton, who had accused Mr
George Bush of 'coddling dictators' in Beijing, has clearly undergone
something of a change of heart since heady days on the presidential campaign
trail. In Hong Kong, Mr Robin Munro of Human Rights Watch/Asia said the
Brown mission 'vividly symbolises the drastic downplaying of human rights
issues in US foreign policy. Basically, China has won hands down on human
rights.'
But defenders of the Clinton administration's new approach to China say that
critics have misconstrued the purpose of the Brown mission, and
misrepresented American policy. They note that during the presidential
campaign, Mr Clinton undertook to place commercial issues at the centre of
foreign policy concerns.
This approach had yielded the successful completion of negotiations on the
North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), and the Uruguay Round which had
cleared the way for the establishment of the World Trade Organisation, the
successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The Clinton administration had been edging away from the crude weapon of
Most Favoured Nation privileged trade access to the American market ever
since a review of China policy in the second half of last year resolved to
'halt the downward spiral' of Sino-US relations. The disastrous visit to
China in March of Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state - China
marked the occasion by harassing dissidents  - added further impetus to
moves within the administration to 'de-link' human rights from annual MFN
renewal.
Mr Clinton's announcement on May 27 that he was renewing MFN more or less
unconditionally - token sanctions were retained - was the culmination of the
policy review begun in the middle of last year.
But administration officials insist that in spite of charges that the
administration has 'flip-flopped' in its China policy, there remains ample
scope for a tough and principled stand on trade and other issues, including
human rights.
These officials note that China and the US, whose trade reached Dollars
39.3bn last year, are locked in difficult discussions on a range of
questions. These include intellectual property rights (IPR) infringements;
arguments over such issues as the transfer of missile technology; textile
quotas; imports of agricultural products; access to China for service
organisations such as banks; and Gatt.
Washington announced in June that China had been placed on 'priority watch'
for six months under special 301 congressional legislation over continuing
IPR abuses. US officials in Beijing say that while China has armed itself
with the necessary rules and regulations to deal with infringements,
enforcement is lax.
But in the end the real test of US resolve in its dealings with China will
come in negotiations on Beijing's application to re-join the Gatt.
The US has been the harbinger of a tough stance on conditions for China's
Gatt entry, arguing that a fast-growing economic power should be obliged to
pay a substantial price for admission.
US negotiators insist that China be obliged to accord the same market access
privileges to its fellow Gatt members as those it will receive itself.
Beijing is arguing, however, that because China is a developing country it
should be granted special privileges for a lengthy transition phase.

FT  07 SEP 94 / World Trade News: UK calls for commercial ships to carry
identification technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's commercial shipping fleet could be fitted with automatic
identification systems by 2002, allowing coastguard and rescue services to
identify vessels and trace ships causing pollution or accidents.
The British government, with the backing of many other shipping nations, has
urged that ships be required to carry transponders - automatic electronic
identification systems - under a proposal to the United Nations'
International Maritime Organisation.
The proposal put forward yesterday may run into opposition from shipowners
concerned at the cost of installing the equipment required and at what they
regard as an infringement of their freedom of the seas.
The equipment could be read from the shore to establish the identity,
position, course and cargo of any vessel within range. Although ships are
presently required to carry their name and home port on their hulls, many
vessels are in effect anonymous while at sea.
Aircraft have carried automatic identification equipment for the past 50
years.
The initiative has been prompted by the sinking of a fishing vessel, the
Ocean Hound, by an unidentified merchant ship in the English Channel in 1991
and by a recommendation of the UK's Donaldson Inquiry into ship safety
earlier this year.
The inquiry said ships should be required to install identification systems
which could be read by coastguards at any time without the intervention of
the crew. At present the coastguard can call up a ship by radio but some
captains refuse to answer.
Growing pressure from governments and public opinion concerned at oil spills
and other maritime accidents has led to calls for ships to made more
traceable at sea.
Of the 400-450 ships which pass through the Strait of Dover each day, only
20 per cent can be identified from the shore.
The UK Department of Transport has submitted proposals to a meeting in
London this week of the IMO's safety of navigation sub-committee. If it
approves the proposal it would then go to the IMO's maritime safety
committee in December.
But even if the idea obtains IMO backing it could take several years for
member governments to ratify it.
The department said it hoped that transponders would be required on ships of
at least 5,000 tons gross tonnage carrying oil, gas or other hazardous
liquids from 1999.
It would be extended to ships of 500 tons or more in 2001 and to all other
ships of more than 300 tons by 2002.

The world competitiveness rankings represent a bold if not necessarily
accurate stab at identifying what makes an economy successful.
This year for the first time, the compilers of the annual World
Competitiveness Report*, the International Institute for Management
Development (IMD) in Lausanne and the Geneva-based World Economic Forum,
have produced a consolidated ranking of 23 rich and 18 poor nations. This
has proved both fascinating and puzzling.
It may come as no great surprise to see the US displace Japan as the world's
most competitive economy. But does it really make sense to rank Singapore,
with a population of less than 3m, above economic heavyweights such as Japan
or Germany?
Part of the problem relates to the desire to be fair to small economies. The
report chooses to define competitiveness as 'the ability of a country or a
company to, proportionally, generate more wealth than competitors in world
markets'.
But, by basing the definition on the idea of global rivalry, the implication
is that countries become a bigger 'threat' the higher their position. The
rankings show East Asia already a competitive force to be reckoned with and
the emergence of a 'second wave' of competitors from Latin America.
At an individual level, however, the 1994 scoreboard produces some odd
results. For instance, Colombia (30th) is considered more competitive than
Italy (32nd), even though Italy is a Group of Seven member with the world's
fifth largest economy and many companies of world renown.
Arguably, the rankings are too dependent on short-term factors - for
instance, the country's position in the economic cycle - and on the
inevitably impressionistic results of an international survey of business
executives which accounts for a third of the data used. (Only 2,851
questionnaires were returned out of 16,500).
The US ascendancy over Japan largely reflects its early economic recovery
while Japan has yet to emerge from its deepest recession in decades.
Other problems arise with the choice of the 381 criteria, availability of
comparable information and the way data are combined to produce the overall
rankings.
What does it mean when business executives classify people in their country
as 'lacking energy and enthusiasm' or 'having a positive attitude to life'?
Interestingly, the most 'positive' nations turn out to be Hong Kong, Korea,
Singapore, Ireland and Malaysia, with Colombia in 8th place.
The most lacking in energy and enthusiasm among the 41 countries rated are,
from bottom, the Czech Republic, Hungary, South Africa, Poland and
Venezuela. Britain ranks 35th.
Discussing the implications for changing competitiveness in a global
economy, the report is in two minds. Prof Stephane Garelli, director of the
World Competitiveness Project, warns that market opening will tempt many
industries to relocate in countries with low-cost labour. Industrialised
nations employ 350m people at an average hourly wage of Dollars 18, he says.
But industry has access to huge new markets such as China, the former Soviet
Union, India and Mexico, with a labour force of 1,200m paid on average less
than Dollars 2.
'Today, an outflow of manufacturing operations from western economies seems
inevitable,' he says. Even more gloomily, he predicts service jobs will soon
follow.
Prof Thomas Vollmann, also of IMD, takes a different view. 'There is a
common misunderstanding that competitiveness in manufacturing depends
heavily on labour costs. For most products this is simply not the case'.
What is needed is 'enterprise transformation' directed at establishing
market dominance, not indiscriminate cost-cutting. 'Lean and mean is too
often anorexia,' he says.

FT  07 SEP 94 / World Trade News: ATR commuter aircraft attract Dollars 100m
of orders - Farnborough Air Show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Franco-Italian ATR consortium, Europe's leading manufacturer of
turbo-prop commuter aircraft, yesterday announced new orders worth more than
Dollars 100m for its ATR42 and ATR72 aircraft.
The orders include two ATR72 aircraft, worth around Dollars 26m, from the
rapidly expanding London-Gatwick based airliner Cityflier Express, a UK
regional carrier operating under the British Airways name under a
franchising agreement with BA.
CSA, the Czech airline, also ordered two smaller ATR42 aircraft worth around
Dollars 22m, while Avianova, an Alitalia subsidiary, placed firm orders for
three ATR72 and options for an additional four aircraft, worth a total of
around Dollars 90m. The ATR consortium, which is jointly owned by
Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy, says the Italian orders
confirmed the boom in regional air transport currently taking place in
Italy. The UK Cityflier order is the first by a UK carrier for the 66-seat
ATR72 aircraft. The two aircraft will be delivered in the livery of BA
Express.
Franchising is a growing trend in the European airline industry, with small
regional niche carriers associating themselves with the marketing power and
brand of large flag carriers to compete in the liberalised single European
airline market.
Cityflier, which already operates five smaller ATR42 aircraft, plans to use
its new ATR72s on the London-Gatwick to Dublin routes as well as on its
London-Gatwick routes to Dusseldorf, Jersey and Rotterdam.
ATR officials also confirmed yesterday that the group was involved in talks
to rationalise a European turbo-prop aircraft industry suffering from
intense over capacity.
Aerospatiale, the French ATR partner, has been in negotiations with British
Aerospace over the possibility of creating a joint venture grouping ATR with
BAe's jetstream turbo-prop operation.
Aerospatiale also believes that ATR, which currently has a share of around
53 per cent of the world's turbo-prop market, could become the focus of a
broad rationalisation of the European turbo-prop industry, grouping not only
BAe's operations but eventually other European producers.
Virgin Atlantic Airways is set to add two Airbus A340 long-range,
wide-bodied aircraft to its fleet as part of its renewal and expansion
programme.

FT  07 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Tokyo probes alleged cartel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese Fair Trade Commission yesterday launched an investigation into
more than 20 Japanese trading companies suspected of forming a cartel to
decide which companies should win government contracts for overseas
development aid projects.
The FTC investigated the offices of leading companies, including Mitsubishi
Corp, Marubeni and Itochu among others, citing a possible breach of Japan's
fair-trade laws.
The raid, which comes as top-level US and Japanese negotiators meet for
talks concerning how to open Japan's markets to more foreign goods and
services, is likely to support US allegations of Japan's widespread unfair
trading practices which prevent foreign companies from winning a fair share
of business.
The suspicion of bid-rigging also coincides with recent US interest in
winning more business stemming from Japanese overseas development aid, the
largest in the world.
Last year, Japan's ODA topped the international aid league for the third
consecutive year at Dollars 11.3bn, followed by the US with Dollars 9bn.
Of that amount, approximately Dollars 8bn was bilateral aid to specific
countries, as opposed to aid given to multilateral organisations.
Of Japan's bilateral aid, 83 per cent is untied and bids are open to foreign
as well as Japanese companies. Most untied aid comprises yen loans which are
directed towards large infrastructural projects such as the construction of
dams.
The latest allegation of cartel activity involves the remaining 17 per cent
of tied aid, about Dollars 20bn, which is grant-in-aid. For reasons of
convenience, bidding for projects carried out on untied aid is open only to
Japanese companies, mainly because the time span for conducting the bid and
completing the project is usually restricted to one year.
Companies involved yesterday expressed surprise at the FTC investigation.
'We don't know what it is about so we don't have any comment,' a Mitsubishi
representative said.

<TEXT>
Australia and Japan will push for a free trade pledge at the next summit of
the Asian Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum in Indonesia in November,
writes William Dawkins in Tokyo.
Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, said yesterday at the end of
a four-day visit to Japan, Australia's largest trade partner, that he
thought Japan wanted 'to see a commitment to trade liberalisation in the
region'.
Mr Keating's announcement came after talks with Mr Tomiichi Murayama, his
Japanese counterpart. The Australian leader gave firm backing for Japan's
attempt to become a permanent member of the UN security council.
In return, Mr Murayama promised Australia that it would not be excluded form
any trade accord between Tokyo and Washington, believed to be the first such
guarantee from a Japanese prime minister, said Australian officials.

FT  07 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Iata warns Asia on airports congestion -
Farnborough Air Show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FARNBOROUGH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Air Transport Association (Iata), the airline industry
trade organisation grouping more than 200 airlines, yesterday urged
Asian-Pacific countries to convene a summit of transport ministers to
address the urgent issue of growing congestion at airports throughout the
region.
Inadequate ground and air traffic control infrastructure in Europe provoked
a crisis in European air transport a few years ago. There was now a risk
that a similar crisis could occur in the fast growing Asian-Pacific aviation
market, warned Mr Pierre Jeanniot, the Iata director-general, at the
Farnborough Air Show in southern England.
Air traffic is continuing to grow faster in the Asia-Pacific region than in
any other market. Iata as well as the leading aircraft manufacturers, Boeing
and Airbus, are forecasting annual air traffic growth averaging around 7 per
cent over the next few years in the region, compared with overall world
traffic growth of 5 per cent in the same period.
Infrastructure both on the ground and the air was coming under 'heavy
strain' in some areas of the Asia-Pacific region, Mr Jeanniot said. Although
a number of new airports were now opening in the area, he said these
investments were already insufficient to cope with the expected growth of
air travel in the region.
Although Europe had started to address the problem of congestion, more
efforts were also needed to harmonise and modernise European air traffic
control systems. At the same time, Europe needed more airport infrastructure
to cope with an expected increase in European air passenger numbers from
394m this year to 653m by the turn of the century and as many as 1bn by
2010, Mr Jeanniot said. In the longer term, Europe would have to adopt a
satellite-based air traffic control management system which would be able to
deliver double the capacity and drastically reduce the existing costs of the
current European system.
Mr Jeanniot also attacked government taxation policies on air transport, and
especially the introduction in November of an airport departure tax in the
UK.
'This passenger duty will raise Pounds 325m for the UK Treasury. Taxes
simply increase airline costs at a time when consumers are demanding lower
fares,' Mr Jeanniot said.
The new UK airport tax was also attacked yesterday by Sir Colin Marshall,
the British Airways chairman, who argued it would distort competition
because it did not apply to other forms of transport including road, bus,
rail and eventually Channel Tunnel high-speed trains services which will be
competing directly against airline services.

FT  07 SEP 94 / US Congress draft legislation faces logjam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Powerful industry lobbies in the US, from banks to telephone companies, are
anxiously waiting for Congress to return to Washington next week, in order
to see which of a wide array of bills will make their way through the
legislative mill before members go home again for the elections on November
8.
A broad legislative agenda has been held up by the cumbersome wrangling over
healthcare reform legislation, which in turn was slowed down, before
Congress broke for a summer recess two weeks ago, by partisan bickering over
the crime bill.
The crime bill has now been passed, and aides in Congress are now assuming
that healthcare reform, if passed at all, will be a more modest package of
incremental measures than the monumental overhaul originally proposed by
President Bill Clinton.
But the health debate is still likely to take much of the time remaining to
Congress, and it is still not clear which other bills will reach the
calendar for final votes.
Perhaps the closest to passage is the inter-state banking bill, which would
allow banks for the first time to open branches freely outside their home
states. Once inter-state branching had broken free of a long row over
whether banks could sell insurance, it seemed to have a clear run. But the
conference to reconcile the versions passed by the House of Representatives
and the Senate has become embroiled in a battle of Texan egos, with Senator
Phil Gramm objecting to a minor provision included by Congressman Henry
Gonzalez.
Telecommunications reform has further to go before passage. The House has
passed a bill setting out the timetable and conditions for the Bell regional
telephone companies to expand from local telephone service, to which they
are now limited by a court anti-trust order, into long-distance, cable
television and telephone equipment manufacturing.
A similar bill has been drafted by the Senate commerce committee but has not
reached the Senate floor. Rancorous battles are expected there over issues
such as restrictions on the Bells' entry to the cable market. One potential
deal-breaker is a requirement that, if the Bells enter manufacturing, they
do so in the US and use mostly US-made components, a measure which, the
administration has warned, would conflict with the US obligations under
Gatt.
Reform of the Superfund law on the clean-up of hazardous waste sites also
faces several hurdles before passage. Everyone agrees that reform is needed,
but much disagreement remains over whether the specific changes proposed,
would be effective. which are intended to reduce the amount of litigation
over who should pay for clean-ups, would make things better or worse. While
the House Ways and Means committee reached a compromise last month over a
crucial tax on insurers to pay for past clean-ups, the Senate finance
committee has yet to tackle the issue.
Also pending are bills to reform campaign finance laws, overhaul the 1872
law on mining in government lands in the West, and revisions to the Clean
Water Act. In addition, ten of the 13 appropriations bills, which in theory
must be completed before September 30 if the government departments they
cover are not to lose their spending power, have still to be wrapped up.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Cardoso's lead undented by minister's departure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, front-runner for Brazil's presidential
election next month, seems to have kept his lead in opinion polls despite
the resignation at the weekend of Mr Rubens Ricupero as finance minister.
According to a poll on Monday, the day after Mr Ricupero stepped down, Mr
Cardoso's support slipped from 45 per cent a week ago to 44 per cent, within
the margin of error. His main opponent, Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the
left-wing Workers' Party, remained steady at 23 per cent.
The Sao Paulo stock market took heart from the poll and was up 3.8 per cent
at the close yesterday, following Monday's heavy selling.
Mr Ricupero resigned after a private conversation was broadcast on satellite
TV. During that, he admitted the government was backing Mr Cardoso and using
its anti-inflation plan to win him votes.
Mr Cardoso has since been heavily attacked by other candidates who have
called such government support unfair and questioned the ethics of his
campaign.
The poll, conducted by the Datafolha institute among 10,532 electors, showed
Mr Cardoso's support still solid among poorer, less-educated voters.
However, it also gave some hope to Mr da Silva. Among wealthier voters, Mr
Cardoso's support fell by five percentage points to 47 per cent. Mr da
Silva's backing among these increased by four points to 26 per cent. Mr
Cardoso's support also fell in metropolitan areas and in Brazil's more
prosperous south.
Mr da Silva's advisers hope this trend will continue as more people become
aware of Mr Ricupero's resignation and the reasons for it,
The poll showed Mr Cardoso apt to win the election outright on October 3
because his support still outstrips the combined support of his rivals.
However, the poll suggested that, if a run-off between the two top
candidates were needed on November 15, Mr Cardoso would gather 57 per cent
support, Mr da Silva 30 per cent.
Mr Cardoso's campaign organisers will also have been pleased to see that
support for the anti-inflation plan, and its chief component, the Real
currency, has continued to rise and now stands at 80 per cent.
The candidate, when finance minister earlier this year, was responsible for
negotiating the plan through Congress and his lead in the polls is largely
due to the plan's popularity.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Spain seeks liberal moves by Cubans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish government hopes that Mr Roberto Robana, Cuba's foreign
minister, will announce a set of deregulation measures for the domestic
economy during a six-day visit to Spain from today.
Officials are hoping that, in what would be a significant shift towards a
market economy in Cuba, the minister will give a timetable for the removal
of curbs on self-employment in Cuba, with an undertaking to close
state-owned industries which are no longer viable.
Failure by Mr Robana to do so could prompt Madrid to rethink its open-door
policy towards Cuba.
Employment deregulation is one of several policies that has been pressed on
the Cuban government by Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spanish former finance minister,
who has visited Havana twice in the past year after an agreement by Mr
Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime minister, to provide President Fidel Castro
with a senior economic counsellor.
Mr Solchaga, whose representatives have held working sessions in Havana
between his trips, has consistently told the Cubans that their critical
financial troubles owe far more to their state-controlled economy than to
the US economic embargo, which Spain has always opposed.
When it set up Mr Solchaga's mission, Madrid believed a comprehensive
package of economic reforms in Cuba would lead to a transition to political
pluralism. Cuba is the main recipient of Spanish aid in Latin America, in
direct subsidies and export credits. Recent Spanish investment, chiefly in
tourism, is estimated at some Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m).
Even so, the former minister's recommendations have been largely ignored and
the Spanish government, wary of accusations that it is legitimising Mr
Castro's government, now wants to relinquish its advisory role in favour of
a panel of experts from the Inter-American Development Bank, the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Mr Javier Solana, the Spanish foreign minister, who met Mr Castro in early
August and will hold talks with Mr Robana today, has hardened Spain's
diplomatic language, saying that economic liberalisation alone is
insufficient and the Cuban government must take 'urgent' and 'rapid' steps
towards democracy.
Reuter adds in London: The UK government, welcoming recent changes in the
Cuban economy, said yesterday it was sending a minister to Havana for the
first time in 19 years.
Mr Ian Taylor, trade and technology minister, will make a three-day visit to
the island from Monday, with a group of British businessmen, in an attempt
to increase UK-Cuban trade.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Shock waves spread among the powerful: The troubles arising
in Mexico from the Carlos Cabal affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by the Mexican government to order the arrest of Mr Carlos
Cabal Peniche, and take over the country's seventh and eleventh largest
banks, has sent shock waves through the country's business and financial
community.
Mr Cabal is one of the country's most prominent businessmen and, apart from
controlling an important financial group, owns by far the largest
agro-business in Mexico. He has powerful friends in the Mexican government,
and the move against him is expected to embarrass those who actively backed
him, lent him money, and gave him authorisation to run not one but two
banks.
A government official said the finance ministry suspects three cases of
illegal loans, ranging from Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m) to as much as Dollars
700m, paid from Mr Cabal's banks to his private business interests, mainly
involving the purchase of Banca Cremi.
However, the official did not exclude the possibility of more cases when a
thorough audit was completed.
The government moved against Mr Cabal in part to prevent his imminent
purchase of Del Monte Foods, according to the official, with concerns that
the near-Dollars 1bn transaction would be financed illegally.
Mr Cabal had intended to re-merge Del Monte Foods with Del Monte Fresh
Produce, which he and a group of investors bought for about Dollars 500m in
1992.
Del Monte Fresh lost money last year, partly because of low international
banana prices. The finance ministry says it may claim the assets of Del
Monte Fresh if the company turns out to have benefited illegally from its
relationship with Banco Union and Banca Cremi.
The adequacy of Mexico's financial supervision is expected to come under
scrutiny, following the charges against Mr Cabal.
The finance ministry gave Mr Cabal authorisation to buy Union (then called
BCH) in 1991, citing his 'administrative experience and integrity.' It gave
him permission to take over Cremi and, earlier this year, to merge the two
banks.
Separately, Nafinsa, the state development bank, financed 25 per cent of Mr
Cabal's acquisition of Del Monte Fresh. Mr Cabal's investor group includes
current or former governors in the Mexican states of Campeche, Tabasco and
Quintana Roo.
The deals were approved despite the fact that Eastbrook, the former US
trading house, has alleged in a civil suit that Mr Cabal and two former
employees of Eastbrook directed more than Dollars 70m of loans to Mr Cabal's
personal bank account or to shell companies between 1986 and 1991. Eastbrook
claims just Dollars 30m was paid back.
These financial dealings with Eastbrook, were being investigated until
earlier this year by the US district attorney's office in Manhattan. Mr
Cabal's lawyer has denied that he was the target of an investigation by the
attorney's office.
The Cabal case follows a fraud of more Dollars 100m alleged to have been
perpetrated by top executives at Grupo Financiero Havre, who are alleged to
have created shell companies to borrow money from Nafinsa.
With Mexico's banks already suffering from high rates of default on their
loans, and from intense competition, the latest allegations come at a
difficult moment for the financial system.
Officials strongly denied that the Cabal case would have any effect of the
Mexican banking system. They said all of Mexico's banks have now been
audited over the past eight months and that the only ones with suspected
serious irregularities were Union and Cremi. They said that problems at
other banks - of a different magnitude - had been sorted out.
Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, advised Mr Cabal in his planned
acquisition of Del Monte Foods. Salomon Brothers was to have managed an
issuance of Dollars 150m of high-yield debt on behalf of Mr Cabal, which was
registered on August 29 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

<TEXT>
The Mexican government has ordered the arrest of Mr Carlos Cabal Peniche,
head of one of the country's largest banking groups and of Del Monte Fresh
Produce, the international fruit company once owned by Polly Peck
International. The government has charged him with fraud.
The finance ministry immediately took over Mr Cabal's Banca Cremi and Banco
Union - which have combined assets equivalent to nearly Dollars 11bn and
deposits of Dollars 9.8bn - and their subsidiaries, including a foreign
exchange house, and leasing and factoring companies. It said that the
alleged irregularities suspected so far did not affect the banks' ability to
meet their obligations, but all depositors would be protected under the law.
The first casualty of the charges may be Mr Cabal's intended purchase of Del
Monte Foods, the San-Francisco based canned food company. In June, Mr Cabal
and his investor group agreed to buy, for Dollars 277m in cash and about
Dollars 700m in debt, the San-Francisco based canned food company. However,
according to Mexican government officials, the transaction has not yet been
completed.
Mr Cabal had planned to re-merge Del Monte Fresh and Del Monte Foods, which
were split up and sold by RJR Nabisco of the US in 1989. Mr Cabal
subsequently bought Del Monte Fresh out of UK bankruptcy proceedings against
Polly Peck.
Mr Pedro Aspe, Mexico's finance minister, announced on Monday night that the
attorney-general's office had issued an arrest warrant against Mr Cabal,
accusing him of having illegally loaned himself money from his banks to
acquire various business interests. These loans, the ministry alleges,
'represent serious alterations to the accounting of the bank and failure by
the administration to observe basic banking practices.'
Mr Cabal has risen from relative obscurity to run one of the country's
largest business empires, helped by the Mexican government itself.
However, Mr Cabal is being sued by Eastbrook, a now defunct US trading
house, which alleges that he defrauded it of Dollars 70m of loans. Mr Cabal
has vigorously denied these allegations.
A government official said yesterday morning that Mr Cabal had not yet been
apprehended. There were reports that he may be in Europe. However, the
official said four of Mr Cabal's senior executives have been arrested. About
10 people connected to the case were in jail.

The ground has been laid for a massive investment programme in east
Germany's energy sector after the Treuhand privatisation agency yesterday
completed the sale of the region's electricity sector and the biggest brown
coalfields.
After four years of negotiations, the Treuhand sold Veag, the former east
German electricity monopoly, to a west German energy consortium led by RWE
Energie, the country's largest utility, and which includes Bayernwerk and
Preussen-Elektra. At the same time, the agency sold Laubag, the giant
coalfields which straddle the eastern state of Brandenburg to a consortium
headed by Rheinbraun, the brown coal subsidiary of RWE. Laubag will supply
Veag with brown coal.
Under the terms of the agreement, the RWE consortium will pay DM8bn (Pounds
3.3bn) for Veag and invest DM23.3bn (Pounds 9.7bn) until 2012 during which
time it will reduce the workforce from 12,700 to 6,700. The investments will
be targeted on upgrading power stations, introducing strict environmental
controls, and building six 800MW power plants in eastern Germany.
The Rheinbraun consortium, which paid DM2.1bn for the Laubag fields, has
agreed to invest DM6bn until 2015, reducing in the meantime the current
workforce from 12,000 to 8,000. Annual brown coal production will range
between 50m and 55m tonnes.
The two contracts, signed just weeks before the federal elections, and five
days before the state elections in Brandenburg and Saxony, mean that the
brown coal industry in eastern Germany will be saved. However, the
privatisation of Veag had provoked a bitter dispute between east Germany's
cities which had opposed the sale to the west German utilities on grounds
that it would create a monopolistic structure in the region's energy sector.
The Stromvertrag, or electricity contract of August 1990 between the two
former East and West German governments, stipulated that the regional
utilities in the east would have to buy 70 per cent of their power from Veag
over the next 20 years. Despite EU arguments that this would extend west
Germany's monopolistic energy structure to the east, Bonn was determined to
implement the Stromvertrag to secure a future for brown coal.
However, the collapse of east Germany's manufacturing base has already led
to a fall in brown coal's share of the primary energy market from 62 per
cent in 1989 to about 40 per cent, while natural gas, which enjoyed only a
10 per cent share is expected to increase to about 23 per cent by the end of
this decade.
German undercover police have been offered illegal plutonium in what could
be the fifth case of nuclear smuggling in as many months, Bavarian
authorities said yesterday, Reuter reports from Munich. A state interior
ministry spokeswoman in Bavaria, where police seized illegal plutonium at
Munich airport last month, declined to give details.

The first European Union ministerial meeting with the 11 member states of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) ended yesterday in Berlin
with broad agreement to set up working groups to promote closer trade,
political, regional and economic contacts. However, Mr Festus Mogae, SADC

South African membership of the Lome Convention, which gives the other SADC
countries duty-free access to the Union. Mr Manuel Marin, the Spanish EU
commissioner, said the Union wanted to conclude a co-operation agreement
with South Africa, but he admitted that there were 'problems about whether
South Africa would be linked to Lome'. Mr Kaire Mbuende, SADC's executive
secretary, said: 'South Africa is rich . . . But South Africa is one of us.
It has joined SADC on equal terms. We want South Africa to have relations
with the EU. But that should not disqualify it from joining Lome or its
integration into the Southern African states.'

Relations between Greece and Albania will be tested today when a court in
Tirana passes sentence on five Albanian ethnic Greeks who are accused of
spying for Athens. The trial threatens to trigger a crisis between the two
countries. Athens accuses the authorities in Tirana of fabricating the
charges in order to intimidate Albania's Greek minority. Since the trial
began on August 15, the Greek government has deported some 40,000 illegal
Albanian immigrants and blocked European Union financial aid to Albania.
Greece has warned that further measures will be taken if the men are found
guilty. All five defendants are members of the Omonia political movement
which campaigns for Greek minority rights in Albania. Diplomatic efforts to
ease tensions between the two countries appear to have failed. A US envoy,
Mr Richard Shifter, was sent to Tirana and Athens by President Bill Clinton
over the weekend to urge conciliation and encourage the Albanian authorities
to drop the case.

Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, yesterday told the parliamentary
defence committee that a report by the federal audit court which alleged
overspending on the four-nation European fighter was 'completely misleading'
and insisted that the project was on course. The audit report has said the
fighter is likely to cost DM150m (Pounds 62m) a piece, a figure which Mr
Ruhe rejected. The defence ministry said it was still working to reduce the
unit price of the Eurofighter from DM134m, in line with a 1992 agreement
between the defence ministers of Germany, Britain, Italy and Spain. German
industry most recently said the aircraft could be built for about DM103m, Mr
Ruhe said. The opposition Social Democratic party has repeatedly said it
will withdraw from the project if it wins the October elections but some
observers are doubtful about the party's pledge because of the number of
jobs at stake.

Portugal's central bank said yesterday it would lower the compulsory cash
reserve requirement for banks from 17 per cent of customer liabilities to 2
per cent from November 1. The high reserve requirement was introduced in the
1980s as a means of draining liquidity from the banking system and holding
down inflation. The reduction will equate Portuguese banks with their EU
counterparts. But existing reserves, estimated at Es2,200bn (Pounds 8.9bn),
will be converted into special bonds with maturities of 2-13 years to
prevent money markets being swamped by newly released funds. Bankers said
the immediate effect would be neutral in terms of both remuneration and
costs, but banks would be able to employ their funds more profitably over
the medium term as the bonds matured. Banks will also be able to use the
bonds as contributions to a planned deposit guarantee fund.

Finland's centre-right government has averted a threatened large-scale
strike by withdrawing budget proposals for 1995 that angered the trade
unions. The coalition, facing parliamentary elections next March, decided
not to propose a reduction in jobless benefits and the ending of tax
deductibility of union dues. Announcing the changes only a few hours before
the draft budget was given to parliament, Mr Esko Aho, prime minister, said
the proposals - which would have raised about FM550m (Pounds 70.5m) - would
be replaced by other measures and that the budget deficit would not grow.
Following the government's move, the executive of the 1.1m-member Central
Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions said it would recommend that the strike
threat be withdrawn.

Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, head of the Saint Gobain glass group, was yesterday
charged with 'influence trafficking' by a French magistrate investigating
allegations that Pont-a-Mousson, a pipe-making subsidiary, paid a FFr4.4m
(Pounds 530,000) commission in 1988 to a Nantes politician to get a water
contract. After the announcement, Saint Gobain shares plummeted 4.2 per cent
in the hour before Paris trading closed. The investigating magistrate, Mr
Renaud van Ruymbeke, questioned Mr Beffa for five hours. Saint Gobain said:
'Considering that he had not got certain information from subsidiaries in
'the Nantes affair', Mr Ruymbeke thought it necessary to put the president
of the group under investigation.'
A company spokeswoman claimed that the magistrate had brought the accusation
to force more information out of the company and that the charge of
'influence trafficking' was chosen only because a political party was
involved. Mr Ruymbeke has been trying for a year to track the commission,
which is said to have reached a Republican party councillor in Nantes via
the Swiss bank account of a local industrialist. He has also been trying to
establish whether any of the money ended up with Mr Gerard Longuet, the
trade and industry minister, who presides over the Republican party and also
over the region of Lorraine where Pont-a-Mousson has its headquarters.

Proposals by the Milan judiciary to introduce new laws to cope with
corruption are causing serious divisions within Italy's right-wing coalition
government.
Yesterday Mr Giuliano Ferrara, the government spokesman and minister in
charge of relations with parliament, dismissed the action of the Milan
judiciary as an unconstitutional interference in the role of the
legislature.
This brought an immediate reply from Mr Roberto Maroni, the interior
minister. He claimed Milan magistrates had every right to contribute to
solving a delicate national problem.
Mr Ferrara, he claimed with some irony, was speaking as government spokesman
but not for the government which had yet to pronounce on the matter.
Later, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, weighed in to prevent the
matter getting out of hand. He said he understood the motives prompting the
anti-corruption magistrates in Milan to suggest new laws; but he shared the
reserves of several of his colleagues over the judiciary's direct
involvement in politics.
The proposals were advanced by Mr Antonio Di Pietro, Milan's best known
anti-corruption magistrate, with the backing of his colleagues at an annual
meeting of businessmen over the weekend. The suggestions centre on providing
greater incentives, through plea-bargaining, for people to confess to
corruption. The incentives are counter-balanced by stiffer penalties to
deter people from being involved in corruption.
The immediate reaction among politicians appeared to be one of relief.
Finding a solution to the problem of apparently endless prosecutions for
corruption has been a most sensitive issue for more than a year. All
attempts have foundered over public unease that the politicians were being
too lenient to their colleagues, businessmen and civil servants under
investigation. The Milan judiciary has also exercised an effective veto over
any legislation it did not endorse. The move seems to be a neat way of
sidestepping these hurdles.
The approach was welcomed by the populist Northern League and the
neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, two components of the coalition. Mr
Berlusconi's Forza Italia was also supportive. The magistrates' supporters
underestimated the strength of those who felt the move overstepped the
institutional role of the judiciary. Mr Ferrara said: 'The Milan public
prosecutors' office cannot become an agency for making laws. The Milan
magistrature has enormous merit but this should not permit its members to
exceed their role.'
The government is unlikely to take a formal position until the judiciary
presents its proposals to the government.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Tietmeyer warns on EU integration: Bundesbank chief stokes
fires of row over 'variable geometry' Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, has joined the heated debate over
the pace and means of European integration with a warning against the
dangers of exclusive clubs at the heart of the process.
While arguing strongly for a multi-speed, concentric-circle formation, he
said the question had to be addressed of whether this might divide Europe
rather than bring it together.
'Indeed, this danger could arise if countries ready to move into a circle
closer to the centre were to be refused access,' Mr Tietmeyer wrote in the
latest issue of Europa-Archiv, a foreign affairs magazine. 'No circle should
regard itself as a closed society.'
Mr Tietmeyer limited his list of candidates for circle membership to an
unspecified, closely knit group prepared to deepen their bonds quickly,
other European Union members, participants in the European Economic Area and
associated states from central and eastern Europe.
Claiming a single-speed programme would slow progress to that of the lowest
common denominator and severely hamper future monetary and political union,
he suggested several speeds could reconcile potential conflicts between
efforts to widen European union and to deepen it.
'The fear that widening means integration comes to a standstill is based on
the idea that each country must take each step at the same time. The slowest
will then set the pace,' Mr Tietmeyer said. 'But the logic of this argument
will be broken if the multi-speed model is adopted.'
Although he avoided the minefield uncovered last week when leading lights of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union named Germany, France
and Benelux as the core members of a 'variable geometry' community, his
intervention is likely to intensify a row from which Mr Kohl has tried to
distance himself.
Mr Wolfgang Schauble, second only to Mr Kohl in the CDU hierarchy, and a
leading proponent of the party's contentious 'discussion paper' which
started the storm, yesterday repeated that if the pace was dictated by the
speed of the 'slowest ship in the convoy', union would never come about. A
strong core built round France and Germany was necessary, he wrote in the
popular Bild newspaper.
Mr Tietmeyer's comments coincided with fresh signs of confusion in the
German government over the policy document from the Christian Democrats, the
dominant partner in the Bonn coalition.
Mr Jurgen Chrobog, political director of the German foreign office, told a
meeting on Monday of senior EU officials that the paper was not official
government policy. His unusually strong statement was made at a regular
gathering of political directors in Brussels. It was intended to reinforce
efforts by Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, to distance himself from the
CDU paper.
Meanwhile Spain's prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, who is abroad, is to
seek an early meeting in Bonn with Chancellor Kohl, according to Spanish
press reports. This reflects both Mr Gonzalez's real fear that a two-tier
Europe could be high on a Franco-German agenda when the Maastricht treaty is
reviewed in 1996 and his self-appointed role as spokesman for the poorer EU
partners.
The Spanish premier has consistently argued that a two-track integration
would derail the principle of political and economic union as envisaged by
Maastricht. In order to deflect precisely the sort of policies put forward
by the CDU paper, Mr Gonzalez over the years has championed issues such as
European citizenship and cohesion funds for the weaker EU economies.
Meanwhile, the issue has forged an unusual degree of unity between members
of the Italian government and opposition. Mr Antonio Martino, the foreign
minister, and Mr Piero Fassino in charge of foreign policy in the main
opposition grouping, the former Communist party of the Democratic Left,
agreed that EU membership was in the national interest and where possible a
bipartisan approach should be adopted to ensure Italy's position was
properly defended.
For the first time in public Mr Martino voiced a widely held Italian view
that the CDU proposals were announced last week with essentially electoral
considerations in mind. But even if this was the case, Mr Martino said the
idea of Italy in the second league was wholly unacceptable.
In Dublin yesterday, Mr Bertie Ahern, Irish finance minister, said: 'It
would be a matter of grave concern if there were to be a tearaway group. Do
people want to rewrite the criteria which have been accepted and voted on by
the entire European Union? Either you fulfil those criteria of you don't.
Ireland does.'
The Irish government fought - and lost - a five-month battle against
devaluation in 1992 and 1993 precisely to keep Ireland's currency aligned to
the hard currencies within the exchange rate mechanism on track for early
incorporation into monetary union.
In Portugal the governing Social Democrats of Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva, the
prime minister, appear to have been embarrassed by the CDU, with which they
have been trying to forge strong ties. No one from the prime minister's
office or the foreign ministry was prepared to comment on the proposals
yesterday.

Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, yesterday told the parliamentary
defence committee that a report by the federal audit court which alleged
overspending on the four-nation European fighter was 'completely misleading'
and insisted that the project was on course. The defence ministry is still
in difficult negotiations with German industry to set fixed prices. A
ministry spokesman said he expected contractors to submit prices by the end
of the year and that, following final negotiations, parliament could approve
them next year. The audit report has said the fighter is likely to cost
DM150m (Pounds 62m) a piece, a figure which Mr Ruhe rejected. The defence
ministry said it was still working to reduce the unit price of the
Eurofighter from DM134m, in line with a 1992 agreement between the defence
ministers of Germany, Britain, Italy and Spain. German industry most
recently said the aircraft could be built for about DM103m, Mr Ruhe said.
The opposition Social Democratic party has repeatedly said it will withdraw
from the project if it wins the October elections but some observers are
doubtful about the party's pledge because of the number of jobs at stake.

The Bosnian peace talks are reaching a 'decisive phase', Mr Klaus Kinkel,
Germany's foreign minister, said yesterday after the 'contact group'
comprising Russian, French, German, British and US officials held a special
meeting in Berlin. Mr Kinkel said the contact group, led yesterday by the
heads of the political directorates, must find a way to 'bring the Bosnian
Serbs on board' and accept the peace plan already agreed by the Bosnian
Croats and Moslems. He said time was running out as Washington was
considering lifting the arms embargo, and there was pressure from Russia to
lift sanctions imposed on Serbia now that President Slobodan Milosevic had
apparently severed economic ties with the Bosnian Serbs. Mr Kinkel added
that he remained disapppointed that Mr Milosevic had still not agreed to
allow United Nations observers to monitor the border between Serbia and
eastern Bosnia.

<TEXT>
Ms Madeleine Albright, the US ambassador to the United Nations, yesterday
approved Russia's peacekeeping role within the Commonwealth of Independent
States but stressed that it fell short of an optimal solution for settling
disputes in the region.
Ms Albright also insisted 'the burden of proof is on Russia' to demonstrate
that what it sees as peacekeeping activities - sometimes described by
leaders of non-Russian republics as a veiled form of neo-imperialism - are
benign.
Ms Albright's qualified acceptance of Russian military presence in some of
the former Soviet republics along its borders appears to give substance to
an emerging 'pragmatic' American approach to Russia.
The policy, articulated by Ms Albright during a tour through Moldova,
Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia, appears to take a middle ground
between US hawks wary of Russian neo-imperialism and Russophiles, willing to
grant Russia a free hand.
On one hand, during her trip, Ms Albright spoke out sharply for the
withdrawal of Russian forces from the European republic of Moldova, which
borders Ukraine. But, at a press conference in Moscow yesterday, Ms Albright
said the US would be prepared to accept the continued presence of Russian
peacekeepers in the more volatile republics in the Caucasus and central
Asia.
Ms Albright struck this balance yesterday when she said of the newly
independent states that 'Russia has the resources, direct interest and the
leadership required to help resolve the problems in this region'. But Ms
Albright also warned that 'Russian policies and actions must reflect the
fact that it is no longer surrounded by vassals, but by independent,
sovereign states.'
Ms Albright, who is a member of President Bill Clinton's cabinet and
National Security Council, said it would be preferable for the UN to police
the trouble spots in the former Soviet Union but that this was impractical
because of demands on its resources.
'Were it possible to have a normal peacekeeping operation I think we all
agree it would be for the best. But one of the things I have learned in the
past year and a half is that there are more peacekeeping options than
peacekeepers. Peacekeeping is a new growth industry,' she said.
Russian - and other CIS - forces have intervened to keep the peace in
Georgia and Nagorno-Karabakh, which is in dispute between Armenia and
Azerbaijan. But some local leaders have accused Russia of acting in its own
national interests. Ms Albright said she was fully aware of the danger but
was satisfied Russia was now adopting a neutral stance. 'In my mind it is
better to do something than nothing. It is a pragmatic solution. It is not
the optimal solution but it is not the worst solution.'
Ms Albright's comments appeared to flesh out indications from President
Clinton last month that the US would not object to a purely Russian
peacekeeping force in Nagorno-Karabakh, so long as all parties agreed to it
and there was oversight by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe.
The instability in Russia's 'near abroad' was highlighted yesterday as it
emerged that 14 people had been killed and 46 wounded in a bomb blast in a
marketplace in north-east Armenia. The Russian counter-intelligence service
also warned that terrorism could be unleashed in Russia if instability
worsened in breakaway Chechnya.

<TEXT>
The Bonn government's election campaign was given a further lift yesterday
by an upbeat assessment of employment prospects from the federal labour
office.
Although the west German seasonally adjusted jobless total rose last month
for the first time since May, and the number of long-term unemployed reached
a record high, a decline of 71,000 in the unadjusted figure for the whole
country was welcomed as 'most pleasing' by Mr Berhard Jagoda, labour office
president.
The seasonally adjusted jobless total in the west rose 4,000 after falling
18,000 in July, while the unadjusted figure in the east (the only data
published) fell 31,000.
On the basis of unadjusted figures, the western unemployment rate fell from
8.3 to 8.2 per cent, while the eastern rate declined from 15.1 to 14.7 per
cent.
The usual post-holiday fall in unemployment was far more marked than in
earlier years, and the jobs market was responding more quickly to the
economic recovery than 'experts' had forecast, Mr Jagoda added.
Labour office officials said their own budget estimate of 400,000 new
benefit registrations this year was no longer valid, and expected further
improvements as the year advanced. The present pan-German unemployment total
is some 250,000 higher than a year ago.
August also saw a sharp fall in numbers working short-time and an increase
in registered vacancies in both parts of the country.
However, Mr Jagoda said he was concerned that a third of those without work
had been jobless for more than a year, and urged companies to take on more
employees rather than pay for overtime.
Even last year, in the depths of recession, the average employee put in 59
hours of overtime, equivalent to more than 800,000 full-time jobs, according
to Mr Jagoda.
Industrial order data for July, also published yesterday, showed the economy
was still recovering, although at a more modest pace than in recent months.
Manufacturing orders increased by a provisional 0.7 per cent, following a
revised 2.8 per cent rise in June. While domestic demand rose 1.8 per cent,
foreign bookings slipped by 1.2 per cent. However, overall orders were still
8 per cent higher than in July last year.
Economists suggested the strength of the D-Mark might be starting to affect
exports, while the weakness of the US currency appeared to be reducing
American orders for German cars.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Card-sized video camera gives portable computers fresh image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British technologists have created what they claim is the world's first
commercially available miniature video camera able to capture and
incorporate images directly on to a portable personal computer.
The credit-card sized 'PC Card Camera', developed by VLSI Vision (VVL) of
Edinburgh, and costing about Pounds 600 with connections and software, is
seen as having widespread business applications in industries where
employees use portable computers to collect information.
Damage assessors working for insurance companies, for example, could add
photographic images of wrecked vehicles or property to their reports.
Mr Alastair Minty, the company's product manager, said the camera, available
now, has been on trial with a number of large companies over the past few
months.
In its present form, the camera can take single black and white snapshots or
sequences of stills and incorporate them into documents on the computer
screen. The card is attached by wire to a camera, about the size of a
walnut, consisting of a microchip and a tiny lens. Mr Minty said that with
additional software full motion video was possible.
The camera opens up new possibilities for companies with staff in the field
who use porta-ble computers. Images of individuals, documents and events can
all be captured and recorded by the card camera and incorporated into
reports.
Connected to a mobile telephone system, the card camera would make personal
video conferences between the office and a field location possible.
Mr Minty said the company would shortly be adding sound to the system.
VVL, formed in 1990 by Professor Peter Denyer of Edinburgh University and Mr
Roy Warrender, a computer engineer, is credited with developing the smallest
and cheapest video cameras on the market. It has produced a video camera on
a single microchip selling for less than Dollars 10 (Pounds 6.40).
VVL is developing video systems for Donnelly Corporation, a large US-based
vehicle components manufacturer, which holds a sizeable minority stake in
the company.

FT  07 SEP 94 / Reynolds meets Sinn Fein as Major halts talks with Paisley:
Unionists condemn Dublin discussions - PM refuses to hear DUP protests
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Seventy years of Irish history were turned upside down yesterday as Mr
Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, shook hands in Dublin with the
Sinn Fein leader, Mr Gerry Adams, and Mr John Major ejected Mr Ian Paisley,
leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, from a meeting in Downing
Street.
Mr Reynolds' meeting with Mr Adams marked the re-emergence of Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA, as a mainstream party for the first time since
the Irish civil war in the 1920s.
The meeting was attended by Mr John Hume, head of the mainly nationalist
Social Democratic and Labour party, and in a statement the three leaders
said: 'We are at the beginning of a new era in which we are all totally and
absolutely committed to democratic and peaceful methods of resolving our
political problems.'
The meeting was condemned by rightwing Conservative MPs and Unionist
leaders, who claimed that Dublin had broken an agreement not to meet Sinn
Fein leaders for three months after a permanent ceasefire.
However, Mr Major refused to listen to protests from Mr Paisley, the most
popular Unionist politician in Northern Ireland, during a meeting at Downing
Street. As Mr Paisley attempted to read a prepared statement, Mr Major three
times demanded an assurance that the DUP leader would accept his word that
no secret deals had been done.
When Mr Paisley refused to give such an assurance, Mr Major abruptly ended
the meeting. The confrontation followed a meeting of senior British
ministers, chaired by Mr Major, which agreed that the government would
continue to demand guarantees of a permanent IRA ceasefire before entering
talks with Sinn Fein. The government's approach was broadly endorsed by Mr
Tony Blair, the Labour leader, and Lord Holme, the Liberal Democrat
spokesman on Northern Ireland, marking a cross-party rejection of the Irish
government's desire for fast progress towards all-party talks.
Mr Blair said the government was 'right to be cautious and not to engage in
direct negotiations until a proper period has passed so that we can gauge
whether the cessation of violence is indeed permanent'.
British officials said Mr Reynolds' meeting with Sinn Fein was 'premature'.
However, they said the meeting would not interfere with progress towards a
framework agreement on the next stage of the Northern Ireland peace process,
which the two governments hope to produce before Christmas.
The continued caution in London contrasted sharply with the optimistic tone
of the Dublin statement, in which the three nationalist leaders said their
objective was to build upon the IRA ceasefire announcement last week to
achieve 'an equitable and lasting agreement' for Ireland's future. They
appealed to Unionists in Northern Ireland to join in talks.
Mr Reynolds said Mr Major wanted an assurance 'that it is for real; that it
is over'. He said: 'I hope that our statement here today, representing the
sense of the meeting, will indeed help him along that road.'
He challenged his critics, saying: 'To those people who say 'Why so soon?'
my answer has to be - it is never too soon to save a life, and never too
soon to stop the killing.' Unionist leaders reacted angrily. Mr David
Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said he was 'astonished' the
Dublin meeting had taken place. 'Mr Adams has at his back a private army
still with thousands of weapons, still with tons of munitions at his
disposal,' he said. 'For an Irish prime minister to meet with the leader of
a subversive organisation who has got his private army intact is really
quite astounding.'
Mr Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Conservative backbench Northern Ireland
committee, said the meeting was 'a disastrous miscalculation by the Irish
government, and potentially it has most damaging consequences'.
He said there was 'grave concern that the Irish government is scuppering the
process by bending over backwards to appease the IRA'.
In Belfast yesterday Republican sources indicated that the IRA had no
intention in the medium term of being more specific about the meaning of its
ceasefire. 'We have entered an unarmed stage of our struggle for
self-determination for the Irish people,' a Republican source said.

FT  07 SEP 94 / PM's patience runs out after 'secret deals' row at No 10
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday ordered Mr Ian Paisley to leave the Cabinet room
after the leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party refused to accept
the prime minister's assurances on the Ulster peace process.
The confrontation happened as Mr Paisley, accompanied by the DUP's two other
MPs, tried to read a long statement condemning 'a concentrated attempt to
move us ratchet by ratchet out of the United Kingdom'.
Three times Mr Major interrupted Mr Paisley and demanded to know whether the
DUP leader accepted his word that no secret deals had been done with the
IRA.
When Mr Paisley declined to answer, the prime minister ended the meeting and
told the DUP delegation to leave.
The meeting was always likely to be theatrical, given the need for both Mr
Major and Mr Paisley to make their points, but it descended into farce when
Mr Paisley ignored the prime minister and insisted on delivering the rest of
his statement. As he read on, Mr Major left the room with Sir Patrick
Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland
minister of state.
Outside Downing Street, Mr Paisley claimed the prime minister had shouted at
him as he tried to deliver his statement, and ended by ordering the DUP
delegation to 'get out of this room. Never come back until you're prepared
to say I speak the truth and do not tell lies.' Mr Paisley added: 'His
language was disgraceful. He thought that he would stir enmity in our
hearts, but the anger was in his heart. The shouting was on his part - we
remained silent and heard him out.'
British ministers and officials told a different story. Sir Patrick said Mr
Major 'saw no purpose whatsoever in answering questions that Mr Paisley had
put, or indeed any questions put by somebody who declined to accept the word
of the British prime minister'.
Mr Ancram said that Mr Major had been 'quiet and polite'. But he said the
prime minister would not meet Mr Paisley unless the DUP leader backed down.
'If there is to be another meeting, the same assurances will be required of
Mr Paisley,' Mr Ancram said. British officials said the prime minister
decided to take a stand over his government's integrity after Mr Paisley
accused him of lying in a broadcast interview.
Downing Street hopes the confrontation will reinforce the government's
credibility with moderate Northern Ireland unionists, whose support is
crucial to the peace process.
The brusque treatment of Mr Paisley is also designed to shore up support for
Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionist party, which has so far gone along with
the government's approach.
Dr John Alderdice, leader of the non-sectarian Alliance party, praised Mr
Major for standing up to Mr Paisley. 'Previous British governments have
backed off and thought it better to appease the man, but Mr Major has simply
run out of patience,' he said.
Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, said he would welcome a meeting with
Mr Paisley.

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK factory output at highest level for four years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The increasingly healthy nature of the UK economic recovery was highlighted
yesterday with official figures showing that monthly manufacturing output
rose to its highest level for about four years in July.
With much of this growth coming from factories producing raw materials for
industry and capital investment goods, the data provided further indications
that the recovery is shifting further from consumer spending towards a more
investment driven upturn.
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Kenneth Clarke,
chancellor of the exchequer, will hold their monthly monetary meeting today
and are expected to discuss whether base rates should rise to curb
inflationary pressures generated by this growth. But in spite of City
assumptions that interest rates will rise this year, the recent benign
economic data have left analysts doubtful that rates will change today.
The Central Statistical Office said manufacturing output rose by a
seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent in July, compared with June, and now stands
only 2 per cent below its last peak in March 1990. Measured on a three
monthly basis, output rose 1.3 per cent in the three months to July,
compared with the previous three months. This yesterday led the CSO to
revise its trend estimate for the annual manufacturing growth rate to 5 per
cent, up from the 4.5 per cent growth previously estimated.
The level of overall industrial production, which also includes the
utilities and energy sectors, remained unchanged in July compared with June.
This was because manufacturing growth was offset by a fall in North Sea
production, the CSO said.
The Treasury yesterday welcomed the data as evidence of the 'continued
recovery in manufacturing', and noted that whereas the consumer sector had
previously provided much of the economic growth, the investment and raw
materials sectors were now outpacing the consumer industries.
The output of capital investment goods, such as computers and industrial
plant, grew 0.7 per cent in the three months to July, compared with the
previous three months, with a strong performance from the electronics
sectors. The output of the intermediate goods sector, which provides the
fuel and materials for industry, grew 2.7 per cent in this period. Consumers
industries' output, however, grew by only 0.4 per cent, with falls recorded
in the cars and clothing sectors.
This relatively weaker performance of the consumer sector was yesterday
echoed by figures showing that new UK car registrations in August, the most
important new car sales month of the year, rose by only 2.8 per cent
year-on-year to 452,566.
The total was well below earlier motor industry forecasts for registrations
of 475,000 to 500,000. By contrast, registrations of new commercial vehicles
rose last month by 19.9 per cent year-on-year.

Pope John Paul postponed a visit to the Bosnian capital Sarajevo tomorrow
after failing to receive security guarantees. Bosnian Serbs, whose forces
surround Sarajevo, refused to provide assurances that Sarajevans who turned
out to greet the Pope would be safe. They said Moslems would stage an
incident and then blame the Serbs. Two United Nations aircraft were hit by
small arms fire at the city's airport, where the papal aircraft would have
landed.

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Suter at Pounds 12m as Wilkes integration
continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suter, the industrial conglomerate chaired by Mr David Abell, said it was
proceeding well with the integration of Wilkes, the Sheffield engineering
group it acquired full control of in May.
Suter's pre-tax profits were Pounds 12m in the six months to July 2,
compared with Pounds 29.6m which included a Pounds 19.1m disposal gain. The
group said a better guide to underlying performance was profits before tax
and exceptionals, up 14 per cent from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 12m. Sales rose
11 per cent to Pounds 110.1m. Savings of more than Pounds 1m have been
achieved at Wilkes, and Mr Abell is seeking closer integration of Avon
Transmissions with the group's existing Mitchell Cotts Remanufacturing
business.
The group intends to concentrate on completing the integration of Wilkes,
continuing its capital expenditure programme and pursuing additional
opportunities to enhance core activities. Negotiations are continuing for
the sale of substantial property assets and certain non-core subsidiaries.
Suter's refrigeration business increased operating profits from Pounds 2.2m
to Pounds 2.7m. The UK and continental European markets had been depressed,
but business had picked up strongly in South Africa.
Trading profits from the chemicals businesses fell from Pounds 4.2m to
Pounds 3.6m. Speciality chemicals businesses performed well, but fine
chemicals suffered from pricing pressure.
The group's automotive and engineering businesses performed well, raising
operating profits from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 3.6m. The exception was
Floform, acquired from Wilkes, which had disappointing volumes in the first
half, but this has been addressed. Consumer products increased operating
profits from Pounds 400,000 to Pounds 700,000.
Mr Abell said: 'If we can - as I believe - expect a period of steady
economic growth with low inflation in the UK, our confidence in it as a
healthy location for our main manufacturing operations is justified.'
Stripping out gains from property, analysts expect full-year profits of
about Pounds 22m, which puts the shares - down 11p yesterday at 198p - on a
prospective multiple of nearly 16. Earnings per share were 6.6p, compared
with 6.3p before exceptionals, an increase of 4.8 per cent. The interim
dividend rose to 3.5p (3.4p).

FT  06 SEP 94 / Price rises help Coats to 10% advance: Textile group pays
its first foreign income dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coats Viyella, Britain's largest clothing and textiles company, yesterday
shrugged off patchy demand and sharp increases in raw material prices by
reporting a 10 per cent rise in first-half profits. The group's success in
passing on price rises to customers helped lift pre-tax profits from Pounds
62.8m to Pounds 69.2m in the six months to June 30.
'We've been more creative than other manufacturers in passing on increased
prices; we've recovered costs in the market place and we're on track to make
further progress,' said Mr Neville Bain, chief executive.
The group had seen signs of a strengthening recovery in the UK and
continental Europe, which contributed to increased sales of Pounds 1.22bn
(Pounds 1.17bn).
Operating profits, however, were held back by disappointing performances in
two core divisions - fashion retailing and clothing. Profits in the fashion
business fell from Pounds 4m to Pounds 3m after an unsuccessful attempt to
attract younger customers, while the clothing division reported reduced
gains of Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 5.2m) after closing its south Wales uniform
factory.
However, in the thread division - the largest business - profits rose
marginally from Pounds 45.9m to Pounds 46.1m and all other operations,
except home furnishings, improved.
The figures were also flattered by sharply reduced interest payments of
Pounds 14.2m (Pounds 26.1m) following the conversion last November of Pounds
97.7m worth of its 7.25 per cent convertible preference shares.
Mr Bain said the group would be paying a foreign income dividend (Fid) for
the first time. Under the scheme, introduced in the last Budget, companies
can relieve surplus advance corporation tax by paying dividends out of
overseas earnings. Coats declared a maiden Fid of 4.375p per share,
equivalent to a conventional dividend of 3.5p net - an 8 per cent increase.
Mr Bain admitted that the move had been prompted, in part, by market
criticism earlier this year of its third successive enhanced scrip dividend,
which contributed to a 15 per increase in the number of shares in issue.
Earnings per share, adjusted to treat the enhanced scrip dividends as rights
issues at less than the full market price, rose from a restated 4.6p to 6p.

FT  06 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Coats Viyella
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Managers looking for an easy life do not, on the whole, go into textiles.
Yet if Coats Viyella is right, textiles companies are enviable in one
respect - their ability to pass on raw materials price rises to their
customers. It seems that by adding a few cheap frills to a blouse Coats can
convince shoppers it is a new product and increase the price to cover higher
cotton costs. Coats expresses confidence that it will continue to recover
cost increases fully as they work through over the next few months. Given
the current negligible inflation in clothing, that would be quite an
achievement.
The odds are that Coats' UK markets will remain tough, and particularly
those related to housing moves, which will make it all the more important to
avoid self-inflicted wounds. It was not the only one to be caught off-guard
by the changes in women's knitwear fashions but the botched attempt to
attract younger women into Jaeger was a dangerous gamble.
Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the interim figures, for which
Coats bears little blame, was the fall in profit from less developed
countries. Coats' exposure to fast-growing markets in Latin America and Asia
has been one of its main attractions for investors. Yet the nature of Coats'
business makes it vulnerable to these economies' fluctuations and even if
more stable growth were achieved they would still account for a relatively
small proportion of group sales. Investors may have to come to terms with
the fact that Coats, like Jaeger, is a mature business.

FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Borealis cuts losses to DKr250m
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Borealis, the plastics joint venture set up this year by the Finnish and
Norwegian state-owned oil refiners, Neste and Statoil, cut its first-half
loss to DKr250m (Dollars 41m). Turnover was about DKr6.53bn.
No comparable figure for 1993 was available, but Mr Svein Rennemo, Borealis'
chief financial officer, said the loss last year was estimated at
DKr1bn-DKr1.2bn.
Mr Rennemo said cost reductions resulting from the merger, which created
Europe's largest producer of polyethylene and polypropylene, played a
significant part in the improved performance.
Mr Rennemo cited several gains from the merger. He pointed to lower costs
for head office staff, a streamlined sales force, lower research and
development costs, and lower costs arising from operating the Neste and
Statoil petrochemical operations at Stenungssund in Sweden as a single
operation.
Borealis forecast a better second half, when growing demand for plastic raw
materials is expected to liftprices.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Metallgesellschaft more optimistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft expects to earn more than DM100m (Dollars 64m) in
operating profits in 1994-95 after last week's agreement to staunch the
flood of losses on controversial oil purchase contracts with Castle Energy
of the US.
Current risk provisions of DM1bn already set aside to cover these deficits
would have to be increased, the group said last night, although no
significant new burdens had arisen from the deal with Castle, it added.
The metals and engineering group, which came close to collapse early this
year before being rescued by its creditor banks, also announced it had
signed an agreement in principle with an unnamed buyer for its Frankfurt
headquarters. It expected the disposal to yield 'considerable extraordinary
profits'. Unofficial estimates have valued the site at about DM750m.
A 'solution had come closer' in efforts to sell a 47 per cent stake in the
Kolbenschmidt automotive components company. The group, which is known to be
negotiating with Dana Corp of the US and T&amp;N of the UK, recently instructed
Deutsche Bank to draw up plans to place the stock as an option to an
industrial sale.
In a statement issued after a meeting between the banking consortium which
raised a DM3.4bn salvage package and the company's supervisory board,
Metallgesellschaft said it would seek further fresh capital at the end of
the current year on September 30, and was confident its proposals would be
approved by the banks and shareholders.
The tone of the statement contrasted sharply with a recent warning the
company issued at the time of the announcement of terms for its most recent
capital-raising move: the offering of 5.6m new shares to raise DM1.4bn.
The prospectus said the success of restructuring measures could not be
guaranteed, and there was no chance that dividend payments would be resumed
in the foreseeable future.
Even though dividend prospects still appear dim, the company seems almost to
have reached the end of the sell-off phase of its restructuring, leaving it
dependent for future earnings on the rump, which comprises mainly metals
trading operations, environmental engineering businesses and a bank.
The shake-out has led to the sale of all mining interests, the highly
profitable Buderus heating equipment maker, and sharp contraction in
German-based metals smelting. The crucial move, however, was last week's
negotiated escape from contracts between Castle and Metallgesellschaft's US
subsidiary MG Corp.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Labor Day baseball struck out by dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It was the US Labor Day holiday yesterday, and President Bill Clinton had
weighty matters of labour relations on his mind - the country's baseball
strike, now into its fourth week.
'I might say, on this Labor Day, there's still time for them to go back and
finish the best baseball season in 50 years, and I hope they will,' said Mr
Clinton, taking time off from his holiday on Martha's Vineyard for a speech
at a Maine shipyard.
Mr Robert Reich, the president's top labour official, was also on the case.
He has offered to mediate between the two sides, but said yesterday there
was no point in mediating unless both sides actually wanted to negotiate.
For the first time since Labor Day was established 100 years ago, there was
no major league baseball to watch on the holiday that traditionally marks
the end of summer.
Hopes are fading fast that the deadlock between the players and the team
owners might be broken in time for at least a truncated championship
play-off.
The owners insist the players must agree to a salary cap. The players insist
there can be no serious negotiation until the idea of a salary cap has been
dropped.
On a Labor Day when New York City's trade unions could not muster enough
support for their traditional parade, the doggedness of the tiny baseball
players' union in pursuing its eighth strike in 23 years stands in sharp
contrast to the weakness of the rest of the union movement.
Today only 11 per cent of the private sector workforce is represented by a
trade union, with only the government employees' unions showing anything
like the bargaining tenacity of the professional sports unions.
That may have something to do with the fact that most baseball players,
whose average salary now tops Dollars 1m, have put something aside for a
rainy day, and can also supplement their income while they are on strike by
selling autographs or through advertising endorsements.
At least for sofa sports fans the American Football season has started.

<TEXT>
Caribbean countries willing to provide 'safe havens' for refugees from Cuba
and Haiti will be treated 'favourably' by the US, but no Caribbean
government is being pressed into accepting the refugees, according to a US
envoy to the region.
'It is obviously true that any country which helps by taking the boat people
that our ships are picking up at sea is doing us a favour, and it's
obviously true that any country that helps us out in that regard and helps
these poor people . . . would be doing a humanitarian service,' said Mr
George Jones, US ambassador to Guyana. 'Would that be favourably looked upon
in Washington? Of course it would be.'
Several opposition parties in the region have suggested that governments are
being pressed by Washington into accepting boatpeople, and into providing
troops as part of a planned US and allied invasion of Haiti. Mr Jones
described these suggestions as 'absolutely' untrue.
Several countries have agreed to accept varying numbers of Haitians, and
have been asked by the US government to accept Cuban refugees. Dominica, St
Lucia, Surinam, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, a British possession, have
agreed to accept thousands.
Several Caribbean countries also agreed last week to provide about 300
soldiers for a non-combat role in a likely US-led invasion of Haiti to
remove that country's military rulers and reinstate the exiled president,
Father Jean Betrand Aristide.
Mr Ralph Maraj, Trinidad and Tobago's foreign minister, said there has been
'no arm-twisting at all'. Dame Eugenia Charles, prime minister of Dominica,
said that, while her government was willing to grant 'safe haven' to Haitian
refugees, it had not agreed to accept any Cubans.
The administration in the Cayman Islands, a British dependency, says it is
in danger of being overwhelmed by refugees.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Barbadians go to the polls today in an early election for a new government
for the Caribbean island. Latest opinion polls put Mr Owen Arthur's main
opposition Barbados Labour party in the lead.
The election, being held 15 months before it is constitutionally due, was
called by Mr Erskine Sandiford, the outgoing prime minister, after he lost a
no-confidence vote in parliament when rebellious cabinet members, critical
of his leadership, voted with the opposition.
Mr Sandiford, who is a candidate in the election, has been replaced as
leader of the Democratic Labour party by Mr David Thompson, a 32-year-old
lawyer who is the island's finance minister.
The opinion polls give the BLP 32 per cent of popular support, with 21 per
cent going to the incumbent DLP and 9 per cent to the minority opposition
National Democratic party, which is led by Mr Richie Haynes. The pollsters
warn, however, that the outcome of the election could be determined by the
38 per cent of voters who were undecided up to last weekend.
Reducing the island's 22 per cent unemployment rate, maintaining the
stability of the currency and expanding the business sector are the issues
which have dominated the campaign.
The DLP has promised measures to cut unemployment by 5 percentage points
over the next 18 months, followed by 4 points the following year, and 3 the
next. The jobs are expected to come from proposed tax cuts and from new
investments in hotels, construction and expansion of the information
processing sector.
The development of small businesses through a range of incentives has been
proposed by the opposition BLP as one means of reducing unemployment.
It says that if elected, it will transform the island's economy, which is
presently based on tourism and cane sugar production, into one based on a
range of services for foreign markets.
The three parties contesting the election have said they will resist
pressure from international financial institutions to devalue the Barbados
dollar. The currency, whose parity is fixed by the government, has been
under pressure intermittently over the past four years.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Talks on peace in Mexico to start this week

<TEXT>
Talks aimed at reopening peace negotiations between the Mexican government
and armed rebels in the south-eastern state of Chiapas will start this week,
after a weekend of protests there, writes Ted Bardacke in Mexico City.
Bishop Samuel Ruiz, a local mediator in the crisis, announced a series of
'urgent meetings' after about 20,000 indigenous peasants had blocked all
roads in and out of Chiapas at the weekend and demonstrated in at least 40
towns. Officials warned of a possible resumption of hostilities in the
state, where Zapatista left-wing guerrillas began an uprising on January 1.
Demonstrators are now seeking to prevent Mr Eduardo Robledo of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party from taking office as governor, after his
election on August 21. They allege fraud and are demanding that Mr Amado
Avendano of the opposition Party of Democratic Revolution, who was openly
supported by the rebels, be declared victor.
Bishop Ruiz said that a 'clarification' of electoral irregularities, as well
as a new round of peace talks, was the key to any permanent settlement in
the state. Mr Robledo 'is going to have very serious problems,' the bishop
told the newspaper Reforma.
Mr Robledo was a top aide to Mr Absalon Castellanos, the former governor of
Chiapas who was kidnapped by the rebels at the beginning of fighting in
January, then released after a ceasefire.
Mr Javier Moreno, the acting governor, said there were 'ominous signs which
announce possible confrontations.'
He is facing disquiet, not only from the protesters but also from
land-owners who have accused the state government of turning a blind eye to
land occupations by rebels and their civilian supporters.
'I hope that statements which contain a high degree of radicalism do not
turn into reality,' Mr Moreno said. He denied the existence of any new armed
groups in the state.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Commerzbank in Tokyo gets bill for extra taxes
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese tax authorities have sent the Tokyo branch of Commerzbank,
Germany's third biggest commercial bank, an additional tax bill of Y40m
(Pounds 2.58m).
The National Tax Agency claims the bank failed to report income of Y100m in
1991 and 1992. The bank is the first financial institution to be involved in
the tax agency's crackdown on Japanese affiliates and branches of foreign
companies, which have been allegedly trying to avoid paying local taxes by
transferring profits from Japan.
In July, the tax agency stepped up efforts to tackle the problem. Last
month, the Japanese subsidiary of Asea Brown Boveri was ordered to pay
Y1.1bn in additional taxes.
Ciba-Geigy, Roche, Hoechst and Coca-Cola, the US beverage company, are also
among companies sent penalty tax bills.
Commerzbank said a misunderstanding arose over when it should have booked
costs for its computer investment. A company official said about 60 per cent
of the Y100m in under-reported income derived from computer costs; the rest
was from financial trading, including derivatives.
Japanese tax authorities have started targeting profits made on derivatives
trading, an area where foreign banks and brokers have expertise, and the
main source of income at foreign institutions.

to be cleared

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Srichand Hinduja, chairman of the London-based Hinduja trading group,
yesterday called on the Indian government to move quickly to complete its
investigations into the 1987 Bofors scandal.
In a statement issued in New Delhi Mr Hinduja said he and his brothers
(Gopichand and Prakash), accused in the Rs14.5bn (Pounds 300m) Bofors gun
payoff, were keen to clear their name. 'We have done no wrong and that is
why we have committed an investment of more than Rs110bn in core sectors in
India,' Mr Hinduja said.
He urged the Indian government to make specific requests for documents from
the Swiss authorities about the alleged payments from Bofors, the Swedish
gun maker, relating specifically to the Indian gun deal in 1987, and not
'any payments from Bofors'.
'It is for this reason we have been compelled to be appelants in Switzerland
to ensure that payments relating to such commercial transactions with the
said group and unrelated to the gun deal does not get mixed up with the
documents of the gun contract to be sent to India.'
The Indian government's Central Bureau of Investigation had made public the
names of seven persons, including the Hinduja brothers, and Mr Win Chadha,
former Bofors agent in India, and Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi,
whose plea for secrecy about their involvement in the scandal was rejected
by the Swiss Supreme Court last year.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Italy's Northern League in purge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's Northern League party yesterday expelled three prominent critics of
its tough-talking leader, Mr Umberto Bossi, in a purge of dissenters, Reuter
reports from Milan.
A party statement said the expulsion of Mr Franco Rocchetta, Ms Marilena
Marin and Mr Vittorio Aliprandi, all members of parliament from the Veneto
region of north-east Italy, had been decided unanimously by the movement's
ruling federal council.
Mr Rocchetta, a junior foreign minister in Italy's coalition government who
holds the largely honorary rank of League president, has accused Mr Bossi of
running a dictatorship. He told Italian reporters in Berlin, where he was
attending a European conference, that the federal council was 'a prison in
which every voice of dissent is smothered'.
In an apparent reference to Mr Bossi, he said it was 'peculiar that of the
more than 20 members of the council only one understands anything about
politics . . . like a second Mao'. Mr Rocchetta led internal criticism of Mr
Bossi's rumbustious brand of politics last week after the League leader hit
the headlines with bizarre claims that he had personally prevented an armed
revolt by northern Italians incensed at corruption in Rome in the mid-1980s.
Mr Bossi followed this up with uncorroborated claims that the prime
minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, was plotting to hold snap elections to rid
his fragile four-month-old coalition of the League, which provides its
parliamentary majority.
Mr Bossi has engaged in a near non-stop slanging match with Mr Berlusconi,
whom he accuses of trying to brake the League's federalist ambitions. Last
week Mr Bossi offered to resign as the League's federal secretary, the
effective leadership post, if members wanted but pledged to root out his
enemies if he stayed in the job.
A League statement headlined 'Big Purge in the Northern League' said Mr
Rocchetta and Ms Marin had been expelled for trying to damage the movement.
It accused them of plotting to form a single party with Mr Berlusconi's
Forza Italia 'in order to delay federalism'. Mr Aliprandi was expelled for
'being in cahoots with Marin and Rocchetta', the statement said. The three
have the right of appeal.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Nuclear industry urged to improve reputation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), said yesterday the end of the cold war should make nuclear power
more acceptable but the industry was still tainted by scare reports of
plutonium trafficking and safety breaches, Reuter reports from Vienna.
Mr Blix said more countries would adopt nuclear power to generate
electricity only if the industry continued to demonstrate its safety and
environmental advantages.
Mr Blix said in a speech opening a four-day conference on the future of
nuclear power said it is regrettable that the issues which now dominate the
media 'tend to create an atmosphere in which it is difficult to have a
balanced public discussion of the nuclear power option'. Delegates among the
200 experts from 37 countries stressed the need for global co-operation on
safety and new technology.
Mr Blix said alarm over plutonium trafficking and the nuclear programmes of
such states as Iraq and North Korea had overshadowed the benefits of nuclear
power.
'Disturbing as some of these developments are, they do not negate the
overriding trend towards ever greater international co-operation to promote
the peaceful use of nuclear energy,' he said.
Russian nuclear experts in Vienna said Moscow's dependence on nuclear power
could double by 2010 but any further boost in output would depend on safety
and cost. Russia has 29 nuclear reactors, producing 12.5 per cent of its
electricity supply. Four more are under construction.
Mr Viktor Sidorenko of Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry told the conference
that new plant designs were based on modern safety regulations and old units
were now subject to stringent annual security checks. 'International
collaboration and co-operation have become an integral part and condition
for activities in the field of nuclear power in Russia,' Mr Sidorenko said.

FT  06 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Food sector active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CLARE GASCOIGNE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais Laing was behind a number of significant moves in the food
manufacturing sector, triggering weakness in key stocks such as Cadbury
Schweppes, 4 softer at 480p, and good rises in Tate &amp; Lyle, 8 firmer at
449p, and Hillsdown, 4 up at 182p.
CLL also unsettled Hazelwood Foods, which dipped 4 to 139p as the broker
shifted its stance from hold to sell.
There was mild disappointment in the market with interim results from Burmah
Castrol, the lubricants group. Net income was below best estimates, as was
the dividend. But analysts said the market's reaction was more a reflection
of the stock's recent strong outperformance; the shares hit an all-time high
of 915p last week. They closed 14 lower yesterday at 891p.
Ms Irene Himona, oil analyst at Strauss Turnbull and a long-time bull of the
stock, said she still viewed the shares as 'undervalued'. Mr Bruce Evers at
Yamaichi Europe said he remained positive on the stock because of its good
exposure to the recovery in Europe and in the US and Far East.
Figures from Coats Viyella, the UK's leading textile group, saw the shares
improve 6 to 226p following recent underperformance. Half-time profits of
Pounds 69.2m were at the top of the range and analysts were relieved to hear
that the company's difficulties in Turkey were easing. However, some
analysts expressed caution over the low level of growth at the operating
profits level. The profits range for the full year is now between Pounds
160m and Pounds 170m.
There was strong speculation in the electricity sector of further share
buy-backs by the 'recs', although the only significant individual deal was a
trade of 1m Eastern Electricity shares at 788 1/2 p. Eastern, which eased 3
to 792p, has already been active in the market to buy in its own shares,
acquiring around 5 per cent of its shares last year.
Other recs rumoured to be about to embark on buy-backs included Northern and
South Wales. Northern was one of the best performers yesterday, the stock
climbing 14 to 824p. South Wales rose 9 to 796p.
Oil shares put on a good showing in spite of the end of the strike by
Nigerian oil workers. British Petroleum led the sector, moving up 5 to a
record 422p, albeit in thin turnover of 4m, as marketmakers spoke of US
buying and a chart breakout. Traders were picking up stock ahead of a
presentation to analysts in London on Thursday week by the head of the
group's exploration division. BP recently announced a substantial new gas
discovery in Colombia and the market is expecting more good news from that
region.
Shell Transport, which reports its interim dividend the same day as the BP
presentation, rose 5 1/2 to 758p.
Bank shares remained among the market's best performers, with institutional
buyers continuing to chase the sector. TSB reached its highest level for six
months, closing a further 5 1/2 up at 233p on turnover of 4.7m, still
boosted by last week's Hoare Govett buy note and also by hints of possible
takeover activity.
Fund management groups kept up their recent good form, with Mercury Asset
Management appreciating 17 to 670p.
The aerospace sector was an oasis of calm as most analysts left their desks
to attend the first day of the Farnborough Air Show. News that Airbus was to
take over the European military transporter project came as no surprise and
British Aerospace, one of the four Airbus partners, was unmoved at 513p.
Positive comments from Siebe's chief executive Mr Allen Yurko at the
company's annual meeting helped to take the shares up 5 to 595p. The market
had been expecting the good news - on Friday the stock bounced 18 to 590p -
but was particularly pleased with news of the contracts for Foxboro, the US
industrial controls group, which showed it gaining market share.
Suter, whose interim profits dropped to Pounds 12m from Pounds 29.6m
previously, fell 11 to 198p.
BTR added 8 1/2 at 392p ahead of results due on Thursday. Kleinwort Benson
reiterated its positive stance.
Paper group Bunzl improved 7 to 173p following top-of-the-range half-year
profits of Pounds 32.8m. Many analysts responded to the confident statement
and strengthening margins by edging up forecasts for the full year above
Pounds 68m. Hoare Govett went to Pounds 68.5m and Panmure Gordon to Pounds
73m.
Elsewhere in the sector, Bowater, which reports today, moved forward 6 to
473p. The group is expected to produce profits of around Pounds 102m.

<TEXT>
The best individual performance in the FT-SE 100 Index came from Standard
Chartered, the banking group, whose shares extended last Friday's good
showing, finishing 10 higher yesterday at 265p.
Dealers said the impetus for the shares' bout of outperformance came from
Lehman Bro-thers, one of the leading US investment banks, with UBS also
reported to have been recommending the stock. Lehman was said to have been
an aggressive buyer of the stock last Friday and throughout yesterday after
upgrading its profits forecast for Standard.
The US brokerage was thought to have increased its current year estimate
from Pounds 480m to Pounds 505m and lifted its forecast for next year from
Pounds 525m to Pounds 575m.

FT  06 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy session for WPP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CLARE GASCOIGNE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Activity in WPP, the advertising and marketing services group, dominated
yesterday's business in the London stock market. Banks that bailed out the
company two years ago through a convertible share issue sold much of their
stake into the market, raising Pounds 138m.
The heavily oversubscribed placing by SG Warburg on behalf of the syndicate
of 28 banks led to total turnover of 246m shares in the stock yesterday and
represented a third of the whole volume in London equities on a day dulled
by closure of Wall Street for the Labor Day holiday.
The shares converted for around 50p each and had been expected to realise
about 100p. By Friday, marketmakers were talking about a price some 10 to 15
per cent higher. In the event, demand at the top level of the auction-style
book building process was such that applications could only be 40 per cent
satisfied, and 120m shares were sold at the top of the range price - 115p.
Of the 70m shares remaining, half had been sold forward by the banks and the
other half had been moved into the banks' own fund management arms for
investment purposes. The underlying WPP share price ended 3 higher at 123p.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures had a very quiet day, with turnover of only 12,242 lots.
The low volume made for volatility, with the September contract yo-yoing
between low and high points, writes Clare Gascoigne.
The FT-SE 100 contract for September delivery got off to a shaky start, down
12 from Friday's close, and fell to test the 3,200 level early in the
morning. However, there was plenty of support to prevent it dropping too
far, and after touching the day's low of 3,205 it began to rally gently.
The morning's squeeze was tested after lunch as locals - independent traders
 -called September low and it received no direction from the US, where Wall
Street was closed for Labor Day. But it climbed steadily throughout the
afternoon, reaching a high of 3,256 before dropping back to close at 3,247 -
only 3 points above its estimated fair value, the premium which allows for
dividends and the cost of carrying.
Bullish traders who suggested the contract would move higher in the next few
days, testing the 3,280 level, received some comfort from after-hours'
trading, when it rose to 3,254.
Activity was equally slight in traded options, with volume of only 16,740
lots. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE turnover totalled 1,405 contracts. Hanson was the
most active stock option, with 1,222 lots traded, followed by Zeneca with
1,020.

FT  06 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Economic data help share prices move
ahead - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Favourable data on UK money supply and consumer credit, both indicating
reduced pressures for a rise in base rates, enabled the London stock market
to move ahead yesterday. Share prices opened lower against a background of
weakness in bond markets and nervousness ahead of this week's meeting
between the UK chancellor of the exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of
England.
However, an early decline of 16 points on the FT-SE 100-share Index was
recovered following the news that MO money supply had risen by an annualised
rate of only 6.2 per cent in August, below market predictions.
By the close the FT-SE 100 was a net 18.8 up at 3,241.5, with the UK market
brushing off weakness in the US dollar and in other European bourses. But in
the absence of a lead from Wall Street, closed for Labor Day, trading volume
in London was unconvincing and the market was dominated by the placing of
stock in WPP, the advertising group, and by activity in a handful of small
company shares.
London's performance, which reflected an easing of worries that the meeting
of the UK chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England might focus on
arguments for a pre-emptive increase in base rates, ran counter to the
general mood in other markets. Nervousness over the outlook for European
interest rates increased following wider publication of the bearish views on
German rates expressed by a leading US investment bank.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which incorporates a wide range of second line
issues, gained 7.4 at 3,788.7. But traders admitted that yesterday's market
was not fully tested and that London could yet follow the trend seen
elsewhere in Europe.
Seaq volume of 765.5m shares was higher than Friday's total but was swollen
by the placing of 120m shares in WPP, double counted as they were passed
through the market. Non-Footsie business, which included the WPP placing,
made up 75 per cent of the day's total, well above the normal average. On
Friday, 715.8m shares through the Seaq electronic network were worth Pounds
1.49bn in terms of genuine retail business in equities, comfortably towards
the higher end of this year's daily averages.
At least two trading programmes were reported yesterday, and the market was
often led from the stock index futures sector. A fairly strong list of
company profits due this week opened yesterday with trading news from Burmah
Castrol, which disappointed some market specialists, and Coats Viyella,
which responded more favourably to good half-time figures.
There was demand for UK bank shares yesterday and oil stocks looked firm in
spite of a more sluggish trend in crude prices.
Retail and consumer shares joined in the general improvement, although the
July consumer lending total fell well short of market expectations. Analysts
said that the unexpectedly low lending figure of Pounds 296m reduced the
dangers of early action on base rates - a factor favourable to retail
stocks.
Later this week the market will take in profits reports from a number of
leading blue chip companies, including Glaxo, RTZ, Sun Alliance and British
Gas.
While good figures are widely expected from Glaxo, the market is likely to
show more interest in any comments on the progress of Zantac, Glaxo's
anti-ulcer drug, which still provides nearly half of group profits but now
faces the prospect of competition from generic rivals.
There will also be news this week from the building and construction
sectors, which are areas seen as sensitive to the pace of economic recovery.
While some market analysts have recently recommended UK housebuilding stocks
as due for recovery, the news from the industry remains somewhat mixed.

FT  06 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: N Ireland peace hopes boost Dublin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT-Actuaries World Index came out virtually unchanged last week but,
across the world, there were some big individual market movements.
Europe's best performer was Ireland, one of the smallest stock markets in
Europe, and up by 4.5 per cent in local currency terms after a 3.5 per cent
gain the week before. In its current EuroLetter, Morgan Stanley acknowledges
that the announcement of an IRA ceasefire and the hopes for peace in
Northern Ireland could only be good for the whole island.
However, Mr Richard Davidson, the bank's European strategist, bases his
argument for Ireland's equity market mainly on the transformation of Irish
economic performance in recent years. 'We believe that the combination of an
attractive valuation and a remarkable economic story, plus respectable
profit growth, more than outweighs the historic investor worries about low
liquidity and a restricted sector choice,' he maintains.
Another smaller market, Finland, was Europe's next best performer, its 4.1
per cent gain taking it to a rise of 26.8 per cent for this year so far,
against a 3.7 per cent fall for Europe, excluding the UK.
Goldman Sachs believes that the Helsinki market remains attractive, and its
analysts Mr Anders Bratenius and Mr Klas Andersson forecast a further 20 per
cent gain over the next 12 months; they expect continuously strong earnings
with a stronger Finnish Marka being the only material risk for earnings
disappointments.
They say the macro picture is improving in Finland. Positive factors include
strong growth ahead as the effect of booming exports spreads into domestic
activities, subdued inflation and scope for declining long-term interest
rates. On the distaff side, they note a very high unemployment rate, and
weak public finances.
Europe's biggest fall of the week, 2.4 per cent, was in Spain. Ms Clare
Miles at Kleinwort Benson notes that the Madrid market was making good
progress in July and at the beginning of August, but that the Swedish and
Italian official interest rate rises on July 10 left the outlook for further
interest rate cuts in Spain looking precarious.
Ms Miles advises a reduction in interest rate-sensitive stocks in Spain, and
a switch into cyclicals.
Mr Marcus Grubb, the Salomon Brothers strategist, says the broker's Spanish
equity research team has reduced its year-end target for the Madrid General
index from 365 to 325, a rise of only 5.8 per cent from last Friday's level,
and that Salomon has reduced its weighting in Spanish equities in favour of
German and Swiss shares.
In the Pacific Basin, Hong Kong topped the ratings with a rise of 5.8 per
cent on the week. Nomura's global strategy team of Mr Nicholas Knight and Ms
Alison Southey have moved 4 per cent of their equity allocation out of Tokyo
and into Hong Kong.
They take the view that, in the US, long rates have not yet peaked and the
dollar still has further to go on the downside. 'The Dow, moreover, should
be pressured by concerns with regard to earnings and higher bond yields,'
they say.
In Europe, they reckon that the global interest rate environment will
continue to put pressure on equities; and in Japan, that the stock market is
vulnerable to a renewed burst of dollar weakness, and strength in the yen.
'Only South East Asia wins as far as we can see,' they declare, 'as concerns
with regard to the upward march in US short-term rates ameliorate. The
biggest winner from this is Hong Kong.'

FT  06 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses savaged by interest
rate bears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While US markets were closed for the Labor Day holiday yesterday, European
bourses were hit by last Friday afternoon's falls in treasuries in New York,
as well as by ongoing weakness in the dollar, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw its main falls in the interest rate-sensitive financials as
the Dax index fell 30.19 to 2,174.52 on the session, touching 2,163.30 in
the post-bourse before recovering to close at an Ibis-indicated 2,173.60.
Turnover fell from DM6.1bn to DM4.7bn. Among the financials, Allianz lost
DM48 at DM2,440, Deutsche Bank DM12 at DM719.50 and Bayernverein DM12.50 at
DM448.
A Goldman Sachs study said that German government bond yields were set to
rise because of accelerating economic growth, a likely rise in official
rates in the first quarter of 1995 and heavy new supply. Yesterday, the
Bundesbank's average bond yield rose by 9 basis points to 7.19 per cent.
However, at the same time, fund managers in Germany were detecting a light
shift towards debt from shares, saying that the benign inflation outlook
should overcompensate for the likely end in the short term to Bundesbank
rate cuts, while shares - which rose by nearly 11 per cent in July and
August - appeared unprepared for the next stage in the economic cycle.
In this context, it seemed odd that the day's main blue chip winner was
Viag, utility based and rate-sensitive. However, there was talk of a big
buying order in the stock for US, or at least foreign consumption.
PARIS saw the CAC 40 index breach 2,000, and hit 1,978.54 before it closed
22.17 lower at 1,998.20. One or two banks were savaged, Suez losing FFr5 at
FFr263 and BNP FFr5.90 at FFr253.70, but there was just as much pain in
industrials: Bouygues lost FFr15 at FFr632, Peugeot FFr18 at FFr846 and Air
Liquide FFr15 at FFr748.
The retailer Casino found itself aptly named after trading was resumed
following an early suspension. The company said that it planned to change
its legal status from partnership to public limited company, and this, at a
time of transnational bid talk in the supermarket business, saw the shares
hit FFr175 before closing FFr6.40 up at FFr170.
MADRID's general index fell through 300, bottoming at 297.50 before it ended
4.45, or 1.5 per cent, lower at 299.50.
Selective interest rate-sensitives lost ground, Argentaria Pta160 at
Pta5,100 in banks and Endesa Pta150 at Pta5,430 in utilities, but here, too,
industrials kept pace, with Repsol Pta95 off at Pta4,030 and Telefonica down
Pta30 at Pta1,755.
In construction, Agroman fell Pta88, or 15 per cent, to a 1994 low of Pta500
after a similar loss on Friday; heavier first-half losses last week were
followed yesterday by a mooted capital reduction scheme.
ZURICH saw further foreign demand early in the day before activity slowed in
the absence of US demand during the afternoon, leaving shares slipping back
from their best levels. The SMI index finished 2.5 higher at 2,674.5 after a
peak of 2,690.5.
Roche certificates added another SFr85 at SFr6,355, while UBS bearers picked
up SFr4 to SFr1,203 amid foreign buying after last week's optimistic
earnings outlooks.
However, Nestle gave up SFr4 to SFr1,233 and BBC bearers eased SFr7 to
SFr1,197.
Sulzer put on SFr4 at SFr940 on news that its Sulzer Hydro division had won
a SFr54m contract to provide Francis turbines to India.
MILAN remained under pressure, the Comit index falling 11.79, or 1.7 per
cent, to 673.23, with blue chips leading the decline. Turnover picked up
from recent levels, but it was still low.
Among the biggest losers, Telecom Italia fell L150. or 3 per cent, to L4,440
and Generali was L1,000, or 2.4 per cent, lower at L40,700. BCI gave up
L125, or 3.4 per cent, to L3,550, with the bank's rights plummeting 14.8 per
cent to L484.7.
Olivetti, heavily sold last week, fell another L50, or 2.3 per cent, to
L2,090. Cir, its holding company, gave up L100, or 4.5 per cent, at L2,100.
AMSTERDAM was deflated by the US holiday, softer bonds and slight pressure
on the dollar. The AEX index closed 1.17 down at 417.97.
Heineken lost Fl 1.80 at Fl 241.00 ahead of results, and analysts noted that
BolsWessanen, another drinks group, turned in unexpectedly poor figures last
week.
STOCKHOLM dived with its debt market after opinion polls pointed to the
weakness of the opposition SDP party, and the risks implicit in minority
government after the general election in 12 days' time.
The Affarsvarlden General index fell 28.60, or 1.95 per cent, to 1,439.60.
Astra A lost SKr6 at SKr180 on profit-taking, and the banking and insurance
index dropped by 3.5 per cent.
TEL AVIV celebrated today's Jewish New Year holiday with the seventh
consecutive rise in the Mishtanim index, which closed 5.75, or 3.1 per cent,
higher at 192.19.

FT  06 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei retreats as
Shanghai surges 13.7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Arbitrage unwinding and profit-taking by corporate investors depressed share
prices, while trading volume declined as many institutional investors
remained inactive ahead of the listing of Japan Telecom shares, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average ended 244.65, or 1.2 per cent, off at 20,409.18 after
a high of 20,645.23 and low of 20,395.98.
Traders said investors were worried about the expensive public offering
price of JT at Y4.7m, while some analysts feared that investors might sell
other shareholdings to buy JT stock. Selling to realise profits ahead of the
interim book closing by most corporations had already finished. However,
many banks, which need to offset write-offs for bad loans, were expected to
continue to do so until the end of the month.
Volume fell to 272m shares from 355m. Some investors chose not to trade,
citing the Labor Day holiday in New York. The Topix index of all first
section stocks declined 22.68 to 1,618.46 and the Nikkei 300 shed 4.30 to
295.07. Losers led gainers by 824 to 205, with 147 issues unchanged. In
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.84 to 1,317.82.
Bearishness over JT prompted declines in the telecommunication sector.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the leading telecom operator, dropped
Y24,000, or 2.6 per cent, to Y906,000, while DDI, a second section company,
receded Y27,000 to Y971,000.
Earnings-linked trading was also evident. Think tanks affiliated with the
leading brokers release corporate earnings outlooks later this week, and
investors are expected to boost trading in individual companies with
earnings revisions.
Fears of lower earnings at Capcom, a video game maker, hurt the whole
sector. The stock weakened Y500 to Y2,750, while Sega Enterprises retreated
Y480 to Y6,420 on selling by overseas investors.
Machine tool producers, on the other hand, were higher on hopes of increased
capital spending. Okuma climbed Y42 to Y958 and Ikegai Y9 to Y428.
Steelmakers were actively traded but lost ground on profit-taking. Nippon
Steel, the day's most active issue, slipped Y8 to Y377 and Sumitomo Metal
Industries Y5 to Y340.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 181.06 to 22,718.31 in volume of 85.3m
shares.
Roundup
Fortunes were mixed in the Pacific Rim.
SHANGHAI's A share index surged 13.7 per cent in extremely active trading as
institutions, major individual shareholders and small investors launched a
buying spree, their confidence boosted by news that Beijing was pressing

<TEXT>
Sao Paulo plunged 8.6 per cent in heavy midday trading as investors sold on
concern that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso's presidential candidacy would be
damaged by the resignation of Mr Rubens Ricupero as economy minister, writes
Michael Morgan.
The Bovespa index fell 4,630 to 49,045 at 1300 local time in turnover of
RDollars 216.5m (Dollars 243.5m), but foreign selling was said to be limited
by the Labor Day holiday in the US.
In earlier London trading, Brazilian stocks traded as ADRs were marked as
much as 10 per cent lower from the prices at which they had closed on Friday
on Wall Street.
Mr Robert Barclay of Baring Securities commented that uncertainty about any
action by the electoral authority, over whether to permit Mr Cardoso's
candidature to continue, would overhang the market until a decision was
announced. He expected the market to fall by as much as 20 per cent over the
next two weeks, especially as it was already looking for an excuse to take
profits.
Mr Barclay added that he still expected the PSDB party to recover from the
crisis and for Mr Cardoso to be elected as president, which would prompt a
sharp market rebound in share prices before the end of the year.
Equities had shot up to last week's level on confidence that Mr Cardoso
would win the October 3 presidential vote. The Bovespa index had risen 24.5
per cent in August.

FT  06 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Firm golds help S Africa to extend
recent gains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg was broadly firmer as investors overcame fears of profit-taking
and stocks extended recent gains in mostly steady trade. The US Labor Day
holiday did little to dampen enthusiasm, while a static bullion price proved
no inhibition to demand for gold shares.
A decision by motor assembly workers, on strike for the last five weeks, to
return to work from tomorrow gave late support to industrials, which had
lagged behind the market for most of the day.
The gold shares index climbed 51 to 2,453 after a 71-point advance on
Friday. The overall index was 41 ahead at 5,956 and industrials added 22 at
6,608, having rebounded from an early low of 6,572.
De Beers was R2 higher at R107, Anglos put on R2 at R260 and Gencor firmed
50 cents to R14.75. Against the trend, SAB lost 50 cents at R86.75 and
Barlows shed 25 cents to R33.75.
Iscor was 16 cents stronger at R4.48 in a continued bullish reaction to
year-end results.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Swedish krona stumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears of a weak minority government following elections on September 18
yesterday undermined the Swedish krona, writes Philip Gawith.
Opinion polls showed that the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) might fail
to win an outright majority, lessening the prospects of a 'yes' vote in the
November referendum to join the European Union.
A poll in Finland, which votes in October on EU membership, also showed a
move towards an anti-EU vote. Both currencies weakened as a result. Traders
said there was evidence of small-scale intervention from the Finnish central
bank to support the currency.
The Swedish krona finished in London at SKr4.94, from SKr4.905 on Friday,
against the D-Mark.
Market activity was generally very subdued with US markets closed for the
Labor Day holiday. The dollar showed no sign of recovering from Friday's
three-pfennig fall, trading in a very narrow range to end at DM1.5537 from
DM1.5602. Against the yen it finished at Y99.25 from Y99.395.
The counterpart of a weaker dollar was generalised D-Mark strength. It
closed at L1,011 against the Italian lira from L1,009.
Sterling also had an uneventful day, with the trade weighted index ending at
78.9 from 78.8.
Swedish markets were disturbed by two opinion polls which showed the Green
and the Left parties making progress at the SPD's expense ahead of the
election.
Financial markets are concerned at whether a new government will be able to
cut the mushrooming debt/GDP ratio, estimated by Citibank to be 93 per cent
of GDP. The krona recently stabilised when the SDP released details of a
proposed SKr61bn austerity package, but its ability to implement these
measures would be hampered if it lacked an outright majority.
Traders are predicting that currency volatility is likely to continue until
the election and the EU referendum, on November 16, are out of the way.
Markets will be keeping an eye on the meeting today of the EU monetary
committee, and a meeting later in the week of EU finance ministers, where
the problem of countries with high deficits will be discussed.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, commented:
'The meetings have refocused the market towards those currencies that are
weakened on the public finance front.' The tendency, he said, has been
towards selling the currencies of countries which combined high fiscal
deficits with forthcoming elections (Sweden) or political instability
(Italy).
The outlook for sterling is, for different reasons, also affected by EU
issues. With controversy having sprung up again about the possibility of a
multi-speed Europe, traders are focusing on a keynote speech that UK Prime
Minister John Major will be giving later this week in the Netherlands.
Mr Hawkins said the market wanted to hear Mr Major affirm that the UK
belonged at the core of Europe. He added that sterling would come under
pressure if the prime minister were seen accepting second division status
for the currency.
Also important for sterling will be the monthly monetary meeting tomorrow
between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, Governor of
the Bank of England.
Mr Mark Austin, treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets, said
expectations of a change in policy were low following good inflation data, a
fall in house prices and weak car sales recently. If rates were to rise,
this would be a surprise to the market, which would probably lend support to
the pound. If policy stayed on hold, added Mr Austin, sterling's fate would
be likely to remain in the hands of the dollar.
The general expectation is that today's quarterly tankan survey of business
conditions by the Bank of Japan will show that the Japanese economy is in
the early stages of recovery. What this will mean for the yen is less clear.
Some analysts argue that a recovering economy will suck in more imports and
curb the trade and current account surpluses, causing the yen to weaken.
Others warn that the trade surplus is unlikely to decrease before the end of
the year, partly because of stronger than expected exports and firm overseas
demand. Further, economists at New Japan Securities in London argue that the
combination of stimulatory fiscal policy and high real interest rates is the
classic recipe for keeping a currency overvalued. They predict the yen at
Y97.50 against the dollar at the end of the year.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 75m late
assistance. Earlier it had supplied Pounds 110m liquidity, at established
rates, after forecasting a Pounds 400m shortage.
In Germany, call money rates rose to 4.90/5 per cent from 4.85/4.95 per
cent. With the repo rate fixed at 4.85 per cent for a further two weeks,
after six weeks at this level already, traders said they were scaling back
their expectations of when a rate cut could be expected.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bumper US crop but farm incomes
to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ideal harvesting weather across most of the mid-west is allowing US grain
farmers to reap near-record maize and soyabean harvests.
The bountiful crop will recharge silos and grain bins drawn low after last
summer's drought and flood-ravaged season, but will do little to improve
farm profits. Producers have watched market prices for feed grains sag
steadily through the summer as crop prospects brightened.
Now, with only scattered chances for damage from frost or disease remaining,
analysts say official estimates of a 9.21bn-bushel maize harvest and a
2.28bn-bushel soyabean crop are almost certainly on target.
The output gains come not only because there were more acres planted this
year - for the first time in recent history the US Department of Agriculture
did not require farmers to set aside unplanted ground - but because yields
per acre are up in many states.
Although domestic food processors and livestock feeders will consume more
grain than ever this year, export markets for maize and soyabeans are on
decline.
A dip in farm income this year could slow the current mini-boom in
agricultural machinery sales next year and limit the recovery in farm real
estate prices. The big crop will also require Washington farm-policy makers
to reconsider acreage set-aside rules.
Analysts say the big crop will also keep pressure on USDA officials to beef
up export subsidy programs to move grain overseas. USDA economists, who are
revising their farm-income data for this year and last, are expected to
report this week that farmers' net cash income in 1994 will be substantially
lower than last year.
The USDA recently estimated that net cash income to farmers was a record
USDollars 62.5bn in 1993, when higher prices and government payments more
than offset income lost due to crop disasters. However, that figure will be
revised downward to Dollars 58.4bn, according to Mr. Bob McElroy, senior
financial analyst with the USDA.
He says 1994 farmers net cash income will be below that record, in the range
of Dollars 53bn to Dollars 57bn. The dip in net cash income this year is the
result of several factors.
Expenses, including interest rates, are higher this year, and government
payments to farmers are expected to drop to about Dollars 8bn, far below
last year's Dollars 13.4bn. Throughout much of the mid-west, livestock
prices are an important factor in farm profits.
'In our seven-state area, livestock accounts for about 60 per cent of farm
income,' says Mr Mark Drabenstott, senior economist with the Federal Reserve
Bank of Kansas City.
'We think farm incomes will be down this year largely because of sour cattle
prices in the spring in early summer.'
Cattle feeders had a bad first half in part because high feed grains prices
prompted many livestock producers to slaughter herds, creating a glut of red
meat.
Now, with the feed situation reversed, livestock producers are contemplating
herd expansion, a factor that may keep a stream of inexpensive beef flowing
to supermarkets over the next two years.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: No early restart at Panguna
planned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CRA, the Australian mining company in which Britain's RTZ holds a 49 per
cent stake, yesterday said it would need to see permanent stability on the
strife-torn Pacific island of Bougainville before it would consider
reopening the controversial Panguna copper mine there.
'Until we've got political stability on the island . . . and also a decision
by the locals to support the reopening of the mine we won't be going back,'
the company said.
However, CRA's caution did not prevent a surge in the shares of Bougainville
Copper which, though controlled by CRA with a 53.6 per cent stake, is also
quoted separately on the Australian stock exchange. When trading opened,
they hit ADollars 1.25, before dropping back for a gain of 12 cents at
ADollars 1.18.
Speculation about the re-opening of the mine follows a ceasefire agreement
reached over the weekend between the Papua New Guinea government, which
controls Bougainville, and the Bougainville Revolutionary Army, which
represents the demands of locals who want to secede from PNG. The PNG
government and the BRA have been fighting a six-year guerrilla war on the
island, and hundreds of people are estimated to have been killed.
The mine, operated by CRA, was a catalyst for the outbreak of the
hostilities back in the late 1980s. At one stage, Panguna provided about 30
per cent of PNG's export revenues and accounted for 10 per cent of the
nation's gross domestic product. However, locals claimed that they had been
inadequately compensated for allowing the mine to be built, and that income
was flowing out of Bougainville, into the coffers of CRA and the PNG
government. The mine was mothballed in 1989.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: China reveals its gold
production at 90m tonnes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday puzzled western analysts by revealing its annual gold
production. It was the first time since 1949 this statistic had been given
by China which previously insisted that gold output was a state secret.
Mr Song Ruixiang, Minister of Geology and Mineral Resources, told Reuter
that last year China produced 90 tonnes of gold.
This was well below the 127 tonnes estimated by the Gold Field Minerals
Services research group in its annual review of the market, regarded as one
of the most authoritative available. Mr Kevin Crisp at GFMS said his
organisation's estimate included unofficial gold production while the
minister obviously was referring only to official output.
Gold producers were required to sell all their gold to the People's Bank of
China, the central bank. As the bank did not vary its price in line with
western bullion markets, there was a big incentive for miners to dispose of
their gold elsewhere when prices rose. 'I think a production figure between
120 and 130 tonnes is more realistic,' said Mr Crisp.
This still left the question of why China had suddenly broken with
tradition. Usually it simply reveals a percentage change. Official
newspapers previously reported that China's 1993 production rose by 7.5 per
cent from the 1992 level.
One analyst suggested that it possibly was significant the revelation came
from the Ministry of Geology and not the State Gold Bureau. 'The Ministry is
keen to attract foreigners into China's gold business and knows that foreign
companies want an indication of the official figure,' the analyst said.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers digs deeper into its
resources - The new lease of life for the Jwaneng and Finsch diamond mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Jwaneng mine, on the fringes of the Kalahari desert in Botswana, is
known as 'a gem in the world of gems' because it almost certainly is the
richest diamond mine in the world - at least in terms of the value of the
stones it yields. Jwaneng's position is being reinforced by a USDollars 160m
expansion programme at present being completed three months ahead of
schedule and under budget.
Meanwhile, 160km west of Kimberley in the northern Cape Province of South
Africa, another diamond mine, the Finsch, where operations started in 1964,
has been given a new lease of life.
Having dug an open pit 423 metres deep, miners have now gone underground. Mr
Simon Webb, the general manager, says that the underground development has
given it another 35 to 40 years of life.
All this goes to show that De Beers, the South African group that dominates
world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, still has complete faith in its
ability to maintain stability in the diamond market despite short-term
difficulties such as those the company is experiencing with Russia. It also
remains intent on maintaining its diamond output even though its
100-year-old mines at Kimberley are now running down.
The South African group believes that its control of at least 50 per cent of
world diamond production gives it a powerful base from which to negotiate
with the other producers who have marketing contracts with De Beers' Central
Selling Organisation,
In Botswana De Beers controls half of Debswana, the company that owns the
Jwaneng mine, with the government owning the rest. The value of Jwaneng to
Botswana cannot be overstated.
It, and the country's two other (smaller) diamond mines, between them
account for 50 per cent of the government's revenue and 40 per cent of the
country's gross domestic product. No wonder Jwaneng's company slogan is Re
phtas imisa Botswana, which translates as 'We make Botswana sparkle'.
Production started at Jwaneng in 1982. Now a so-called fourth stream is
being completed which is adding one-third to processing capacity. In turn,
this means a 21 per cent rise in the number of carats produced. Last year
the mine treated 5.8m tonnes of ore which yielded 8.546m carats of diamonds,
well below the 1992 output when the 5.77m tonnes treated gave up more than
9m carats.
Jwaneng's open pit has reached a depth of 190 metres. Already it is 2kms
long and 1km wide. Mr Loz Shaw, chief geologist, says drilling down to 600
metres shows there are still plenty of diamonds at that depth and so the pit
will go down at least that far.
Mr Derrick Moore, the general manager, says this indicates mining in the
open pit will last another 35 years - 'and then we might go underground'.
If experience at De Beers' wholly-owned Finsch mine in South Africa is
anything to go by, planning the underground development at Jwaneng might
already have started.
Planning for the underground mine at Finsch started in the 1970s and the
first work began in 1979. Yet the bottom of the Finsch open pit - 423 metres
 -was not reached until 1990.
Unfortunately, things did not go completely as expected when underground
mining started, to some extent because the development was designed by a
management whose expertise was mainly in open pit mining.
However, Mr Mark Button, mining superintendent, says: 'Finsch has come of
age as an underground mine after two years. Our costs compare with the best
in the group.'
Among the innovations that have helped Finsch achieve its objectives are
some remote-controlled LHD (load-haul-dump) trucks which are similar to
radio-controlled toy vehicles or boats. Using VHF radio signals, a driver
can stand back and send a truck on its own to dig out material from areas
between the old pit wall and the underground development that would not
otherwise be mined because of the dangers involved. When, as occasionally
happens, rock crashes on to the LHD trucks, it is relatively simply to haul
the vehicles out virtually undamaged.
Mr Webb says the objective is to mine down to a depth of 830 metres, at
which point there are not enough diamonds left in the ground to make
recovery viable.
Finsch - named after the discoverers, Messrs Fincham and Schwabel, who
stumbled across the kimberlite pipe containing the diamonds when actually
they were looking for asbestos - is one of the victims of the present
turmoil in the diamond market caused mainly by uncertainties about Russian
exports.
About 500 of its 1,900 employees were laid off in August 1992. It is mining
only five days a week at present and processing on four days. Last year
Finsch mined 2.68m tonnes and recovered 2m carats of diamonds compared with
4.7m tonnes mined and 3.446m carats in 1992.
Mr Webb suggests 1994 output will be similar to last year's. But when market
conditions improve, production can be brought back up to previous levels in
about six months.

India, which has the world's fifth largest bauxite reserves, will be
emerging as a significant supplier of alumina to the world, the
international aluminium majors believe.
Their faith in India can be seen in the recent conclusion of joint ventures
formed with the local companies for mining bauxite and producing alumina for
export.
Impressed with the vastness and quality of Indian bauxite reserve, Alcoa of
the US has chosen Larsen &amp; Toubro, India's largest engineering company, for
a project aimed at producing and exporting 1m tonnes of alumina a year.
Norsk Hydro of Norway will be working with Indian Aluminium, an associate of
Alcan of Canada, and Tata Industries, part of India's largest industrial
group, to build a 1m tonne export-oriented alumina plant.
Both projects are located in Orissa which accounts for nearly half the
country's bauxite reserve.
Gujarat Alkalies &amp; Chemicals is talking to Kaiser Aluminium for technology
for its proposed 500,000 tonne alumina project in the Kutch district of
Gujarat.
Kitply Industries, India's biggest producer of plywood, has signed a
memorandum of understanding with the Madhya Pradesh Industrial Development
Corporation to build a 1m tonne alumina project.
Mr Goenka, chairman, said that Kitply was talking to some aluminium majors
in the US and Europe about technology, equity participation and marketing
assistance.
At the same time the Andhra Pradesh Mineral Development Corporation, a state
undertaking, is looking for a private sector partner to mine bauxite at
Srikakulam-Vizianagaram belt and refine it into alumina. However, the lack
of infrastructure and a growing extremist movement in the region may make
the search for a partner difficult.
RPG Enterprises, India's fourth largest business house, also wants to build
an alumina plant.
Meanwhile, Nalco is raising the alumina refining capacity of its existing
plant to 1.35m tonnes from 900,000 tonnes. The company exports around
400,000 tonnes of alumina a year.
Explaining the reasons for the growing interest of aluminium majors in
alumina ventures in India, Mr Tapan Mitra, managing director of Indian
Aluminium, said: 'We are the least costly producer of alumina in the world.
The alumina production cost in our proposed export-oriented project is
estimated at Dollars 80 a tonne, which is much lower than the world average
cost.' While the 1m tonne Indian Aluminium project will cost Dollars 800m, a
similar project elsewhere in the world will need an investment of at least
Dollars 1bn, according to Mr RN Parbat, director.
He points out that the foreign companies were particularly impressed that a
major portion of proven Indian reserves of about 3bn tonnes of bauxite is of
the Gibbsitic variety which allows refining at a low temperature and low
pressure. It is found along India's Eastern Ghats running through Orissa,
Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.

LEAD prices rose to a fresh two-year peak of USDollars 622 a tonne on the
London Metal Exchange following speculative buying and short covering ahead
of stock figures today expected by some traders to show another fall. This
should spark more gains towards Dollars 650. ALUMINIUM vacillated, driven
down by the end of the three-week strike at Australia's Tomago smelter,
which cost output of about 80,000 tonnes, but given support by news that the
Volta River Authority in Ghana had told Kaiser to halt output at its
200,000-tonnes-a-year Valco smelter. OIL prices slipped back as more
evidence emerged that the strike in the Nigerian industry, which began on
July 4, was coming to an end.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU moves against Asian garlic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The image of the French peasant with a string of garlic around his neck
could be threatened by a huge surge in imports of the pungent bulb from
China, Vietnam and Taiwan to the European Union. French farmers have
complained that the livelihood of many small producers and family growers is
at stake.
The European Commission has revoked garlic import licences from Taiwan and
Vietnam until May next year. Licence requests from Vietnam increased by 680
per cent between the beginning of June and August 19 compared with the same
period last year.
Over the same period, Taiwanese producers raised their demands for licences
by 4,611 per cent.
The French farmers' union has called on the Commission to impose a total ban
on imports until the middle of next year. The French are backed by Spanish
growers which between them represent the bulk of garlic produced in the EU.
European producers believe that Taiwan and Vietnam are being used as
conduits for Chinese garlic following the placing of restrictions on Chinese
imports in June.
Last year China sent 40,000 tonnes of garlic to the EU - almost 20 per cent
of the entire market. This year shipments have been restricted to 10,000
tonnes. Growers complain that the Chinese garlic is of a low quality and has
undercut EU prices.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: UK gilts drift upwards in quiet trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK gilts drifted upwards yesterday in quiet futures-led trading, ahead of
tomorrow's monthly meeting on monetary policy between the Treasury and the
Bank of England.
Economic data showing a slowdown in M0 money supply growth for August and
modest consumer credit figures for July had little impact, analysts said.
'The weaker-than-expected M0 figures are a hint that the pace of economic
expansion may be easing,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg.
He said they were unlikely to lead to a rise in base rates from the current
level of 5.25 per cent after Wednesday's meeting.
'The market view is that nothing will happen (on Wednesday), but there will
be some degree of market nervousness,' said Mr John Shepperd, chief
economist at Yamaichi.
There was little change in the yield spread between gilts and German bunds,
which remained at about 140 basis points. On Liffe, the December long gilt
future fell in early trading to 100 1/4 from the previous close of 100 29/32
, before recovering to 101 1/32 in late trading, up 1/8 on the day.
Bunds started the week in dismal fashion as worries about an early
overheating of the German economy prompted an early sell-off. The market is
worried that the west gross domestic product data for the second quarter,
due on Thursday, could show quarter-on-quarter expansion in excess of 1 per
cent, which would bring the yearly growth rate to close to 2 per cent.
Ms Wendy Niffikeer, senior economist at IBJ International, said that such an
acceleration in economic growth would lead to inflationary pressures and
would also cause the output gap - the difference between actual and
potential growth - to close far earlier in the cycle than expected.
These worries, coupled with concerns about the Bundesbank's large funding
programme, are likely to keep a lid on bund prices. On Liffe, the December
bund future stood 0.45 points lower at 89.67 in the late afternoon in volume
of 75,473 lots, off the day's worst level of 89.38.
French government bonds were also weaker amid worries that recent base rate
rises by French commercial banks would put pressure on the Bank of France to
do likewise. On the Matif, the September notional bond future was down 0.14
points at the day's low of 112.62 late in the afternoon. Elsewhere, the
yield on 10-year Spanish government bonds rose 16 basis points to 11.17 per
cent. Mr Simon Meggs of UBS said the movement was driven by worries about
the continuing negotiations over the government's budget, and performances
were similar along the yield curve.
'It was a rocky ride today and the market may get jittery if there is no
firm news this week,' he said. He added that investors were also concerned
at the possibility of Spain being left out of the core of a multi-speed
Europe.
Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Italian government bond rose 3 basis
points to close at 12.06 per cent, moving in line with markets elsewhere.

FT  06 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Abbey National launches L250bn
three-year deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The eurobond market saw few new issues yesterday with the US, Canada and
Luxembourg closed for holidays. However, issuance is expected to pick up
over the next few days with both Pearson and the City of Yokohama expected
to launch offerings.
Pearson, the media and entertainment group which owns the Financial Times,
is expected to come to the euro-sterling market with a 10-year offering,
which syndicate managers expect to amount to about Pounds 100m.
The City of Yokohama is also rumoured to be considering a 10-year fixed-rate
eurodollar offering of around Dollars 300m, lead-managed by Bank of Tokyo
Capital Markets.
Abbey National Treasury Services launched a L250bn offering of three-year
bonds with a coupon of 11.5 per cent, lead-managed by Swiss Bank
Corporation.
Syndicate managers said that the bonds were fairly priced, although they
said that they were surprised by the relatively large size of the issue,
especially with the Luxembourg market closed. Many recent eurolira issues
have been placed with Luxembourg investors.
'There is much debate about whether the lira market is saturated, especially
in the three-year area, but we are seeing no evidence of that,' said one
syndicate manager.
Compagnie Ge'ne'rale des Eaux tapped the D-Mark sector with a DM300m
offering of five-year bonds priced to yield 45 basis points over the
five-year 6 1/4 per cent German government bond.
Around one-quarter of the bonds were placed with French institutions and a
large part of the remainder will be targeted at retail investors in
Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg, according to the lead manager Credit
Commercial de France.
The D-Mark market currently offers favourable swap opportunities,
particularly in the four- to five-year area, syndicate managers said. The
proceeds from the offering were believed to have been swapped back into
French francs.
The market also digested the announcement on Friday by the World Bank that
it plans to launch a global fixed-rate dollar bond issue later this month,
expected to be about Dollars 1.5bn.
The timing of the launch and the maturity of the issue would be determined
in light of market circumstances in the coming weeks, the World Bank said.
The market expects the offering to have a life of five or 10 years. The deal
will be lead-managed by Lehman Brothers and UBS.
'There is a continuing demand for high quality dollar paper, which this
certainly is, and we expect this deal to go well,' said one syndicate
manager.
Previous recent global offerings have struggled to find buyers outside the
US. 'It will be interesting to see how much is placed outside the US,
whether there is now a broader interest, particular from Asian investors, in
the dollar bonds,' said one syndicate manager.
Telekom Malaysia is rumoured to be assessing demand for a Dollars 300m to
Dollars 500m 10-year convertible eurobond offering.
The issue will be the first by a Malaysian company which is rated by
Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service.

<TEXT>
The Czech and Slovak Investment Corporation, a London-based investment fund
managed by merchant bankers Robert Fleming, is to raise Dollars 25m in a
share and warrant offer to new and existing shareholders to finance further
investment in the two countries.
The offer, consisting of up to 340,000 units each including seven new shares
and one new warrant, at a price of Dollars 73.50 a unit, is underwritten by
Fleming and co-managed with SG Warburg.
The offer closes on September 21. Current shareholders include the IBM
Pension Fund, Robert Fleming, and Confederation Life of Canada.
The fund, set up early last year, has invested Dollars 30m in the two
countries. More than 90 per cent of the investments are in the Czech
Republic.
Mr Leonard Ingrams, the fund's chairman, said the proportion invested in
Slovakia may rise, depending on the outcome of the Slovak general election
at the end of this month. 'Things are happening there that we view
positively but it depends on the election,' he said.
The fund invests in a mixture of stock market-listed and unlisted shares and
in joint ventures between international and local companies.
Its portfolio, currently worth Dollars 35m, includes a stake in British
Petroleum's recent Dollars 23m investment in a petrol retailing network in
the Czech Republic.
The BP joint venture is with two investment funds and is aimed at extending
the UK group's network of petrol stations in the Czech Republic.

FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: MAN truck unit falls into the
red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, the German commercial vehicle maker, fell into loss in
its last financial year to the end of June but will return to profit in the
current year, according to Mr Rudolf Rupprecht, group chief executive.
The company, a subsidiary of MAN, the German engineering group, suffered a
9.2 per cent fall in production to 32,657 trucks and buses in 1993-94 from
35,948 a year earlier and a record 41,590 in 1991-92.
Turnover fell by 4.6 per cent to DM6.9bn (Dollars 4.4bn) from DM7.2bn, and
the group next month is expected to disclose a loss of between DM50m and
DM100m.
The financial performance of MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, Germany's second largest
manufacturer of trucks after Mercedes-Benz, has been undermined by the steep
recession in the European truck market.
Pre-tax profits fell to DM60.5m in 1992-93 from DM506m in 1991-92 and net
profits to DM31.5m from DM255m.
Mr Rupprecht said demand for commercial vehicles had begun to pick up in
recent months, led by higher demand from MAN's European export markets.
The value of the group's order-book at the end of June had fallen marginally
to DM2.3bn from DM2.4bn a year earlier, but the volume of new orders had
been rising during the first six months of 1994.
In the year to end-June the value of new orders rose by 8.3 per cent to
DM6.8bn from DM6.3bn in 1992-93. New orders from foreign markets jumped by
22.6 per cent to DM3.2bn, while those from the domestic market declined by
2.1 per cent to DM3.5bn.
MAN has been forced to restructure during the recession and is cutting 4,500
jobs or around 16 per cent of its workforce. The number of employees fell to
25,463 at the end of June from 28,917 in mid-1992 and another 1,000 jobs are
to be cut during the current financial year, said Mr Rupprecht.
Truck sales in Germany are expected to decline further in 1994 by between 5
and 10 per cent, said Mr Rupprecht, but will begin to recover next year.
Sales have begun to pick up in other west European markets, however, led by
the UK, Scandinavia, France, Spain and the Benelux countries.

Lower iron ore and uranium prices and increased expenditure meant that North
Broken Hill Peko, the Australian mining and resources group, reported a fall
in profits before tax and abnormals to ADollars 201.1m (USDollars 150m),
ADollars 11.1m less than in the previous year.
However, due to a ADollars 65.2m abnormal surplus from the sale of non-core
businesses and investments, profits after tax and abnormals were up ADollars
52.9m to ADollars 185.3m. Total sales were ADollars 1.13bn, compared with
ADollars 1.51bn.
Operating profits from the iron ore business fell to ADollars 129.1m from
ADollars 136.1m; uranium was down to ADollars 46.1m from ADollars 75m; and
the equipment business fell to ADollars 29.8m against ADollars 30.5m.
However, the gold interest contributed ADollars 21.8m, up from ADollars
4.8m, while the forestry products business, meanwhile, contributed ADollars
51m, against ADollars 50.3m.

Southcorp, the Australian packaging, wine and appliance manufacturer
formerly known as SA Brewing, yesterday announced a 2.4 per cent rise, to
ADollars 121.2m (USDollars 90.4m), in annual operating profits after tax but
before abnormals.
However, after abnormals, profits plunged 58.5 per cent to ADollars 49.8m.
The reason was a one-off charge of ADollars 68.7m, mainly related to
write-offs and restructuring costs at its troubled US water heater business.
Sales for the year were 1.6 per cent lower at ADollars 2.25bn.
Southcorp said that its packaging, wine and Australian appliance businesses
were 'very satisfactory'.
The wine business performed particularly well, in spite of competition in
the domestic market, with sales rising 11 per cent to ADollars 352m, and
pre-tax profits jumping 35 per cent to ADollars 62m.
However, the US water heater business incurred a USDollars 18.3m loss,
leading to a 20 per cent decline in pre-tax profits from the appliance
division.

FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Unease awaits Tokyo SE floats -
Privatisations are putting prices under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
History, said Karl Marx, tends to repeat itself twice - the first time as
tragedy, the second as farce. Investors in the Tokyo stock market, though
improbable candidates to heed those words, are increasingly nervous that
shares there may be about to prove the veracity of Marx's theory. The fear
is that the market may be about to repeat its precipitous fall of last year,
on the back of a substantial increase in equity supply.
Last autumn, the Nikkei index lost more than 20 per cent of its value in a
month, following the ill-starred debut on the stock exchange of the
privatised railway company JR East. An already nervous market was flooded
with Y1,000bn (Dollars 10bn) worth of shares from the floated company. The
extra supply was too much for a weak market and it collapsed under the
weight.
This year, if Marx is right, tragedy could lurk in the form of a pair of
companies with the identical acronym JT: Japan Telecom and Japan Tobacco.
The first of the JTs tests the market today, when shares in Japan Telecom
start changing hands. Traders yesterday were anxiously awaiting the listing
 -which represents a cash call of more than Y150bn and is thought by many to
be overpriced.
However, next month an even tougher test will be set by the arrival of Japan
Tobacco, the privatised tobacco and foods manufacturer. That flotation will
drop more than Y900bn on the market.
What worries investors is that between them, the two companies will inject
even more equity into the stock market than JR East last year, and that that
can have only dire consequences for share prices again this year.
'When you increase supply by that amount into a market where demand is still
very weak, you could be in for trouble,' says Mr Neil Rogers, equity
strategist at UBS Tokyo,
Analysis by Nikko Securities Research suggests that share prices are put
under extreme downward pressure when annual equity financing by Tokyo Stock
Exchange-listed companies is greater than 15 times the value of average
daily turnover.
Without the two JTs, the total value of new equity financing for the current
year would be about Y4,600bn, with an average daily turnover of about Y250bn
to Y300bn.
These figures already suggest a strain on prices. However, the extra
injection of funds from the two issues raises the total financing figure to
Y5,700bn - substantially more than 15 times trading levels. That may be too
much for the market to tolerate.
And there are additional concerns that the prices set for both Telecom and
Tobacco are too high. At Y4.7m and Y1.44m per share respectively, most
analysts agree the offer prices are well above fair values, and are nervous
about the trend among many institutional investors to bid well below those
prices in the auctions.
Some analysts, however, are eager to point out important differences between
this year's and last year's offerings. They say there are reasons to believe
the market may find the JTs more digestible.
For one thing, institutions are much more cautious about the issues this
year, and that may itself limit any damage should they not go well.
Last year, investors were convinced that the JR listing would bolster the
wider equity market. As a result, there was heavy futures buying shortly
before the listing.
The substantial premium on equity futures encouraged traders to short the
futures against the underlying stocks. When the JR stock disappointed, these
investors were forced to sell their positions at a loss. This itself added
about another Y1,000bn to equity supply.
This time, institutions are less optimistic about the issues, and have not
built up the arbitrage postions of last year. 'If you look at the big
investors' positions this year, you can see that they have been much more
cautious than they were before the JR listing,' says Ms Kathy Matsui,
strategist at Goldman Sachs in Tokyo.
Perhaps the main reason for believing that history may not repeat itself,
however, is that Japan's economic fundamentals are in better shape this
autumn than last.
The JR East difficulties came at a time of growing unease about the pace of
recovery, a sentiment that was exacerbated by the disappointing autumn
interim results season. This year, there is more optimism that recovery is
broadly-based and that it will be reflected in corporate earnings.
However, there remains a nagging suspicion among traders that a poor
performance by the two JTs could swing sentiment firmly against equities
again.
The level of individual interest in the Japan Tobacco issue in particular
has been high. A big disappointment when the shares begin trading could set
back the prospects of a wider return to the equity market by individuals for
a long time.
Without that investor confidence, the prospects for the Nikkei are highly
uncertain.

<TEXT>
Bangkok Expressway, the construction consortium led by Kumagai Gumi of Japan
and financed by Thai and foreign banks, is to be floated on the Thai stock
market.
The company, which is building an elevated motorway for Bangkok, plans to
raise about Bt3.4bn (Dollars 136m) by floating 129m new shares, or 25 per
cent of the company.
This suggests the initial public offer (IPO) price will be around Bt26 per
share. The company has projected return on equity of 16 per cent a year. The
IPO will put the shares on a prospective price/earnings ratio of around 35.
Total earnings at the company are forecast to rise from Bt816m in 1993 to
Bt2.75bn this year.
The operating cash flow is forecast to grow strongly after this year, when a
Bt15.7bn loan repayment is made. Net income is forecast to rise from Bt34m
in 1993 to Bt327m this year.
Solid increases in income should be supported when a second arm to the
motorway opens in the next few months.

FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Co-operation replaces
competition - Kieran Cooke reports on a surge in activity between Indonesia
and Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South-east Asia's big companies are increasingly co-operating in order to
exploit more fully the area's robust economies, and leading the charge are
Malaysian and Indonesian concerns.
'Over the last few months we have seen a sudden surge in business activity
between Malaysia and Indonesia,' said Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy
prime minister, on a recent investment mission to Indonesia. 'Companies in
our two countries are learning to co-operate rather than compete.'
Though Malaysia and Indonesia have strong cultural, racial and religious
links, there have often been sharp political differences between the two
countries. Corporate contacts have been few and trade limited.
The catalyst for the recent flurry of cross-border corporate dealings was a
meeting between President Suharto of Indonesia and Dr Mahathir Mohamad,
Malaysia's prime minister, at the end of last year. Since then, deals have
been announced on a regular basis.
Indonesia has agreed to import Proton cars manufactured by Malaysia's
Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional. In return, Malaysia will buy aircraft
manufactured by Indonesia's Industri Terbang Nusantara (IPTN). Proton says
it will export about 2,500 of its cars to Indonesia during the next year and
eventually plans to assemble cars there. Malaysia has not said how many
Indonesian-made aircraft it intends to buy.
The deal is controversial. Other car importers in Indonesia have been
angered by reports that PT Citra Lamtoro, the local company which has been
appointed as Proton distributor, will be exempt from 300 per cent Indonesian
duties imposed on most imported vehicles.
PT Citra is controlled by Mrs Hardijanti Rukmana, the eldest daughter of Mr
Suharto.
One of the year's more unusual corporate deals came in February when
Indonesian and Malaysian interests took control of Lamborghini, once the
pride of Italy's sports car manufacturers.
Mr Hutomo Mandala Putra, Mr Suharto's youngest son, has a 50 per cent stake
in Megatech, the Bermuda-registered company which owns Lamborghini. Other
shareholders are Mycom, a listed Malaysian gaming company, and the
Mal-aysian police investment fund.
In April, two of south-east Asia's wealthiest businessmen, Mr Robert Kuok
and Mr Liem Sioe Liong, announced they were teaming up to develop sugar
plantations and refining operations on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.
Mr Kuok, a Malaysian Chinese, controls a business empire with interests
ranging from beach resorts and housing schemes to ownership of a controlling
interest in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post group. Mr Liem, an
Indonesian Chinese, controls Indonesia's largest business group, with
interests ranging from noodle making to cement manufacturing.
In mid-July Barito Pacific Timber, one of Indonesia's largest companies and
the world's leading exporter of plywood, said it would purchase about 70 per
cent of a small, loss-making Malaysian building supplies company listed on
the Kuala Lumpur exchange.
Indonesian companies anxious to go public and raise funds for expansion are
envious of Kuala Lumpur's highly liquid stock market. The Jakarta exchange
is considerably smaller and less developed.
Under the terms of the deal, Barito will inject a significant part of its
funds into the Malaysian company and so achieve a 'back-door' listing on
what is south-east Asia's biggest exchange in terms of total capitalisation.
The deal has been backed by the Malaysian and Indonesian leaders, but it has
also been criticised. Such corporate manoeuvrings are coming under
increasing scrutiny from Malaysia's Securities Commission. In Indonesia
there is criticism that Barito, controlled by Mr Prajogo Pangestu, an
Indonesian Chinese businessman closely linked to the ruling family, is not
investing company funds inside the country.
Last month, Renong, one of Malaysia's biggest conglomerates, and the
Indonesia state-owned Bank Rakyat Indonesia agreed to set up a Dollars 100m
venture capital fund in Indonesia. Its aim is to help medium-sized
industries in that country and promote links with their Malaysian
counterparts. Again, the deal is supported by both governments.
Renong has close links to Malaysia's United Malays National Organisation,
the dominant political party in Malaysia, while Bank Rakyat is one of
Indonesia's largest banks, with assets of about Dollars 12bn.
'We encourage investment from the east and west in our countries,' says Dr
Mahathir, 'but we should also promote investments and co-operation between
neighbouring countries.'

downturn

<TEXT>
Peregrine Investments, the Hong Kong-based merchant bank, has reported a 5
per cent increase in first-half net profits, to HKDollars 398m (USDollars
51.5m) from HKDollars 380.9m.
The company's usually strong performance was held in check by the downturn
in Asian equities markets which followed the lifting of short-term US
interest rates, Mr Philip Tose, chairman, said.
For each of the three years to December 1992 the group more than doubled
profits; last year earnings rose 43 per cent to HKDollars 869.5m.
Falling stock markets and dwindling volumes led to a sharp reduction in
corporate finance and securities activity, particularly in the second
quarter.
In the first half, the company invested in a new division, Peregrine Fixed
Income, which was set up with a team poached from Lehman Brothers in Hong
Kong.
New offices were opened in the six months in Munich and Zurich, and plans
are under way for a Bahrain office to serve Middle East investors interested
in south-east Asia.
Earnings per share, taken on a fully diluted basis, inched up to HKDollars
0.65 from HKDollars 0.64 in the same period last year. The interim dividend
is to be held at 25 cents.
While turnover more than doubled, to HKDollars 6.4bn from HKDollars 3bn, the
operating profit was virtually flat at HKDollars 294.9m.
Mr Tose said the group would continue to diversify into business areas such
as fixed income, direct investment operations and global trading of
convertible bonds, depositary receipts and warrants.
He expected a more stable second half, although uncertainties over interest
rates and inflation would persist.

Mayne Nickless, the Australian transport and security services group, saw
profits after tax and abnormals rise by 21 per cent in the year to July 3.
The company made ADollars 69.5m (Dollars 52m), compared with ADollars 57.4m
previously.
The results, however, were muddied by a significantly increased abnormal
item, but a sharply-lower tax charge.
Abnormals took ADollars 70.8m before tax, compared with ADollars 51m last
time, largely as a result of a restructuring in the Australian transport
oper-ations and a mixture of closures and retrenchments in Europe. The total
tax charge fell to ADollars 41.6m from ADollars 56.3m.
At the operating level, Mayne made a pre-tax profit of ADollars 181.9m,
compared with ADollars 164.8m in the previous year. Revenues were up by 2.6
per cent at ADollars 2.84bn. Earnings per share before abnormals were up by
13 per cent at 41 cents. The final dividend is 17 cents a share (against 15
cents), after an interim of 16 cents (15 cents).
The company reported encouraging progress from its core Australian transport
services business, and earnings from the Health Care of Australia business
also nudged ahead.
In Europe, operating earnings overall were up by 23 per cent, in spite of
competitive price pressures faced by the UK express freight subsidiaries and
continued losses and the Spanish Transportes Helguera business.
Operating profits in the US rose by 9.4 per cent.

FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Baby Bells call on Hollywood -
Phone and entertainment groups are linking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Links between the telephone and entertainment industries in the US have
traditionally, been restricted to phone companies employing actors and
celebrities to appear in their television advertisements. But that
relationship is changing.
In the past year, the big regional telephone companies have been beating a
path to Hollywood's door, seeking to forge alliances with entertainment
groups and film and television makers, hiring programme production
executives and exploring joint ventures with other industry powers, such as
talent agencies.
Why the enthusiasm? The telephone companies have the technology to provide
two-way, or interactive, television programming to phone customers via
broadband communications lines. But they do not have the product - in the
shape of movies, video games, educational programming and television shows -
to send to customers over those lines.
As Mr Jack Grubman, telecommunications industry analyst at Salomon Brothers,
says of the phone companies: 'These guys don't know anything about
entertainment.'
But Hollywood does - which explains why the Baby Bells have been rushing to
Los Angeles to talk to companies such as Walt Disney, which probably
originates and distributes more entertainment products than any other in the
US.
Those talks have borne fruit. Last month, three Baby Bell regional telephone
companies - Ameritech, BellSouth and Southwestern Bell - announced a joint
venture with Disney to create interactive video programming carried on the
phone companies' home video networks.
Each of the three has begun to build the distribution services for
entertainment programming. Ameritech is spending Dollars 4.4bn to provide
video services to 6m of its customers in the Midwest by the end of the
decade. Next year, BellSouth will start testing interactive multimedia
services to 12,000 homes in Georgia, and Southwestern Bell plans to have a
video-on-demand system for customers in Texas by 1996. Disney will help
provide the phone companies with the films, cartoons, and television
programmes.
Not to be outdone, three other Baby Bells - Nynex, Bell Atlantic and Pacific
Telesis - not to be outdone, are reportedly close to signing a similar
agreement with Creative Artists Agency, Hollywood's top talent agency.
CAA has moved beyond representing actors, directors and writers, and is
heavily involved in programming for films and television. Any deal is likely
to involve the agency agreeing to help commission and produce programmes for
the phone companies.
The phone companies have been tapping the entertainment industry for
executives to run their programming operations.
For example, Mr Patrick Campbell of Ameritech, responsible for co-ordinating
the company's venture with Disney, was previously president of Columbia
TriStar Home Video, and Ms Heidi Diamond, Ameritech's head of consumer
marketing and sales for its video and interactive services, used to work at
the Nickelodeon television channel.
The movement of talent has not been just one-way. Earlier this year, CAA
hired Mr Robert Kavner, AT&amp;T's multimedia chief.
These manoeuvres are aimed at preparing for when the government passes
legislation to deregulate the phone and cable television industries.
That legislation, still wending its way through Congress, will allow phone
companies to provide television programmes, and cable companies to provide
phone services. When the time comes, the phone companies want to have the
programming in place to wire to their customers.
As Mr Peter Shapiro, senior consultant in cable and telecommunications at
Arthur D. Little in New York, explains: 'All the RBOCs (regional bell
operating companies) are looking to build a broadband network and develop
interactive television multimedia services. Their one area of real
vulnerability is in the supply of programming . . . What they want to get
their hands on is the supply of programming to prime the pump for their own
systems when that's allowed.'
Phone companies are eager to secure programming because those with a head
start when deregulation arrives stand to make a lot of money. The three Baby
Bells that have linked with Disney, for example, serve more than 50m
consumers across the US, while the three phone companies reported to be
negotiating with CAA serve 46m customers between them.
While the phone companies are linking with Hollywood through joint ventures
and other alliances, few expect to see them buy a programme-producer - such
as a studio - outright. That would be taking too much of a risk, says Mr
Shapiro.
'It would be close to insane for an RBOC to put down money and buy a movie
studio. But getting in early to see if they can develop new forms of
programming with companies that can do programming, that may not be so
crazy,' he says.
The Baby Bells are prevented from owning programmers by federal restrictions
on cross-ownership in the telecommunications and entertainment industries,
points out Mr Grubman.
In spite of the recent flurry of activity across the increasingly-blurred
borders between the telecommunications and entertainment industries, there
is still a long way to go.
The phone companies' expansionist dreams of providing customers with
everything from films, entertainment and educational televisions shows to
computer games and shopping services, will not be realised for several
years. And during that time the rules of the game could change.
'These are early days for these sort of ventures. A lot will happen in the
next couple of years as the nature of programming becomes better defined,
and the roles of the participants are better understood,' says Mr Shapiro.

<TEXT>
Casino, the French super-market group, yesterday announced a threefold
increase in interim net profits to FFr55.9m (Dollars 10m) for the first half
of this year from FFr17.6m in the same period of 1993 due to a general
improvement in trading activities.
Mr Antoine Guichard, chairman, said Casino was changing its status from a
partnership to a public limited company.
This reflects a long-term trend in French industry. Several large groups
have made similar changes by abolishing the old commandite actions system
under which small groups of shareholders in effect control the company.
Casino has been controlled by Eurosia, a legal vehicle belonging to the
Guichard family and institutional investors. Mr Guichard said such a
structure had played a critical role in the company's development since its
foundation in 1898 but the commandite actions concept had since become 'less
and less valid or justifiable'.
Casino reported a modest improvement in trading activity during the first
six months of the year.
Interim sales rose 1.6 per cent to FFr29.38bn from FFr28.92m with operating
profits up 26.7 per cent at FFr331.5m from FFr261.8m.
Casino attributed the increase in trading margins to the benefits of the
merger with Rallye supermarkets group and to general improvements in cost
control.

On June 23, the FT-Actuaries World Index Policy Committee announced that
Thailand and Brazil would be included in the World Indices from October 1
1994, subject to satisfactory resolution of several outstanding technical
issues. The committee has decided that Thailand and Brazil will be added
from November 1 1994, to the World Index and all relevant regional indices.
The addition of both new markets was postponed until November 1 in response
to comments from index users, some of whom have expressed concern about the
substantial lead-time required before first-time investors can participate
in the Brazilian market.
Simultaneous with the introduction of Brazil, FT-AWI Mexico will move on to
a same-day calculation basis from its current one-day lag, and a new
Americas regional index, consisting of the US, Canada, Mexico and Brazil
will be added to the daily table.
When new countries are added to the World Index, it is necessary to set
initial index levels. These will be US dollar index values derived from the
value for the World Index on October 31 1994.
There will be a slight modification from the usual practice for the Brazil
index level in local currency. Normally an index in local currency is
calculated as a function of the index level in US dollars, the current
exchange rate, and the exchange rate from December 31, 1986. In the case of
Brazil, years of hyperinflation would result in an impractically large
number for the local currency index.
To adjust for this, the exchange rate from December 31 1986 will be
multiplied by a factor which will scale the index to a level comparable to
that of the Brazil US dollar index.
Following comments from users of the World Indices, the committee has also
decided that to reflect as accurately as practicable conditions for
foreigners trading in Thailand, the following guidelines will be used to
price Thai shares, including the prices used to start the index.
1. Foreign board prices will be used where the aggregate of foreign holdings
are greater, equal to or less than three percentage points below the
permitted foreign limit (see 4 below).
2. Domestic board prices will be used in all other cases.
3. The World Index Policy Committee will, for the purposes of determining
the type of price to be used, review the latest aggregate levels of foreign
holdings and the individual foreign limits at its quarterly meetings. Any
changes in the type of price used for individual lines of Thai stocks will
be announced after each quarterly meeting and implemented at the start of
the next quarter. There will be no changes in types of prices used during a
quarter.
However, the practice of making pre-announced adjustments to companies'
investibility weightings during a quarter will continue to be applied to all
countries. Thai companies' investibility weightings will, where appropriate,
take into account any changes in the permitted foreign limits for individual
lines.
4. Every day before the Thai index is calculated, all constituent lines
priced from the foreign board will be reviewed. If the foreign board price
for any line is unchanged from the previous day but there has been a price
movement in the domestic board price, a calculated foreign board price will
be determined as follows:
Calculated foreign board price = today's domestic board price x (yesterday's
foreign board price used in the calculation of the Thai index/yesterday's
domestic board price).
Where the foreign and domestic board prices are unchanged, the latest price
used in the calculations of the index will be carried forward.
The constituents of Thailand and Brazil are as follows. The investibility
weightings are correct at the time of publication but may be subject to
amendment prior to the launch of the index.
Thailand: (D after a Thai stock indicates that a domestic price will be used
and F that a foreign board price will be used. The figure after each name

Schindler, the world's second largest elevators and escalators group after
Otis of the US, said its revenues in the first half dropped 2.4 per cent to
SFr2.16bn (Dollars 1.5bn).
No profit figure was published, but the group said it expected net income
for the full year to be slightly below the SFr168.6m reported for 1994.
It predicted that full-year operating profit would be broadly in line with
last year's SFr150.5m because of continuing unfavourable market conditions.
Sales of elevators and escalators fell 7.5 per cent in the first half to
SFr1.81bn, sales of rolling stock gained 15.3 per cent to SFr158m and
revenues from the recovering Also computer services subsidiary jumped 64 per
cent to SFr187m.
Total new orders were up 4.9 per cent to SFr2.2bn, and orders on hand at the
end of June were SFr2.65bn, 0.4 per cent lower than at the end of 1993. The
group said the SFr51m in new orders for rolling stock was nearly double the
level in the year earlier but was below expectations.

FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft more
optimistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft expects to earn more than DM100m (Dollars 64m) in
operating profits in 1994-95 after last week's agreement to staunch the
flood of losses on controversial oil purchase contracts with Castle Energy
of the US.
Current risk provisions of DM1bn already set aside to cover these deficits
would have to be increased, the group said last night, although no
significant new burdens had arisen from the deal with Castle.
The metals and engineering group, which came close to collapse this year
before being rescued by creditor banks, also announced it had signed an
agreement in principle with an unnamed buyer for its Frankfurt headquarters.
It expected the disposal to yield 'considerable extraordinary profits'.
Unofficial estimates have valued the site at DM750m.
A 'solution had come closer' in efforts to sell a 47 per cent stake in the
Kolbenschmidt automotive components company. The group, which is known to be
negotiating with Dana Corp of the US and T&amp;N of the UK, recently instructed
Deutsche Bank to draw up plans to place the stock as an option to an
industrial sale.
In a statement issued after a meeting between the banking consortium which
raised a DM3.4bn salvage package and the company's supervisory board,
Metallgesellschaft said it would seek further fresh capital at the end of
the current year on September 30, and was confident its proposals would be
approved by the banks and shareholders.
The tone of the statement contrasted sharply with a recent warning the
company issued at the time of the announcement of terms for its most recent
capital-raising move: the offering of 5.6m new shares to raise DM1.4bn. The
prospectus said the success of restructuring measures could not be
guaranteed, and there was no chance that dividend payments would be resumed
in the foreseeable future.

FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Bank Austria in search for
international partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bank Austria is looking for international strategic financial partners
following the announcement by the government that it wants to sell its 22.8
per cent voting stake in the country's largest bank.
Mr Hans Mayr, deputy mayor of Vienna, said in a newspaper interview that he
was already in discussions with 'a number of large international banks'
about buying parts of the government's shareholding and becoming strategic
partners.
The City of Vienna controls 51.8 per cent of the votes and 45.6 per cent of
the capital in Bank Austria.
Although the bank already has relations with Westdeutsche Landesbank, Mr
Mayr told Vienna's Der Standard that the discussions were mainly with banks
from Anglo-Saxon countries, and he would rather bring in three or four
partners than just one.
Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the Austrian finance minister, confirmed last week that
the federal government wanted to sell its stake in Bank Austria, but added:
'We are not in a hurry and don't want to be pressurised.'
The market value of the federal government stake in Bank Austria is about
Sch11.1bn (Dollars 1bn).
As so often in Austria, the stances of both Mr Lacina and Mr Mayr probably
reflect, at least in part, short-term political interests. Mr Lacina is in
the throes of a general election campaign and his Democratic Socialist Party
is trying to win over middle-of-the-road voters.
Mr Mayr, who is also a socialist, is trying to fend off a claim by the
public auditor, who happens to be a Conservative appointee, to the right to
scrutinise Bank Austria's books. If the federal government were no longer a
shareholder, the auditor's claim would become weaker.
Mr Mayr also said the city would let its shareholding in Bank Austria drop
below 50 per cent in the near future by not participating in the bank's
rights issues.
Meanwhile, Mr Lacina said yesterday that he had engaged JP Morgan, the US
investment bank, to assess bids for parts of the government's 70 per cent
voting stake in Creditanstalt, the country's second largest bank.
CS Holding, the financial services group built around Credit Suisse, and a
consortium drawn from mainly from Conservative business circles in Austria
have made competing bids.
Mr Lacina has said that Allianz, the German insurance group, has also shown
interest in the bank and some Viennese bankers suspect that the Raiffeisen
group of banking co-operatives, which last year made an aborted bid to merge
with Creditanstalt, may try again.

FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: ABN Amro lends itself to broking
 -What's in a new name?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by ABN Amro, the dominant bank in the Netherlands, to use its
name on a network of investment banking operations around the world is a
further step on an ambitious route. 'We are a bank that takes small steps,
but many, many of them,' says Mr Jan Kalff, chairman.
It is characteristic of ABN Amro, formed by the merger of Algemene Bank
Nederland and Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank four years ago, to have taken time to
blow its trumpet. For the seventh-largest European bank - bigger than
Barclays and Dresdner - it has kept a low international profile.
But by re-naming its equities, fixed-income and some of its corporate
finance activities ABN Amro Hoare Govett - after the London broking firm
acquired in 1992 - ABN Amro has sent a signal. It wants to be recognised as
one of the banks that compete with US securities firms such as Goldman
Sachs.
ABN Amro already has a claim to being global. It has 1,690 branches in 60
countries. It also owns the Dollars 24bn asset La Salle bank in Illinois,
and the Dollars 6bn asset European American Bank on Long Island.
This means that 40 per cent of its assets were held outside the Netherlands
in the first half of this year, while 45 per cent of pre-tax profits were
international. But its claim to being a global investment bank is weaker. It
does little equity underwriting outside the Netherlands, and is still
organising a broking network.
Like Swiss banks which have also expanded internationally, ABN Amro faces
intense margin pressure in a small domestic market. And, like them, it has
ambitions to put down roots in a second European 'home market' by buying a
bank or savings bank in a country such as Belgium, France, Germany or the
UK.
Yet ABN Amro is accustomed to making slow, steady progress. Mr Kalff
estimates that it is 'two-thirds to three-quarters' towards achieving the Fl
600m (Dollars 343m) cost savings it said it could get from its merger. It
has also built up the La Salle group steadily from its first acquisition in
Chicago in 1979.
The merger was intended to create a bank strong enough to compete globally.
'It was obvious that we could not go on acquiring banks, and charging large
amounts of goodwill, as ABN had done, without it hampering growth,' says Mr
Kalff.
The most significant investment banking step ABN Amro has taken since the
merger has been to build up a broking network. This includes firms such as
Riada Stockbrokers in Ireland, Massonaud-Fontenay-Kervern in France and
Hoare Govett. Equities have been run from London since the start of this
year.
ABN Amro wants to meld the broking operations into a single network, and use
it to strengthen its corporate finance arm. As evidence of how the strategy
could work, it points to its lead management of the Fl 7bn flotation of KPN,
the Dutch post and telecommunications company.
Its network of brokers - notably Hoare Govett - allowed it to distribute KPN
equity. Yet it will be a much harder task to break into primary equity
business elsewhere. Mr Kalff says he is optimistic that its huge client list
of large companies and commitment to other countries will help it to
prevail.
'I am optimistic that we will make an inroad one of these days if we show
our capability and commitment,' says Mr Kalff of the chances of lead
managing equity in France.
Making its broking network function as a unit could also take time.
'Sometimes the French have problems listening to Amsterdam, and now they
must listen to London, which may be even more difficult,' says Mr Rijnhard
van Tets, board member for global investment banking.
Like other parts of ABN Amro, investment banking must meet a range of
targets. As well as wanting to gain 50 per cent of pre-tax profit
internationally, the bank seeks 12 per cent return on equity, a cost-income
ratio of 62.5 per cent, and capital ratios at least 30 per cent higher than
the minimum.
This makes for a difficult balance. The bank has avoided a strong push into
derivatives, and does less financial markets trading than its counterparts
in Switzerland. But this places it under stronger pressure to break into
markets like equity underwriting to justify international investments.
'We are very risk conscious. We are not averse to risk, but we do not take
something on unless we are sure we can manage it,' says Mr Kalff.

FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Saint-Louis to step up expansion
of sugar side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Saint-Louis, the French food and transport group, plans to accelerate its
expansion within the European sugar industry, according to Mr Bernard Dumon,
chairman.
Mr Dumon told Le Figaro, the French newspaper, that he was interested in
increasing the company's sugar activities in France and in the emerging
eastern European markets.
The chairman also affirmed that the group, which suffered a fall in net
profits last year, was on course for recovery in 1994.
Saint-Louis is already in negotiations to augment its western European sugar
interests by raising its stake in General Azucarera, the Spanish sugar
concern, from the present level of 10 per cent to 20 per cent.
The deal involves the acquisition of a holding now owned by the Banco
Central Hispano-americano banking group.
The talks with Banco Hispanoamericano have been under way for some months.
Mr Dumon said that the two companies were about to resume negotiations in
earnest after a lull during the summer holidays.
When the General Azucarera deal is completed, Saint-Louis, which is
understood to be able to spend more than FFr7bn (Dollars 1.3bn) on
acquisitions, will turn its attention to expansion elsewhere in Europe.
One priority is eastern Europe, where it already has projects under way in
Poland and the Czech Republic.
The group has already announced that it might sell its 2.4 per cent stake in
Danone, another French food group, to finance its future expansion.
Mr Dumon estimated the value of the Danone holding at about FFr1.3bn.
He also forecast a 'substantial improvement' in net profits for Saint-Louis
this year.
The group last year saw net profits slip to FFr717m from FFr774m in 1992.
The chairman envisaged static profits from sugar during 1994, with an
increased contribution from prepared meals and a significant upturn from the
paper business.

FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Go-ahead for Lufthansa sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German government's privatisation of Lufthansa, the national airline, is
set to go ahead at the end of this month, according to Dresdner Bank, which
is co-ordinating the international and domestic offerings.
The government's timing coincides with a radical turnround in Lufthansa's
fortunes which has resulted in a doubling in its share price from a low of
DM97 in January 1993 to a high of DM223.80 last month. The shares closed at
DM207.50 yesterday.
The company said last month that it expected to make an operating profit
this year and confirmed earlier suggestions that it would resume dividend
payments for the first time since 1989.
The government intends to reduce its stake in Lufthansa from 51.4 per cent
to about 41 per cent by not participating in a forthcoming rights issue,
Dresdner said. The 3.9m shares which the government will not be taking up
will be sold to investors in Germany and abroad, excluding the US.
Lufthansa has decided not to place shares in the US under Rule 144A of the
US Securities Act, in order to limit the risk of excessive foreign ownership
which could jeopardise its flag carrier status. However, US investors are
likely to be included when the government disposes of the rest of its
shareholding, which is scheduled to take place before the end of 1995.
The new shares are likely to be priced at a slight discount to the
prevailing market price. If investor demand is sufficiently buoyant, the
government also intends to sell up to 2.1m existing shares which would
reduce its stake in Lufthansa to 36 per cent.
Dresdner Bank has drawn up a large syndicate of domestic and international
banks to ensure a wide placement of the shares.
Kleinwort Benson and NatWest have been appointed as senior sellers of the UK
and Ireland tranche, SG Warburg and UBS are senior sellers for the rest of
Europe tranche and CS First Boston and Morgan Stanley are senior sellers for
the rest of the world.
The publication of the preliminary circular yesterday launched a packed
pre-marketing period, with roadshows scheduled in Frankfurt, Paris, London
and Zurich. The book-building process begins on September 19 and will close
10 days later with the setting of the price and the allocation of the
shares.

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: ASW maintains interim despite fall to
Pounds 700,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASW Holdings, the Cardiff-based steel products and construction systems
group, is maintaining its interim dividend of 3p a share in spite of a sharp
fall in first-half pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 700,000.
The decision is based on the expectation that trading conditions will
continue to improve following a much better second quarter in the company's
main steel business.
The company is also expecting the benefits from its investment and
cost-cutting programmes to come through.
Total turnover edged up from Pounds 230.5m to Pounds 237m, but profits from
continuing operations, excluding restructuring costs, fell from Pounds 5.2m
to Pounds 3.4m.
The steel side suffered a slide in profits from Pounds 7m to Pounds 4.1m. A
loss of Pounds 100,000 in the first quarter reflected the continuation of
the poor trading conditions experienced at the end of last year, but the
second quarter brought a significant recovery in selling prices and margins.
Prices continued firm and demand remained satisfactory, ASW said yesterday.
An Pounds 11m-Pounds 12m upgrade of the Cardiff bar and section mill has
been carried out, which ASW said would achieve substantial cost reductions
when it came into full operation next year. Meanwhile, as a result of this
and other restructuring to be undertaken in the second half, there would be
exceptional restructuring costs estimated at Pounds 3.5m this year, due
mainly to redundancies. Some Pounds 600,000 of this was incurred in the
first half.
The construction systems business showed some improvement, helped by the
restructuring carried out at the end of last year, reducing its first-half
loss from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 700,000. The company reiterated that the
business would be profitable in the second half.
The group's net borrowings stood at Pounds 43.4m on June 30, only slightly
up from Pounds 42.8m a year earlier despite a rise in capital spending from
Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 10.2m.
Net profit rose from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 1.6m following the release of
an earlier provision related to the tax treatment of the takeover of
Manchester Steel in 1985. A favourable agreement with the Inland Revenue was
reached early this year.
After payment of preference and ordinary dividends, the retained loss for
the period was reduced from Pounds 2m a year earlier to Pounds 1.1m. Basic
earnings per share were 1.3p (0.0p).

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Interest income cuts Scotia loss to Pounds
1.54m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scotia Holdings, the drugs company which raised Pounds 37m from its
flotation last October, reduced its interim pre-tax loss from Pounds 2.59m
to Pounds 1.54m, helped by net interest income of Pounds 839,000, compared
with interest paid of Pounds 282,000.
However, the previous result was after net exceptional charges of Pounds
1.5m. Profits before R&amp;D, exceptionals and interest eased from Pounds 2.97m
to Pounds 2.92m on sales 14 per cent ahead at Pounds 8.81m (Pounds 7.76m).
Scotia finances research into new drugs with the profits from sales of
evening primrose oil. Research focuses on lipids, important constituents of
the membranes which surround cells.
Mr David Horrobin, chief executive, said the company had five products in
phase 3 trials, yet its cash balances had fallen by only Pounds 467,000 in
the six months. Spending on research and development had risen by more than
40 per cent to Pounds 5.29m.
The pharmaceutical division's sales and royalties fell from Pounds 3.97m to
Pounds 3.85m, reflecting price reductions in the UK, which accounts for 60
per cent of the total. Sales of distribution rights and other operating
income were down 34 per cent at Pounds 1.51m (Pounds 2.3m).
The nutritional division increased sales and royalties by 31 per cent to
Pounds 4.97m (Pounds 3.79m) following a return to the US market and a change
of UK distributor.
Mr Horrobin said the flotation had allowed the group to accelerate patient
recruitment for trials. Drugs in the pipeline include treatments for
diabetic complications, pancreatic cancer and the side effects of
radiotherapy.
Losses per share were 2.5p (6p).

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Britannia Building Society 64% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britannia Building Society, the UK's ninth largest, yesterday reported a 64
per cent increase in first half pre-tax profits, from Pounds 28.5m to Pounds
46.8m.
Mortgage lenders across the sector have benefited from falls in provisions
for bad and doubtful debts; Britannia also attributed the rise to better
management of interest margins and an increase in non-interest income.
Net interest receivable for the six months to June 30 rose to Pounds 88.2m -
some 16 per cent higher than in the first half of last year. Other income
and charges, including those from insurance sales, rose by Pounds 2.9m to
Pounds 27.2m (Pounds 24.1m).
The society's estate agency subsidiary is just below break-even point.
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell 22 per cent to Pounds 17m (Pounds
21.8m) - less than the falls experienced by some other societies.
Mr Trevor Bayley, finance director, said that Britannia's provisions had not
had as far to fall as those of some societies, and that it had also taken a
relatively cautious view of property prices.
The society's administrative expenses rose to Pounds 51.6m (Pounds 49.9m),
part of which was attributable to the cost of closing 25 branches earlier
this year. Mr Bayley said that this closure programme, which leaves the
society with 201 branches, was now broadly complete. Group assets rose by
about 2 per cent to total Pounds 13.4bn.
Mr Bayley said that historically the society's interest margins had been
slim for the sector, but that this had been improving over the last 18
months.
One example of this had been the society's very selective approach to the
prices at which it was prepared to offer fixed-rate mortgages. At 7.75 per
cent, its standard variable rate is just over 0.1 percentage point above the
lowest headline variable rates offered by any of the 10 largest societies.

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: New issues machine back in gear -
Institutional mood towards flotations is changing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a summer of discontent for the city's vast new issues machine, which
almost ground to a halt in the face of institutional hostility, recovering
share prices have cranked up the machine once more.
The Stock Exchange estimates that it has between 40 and 50 companies
currently in its new issues pipeline. A further 25 have made initial
approaches, which could be translated into flotations by the year-end.
The net result is that 1994 will overwhelmingly break both the 1986 record
of Pounds 9bn of flotations for a year and the 1993 record number of 180
initial public offers.
This year, according to KPMG Peat Marwick's figures, an estimated 147
flotations have sucked up Pounds 7.5bn of institutional capital and added
companies with an initial market value of close to Pounds 13bn.
These statistics might suggest a return to the euphoric reception of new
issues during the bull market of the mid-1980s, but the reality could hardly
be more different.
Institutions all demonstrate an enormous wariness towards the flood of new
scrip. Companies such as Canadian Pizza, United Carriers and Nottingham
Group, which encountered unexpected sales declines shortly after flotation,
have made it more difficult to persuade fund managers to support less than
quality issues.
As Mr Neil Austin, of Peat Marwick Corporate Finance, says: 'One of the
advantages of the shake-out is that those opportunistic, or downright
greedy, companies that shouldn't float will not be able to. I think we have
lost that fringe element for the moment.'
Primary causes of the recovery in confidence were the 3i and Exco
flotations. Both received strong institutional support for share offers
despite uncertain market conditions. Backers were rewarded with share price
increases of 18 per cent and 19 per cent respectively.
However, enthusiasm will be tempered by less successful flotations such as
on-line business information group MAID, whose shares fell 61 per cent below
the 110p issue price, before recovering to a 36 per cent discount.
Investors are likely to be faced with a mixture of both. Larger companies,
such as Thorn Lighting and ED &amp; F Man, have experienced managements and long
track records, and are expected to get positive responses at the right
price. By contrast, there are a number of smaller companies that have been
touting themselves over too many months, which may encounter less
enthusiasm.
The list of impending floats will include names such as Ashbourne Homes,
Bright Reasons, Century Inns, Compell Group, Datrontech, Filtronic Comtek,
Optus, Seaperfect, Servisair and USM Texon.
Brokers said they hoped that these would be evenly spread throughout the
remainder of the year, but the reality will be the opposite.
There is a sense that there is only a limited window of opportunity.
Companies and their advisers are therefore already jostling to get to the
front of the line, to ensure that they are not left exposed when
institutional appetites are satiated.
The dangers for those that miss the boat are great. London Capital's
flotation was pulled at the last minute, as major shareholder Citibank
refused to sell out at the prices dictated by its advisers - close to a 15
per cent discount to assets.
Analysts said there were concerns over the LCH's management, which might
have been ignored in a stronger market. However, having withdrawn once, it
would be likely to struggle to get a positive response a second time and a
trade sale is now considered a more likely exit for Citibank.
British Printing Company was another casualty, but it was beaten more on
price than quality and is expected to relaunch its offer, after completing
accounts for the current year.
In the past, marginal flotations could be propped up through support from
the small retail investor, but this year the public have played only a
limited role.
The Capital Shopping Centres public offer was only 14.4 per cent subscribed,
and even after an aggressive marketing campaign, the public portion of the
3i offer was only 1.1 times subscribed.
Institutional shareholders are therefore the key to success, and they are
returning from summer holidays with money to spend from recent bids and
dividends and a more positive outlook for the market.
The race is now on to see how many new issues can get through before the
mood changes once more.

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: US purchases behind Heywood advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US acquisitions boosted the first-half results of Heywood Williams, the
building materials and automotive components group, which more than doubled
the pre-tax profits of its continuing businesses to Pounds 16.1m, writes
Andrew Taylor.
Last year's interim profit of Pounds 22.74m was not comparable as it
included a Pounds 15m gain on the Pounds 95m sale of the UK glass division
to Pilkington.
Proceeds from the sale were used to buy two US companies: LaSalle-Deitch,
which supplies components and furnishings for factory built homes, and
Bristol Corporation, the plumbing products concern. The latter also sells
heavily to suppliers and occupiers of factory built homes.
The acquisitions, which joined the group after the first half of last year,
added Pounds 7.8m to operating profits which rose from Pounds 7.6m to Pounds
16.1m. Profits from existing US operations increased by Pounds 300,000 and
the US total reached Pounds 9.6m, compared with Pounds 1.4m.
UK building materials businesses, however, continued to suffer from the
failure of the repair, maintenance and do-it-yourself markets to recover.
Profit margins on plastic windows and doors have been squeezed by big rises
in polyvinyl chloride raw material prices. Overall UK profit, including
AutoWindscreens, fell by 6.8 per cent from Pounds 6.21m to Pounds 5.81m.
Continental European glass profits rose sharply from Pounds 77,000 to Pounds
265,000 reflecting an improvement in construction markets. It is thought the
group intends to sell this business.
In the UK it has accepted an offer for Finalex, 'reflecting the asset value'
of the aluminium extrusion business which has been losing market share to
plastics in the replacement window and door market. Mr Ralph Hinchliffe,
chairman, said the price was low and not material by comparison with
Heywood's remaining businesses.
Earnings per share of continuing businesses increased from 5.5p to 9.7p,
including the effects of last December's Pounds 52.4m rights issue.
The company, therefore, is proposing to increase the interim dividend by 11
per cent to 5p.
COMMENT
Heywood is the latest building materials producer to complain of slow
progress in UK repair and maintenance markets. These fare better when the
housing market is performing well. General house sales, however, remain
sluggish compared with new house sales. Meanwhile, PVC prices seem set to
rise further. Heywood shareholders should be grateful, therefore, for some
shrewd earnings-enhancing US acquisitions. These should help increase group
profits to Pounds 36m this year and Pounds 42m next. This places the shares
on forward multiples of 16 this year and more than 13 for 1995. It is
difficult, however, to see how the group will improve this rating until
there is a more positive outlook for UK repair markets.

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Redundancy for head of Lloyd's agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Terry Hayday is parting company with Sturge Holdings after three years as
chief executive of the Lloyd's agency's insurance operations.
Mr Hayday's departure follows the appointment of Lord David Poole as group
chief executive early last month, and the decision of Mr David Coleridge,
the chairman and former chairman of the Lloyd's market, to retire next
February.
'Both the company and Mr Hayday have agreed that it is in their mutual best
interests if Mr Hayday left the group,' the company said.
'He has accordingly accepted that he is made redundant effective from 16
September 1994, on which date he will resign all his directorships with the
group.'
Mr Hayday originally became a director at Sturge when his own underwriting
agency was taken over by the larger group in 1990.
His tenure in office has coincided with a difficult period for Sturge, with
the capacity managed by its underwriting agency falling from over Pounds 1bn
to some Pounds 660m after losses at a number of syndicates.
Sturge, under Mr Coleridge's direction, grew rapidly in the late 1980s. But
it closed eight of its 22 syndicates early last year, including two - 206
and 210 - which had generally been regarded as 'flagships' in the market.
The closures and dismissal of 40 staff were part of a rationalisation geared
to improve efficiency.

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Wilson Bowden 46% ahead to Pounds 16.5m -
Housebuilder cautions on August sales / Repair and DIY market still in
doldrums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Wilson Bowden jumped 46 per cent to Pounds 16.5m during
the first six months of this year - after discounting a 'one-off Pounds 5.5m
pension fund surplus' in the first half of 1993.
However, Mr David Wilson, chairman and chief executive, struck a cautious
note following reports last week that new house sales had recovered sharply
during August from disappointing levels in June and July.
He said: 'Our sales are slightly higher than in August last year, but
no-where near the margin suggested by other builders.' Persimmon, the
country's eighth largest housebuilder, had said that its August sales were a
quarter higher than last year.
Mr Wilson said his company traditionally did better in September and
October, but there were signs that the market was beginning to improve.
Its sales in southern England last week were double those of the
corresponding week last year, although sales in the Midlands were only
slightly higher.
The company is increasing its interim dividend by 7.5 per cent to 2.85p
after earnings per share rose by a fifth to 11.8p, excluding last year's
pension fund surplus and reflecting last November's Pounds 57m rights issue.
Housebuilding profits rose by 56 per cent to Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 8.7m). The
number of houses sold increased by 17 to 965, while operating margins
increased from 13.4 per cent to 15.5 per cent, which Mr Wilson claimed was
the best in the sector.
Margins were boosted by a 15.3 per cent rise in the average price from
Pounds 78,900 to Pounds 91,000. Of this about 3 per cent represented a
genuine price rise and removal of discounts; the remainder reflected a
change in product to more expensive, higher-margin properties.
Increased volumes for the same fixed overheads also helped enhance margins.
Mr Wilson said the company had used up most of the more expensive land
bought in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
He remained concerned about government environmental policies stifling the
supply of land for house-building, although the big increases in prices paid
for land had slowed since the beginning of the year.
COMMENT
It is difficult to find areas to improve when you are already top of the
class. Less well managed competitors, which have more to gain from a housing
recovery, receive buy recommendations for their shares while most of Wilson
Bowden's virtues are already in its price. One area of gain may be
commercial property where profits, in spite of a slip to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds
4m) at the half year, are likely to be comfortably above last year's Pounds
6m. The company has reported an upsurge in demand for industrial units. The
balance sheet remains strong in spite of recent land purchases. Pre-tax
profits of Pounds 37m this year and Pounds 47m next place the shares on
prospective multiples of approaching 16 and almost 13 respectively - high
enough at this stage of the recovery.

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Speedo swimwear helps Pentland jump to
Pounds 16.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pentland Group yesterday claimed a share in recent Commonwealth Game
victories as the branded consumer goods company announced a sharp jump in
interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 16.8m.
The 96 medal winners in the 32 swimming events were all wearing Speedo
swimsuits, according to Mr Frank Farrant, finance director. 'It is the first
time that has happened and shows our strength in the performance-related
swimwear market.'
Strong growth in the Speedo division, which manufactures and distributes
swimwear, was partly behind the sharp rise for the six months to June 30
withacquisitions, on which Pentland spent Pounds 20m in the first half, also
helping.
The advance was further fuelled by the absence of Pounds 9.5m in losses and
charges arising from the closure of the US trade finance business in 1993.
At the operating level, profits rose from Pounds 5m to Pounds 10.2m. Sales
rose by 42 per cent to Pounds 280.9m (Pounds 198.4m), or by 43 per cent on a
continuing basis.
Pentland was disappointed by the performance of its US footwear business,
which incurred losses of Pounds 5m for the whole of last year. Mr Farrant
said the group was behind its target to halve losses for 1994, but was
confident the division could break even next year.
The consumer goods division suffered from higher prices for commodities such
as copper, used in the manufacture of extension cords. This is the largest
part of the business at Woods Wire, the cables maker and distributor
acquired last year.
Woods, which accounts for about half of total turnover, had been unable to
pass on price increases to retailers, Mr Farrant said. However, increases of
between 5 and 10 per cent had recently been introduced and there would be
further rises in the second half.
Pentland finished the first half with net cash of Pounds 145m, against
Pounds 185 at the December year-end. The drop in cash and lower interest
rates accounted for a fall in net interest income from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds
4.2m.
Mr Farrant said the group's strategy of making medium-sized acquisitions had
been vindicated by the results. 'We have come a long way and people have not
recognised that fact because we have not done one major acquisition.'
Although Pentland would continue to be acquisitive, the group now intended
to focus more on managing brands, Mr Farrant said.
The dividend was increased by 7.8 per cent to 1.25p (1.16p) from earnings up
from 0.41p to 2.71p, although the rise was a more restrained 19 per cent
when non-recurring items were excluded.
Analysts upgraded forecasts for full-year profits before exceptionals from
about Pounds 31m to Pounds 35m, compared with Pounds 28.3m before
exceptionals. The shares were marked up 4p to close at 108p.

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional gain helps Peter Black rise to
Pounds 12.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An exceptional gain of Pounds 1.1m on the disposal of its Factory Shops
business helped to lift annual profits at Peter Black, supplier of footwear,
cosmetics and accessories to Marks and Spencer, by more than 36 per cent.
Pre-tax profits for the year to June 4 rose from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds 12.4m
on sales 8 per cent ahead at Pounds 124.8m, compared with Pounds 114.9m.
Mr Gordon Black, joint chairman, said the sale of the retail and leisure
businesses had left the group both focused and ungeared. That, coupled with
its cash generating ability, would allow it to remain at the forefront of
the personal care and footwear industries, where there were clear prospects
for organic growth.
Operating profit from continuing operations improved from Pounds 9.16m to
Pounds 10.8m on turnover of Pounds 117.1m (Pounds 105.5m). Margins improved
from 8 to 9 per cent.
The personal care division lifted profits to Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 4.4m) on
the back of a rise in turnover from Pounds 40.9m to Pounds 44.7m in markets
described by Mr Black as 'vibrant'.
English Grains, which supplies vitamins, dietary supplements and natural
medicines to multiple outlets and chemists, had a record year.
Mr Black said the group was constrained by lack of capacity in this market -
a situation that would change in 12 months' time when its new Pounds 10m
factory opens in Derbyshire.
Profits at the footwear and accessories division increased from Pounds 3.7m
to Pounds 4.6m on sales of Pounds 67.2m (Pounds 60.6m). The group is
confident that it can increase sales to M&amp;S, which has a relatively low
share of the footwear market.
Turnover from the group's discontinued retail and leisure operations was
Pounds 7.74m (Pounds 9.4m), with operating profits of Pounds 757,000 (Pounds
698,000).
The profit from the disposal of the Hornsea Freeport retail and leisure
division, sold after the year-end, will be in next year's accounts.
Earnings per share increased to 15.56p (11.18p) and the recommended final
dividend is lifted from 2.77p to 3.35p, giving a total for the year of 4.47p
(3.7p).
Analysts are expecting profits for this year to be just above Pounds 12m,
giving the group a prospective p/e of 19.

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Flat demand balks British Vita
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in British Vita fell 11p to 259p yesterday after the foam and fibre
group said it had been hit by pricing pressures and flat demand in important
markets.
Although the group saw first-half pre-tax profits rise 46 per cent to Pounds
23.71m (Pounds 16.26m), it admitted that the figures were flattered by
sizeable losses last time which disguised a more modest increase in
operating profits.
'We are not seeing the kind of recovery that manufacturers of capital goods
are enjoying,' said Mr Rod Sellers, chief executive.
At the operating level, profits on continuing operations were almost
unchanged at Pounds 21.39m (Pounds 20.08m) and Mr Sellers warned that the
company's main markets were static or improving only slowly.
Overall operating profits showed a healthier near Pounds 4m improvement, as
the group benefited from the disposal last year of its debt-burdened Spanish
subsidiaries - Icoa and Metzeler Laminados - which lost Pounds 2.62m last
time.
Without contributions from the two subsidiaries, turnover fell back to
Pounds 388m (Pounds 404.4m), but their disposal helped lift pre-tax profits
with Pounds 550,000 of interest receivable, against payments of Pounds
99,000.
'We've got rid of the problem businesses and although our markets are not
booming we've seen a small upturn in all our divisions,' said Mr Sellers.
That improvement was helped by last year's rationalisation programme, which
saw the workforce cut by 5 per cent to 12,800 and costs adjusted to meet
lower demand.
Of the group's three divisions, cellular polymers - the largest - saw
profits increase 8.6 per cent to Pounds 13.85m (Pounds 12.78m).
The industrial polymers operation saw profits rise from Pounds 2.33m to
Pounds 2.65m, and the fibres and fabrics division moved ahead 7.5 per cent
to Pounds 3.69m (Pounds 3.43m).
While welcoming the figures, Mr Sellers said recent trading had been quiet
and it was unrealistic to expect a rapid increase in demand.
Nevertheless, earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 7p (5.6p), after
adjusting the 1993 figure by adding back the loss on the disposal of
discontinued operations.
An interim dividend of 3.75p (3.65p) has been declared.
COMMENT
British Vita is refreshingly candid about its prospects. It admits that its
figures are fairly limp even after shedding the excess baggage which slowed
it down during the worst of the recession. But the performance is not bad,
given the margin pressures and increased raw material prices. To see any
acceleration, it really needs to use its Pounds 32.5m reserves to make a
cash-generative acquisition that would also boost market share. If it did
that, then profits could exceed the Pounds 47m forecast for this year and
make the shares - which reached 309p in April - worth considering on a
forward multiple of 18.

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Growth in US helps Haynes to Pounds 5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance by the US operations of Haynes Publishing Group, the
car and motor cycle maintenance manual company, helped lift annual pre-tax
profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 5.04m.
Turnover moved ahead to Pounds 25.7m (Pounds 22.8m) in the year to May 31,
with US sales up 23 per cent at Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 10.5m) and UK sales up
5 per cent at Pounds 12.8m (Pounds 12.2m).
'As in recent years, much of our growth is expected to come from the US, '
Mr John Haynes, chairman, said. But, he added, the board had achieved its
objective of returning the UK operations to their former levels of profit.
Pre-tax profits for the UK rose by 23 per cent to Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.3m).
This included a write-off of Pounds 223,000 largely caused by the closure of
the contract printing business. Operating profits for the UK stood at Pounds
2.3m (Pounds 2m).
Mr Haynes said an improvement in new titles had helped reduce publishing
losses and additional products were being considered. The replacement of old
machinery would mean an improvement in UK capacity.
The US operation saw pre-tax profits grow by 32 per cent to Pounds 3.3m
(Pounds 2.5m). Operating profits moved ahead from Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m.
The company now has book manufacturing facilities on both sides of the
Atlantic following the opening of a print facility in Nashville in November.
Despite Mr Haynes' concern about expected rises in raw material prices -
they account for 50 per cent of product costs - Mr Max Pearce, group chief
executive, was confident the current year's profitability would not be
affected.
A final dividend of 5p (3p) has been recommended, making a total of 9p
(6.5p) on earnings per share 12 per cent ahead at 19.6p (17.53p). Last
year's dividend and earnings per share have been restated for November's 1
for 2 scrip issue.
The shares rose 12p to 450p.

Better conditions in all its markets helped John Mansfield Group, the timber
processing and manufacturing concern which came to the market in June, to
turn in a pre-tax profit of Pounds 102,000 for the first half of 1994. This
compared with a Pounds 36,000 loss last time.
Turnover grew 8 per cent to Pounds 3.74m and earnings per share were 0.37p
(0.12p losses).
The company said that cash inflow following the flotation had significantly
strengthened the balance sheet. Reduced bank borrowings had only a small
effect on lower interest payments of Pounds 95,000 (Pounds 105,000) for the
period and the main benefit would be seen in the second half.

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Computer People doubles to Pounds 733,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Computer People, the computer recruitment service and consultancy, reported
pre-tax profits doubled from Pounds 364,000 to Pounds 733,000 for the half
year to end-June.
The shares rose 10p to 195p.
The outcome was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 530,000
relating to management reorganisation, and came from revenue up from Pounds
33.5m to Pounds 38m.
Earnings per share emerged at 3.42p (1.45p) and the company is restoring the
interim dividend with a pay-out of 1p.

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Oliver reduces first half loss to Pounds
1.65m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oliver Group, the shoe retailer now trading from 335 branches, cut its
losses from Pounds 2.24m to Pounds 1.65m for the six months to July 2.
The group made a Pounds 244,000 full-year profit; however 'footwear, like
most other forms of retailing, is heavily dependent on the peak Christmas
trading period for a profitable outcome for the year,' said Mr Denis
Cassidy, chairman.
Turnover was down at Pounds 32.2m (Pounds 33.2m), but this was achieved from
43 fewer branches than in the first half of 1993. Losses per share were
6.55p (8.86p).

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Cantors improves towards end of year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cantors, the retail furnishing group, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.54m for the year to April 23, a 52 per cent increase on the comparable
Pounds 1.67m. Turnover rose 3 per cent from Pounds 60.4m to Pounds 62m.
Mr Harold Cantor, chairman, said the January sale was successful and there
was an improvement in trading in the last quarter of the year.
This continued into the first month of the present year but the tax rises
and the hot weather in June and July resulted in very poor trading.
Earnings per share came out at 10.33p (6.66p) and the dividend is being
maintained at 4p with an unchanged final of 3p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in RPS jumped by 10 per cent from 60p to 66p after the USM-quoted
environmental consultancy reported a 35 per cent increase in first-half
pre-tax profits and sounded an optimistic note for the future.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 388,000 to Pounds 525,000 for the
first half of 1994, on turnover up by 22 per cent at Pounds 4.27m. Margins
also increased from 11 per cent to 12 per cent.
Mr Roger Looker, chairman, said the forward order book level was more
encouraging than at any time since the recession first affected the group in
the second quarter of 1990.
Earnings per share climbed from 2.17p to 2.89p and the dividend has been
stepped up to 1.3p (1.1p).

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Interest cut bolsters Expamet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A 39 per cent cut in interest charges to Pounds 830,000 helped Expamet
International to raise pre-tax profits by 30 per cent from a restated Pounds
2m to Pounds 2.6m in the first half of 1994. Turnover on continuing
businesses rose from Pounds 62.8m to Pounds 64.3m.
The company's security and building sectors both showed improvements - at
Pounds 1m (Pounds 0.9m) and Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.7m) respectively - while
the industrial side, although Pounds 0.5m lower than last time at Pounds
0.6m, showed a recovery on last year's difficult second half.
The lower interest charge reflected both reduced borrowings and a fall in
French interest rates. At June 30, borrowings including leasing, had reduced
by 20 per cent or Pounds 4m compared to mid-1993.
Earnings per share were 2.71p (2.59p) and the interim dividend has been
lifted from 1.25p to 1.35p.

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Asia Pacific side behind 17% JIB rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance from its Asia Pacific operations helped JIB Group, the
insurance broker in which Jardine Matheson has a majority stake, turn in a
17 per cent increase in half-year pre-tax profits from Pounds 11.7m to
Pounds 13.7m.
Turnover grew 7 per cent to Pounds 114.6m (Pounds 107.4m), while earnings
per share were unchanged at 6.4p, as was the dividend of 2.5p.
Turnover in the Asia-Pacific region rose 19 per cent to Pounds 19.7m as the
company reaped the benefit of opening new offices in South Korea and India
and reorganising its operations in the Philippines.
Mr John Barton, chief executive, said that JIB was looking to further expand
its Far Eastern operations to benefit from the region's burgeoning
economies. 'We will be building on our successes in our Asian Pacific
insurance operations and overseas reinsurance business,' he said.
He added that the company had been surprised by the toughness of the UK
insurance market. Turnover here grew by just 9 per cent in the first half to
Pounds 46.1m (Pounds 42.2m), with margins coming under pressure as brokers
reacted to strong competitive pressures by reducing rates, particularly in
the marine market.
JIB's US operations also performed in competitive conditions, with Mr Barton
blaming difficulties in the Lloyd's market as part of the reason for an
increase in business remaining in the US. He added that the business was
undergoing some restructuring.
London was also a difficult market for the reinsurance business, with
reduced demand dampening prices required for reinsurance cover. However, JIB
was boosted by a good performance from its overseas reinsurance division.

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Canadians buy holding in Trio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regent Pacific Group, an international financial services group which is
majority-owned by Altamira Management of Toronto, said yesterday it had
bought 9.1 per cent of the share capital of Trio Holdings, the UK money and
securities broker.
'We are keeping an open mind about further investment,' said Ms Jayne
Sutcliffe, a director of Regent Pacific in charge of corporate finance. She
noted that although Regent had invested in UK investment trusts in the past,
this was its first entry as a significant shareholder into an operating
financial services company.
She said the purchase reflected Regent's view that the UK's financial
services sector had good growth prospects. Trio represented a geared play on
the sector since its restructuring last year had improved its potential, she
added.
Mr David Hagan, Trio's chairman, said he was pleased that another
institution had decided to take a material stake in the company. Fidelity is
thought to be Trio's largest single shareholder with a stake of about 11 per
cent, followed by Warburg Pincus with about 10 per cent.
Ms Sutcliffe said the 5.08m shares in Trio were acquired in the market
towards the end of last week, when the shares traded between 28p and 30p.
This would put a price tag of some Pounds 1.5m on the stake. Trio's share
price closed at 34p yesterday, up 2p from Friday.

<TEXT>
Medical Insurance Exchange of California, a professional liability insurer,
has become the latest organisation to take advantage of the drive by Lloyd's
of London to attract corporate investors.
The US group will begin contributing its corporate capacity to the Lloyd's
market for 1995, and is expected to write premium income of about Pounds 5m.
It will allocate its capacity to specialist medical malpractices syndicates.
Stace Barr has been appointed as MIE's Lloyd's adviser.
Lloyd's currently has 25 corporate member groups, the first to be allowed
since the insurance market changed its rules a year ago in a radical move to
allow investors to take advantage of limited liability.
The new protected members have been backed by institutional and private
money and have been able to contribute Pounds 1.6bn in capacity for the 1994
underwriting year.

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Paper price rises put Bunzl up 26% at
Pounds 33m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bunzl, the distribution and cigarette filter company, yesterday wrapped up
its first half with the promise of an increased final pay-out and a 26 per
cent jump in pre-tax profits, excluding goodwill write-offs, to Pounds
32.8m.
The profits rise was due in part to long-awaited price rises in the
depressed paper industry, on which Bunzl depends for more than 70 per cent
of its earnings.
Mr Tony Habgood, chief executive, said paper prices had risen by 1
percentage point, against a 2-point fall previously. They were expected to
improve further in the second half, he added.
Although acquisitions also helped the return, he said Bunzl had still
achieved underlying profits growth of between 11 and 12 per cent.
Margins in continuing operations rose from 4.6 to 5.1 per cent.
Given the strong performance, 'we expect to be able to increase the final
dividend,' Mr Habgood said. The interim was held at 1.8p, as foreshadowed
last year, to adjust the balance between first and second half payouts.
During the first half, Bunzl sold its building products business for Pounds
61m. The disposal resulted in a net goodwill write-off of Pounds 35m which
must be taken through the profit and loss account.
Although this has no cash effect, it left Bunzl with a Pounds 2.2m interim
pre-tax loss, against profits of Pounds 26m last time. Sales were 11 per
cent higher for the six months to June 30 at Pounds 809.7m.
Of the group's four core businesses, cigarette filters and fine paper
returned the strongest growth.
Fine paper, which has seen prices fall by as much as 38 per cent in the last
three years, benefited from the general upturn and the withdrawal from
Sicily. Profits rose by 31 per cent to Pounds 6.4m.
Mr Habgood said the growing market for lower tar cigarettes had helped
Bunzl's filter business return a 31 per cent increase in operating profits
to Pounds 7.2m.
Paper and plastic disposables enjoyed 18 per cent profit growth to Pounds
19.7m. Plastic products also returned an 18 per cent rise to Pounds 5.9m.
The loss per share was 3.5p, against a 3.9p profit last time. Excluding the
goodwill write-off, earnings advanced 21 per cent to 4.7p.
COMMENT
Tony Habgood appears to have confounded the sceptics who criticised his
strategy just two years ago as a misguided focus on mature markets. The
rewards are undoubtedly rolling in. So far, they have been down to
management's herculean restructuring efforts. Now, with little left to
achieve on that front, the upturn in the paper cycle will do its bit for
Bunzl. If Habgood is not to be caught out, however, he needs to look ahead
to the next downturn. With the paper cycle expected to peak in 1997, Bunzl
may have to find a sizeable acquisition to keep up the momentum. Forecasts
are for about Pounds 71m this year, putting the shares on a prospective p/e
of about 15.5 times. This looks just about right for a solidly managed
company.

FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Burmah Castrol rises 16% - US activities
advance 50% on lower crude prices and synthetic sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Burmah Castrol, the lubricants, chemicals and fuels group, increased interim
pre-tax profits by 16 per cent but said it would be unable to repeat in the
second half an exceptional performance by Castrol in the US.
Pre-tax profits from Pounds 89.5m to Pounds 103.8m in the six months to June
30, and attributable profits climbed 15 per cent to Pounds 50.5m (Pounds
44m). The shares closed 14p lower at 891p.
Mr Jonathan Fry, chief executive, said Castrol's US profits had risen by 50
per cent, thanks to increased sales, the move into profit of the new
synthetic lubricant, Syntec, and a fall in the price of crude oil at the
start of the period which had now been reversed.
In lubricants as a whole, trading profits rose 24 per cent to Pounds 86.6m
(Pounds 70m). In Asia, there were strong performances from India, Japan,
Thailand and Vietnam, while Australasia benefited from economic recovery.
In Europe, although the industrial market showed some pick up, consumer
demand remained subdued, notably in Germany, the UK and France. Latin
America suffered from 'chaotic' trading conditions in Brazil.
Chemicals also increased trading profits by 24 per cent, to Pounds 22.1m
(Pounds 17.8m). Profits from Foseco Metallurgical Chemicals bounced back by
85 per cent, mainly because of the restructuring and rationalisation which
has been completed in Europe and North America.
The group said Sericol Printing Inks continued to power ahead, and adhesives
also had a good first half. Coatings had a poor first quarter, although the
second quarter was stronger. Fosroc Construction and Mining Chemicals
suffered from difficult trading in Europe and a softening in key Middle
Eastern markets.
In fuels, trading profits fell to Pounds 8.5m from Pounds 13.5m. Competitive
markets in the UK and Sweden combined with economic turmoil in Turkey to
drive down volumes and profits. LNG Transportation was also down, to Pounds
3.2m from Pounds 7m, mainly because the previous period benefited from the
inclusion of a provision release of Pounds 3.5m.
Mr Lawrence Urquhart, chairman, said the group intended to pay up to a third
of the year's total dividend as a Foreign Income Dividend, which would
reduce the group's ongoing surplus Advance Corporation Tax problem. It
declared an interim dividend of 10p, compared with 16.5p. Last year's
payment had been increased in case the use of an enhanced scrip dividend was
blocked by the Budget.
Earnings per share increased by only 9.4 per cent, to 25.6p (23.4p), because
of the greater number of shares in issue following last year's enhanced
scrip scheme and the Pounds 32m acquisition of Tribol, a US lubricants
specialist.
