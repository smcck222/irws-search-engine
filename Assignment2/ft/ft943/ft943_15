FT  06 SEP 94 / There's no option but to take Courage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With its asset write-down yesterday, Foster's Brewing Group took a step
toward solving several strategic problems it faces in the UK in brewing and
pub retailing.
On the brewing side, Courage, the second largest UK brewer, is suffering
like the rest of the industry from declining beer consumption and intense
competition. Some industry observers have even questioned whether Foster's
would stay the course.
On the pub side, it stands over the next few years to lose supply agreements
and ties to pub estates that account for some 25 per cent of its output.
It thought it had found the solution to these problems four years ago in a
complicated agreement with Grand Metropolitan, the UK food and drinks group.
Foster's would commit itself to brewing while GrandMet would concentrate on
pub retailing, allowing each group to play to its self-confessed strengths.
To that end, GrandMet sold its brewing activities such as the UK production
of Carlsberg Pilsener and Budweiser to the Australian group to enhance
Courage's portfolio. GrandMet and Foster's combined their pubs in a 50-50
joint venture, Inntrepreneur Estates (IEL) which GrandMet essentially runs.
Inntrepreneur was dogged from the start by its financial structure. Both
parties loaded it with debt so they could extract cash from the transaction.
But asset values fell rapidly during the recession, forcing Foster's and
GrandMet to put in more equity to maintain banking covenants.
IEL, which has an estate of some 6,500 pubs, has also found trading
difficult. Foster's shed a ray of hope on it yesterday,saying that IEL would
achieve 'a modest profit' for the first time in the year to September thanks
in part to lower interest costs. 'IEL is motoring along quite favourably,'
Mr Bob WIlliams, managing director of Grand Metropolitan Estates,which
effectively runs the joint venture, said yesterday.
Despite this pick-up, Foster's has to address two questions:
Its agreement to supply beer to IEL runs out in 1998;
Grand Met has indicated it would prefer to focus on IDV, its international
spirits business, and food activities such as Pillsbury. 'IEL is not a key
part of that strategy,' Mr Williams said.
More urgently, Foster's will lose next year an agreement to supply beer to
the Chef and Brewer pub and restaurant chain bought last year by Scottish &amp;
Newcastle from GrandMet.
Although Foster's will continue to supply beer to bigger Chef and Brewer
outlets for a further five years, S&amp;N will clearly want to increase sales of
its own beers.
Despite attempts by the UK government through its 'beer orders' to bring
greater separation of brewing and pubs, all large British brewers except
Courage and Guinness still have estates. But Guinness is a special case
because its strength lies in a powerful international brand.
Foster's will say only that it is reviewing all its strategic options in the
UK. For many industry observers, however, buying a large chunk of the IEL
estate would at least guarantee some sales volume.
Price, however, could be an issue. Foster's and GrandMet now value their
combined equity in IEL at Pounds 225m. In addition, they have more than
Pounds 500m of IEL debt or loans on their books. Therefore, Foster's might
have to pay about Pounds 500m to buy a majority of the pubs, leaving the
rump to be sold to a management buy-out or to newly established pub chains.
Fortunately for Foster's, its year-end results announced yesterday carried a
good operating contribution from Courage. The UK brewer contributed
operating profits of ADollars 174.4m, down from ADollars 208.3m a year
earlier. They were essentially flat, however, allowing for the impact of a
change in excise duty in the UK and currency translations.
Courage's sales fell to ADollars 2.19bn from ADollars 2.39bn but it
increased its market shares by maintaining its beer volumes in a declining
market. 'Courage has delivered some of the best beer numbers the industry
has seen in the past year,' said Mr Geoff Collyer, an analyst with NatWest
Securities.
The UK performance was helped by cutting some ADollars 50m from of Courage's
annual operating costs of ADollars 900m, part of an effort to increase
productivity.
Courage still has plenty of work to do on repositioning some of its brands
and cutting some of its capacity. Its Webster's Yorkshire bitter, competing
against its brother-brand, John Smith, is a case in point.
Moreover, the industry background remains highly unfavourable. Beer
consumption is falling by about 2 or 3 per cent a year, lower margin
off-licence sales are draining pub sales, and imports are growing - both
direct imports by brewers and consumer imports across the Channel. Overall,
the industry has to make big cuts in both brewing capacity and the number of
pubs. Foster's indication yesterday that it will stick with the UK might
only prolong the agony for all.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Foster's writes down UK assets by Pounds 459m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foster's Brewing Group yesterday announced a 35 per cent write-down in the
value of its UK assets consisting of Courage, Britain's second largest
brewer, and a 50 per cent stake in Inntrepreneur Estates, a pub joint
venture with Grand Metropolitan.
The Australian group said the ADollars 955m (Pounds 459m) charge was
prompted by continued trading difficulties in the UK, a complex regulatory
environment, continental European brewers' increasing access to the UK
market, and rising take-home sales of lower-margin beers at the expense of
sales in pubs.
Analysts said the write-down brought the investments broadly in line with
book values of other brewers and with GrandMet's valuation of its half of
Inntrepreneur. GrandMet had previously written down its stake in several
stages while Foster's had maintained the book value.
The move, which Foster's announced with a 9 per cent fall in group profits
after tax and abnormal financial items for the year to June 30, was seen by
analysts as a prelude to further rationalisation at Courage and the
possibility of Foster's taking over a large part of Inntrepreneur. GrandMet
has previously indicated it would like to concentrate on its other food and
drink businesses.
Foster's wrote down its Courage brand names by ADollars 385m, goodwill by
ADollars 242m, Courage's fixed assets by ADollars 58m and its investment by
ADollars 270m.
But the Melbourne-based group also announced that it would offset much of
the balance sheet damage by writing up the value of its Australian assets,
and including a valuation for the Carlton and United brand names.
In its 1993 accounts, Foster's did not include a CUB brand valuation but
said, in a footnote, that directors considered them to be worth about
ADollars 1bn-ADollars 1.2bn.
Yesterday, Foster's said it had referred to an independent assessment when
deciding the value of the CUB brands but decided to pick a substantially
lower figure - ADollars 665m.
Foster's reported a 10.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits at ADollars
308.4m. Sales fell from ADollars 6.49bn to ADollars 5.07bn, largely due to
asset sales. It said its three beer markets - Australia, the UK and Canada -
were still extremely competitive, and that volumes had declined slightly in
the UK and Australia. Canadian volumes were 'modestly higher'.
Operating earnings from CUB rose from ADollars 211m to ADollars 250m, with
market share climbing to 53 per cent. Pre-interest profits at Courage, by
contrast, fell from ADollars 208m to ADollars 174m, a decline exacerbated by
the strengthening Australian dollar. The contribution from Molson in Canada
fell from ADollars 107m to ADollars 78m.
Profits were helped by a drop in interest charges, from ADollars 343.3m to
ADollars 214.9m, with debt at June 30 put at ADollars 1.85bn, compared with
ADollars 2.64bn. Basic earnings per share were 8.7 cents, against 10.7
cents. The final dividend of 3.25 cents is unchanged.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Savoy's Shepard spoke only for himself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Giles Shepard, managing director of the Savoy hotel group, yesterday took
personal responsibility for a weekend statement criticising a director for
allegedly leaking confidential information. He said the statement had not
been authorised by the company's board.
The statement followed reports on Sunday that Mr Shepard had sent some Savoy
directors a document outlining the case for the group's continued
independence from the Forte group. Forte owns 68 per cent of Savoy's shares
but only 42 per cent of the vote.
The statement, published in the FT, said: 'The board of the Savoy group is
dismayed that one non-executive director, for his own reasons, has decided
to discuss confidential papers with the press.' The statement was seen as a
reference to Sir Michael Richardson, who on Friday announced his retirement
as chairman of Smith New Court, the securities house. Sir Michael denies
leaking the report.
Sir Anthony Tuke, Savoy chairman, said the board had made no such statement.
He said he accepted Sir Michael's assurances that he had not leaked Mr
Shepard's document.
Sir Anthony added: 'The important error, and it's not the FT's fault, is
that it made it appear that the board of directors had taken a view on this.
They would have read this with surprise. They had no meeting.'
Asked whether it was unusual for Mr Shepard, a board member, to criticise
another director in this way, Sir Anthony said: 'I think it's
extraordinary.' When he was asked it he had spoken to Mr Shepard about it,
he said: 'We see each other every day. There's no change in that.' Mr
Shepard made no comment beyond saying that Sunday's statement should be
attributed to him rather than to the board.
The attempt to resolve the 13-year dispute between Forte and the Savoy
senior management is expected to continue at a Savoy board meeting on
September 13. Sir Anthony, when asked whether the meeting would reach a
conclusion on the dispute, said: 'If I have anything to do with it, it
will.'
Sir Anthony, who is 74, is keen to retire. The Forte and Savoy sides have,
however, been unable to agree on a replacement.
Mr Rocco Forte, Forte chairman, has been attempting to persuade shareholding
trusts controlled by the Wontner family to back plans to merge the Savoy's
hotels - which include the Savoy, the Connaught and Claridge's - with
Forte's luxury establishments. Sir Hugh Wontner was president of Savoy until
his death in 1992.
Opponents of the merger are believed to argue that it would give Forte
control of the group without making any offer to the remaining shareholders.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Unions warn Blair on plan to modernise Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leaders of the two largest Labour-affiliated trade unions yesterday
warned Mr Tony Blair, the new Labour party leader, not to pursue his
modernisation strategy at their expense.
Mr Bill Morris, leader of the 950,000-strong TGWU general union, said the
'jury is still out' on the Blair leadership and described as 'a bit of an
insult' Mr Blair's recent description of the unions as a pressure group like
any other.
'We are more than a pressure group, we have a special constitutional link
with the party,' he said.
Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, which has 830,000 members,
said: 'Tony has chosen not to speak in the traditional tones of the Labour
party, he does not use the time-honoured formulas. That gives rise to
anxieties.'
Mr Blair, who will not speak at the congress but will address TUC leaders at
a private dinner this evening, is expected to resist pressure to give public
support to striking rail signal staff.
But after the blood-letting at last year's Labour conference over the issue
of diluting union influence in party elections, neither the union leaders
nor Mr Blair want another row.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour party chairman, underlined in a speech to the TUC
congress yesterday that this should be a period of 'consolidation'.
He said: 'We have renewed our links, now it's time for consolidation and
continuity . . . we work in complementary avenues, side by side.'
Friends of Mr Blair said he was in 'full agreement' with Mr Blunkett on the
role of the unions in the modernised Labour party.
Substantial arguments over policy are not likely to arise until next year,
when a number of Labour policymaking commissions report. The unions will
want to hold on to the commitments made by the late John Smith at last
year's TUC congress for a substantial re-regulation of the labour market and
an economic policy emphasis on full employment.
Labour and the unions are likely to differ over the level of the minimum
wage, Labour's economic strategy and Mr Blair's plans for changes to the
shadow cabinet. The unions fear they will be marginalised in forming Labour
policy.
However, Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, who shares Mr Blair's view
that greater distance is in the mutual interest of unions and party,
yesterday endorsed Mr Blair's union policy of 'fairness, not favours'.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Hopes for Swan Hunter rescue package collapse: Receivers
fail to agree going-concern sale with CMN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prospects for a sale of troubled shipbuilder Swan Hunter to
Soffia/Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie collapsed yesterday after CMN
and receivers Price Waterhouse failed to agree a deal.
With the abandonment of negotiations for a going-concern sale to
French-owned CMN, 164-year-old Swan Hunter, one of the world's great
shipbuilding names, looks almost certain to close.
CMN, the only prospective bidder to emerge from a worldwide search by the
receivers, yesterday put forward proposals to acquire a section of the
Tyneside yard and intellectual property rights. It said this might enable it
to place a short-term design contract with Swans, postponing next Friday's
design-team redundancies.
After final talks in London ended in stalemate, joint receiver Mr Gordon
Horsfield said: 'The gap between us was too large to bridge and in these
circumstances no purpose could be served by continuing talks to sell the
business to Soffia/CMN.'
He said the receivers' next task was to discuss the implications with Swans'
remaining 660 employees. Price Waterhouse and union leaders will meet today.
Following the news of the failure of the sale, TUC general secretary Mr John
Monks last night wrote to Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, urging him
to give the government's support to Swan Hunter's fight for survival.
With a deadline of Friday for the dismissal of Swans' design and technical
team - a move which would end the company's prospects of tendering for more
work - Price Waterhouse is urgently reviewing other approaches made by
potential buyers during the 15 months of receivership to see whether any
offers a last hope of a going-concern sale.
If that cannot be achieved, the company's physical assets on both banks of
the Tyne and its intellectual property will be sold off piecemeal in the
coming months. The last vessel on Swans' order book,the Type 23 frigate
Richmond, will be completed in November. Mr Allen Donnelly, the Tyne and
Wear Euro-MP, said: 'The whole sad series of events reflects the UK
government's determined efforts to take Swan Hunter out of the defence
procurement industry.'
In the latest of several proposals made in recent months, CMN had offered
Pounds 5m for the assets, against an estimated break-up value of Pounds
7.2m.
But price was not the only sticking point: the unions and the receiver were
unhappy at CMN's proposals for the workforce, which faced lay-offs without
pay. After more than a year of talks, CMN, which proposed setting up a shelf
company to acquire Swans, had still not provided financial guarantees to
underpin the transaction.
Mr Peter Chapman, one of the union leaders, said last night: 'We're
disappointed we haven't got a conclusion, but while we're still working on
the last frigate we still have some time.'
Shipwright Mr Harry Cooper said: 'We're destined to die, everybody thinks
that now.'

FT  06 SEP 94 / Four universities in project for Pounds 60m Docklands campus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four universities have joined the London Docklands Development Corporation
in a consortium to build a Pounds 60m university campus in east London's
disused Royal Albert Docks.
The group, which also includes London East Training and Enterprise Council
and the Labour-controlled Newham council, has made a formal bid for Pounds
10m from the government's new single regeneration budget, which brings
together the urban regeneration budgets of a number of government
departments.
This is, the consortium says, its first and 'potentially most critical'
request for funds. If built, the project would provide a big impetus to
government plans for a development corridor east of London. The corporation
has already committed Pounds 4.1m to the project and is in discussions with
the Treasury over raising further funds via the private finance initiative.
London First, the co-ordinating body for private-sector investment in
London, is supporting the project.
Up to 5,000 students would be catered for by the campus, which would be
owned jointly by the Queen Mary and Westfield College, the University of
East London, City University and London Guildhall University. A new science
and technology park would adjoin the campus. Up to 2,000 jobs would be
created.
The University of East London said it hoped to start admitting students to
the new campus in 1996 or 1997, when it is hoped the first phase of teaching
facilities will be ready.
Mr Bob Pringle, an executive director of the corporation, said: 'The
institute will specialise in industry-related applied science and
technology, attracting hi-tech, high-value industries which will change the
economic profile of this part of Docklands and aid the regeneration of the
east Thames corridor.'
Once completed, the campus will be funded by the Department for Education,
although it hopes to raise private sector income.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Compulsory tests for 11-year-olds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
All 11-year-olds in England and Wales must take national curriculum tests
next year, education secretary Gillian Shephard announced yesterday.
But she also made a series of concessions designed to ensure that the tests
are not disrupted by a teachers' union boycott for the third year running.
National curriculum tests will now be compulsory for all children at the
ages of seven, 11 and 14.

FT  06 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Burmah Castrol
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that Burmah Castrol's lubricants business had matured were confounded
by yesterday's results. Skilful marketing and geographical expansion into
fast-growing markets helped the division achieve 24 per cent growth in
operating profits and an 8 per cent increase in sales. Margins were a
healthy 10 per cent - not bad for what was supposed to be a mature business.
Given lubricants' success, the continuing failure of the group's
diversification into speciality chemicals was all the more disappointing.
Synergies between lubricants and specialities have proved hard to discover.
Like other lumbering groups lured into the fast-moving speciality chemicals
business, Burmah has found decent margins hard to achieve. Despite massive
cost-cutting, the chemicals division's 5.8 per cent operating margins during
the half year to end-June are still worse than those in 1991 - just after
Burmah bought into the business. That compares with the 14 per cent achieved
by focused speciality groups such as Allied Colloids and Laporte.
Burmah should stick to what it does best - selling lubricants. Ideally, it
would divest its chemicals division. It could achieve a decent price as its
important continental customer base starts to recover. The worst scenario
would be if, once the chemicals businesses had benefited from the cyclical
upturn, the company compounded its error by making further acquisitions in
the sector. For the moment, management is thankfully stressing the need for
organic growth.

FT  06 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Airbus
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Transporting tanks and guns is not so different from carrying passengers and
freight, so there is logic in bringing the European Future Large Aircraft
project within the Airbus consortium. The move may also bring British
Aerospace some advantage in its campaign to persuade the UK government to
buy the FLA rather than Lockheed's rival Hercules transport aircraft. Airbus
has a track record of delivering aircraft on time and budget, which cannot
be said of most military aircraft programmes. If BAe can persuade the
government Airbus's good practices can be transferred to the FLA, that could
nudge the procurement decision in its favour.
Even so, Airbus's consortium structure is only a second-best option compared
with an integrated corporation on the lines of Boeing or the
soon-to-be-created Lockheed Martin. Airbus is still too wedded to
work-sharing arrangements under which many contracts are awarded in
proportion to the stakes held by its partners, so blunting its ability to
cut costs through competitive tendering. The FLA will follow a similar
model. Not only will BAe be cut out of the project if the UK fails to buy
the aircraft. It could even lose its position as supplier of Airbus wings to
Deutsche Aerospace. Plans to turn Airbus into a more straightforward company
have in the past foundered because of political sensitivities. But, with
competition in both military and civilian markets stepping up, its
cumbersome structure is looking increasingly like an expensive luxury.

FT  06 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Trouble brewing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision of Foster's to write down the value of its UK assets by
one-third calls for a stiff drink. In some respects Foster's is only
catching up with its peers. Its stake in the Inntrepreneur pubs venture has
been written down to a level already used by its partner Grand Metropolitan,
but the red ink in brewing underlines that the outlook on this side of the
business is as cloudy as ever. The inflow of cheap cross-channel lager has
only added to the wider problem of overcapacity.
Yet any lingering hopes among its competitors that the Courage subsidiary of
Foster's would be the first to crack and start closing capacity should be
dispelled by yesterday's figures. Its market share increased modestly last
year and, thanks to cost savings, the operating performance was respectable.
Excluding the impact of changes in excise duty and currency translation,
profits were flat. Since the wholesale price war has failed to produce clear
winners or losers, the question remains whether the big brewers will be
forced into a sober reassessment of strategy.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that the last two months have seen a pause in
pricing hostilities, but that could simply be a result of stronger beer
sales during the summer months. The long-term trend towards lower beer
consumption has not changed. If the autumn brings a seasonal decline in
sales, discounting could return with vengeance. It is difficult to see why
margins should improve until capacity is withdrawn, which makes Grand Met's
decision to sell its brewing interests to Courage three years ago look
increasingly well judged.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Video games turn nasty: The latest generation of TV toys,
launched in the UK this month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best part is when you run over the granny with a walker,' says Erick
Arnold, 14, eyes fixed on the TV screen, hands grasping the controller as he
races recklessly through city streets on a motorcycle in Road Rash, a hit
video game for the 'multiplayer system' made by US company 3DO that is being
launched in the UK this month.
Parents, and especially grandmothers, may not appreciate the humour, but 3DO
technology is a winner among 'selfish, single males', as one software
developer describes the target market. The latest generation of TV video
games has sharper graphics, higher-speed moving video sequences and better
sound quality than other game machines. The games are stored on CD-Roms,
rather than in cartridges.
There seem to be plenty of them around. World video game sales are expected
to top Dollars 9bn this year, with Nintendo and Sega, both of Japan, the
'mighty forces' in this world of Street Fighters, Fatal Fury and Killer
Instinct.
3DO charged on to the scene a year ago, like the bold champion in one of its
fighting games, vowing to banish the evil monsters that fragment the market
with different technical specifications and create a unifying global
standard for interactive multimedia. The company licenses 3DO technology to
hardware and software companies, which pay royalties to 3DO from sales of
their products.
Among 3DO's backers are Matsushita, the Japanese consumer electronics
manufacturer; AT&amp;T, the US communications company; Time Warner, the
publishing giant; and MCA, the entertainment group.
For a time, it seemed that 3DO was outgunned. Initial sales of the first 3DO
licensed product, Matsushita's Panasonic Multiplayer game machine, were
disappointing in the US. Heavily promoted software titles, such as a video
game based on the film Jurassic Park, arrived late and did not live up to
the hype that preceded them.
Over recent months, however, 3DO has been gaining momentum. 'We just had our
best month ever,' says Mr Trip Hawkins, founder and chief executive of 3DO.
Sales of the Panasonic game machine have reached a total of 200,000 -
boosted by strong sales in Japan - enough to attract the interest of some of
the best game software developers. Consumer electronics groups Sanyo of
Japan and Goldstar of Korea have announced plans to launch their versions of
3DO technology this autumn and Creative Technologies, the leading supplier
of sound cards for personal computers, has introduced an add-on circuit
board for personal computers that enables them to play 3DO games.
Now comes the UK launch. 'The big competitors are not as entrenched here,'
says Mr Bob Faber, 3DO senior vice-president of marketing and managing
director of the new UK operation.
He also sees an opportunity to build a broader market in the UK. Whereas
most American and Japanese players - or 'gamers' - are in their teens, the
UK has a strong 'adult gamers' market, he says, and even a growing band of
'second-generation 'gamers' whose fathers grew up playing Atari games in the
early 1980s'.
There is no doubt where the primary - and primal - interests of video game
developers lie. 'Your mission is to protect five teenage girls . . . ,' says
the commander of Night Trap, a 3DO interactive movie. 'If you don't have the
brains or the guts for this assignment, give the controls to somebody else.'
'An ancient clan with the power to transform into fearful monsters stands
poised to destroy itself for a goddess who will grant their every wish . . .
,' reads the introduction to Breath of Fire.
For now, 3DO has a technology edge over rivals, according to game
aficionados. 'The graphics and sound effects are much better,' says Erick, a
veteran player of Nintendo, Sega Genesis and personal computer games, 'and
the play action is faster than on the computer.'
But he says the 3DO player is too expensive, at about Dollars 500 in the US
and a list price of Pounds 399 in the UK. 'It would take forever to save up
for from a paper round (newspaper delivery round).' Sega's planned
introduction in the US this November of Genesis 32X, a Dollars 150 add-on
component for its Sega Genesis video game machines may close the performance
gap at a lower price. In the interests of research, however, Erick and
several of his friends did not object to spending many hours this summer
glued to the TV screen assessing the merits of 3DO games such as Road Rash,
in which motorbike riders kick and punch each other, mow down pedestrians
and plough into oncoming cars.
Crash &amp; Burn, a car race that would drive the authors of the Highway Code
crazy, and Shock Wave, in which players fight alien conquerors, also proved
popular. The latter is 'good fun, great sound effects and graphics', says
Erick.
3DO's goal of establishing a global standard for interactive multimedia,
including interactive TV, personal computers, video production as well as
video games may be similarly difficult to conquer. The fledgling company
will face bigger competitors at every turn.
Whether 3DO can move beyond video games will depend largely upon its ability
to attract 'gamers' in the next year. That may be challenge enough for a
young player in a big market.

Harry Ramsden's fish and chip restaurant has as many working class
credentials as Blackpool itself, so no surprise that it's proving popular
with the Trades Union Congress.
So popular is it that John Monks, TUC general secretary, made straight for
it when taking a late supper on the eve of the conference. Sad to relate,
Monks and Brendan Barber, his number two, were shown the door - because the
restaurant had closed.
Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, had managed
to squeeze in earlier. Scargill may no longer be a big fish in the union
pond; but he can still organise a plate of chips.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Observer: A banker explains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A couple of weeks ago Observer got a call for help from financial advisers
Pointon York. It wanted an English translation of a letter from the Bank of
Scotland giving notice that it had 'retrocessed, reponed and restored. . .'
There has been no shortage of suggestions from readers. Andrew Martell of
Wise Speke suggested that what the bank was trying to say was, 'here's what
we nicked from you'.
C. E. Fuller of ERF (Holdings) claimed the letter means that the bank had
found a way of charging you for something they did in the past, which you
did not know you had to pay for, and which they had not previously thought
of charging.
However, Viv Edwards of The Royal Bank of Scotland (who else?) came up with
the correct answer. The notice refers to an asset provided to the bank as
security. The English translation is 'you can have it back'.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Observer: Strike out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration has carefully avoided getting sucked into the
rancorous negotiations over the three week old strike that has shut down big
league baseball in the US. But one administration official is really
fretting: William B. Gould IV, chairman of the National Labor Relations
Board.
A certified Boston Red Sox fanatic, Gould has contributed almost as many
paeans to the Sox on the sports pages as he has penned scholarly articles on
labour law.
Indeed, given his background he would would seem to be just the person to
sort out the strike before it spills over into the 1995 season.
However, the NLRB can only get involved in unfair labour practice complaints
and in unionisation ballots. Still, Gould can take some comfort from the
fact that when play stopped last month his beloved Red Sox attained second
to bottom place in their division.
Perhaps Gould would do well to write the season off.

When Dugald Eadie stepped down as chairman of investment performance
consultancy WM Company in May, he professes to have been taken aback by the
flood of calls he received from fund managers eager to engage his services.
After years of scrutinising all that performance data, he was certainly in
an unusually good position to pick his new stable. So what precisely made
him take the call from Colin Day who chairs Henderson Pension Fund
Management?
Henderson is something of a fallen star in the industry, but Eadie says he
took to the idea of running HPFM for the highly non-technical reason that he
finds them such a congenial bunch of people. The man who started off as a
computer manager in stock broker Wood Mackenzie's back office adds that he
hopes he has identified what he terms 'a recovery situation'.
Yesterday the gamekeeper turned poacher was faxing WM's 40 top clients
apologising for his re-emergence as one of their competitors.
'There is a lot of secrecy surrounding performance in the industry,' he told
Observer. 'I may be able to help.' You bet . . .

FT  06 SEP 94 / Observer: A diplomat's diplomat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After months of coyness on the part of Anatoly Adamishin, it is official.
Russia's first deputy foreign minister is bound for London as the next
ambassador to the Court of St James, succeeding Boris Pankin who was first
told he would have to vacate the ambassadorial mansion almost a year ago.
A 37-year veteran of the foreign ministry, Adamishin has garnered much of
his considerable experience on the west European desk. He spent two long
spells in Rome, and professes his Italian to be better than his 'poor' (but
in reality fluent) English.
Highly respected within the diplomatic community, the new man also knows his
way around the newly-independent Soviet states. He was recently heard
lamenting the West's tendency to label as 'neo-imperialism' any Russian
attempts to promote stability round its borders. No doubt it is a point he
will hope to hammer home in his new posting.
Meanwhile, Pankin may feel a trifle aggrieved. As ambassador to Prague, he,
alone among the Soviet ambassadors, stood up publicly against the attempted
coup in August 1991. The post of foreign minister, given to him as reward
for his valour was soon lost, and the Anglophile's tenure in London has been
shorter than he would have wished. Perhaps the former journalist fancies
turning his hand to an informed account of the end of the Soviet foreign
ministry and the creation of its Russian counterpart.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Neither foes nor allies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chinese foreign minister describes his country's warming relationship
with Russia as 'neither confrontation nor political alliance'. His choice of
negatives is a remarkably honest assessment of the agreements signed in
Moscow at the weekend by Presidents Boris Yeltsin of Russia and Jiang Zemin
of China.
The agreements themselves, with the largely symbolic declaration that
neither side would target nuclear weapons at the other, are modest, designed
to tidy up the frontiers and clear up potential impediments to pragmatic
trade and co-operation. But they do mark another useful stage in the
Sino-Russian detente which has developed over the past decade.
Good relations between Russia's far east and the bordering north-eastern
provinces of China have become steadily more important in recent years as
Moscow and Beijing have decentralised their economies. Deprived of the goods
which used to be allocated by the central plan from distant European Russia,
the under-populated regions bordering Russia's Pacific coast have welcomed
the chance to buy cheap Chinese consumer goods in exchange for Siberian
timber, furs and raw materials.
The trade and other economic co-operation agreements signed at the weekend
reflect mutual recognition of the beneficial nature of these links. Putting
their trading relationship on a more formal and secure basis makes obvious
sense for both countries.
Mutual recrimination
For China, the concentration of economic growth on the coastal cities and
the south has left its three north-eastern provinces eager for growing
opportunities for trade across the Amur and Assuri rivers which form the
often contested borders between the Asian part of Russia and China. This
two-way trade, much of it on a private basis, rose sharply to over Dollars
7bn last year but has dropped significantly over the last few months. This
follows mutual recrimination over shoddy goods, rising criminality and
Russian security concerns over the presence of increasing numbers of Chinese
traders.
The search for a modus vivendi between the great communist powers was given
fresh impetus by Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. He, and after him Mr Yeltsin, ended
the strategic confrontation with Nato and toned down the ideological and
great power rivalry with China which for decades led to the stationing of
over 600,000 Soviet troops along the 6,640km Sino-Soviet border.
Sino-Russian detente has allowed both countries to devote more of their
resources to civilian purposes, although China has been far more successful
to date in creating new wealth than Russia which has been bogged down by the
immense difficulties of redirecting its militarised industries into more
productive use.
Military hardware
Given the difficulties of military conversion it is not surprising that
Moscow is looking harder at potential markets for military hardware. China,
with a much less sophisticated military industry and busily modernising its
armed forces, is a natural market for cheaper Russian arms whose sale will
be facilitated by the latest agreement.
On the other hand, the agreements do not bother to disguise the continuing
existence of long-term strategic rivalry between Russia, China and Japan in
the region. Much of Russia's Asian territory was conquered from the decaying
Chinese Empire in the 19th century. Many Russians fear that it is only a
question of time before a revitalised China, with over 100m people in the
three northern provinces alone, tries to win it back. To prevent this,
Russia needs to realise the economic potential and increase the population
of a vast region with only 7m inhabitants and vulnerable communications
along the Trans-Siberian railway. Above all Russia needs foreign capital to
develop its Siberian resources and is more likely to find it in Japan and
the US than China.
The latest agreement with China is a useful diplomatic achievement. But
Russia's long-term future as a prosperous part of the Pacific rim still
depends upon coming to agreement with Japan over the future of the four
disputed Kurile islands and creating the necessary legal and investment
framework for US and other investors to share in the development of Siberian
resources.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Setback, shaken and stirred: Experiences of recession have
led to changes in corporate Germany's strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recession's fleeting but brutal invasion of west Germany swept away
corporate profits and jobs on a dramatic scale. The engineering industry
alone last year lost DM7bn (Pounds 2.8bn) - DM3,500 for every employee. More
than a third of the 3m jobs created in the mid- to late-1980s have
disappeared since the onset of the slump in the final quarter of 1992.
Giants such as Daimler-Benz, the automotive and aerospace group, stumbled
into their worst losses in postwar history. Dynastic family concerns such as
the Kassbohrer group, which in exactly 100 years evolved from waggon-maker
to bus-builder to break-up candidate, were dismembered. Towns such as
Schweinfurt, home of the FAG Kugelfischer bearings group, tumbled from the
peaks of prosperity to unemployment troughs as their mainstay industries
crumpled.
In the nation at large, recession severely dented popular confidence in the
notion that 50 years of economic success and rising living standards
automatically guaranteed more of the same.
Yet, for all the corporate and personal distress, the outcome has not been
entirely negative. Now recovery has taken hold it is clear that the shock of
the precipitous crash from the 1991 peak of the post-unification spree has
shaken industry and stirred it into action against underlying structural and
competitive disadvantages. While recession created conditions which
highlighted structural weaknesses, it also sparked a concurrent national
debate which appears to have resulted in a broad consensus in favour of
change.
As Daimler chairman Mr Edzard Reuter admits, business found itself with an
opportunity to take speedy, radical actions 'which would not have been
possible in the past'.
The most compelling evidence so far for the existence of a consensus for
change has been the relatively friction-free acceptance of massive job cuts,
reductions in real wages and the loss of traditional employee benefits and
privileges.
These trends have marked a frontal assault on the most obvious and
most-discussed of Germany's competitive disadvantages: high labour costs.
Employers and unions, starting in the chemicals industry, agreed new
flexible work-time and pay structures which have started to improve unit
labour costs and machinery running times.
Although little post-recession data is yet ready, the scale of Germany's
disadvantages compared with competitors can be judged by 1992 measures,
which showed German factory plant was used for an average of 53 hours a week
 -the lowest in the European Union. Unit labour costs in the automotive
industry were about 40 per cent higher than those in France, Japan and the
US.
While a clear impression of the impact of last year's new labour agreements
will not emerge until 1995, promising indications emerged at the weekend
from the VCI chemicals industry association, which said average productivity
in the sector had risen by almost 11 per cent in the first half of this
year.
Meanwhile, the job cuts are continuing, maintaining downward pressure on
labour costs. Daimler, for example, said last week that a further 8,000
places are to go next year after 26,000 this year.
Employers continue to lay a large proportion of the blame for lost
competitiveness at the door of aggressive trade unions, but confessions of
past 'mistakes' and 'arrogance' by senior managers such as Mr Hilmar Kopper,
chairman of Deutsche Bank, reflect an unusual readiness within the
establishment to acknowledge that management, financial institutions and
politicians have made an even more telling contribution to Germany's
international disadvantages.
One such failing was the neglect of developing markets. Attempts are now
under way to correct that fault, particularly in Asia, where potential
demand for Germany's traditional industrial products is strongest. Against
the global trend, industry has relied doggedly on exports out of its
high-cost domestic factories, rather than establishing manufacturing
bridgeheads abroad. At the same time, industry has focused most foreign
investment and sales effort on virtually saturated markets in neighbouring
European countries.
The automotive industry, the country's leading foreign exchange earner, for
example, relies heavily on the west European car market which is expected to
expand only 1 or 2 per cent a year for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile,
Asia will generate 70 per cent of world market growth. Managers in broad
sweeps of German industry who looked askance at Volkswagen's former
chairman, Mr Carl Hahn, when he started investing in Chinese assembly plants
in the mid-1980s, are now clamouring to follow as VW continues to build its
market leadership in the People's Republic, with sales up 14 per cent in the
first half of 1994.
While it was not the only factor at work, the 1993 recession will also be
remembered as the catalyst which prompted Mercedes-Benz and BMW to break
with conservative tradition and set about building their first car
manufacturing plants in the US. Reacting to global health reforms, the big
three chemical groups, Bayer, BASF and Hoechst took up positions in the
fiercely contested international market for cheaper out-of-patent generic
drugs.
Such relatively radical changes have helped dispel German industry's
reputation for aversion to risk, complacency, tunnel vision and
leaden-footedness. But these failings are not the sole preserve of
management: they extend deep into the cultural and political structure.
Over-regulation at federal, Land and local government level militates
strongly against innovation. German planning procedures and system of
approvals for new factories and products, particularly in new technologies,
consume years of management time.
According to Mr Utz-Hellmuth Felcht, research director at Hoechst, the
catalogue of 2,000 laws and regulations governing the chemicals industry
sprawls over 16,000 sheets of paper. Bureaucracy has meant his attempts to
open a plant manufacturing genetically-engineered insulin near Frankfurt are
only now approaching success - eight years after the project started.
Raising public awareness of Germany's institutionalised bias against
innovative industries will be a long haul. For now, restoring the health of
the traditional industrial base remains in the forefront of management's
concerns. In the past few months recession has turned to recovery, and the
profits stream is flowing again. Last month the chemicals sector,
traditionally the first into and the first out of slump, published a swathe
of ebullient interim reports. BASF, for example, announced a 40 per cent
earnings boost.
But welcome as the recovery is, its effect on company earnings is less
vigorous than some in corporate and political lifewould have the world
believe. For example, BASF's earnings of DM680m on sales of DM22bn in the
six months to the end of June pale beside profits of DM2.2bn on DM24bn
turnover in the first half of 1989.
Moreover, though companies are clearly coming round, the apparent scale and
speed of the upswing is exaggerated by latest financial results which do not
include the huge provisions set aside last time for redundancy payments and
restructuring charges. Interim figures and accompanying statements from
company chairmen also betray the effects of ferocious international price
competition in export markets which have contributed most of the momentum to
the recovery so far.
There are no indications of any relaxation in competitive pressures, and
although the most dramatic of industry's restructuring measures have been
implemented or announced, the shake-out has some time to run before it can
be considered complete. The short 1993 recession marked only the starting
phase of repairs to structural flaws which took 50 years to develop.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Time to end the rail dispute
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The summer holiday period is ending without a settlement in Britain's
long-running rail dispute. Signal staff will strike on Thursday, the 13th
week of disruption on the rail network. No negotiations are under way over
their pay claim and further strikes are planned for the next two weeks.
There is little sign of a return to work by the overwhelming majority of
signal staff who continue to support their union, the RMT.
Railtrack, the state-owned company that runs British Rail's track and
signalling operations, continues to use supervisors, non-striking signalmen
and other qualified rail staff to provide services on strike days. It may
succeed in running more trains on Thursday than on previous strike days. But
the scope for further improvements is limited without a break in the
strikers' resolve. The stalemate looks set to continue.
Yet the strikes are in the interests of neither staff nor management. As in
any industrial dispute, business will have been lost to the railways. Some
passengers will continue to use the alternative forms of transport they have
adopted on strike days. Some freight customers will conclude that railways
can never be reliable where time is of the essence. RMT members will be
among the losers as a result.
By contrast, those who wish to see less spent on the railways will have been
heartened by the strikes. Commuters have been able to get to work on strike
days with less frequent services and few trains in the evenings. Towns and
villages served by marginal branch lines have suffered no visible loss from
the absence of trains. The case for subsidising the current level of rail
services has been weakened.
Privatisation challenge
The dispute will also make it much harder for the government to privatise
British Rail in the immediate future. The train operating companies have
lost millions of pounds by being unable to run services on strike days.
Their vulnerability to disruption at Railtrack has been underlined to
potential investors. And the more that train operators are indemnified
against such costs, the less attractive Railtrack will be to the private
sector. Opponents of privatisation such as the RMT will rejoice, but the
government has been foolish to allow the dispute to drag on.
The strikes cannot be allowed to continue into the autumn. Railtrack must
act now to bring the dispute to an end. If there is no agreement before the
end of September, signalmen stand to lose valuable pension rights when
British Rail's pension fund is divided between the successor rail companies.
They are therefore likely to be ready to end the dispute given sufficient
cause.
Flexible practices
Railtrack has already lost more than Pounds 100m because of the strikes. A
private business facing such losses would increase its pay offer by enough
to get the strikers back to work. This would be followed by restructuring to
recoup the cost, through improvements in efficiency. Individual contracts of
employment would be introduced, after giving the requisite notice and
consulting as necessary, to encourage more flexible practices.
Such an approach may no longer be an option, however. The government fears
that a higher offer - even if self-financing - would be seen as a defeat for
its public sector pay policy. Its intervention in the dispute almost
certainly means that this is true: higher pay claims would follow elsewhere
in the public sector where efficiency cannot be improved so easily.
That leaves the sort of strategy which a leaked letter last week indicated
that Railtrack appears to be considering. This involves inviting individual
signalmen to accept the offer on the table, sacking strikers and
re-employing those who wish to return on individual contracts. Such an
approach could cost Railtrack more than Pounds 16m in compensation for not
giving adequate notice of the change in working conditions. This would be
embarrassing, not least because it is three times the annual cost of
settling the RMT pay claim. However, it is a price that Railtrack - and the
government - may have to pay to end a strike that incompetence has allowed
to drag on for 13 weeks longer than was necessary.

</HEADLINE>

   From Mr R HALL

<TEXT>
Sir, Charles Jennings is in error in believing that reduced atmospheric
pressure increases the temperature at which water boils (Business Travel:
'The anatomy of a Club Class flight', August 29). As every schoolboy knows,
water boils at a temperature below 100'c when the ambient pressure is
reduced, thus making it difficult to get a good infusion of tea or boil
eggs.
Little wonder that employers are worried about the rise of scientific
illiteracy.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: No alternative to slowing consumption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr A R T KEMASANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The recipe prescribed by Ambassador Clayton Yeutter (' 'Gatting' the
greens', August 2), that nations 'become richer' first by letting their
middle class rip before worrying about environmental issues, is the
stock-in-trade of those who want to have the cake and eat it. Not only is it
erroneous, it also gives licence to the continuation of the ongoing
environmental plunder. This line of thought assumes that it is only the
middle class which cared about our environment. It makes no sense without
blotting out the historical fact that it is precisely as a result of the
'growth' of the (west's) middle class that we are now in this environmental
mess. Surely, plugging for more of the same, encouraging non-OECD peoples to
adopt a 'destroy first, rebuild later' mentality, is, to put it mildly,
irresponsible.
It is true that to tell non-OECD peoples not to consume the remaining
resources without substantially (note: I don't say 'fundamentally') changing
our pattern of consumption is like telling others not to eat the fruits left
in the common garden while we are not prepared even to slow down the rate at
which we gobble them up. It is just as hypocritical to talk of 'growth' and
'expansion' while professing concern about the environment.
If we are sincere, we have no alternative other than to do the complete
opposite: slow down our consumption rate. Then, we reason with non-OECD
peoples to preserve what is left of their resources.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Intriguing model for future of UK
unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER GORRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a practitioner in industrial relations for a global company, I am
familiar with Robert Taylor's reporting, scholarly work - eg, 'The Trade
Union Question in British Politics' - as well as his latest publication,
'The Future of Trade Unions', reviewed by Howard Davies, director general of
the Confederation of British Industry ('Bedrock trade unionism lives on',
September 1).
It seems to me that Mr Davies's industry bias skews his observations in
representing the author's position regarding the attitude of employers. A
specific quote in the review is 'He (Taylor) contrasts British employers'
'commitment to deregulated labour markets' with the attitude 'of their
European mainland counterparts who have a sense of social and ethical
responsibility for the well-being of their employees''. Mr Davies finds this
generalisation 'absurd and offensive'.
In context, the full quote is 'British employers' commitment to the
deregulated labour markets looks much firmer than that of their European
mainland counterparts who have a sense of social and ethical responsibility
for the well-being of their employees'. Certainly not an absurd observation,
and offensive to whom? In reality, transnational enterprises manage work
forces according to statutes of the member states in which they operate, and
the 'sense of responsibility' of businesses, as evidenced in northern
Europe, may be the result imposed by law rather than a higher social
consciousness.
In Robert Taylor's concluding chapter, notwithstanding his advocacy of the
union movement, he is pragmatic in writing a prescription for the future.
'The trade unions in this country have reached an important crossroads in
their history. They need to come off the back foot and take the initiative',
and he acknowledges that unions must add value 'to the success of the
enterprise in meeting the remorseless challenges posed to it by global
competition in the open market'. Pressures to increase shareholder value,
cyclical economic downturns, and the realities of alternative sources of
lower unit labour costs, combine to have an impact even on enterprises with
the most enlightened human resource programmes. Unions could well provide a
buffer between unilateral actions by the employer and employees' collective
best interests.
Although I do not completely agree with all of Taylor's analysis and
conclusions (for example, the role of unions in providing certain services
outside the workplace and great expectations from EU directives), I believe
he provides an intriguing model for the future. Clearly, any institution
would prefer to operate unencumbered by outside influence; better then for
business to develop a constructive partnership with a union than rely upon
intervention by the government or the courts in determining the employer's
relationship with the work force.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: No real argument for local government
change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Councillor RICK TILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I must respond to Councillor Mrs Duddy (Letters, August 30). The
current review of local government has been built on unsubstantiated
assertion. No evidence has been produced to demonstrate convincingly that
unitary local government is, per se, better than two-tier. There are many
examples of the unitary system not working.
Mrs Duddy says a unitary council in her area has the support of the business
community. Yet a Macclesfield Chamber of Commerce survey shows 43 per cent
of businesses want no change, compared with 33 per cent that want a unitary
Macclesfield Council.
Nor do the people of Macclesfield want change. In a new survey by the Harris
Research Centre 70 per cent of people in Macclesfield support 'no change'.
Perhaps more significantly 77 per cent of Macclesfield residents consider
that the present system of local government is successful, and only 13 per
cent think that change is definitely needed. As for the Local Government
Commission's two unitary options for Cheshire, no more than 6 or 7 per cent
of Macclesfield people support either of them.
According to the commission, change in Cheshire would cost Pounds 23m to
Pounds 29m; it could cost Pounds 2m more to run, and savings, 'if any',
might be Pounds 4m. These costings are highly speculative, as we know, and
there is every chance the costs of change will never be recovered. In the
Harris survey 80 per cent of people are not prepared to pay more either for
their local government services or to change to the system.
Finally, she describes the two-tier system as an 'anachronism'. Why, then,
do all European Union countries, except Luxembourg, have multi-tiered local
government?

FT  06 SEP 94 / No star to steer by
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heigh-ho, here we go. Summer fun is over for us all, not least President
Bill Clinton. Look at him with kind eyes. It is a sorry sight. His work is
nowhere near done, but he can hardly be enjoying it these days. Something is
going wrong. It is too soon to declare his presidency a failure, but it does
not seem, from the eastern side of the Atlantic, to be on the road to
glittering success.
According to the most recent Time/CNN canvass of public opinion, only 40 per
cent of respondents approve of the way Mr Clinton is handling his job. This,
we read, is the lowest such score in the past 40 years for any president at
the same stage of the game. Many of his policies receive respectable
indications of assent from the electorate at large, but the esteem attached
to his name is demonstrably low. Democratic candidates in the congressional
elections for which campaigning officially began yesterday have been advised
not to associate themselves with their national leader.
Some of Mr Clinton's misfortune is explicable by factors particular to
himself. The Whitewater investigation, an endless prying into the details of
land investments made long before he publicly aspired to the presidency, is
one such. The outcome may be inconclusive, or it may wholly exonerate Mr and
Mrs Clinton, but that is beside the point. The president is weakened by the
process. He has been further debilitated by the descent, almost to British
levels, of public speculation about his past private life.
A second cause of the president's difficulties is beyond his ability to
redress. The weakness of party discipline in the US legislature has long
been a matter of wonder to European parliamentarians. Democrats and
Republicans, whether senators or congressmen, owe their primary allegiance
to their local districts and their own careers; support for a president of
the same party comes after that. A popular president, espousing popular
policies, can overcome congressional obstruction, but Mr Clinton did not win
the necessarily overwhelming popular mandate, and consequently does not
command sufficient clout. He has achieved a crime bill, sort of, but his
star policy, a comprehensive health insurance scheme, looks bogged down.
Welfare reform, promised during the campaign, awaits progress on health.
These storms might have been better weathered if the president had convinced
the American people that he had an idea of where he was taking them. Perhaps
he did when he started, but the evidence suggests otherwise. His foreign
policy is inchoate, his domestic policy lamed, his strength of purpose
uncertain. His long hesitation on the brink of an invasion of Haiti is one
indication of his inherent wobbliness; his tailoring of his Cuban policy to
the niceties of Florida politics another.
Mr Clinton has had important successes: the North American Free Trade
Agreement, the Partnership for Peace strategy to enlarge Nato, the
completion (although not yet the congressional ratification) of the Uruguay
round of trade talks. None of them has been set in the context of a global
strategy. That is the trouble. By all accounts the president is a highly
intelligent man, a quick master of a brief, consultative, fascinated by
debate and policy detail. He is, however, possessed by the need to win
political points with every move he makes; he cannot, or will not, take the
risks leadership requires.
There is a double-edged lesson here for centre-left challengers everywhere.
As to campaigning, follow the president; as to running the country, don't.
Mr Tony Blair, the new leader of Britain's Labour party, has closely studied
Mr Clinton's 1992 campaign. The then governor of Arkansas spent several
years establishing himself as first among the 'new' Democrats. He worked at
bringing the party back from the hopeless left towards the political centre.
After the long Reagan-Bush years, he campaigned on strong themes calculated
to allay middle-class fears. He told people what they wanted to hear, smiled
a lot, was blessed by the intervention of Mr Ross Perot, and won.
Mr Blair plainly intends to do much the same. It is a proven
election-winning formula, which could, in spite of everything, deliver a
second term to Mr Clinton in 1996, not to mention a Labour victory in the
same year. It has done marvellously well for Mr Blair this summer: he
appears to be as popular as ice-cream. If he does not melt, he could become
the first Labour prime minister in nearly two decades.
The US formula does not, however, deliver anything of true value once the
votes are counted. I suspect - hope - Mr Blair is aware of this. It is not
worth winning an election if you do not have a clear purpose in doing so.
Labour thinking is naturally shaped by long contemplation of the causes of
the party's dismal record of electoral failure since 1979. The pitfalls to
avoid are often rehearsed. One, frequently referred to by the late Mr John
Smith and his then deputy leader, Mrs Margaret Beckett, was the production
of detailed policies. You must never do that, they said. The Conservatives
would cost them, distort the results, and throw the figures back in Labour's
face.
We will see how much of this obsession with past defeats governs the
thinking of Mr Blair when he speaks at Labour's annual conference next
month. His fixation must necessarily be with electoral victory, but he is
sophisticated enough to know that office is not all. For confirmation, he
has only to consider the case of Mr John Major. In spite of his
shortcomings, the prime minister has consistently steered by the light of
low inflation. He has also shown determination, and courage, in seeking
peace in Northern Ireland. If the latter be sealed, the two achievements
will be recognised by historians, if not necessarily rewarded by the voters.
The big conundrum remains unresolved. In what direction will Labour steer if
it wins? Never mind the details. Let us have just sufficient to assure us
that Britain's refreshed party of the centre-left is not to follow the
Clinton Democrats down the path to disappointment. Would Labour lapse into a
strategy of allowing a little bit more inflation, in the hope of faster
growth and more jobs? Would it seek to redistribute some income or wealth?
What would be its principal lodestar? If we are not to know, can we be sure
that the putative next prime minister does?

Sir, Rejoicing over the early retirement of Ros Hepplewhite ('Child Support

law. By convention, ministers are responsible, not civil servants or
ministerial appointees. This time they have conveniently passed the blame
on.
It is the flaws in the original legislation - and the directions given by
minister to the Child Support Agency - which has led to the problems and
consequent mess. Ms Hepplewhite may have gone, but the problems remain.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Costly slip of the tongue: Angus Foster on the resignation
of Brazil's finance minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's former finance minister who left the
government in April to contest next month's presidential elections, was
hoping a quiet September would help consolidate his lead in opinion polls.
He must be disappointed.
On Sunday his successor at the finance ministry, Mr Rubens Ricupero,
resigned after making embarrassing comments in an interview which was
transmitted by mistake on satellite TV. During the interview Mr Ricupero
suggested he, and the government, were using Brazil's latest anti-inflation
plan and its main component, a new currency, the Real, to help Mr Cardoso
win votes.
Many observers long suspected the plan had electoral as well as economic
objectives. But Mr Ricupero's admission of support for Mr Cardoso - which is
illegal under Brazilian laws restricting the state's role in elections - has
ignited the election campaign. Though attempts by Mr Cardoso's main
opponents to have him disqualified are unlikely to succeed, their threat of
a legal challenge has put his campaign on the defensive for the first time.
Until now, Mr Cardoso has had a strong opinion poll lead over Mr Luiz Inacio
Lula da Silva of the leftwing Workers Party (PT). A survey by polling agency
Datafolha, last week gave Mr Cardoso 45 per cent and Mr da Silva 23 per
cent. Mr Cardoso's advisers are still confident of victory. Mr Antonio
Carlos Magalhaes, one of his main backers, insisted on Brazilian radio:
'This won't upset the campaign. People want stability and that is what they
have with the Real plan.'
But Mr Ricupero's resignation has raised questions about the future
effectiveness of the Real. Not only has his departure created uncertainty at
an early stage of the new currency, but the political motives behind its
introduction have been exposed. In turn, that has led to questions about
whether the chances of Mr Cardoso's opponents have improved.
Mr Cardoso and Mr Ricupero have been the two men most closely associated
with the Real. The currency is part of an economic package which has been
praised by economists for its emphasis on spending restraint and a balanced
budget, rather than political objectives. Since the new currency was
introduced on July 1, the monthly inflation rate has fallen from 50 per cent
to about 5 per cent.
The Real's success so far has led to a rush of support for Mr Cardoso, who
was polling only 20 per cent before the currency's launch. For Brazilians,
the fall in inflation has made a big difference to life styles. When monthly
inflation was high, people spent their salaries immediately rather than see
their purchasing power fall daily. Once inflation dropped, they could plan
purchases, consume more or start to save. Mr Luiz Pedone, a political
scientist at the University of Brasilia, says: 'Among the poor, many
families have not had the chance to eat this well since 1986.'
But the good news that has flowed since the Real's introduction came to a
halt last week when the inflation figures for August did not show as steep
as fall as expected. Mainly for technical reasons connected with rent
increases, the rate of price increases in the four weeks to August was 5.46
per cent.
The figures prompted powerful unions such as the Sao Paulo metal workers to
call for immediate pay rises to make up for the impact of inflation on real
wages since the Real's launch. This is a threat for the government, since
pay rises could feed into higher prices.
The job of countering that threat falls to Mr Ciro Gomes, the governor of
the northern state of Ceara who succeeded Mr Ricupero as finance minister.
He is respected for his successful - and honest - governorship of Ceara. Mr
Gomes rushed to stress no policies would be changed.
But the switch of minister will lead to uncertainty. More damaging will be
Mr Ricupero's admission that he did not 'have any scruples' deciding when or
whether inflation indices were released according to his own advantage. In
his interview, Mr Ricupero also suggested some indices may have been
doctored by opponents of the government that work in the department which
gathers the figures.
Inflation figures are important in Brazil because until July they were used
regularly - usually each month - to adjust salaries, taxes and prices to
keep pace with inflation. The government hopes that under the Real, such
adjustments will be made only once a year - and has so far been largely
successful. The danger of Mr Ricupero's comments is that if they undermine
the credibility of the inflation indices, the private sector will
reintroduce regular adjustments, and Brazil's inflationary cycle could start
again.
The prospect of a rise in inflation would be damaging to Mr Cardoso, given
his close association with the Real. But the chances of a big pick up in
inflation before the October 3 contest is slim and many Brazilians,
including most of the 33m illiterate and semi-literate voters, may ignore
the weekend's incident. They may back Mr Cardoso because of the Real's
success so far, rather than its prospects.
But Mr Ricupero's admission of the government's support for Mr Cardoso have
been seized on by Mr da Silva and his Workers' Party. Alleging a wider
conspiracy between the government, business and media to elect Mr Cardoso,
they have questioned the 'ethics' of Mr Cardoso's campaign. This is a
promising theme for the opposition party because most Brazilians agree
former president Fernando Collor, who resigned amid corruption allegations
in 1992, won the 1989 election against Mr da Silva thanks to business and
media backing. If the opposition can persuade voters that Mr Cardoso is
being backed by the same alliance of interests, Mr da Silva's campaign would
be transformed.
The Workers' Party leader only needs to persuade some of Mr Cardoso's voters
to switch camp at this stage. Under Brazil's election rules, a candidate can
win outright in the first round only if he or she attracts more votes than
all their competitors combined. If not there will be a run-off between the
two leading candidates on November 15. According to last week's Datafolha
poll, Mr Cardoso has only a 6 per cent lead over his combined opposition,
scarcely a comfortable margin.
The events of the weekend may, therefore, force Mr Cardoso into fighting a
second contest. Though opinion polls taken last week suggest he would still
be the clear favourite to win, time might start to play against him. If the
government is unsuccessful in holding off wage claims and price increases in
the next few weeks, inflation may even start to rise and undermine voters'
confidence in Mr Cardoso.
Mr Cardoso spent yesterday calming his campaign workers and assuring them
his lead in the polls was safe. Even he would agree, however, that thanks to
Mr Ricupero, September will now be a nervous rather than tranquil month.

Sir, I have just seen Alan Clark's hilariously splenetic piece about my
Frustrate Their Knavish Tricks (Books, August 27/28), in which I am
presented as a kind of ageing and illiterate Dave Spart, whose extreme
leftwing views belong in the 1970s. The only puzzling thing is that the many
quotes-out-of-context in Lord Clark's article do not include my sole
reference to him. On the very first page of the book I describe the Tory
ex-minister as a former MP 'of indisputably blimpish proportions' who has
'written a book review backing a suggestion that Winston Churchill ruined
the country'.
But then again, he was probably right. If he had mentioned it, some
unsporting socialist bounder might have accused him of tit-for-tat
reviewing.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Arts: The chamber opens - Wigmore Hall season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Presumably the audience for chamber music just goes on holiday in the
summer. While the Wigmore Hall is closed, no other venue in London tries to
fill the gap and the opening of the new season on the first weekend of
September is greeted with pent-up enthusiasm.
Advance bookings are said to be healthy this year. A series of concerts
marking the tercentenary of Purcell's death (not strictly due until 1995) is
already heavily sold, suggesting that the Wigmore Hall might profit from
scheduling more early music. On its traditional territory of song recitals
it has again put together an impressive line-up of singers for its
International Festival of Song, which starts the season.
No favouritism was shown at the opening night. Four singers had been invited
to share the platform on Saturday, which is a clever way of making sure that
fewer important people feel slighted. Barbara Bonney, Anne Sofie von Otter,
Kurt Streit and Olaf Bar together for a light-hearted programme of vocal
quartets by Brahms and Schumann, including - inevitably - both sets of
Brahms's evergreen Liebeslieder-Walzer.
The singers came down from the Edinburgh Festival, where they had performed
the same programme as a late-night recital, which was recorded live by EMI.
Why the record company should choose the Usher Hall for its recording is a
mystery. The Wigmore offers a far more appropriate ambience for intimate
music like these drawing-room quartets and there was nothing but delight to
be had from hearing them there, sung by four such high-quality voices.
The quartet was perfectly balanced and admirably accompanied by Helmut
Deutsch and Bengt Forsberg. Bonney's tender cradling of the soprano solos
was particularly lovely.
It was a shame that the warm glow they left was so quickly doused with cold
water the following night. Christiane Oelze and Hans Peter Blochwitz
performed a substantial selection of songs from Wolf's Spanisches Liederbuch
and promptly disproved a theory gaining credence of late, namely that a good
voice and a native command of German are sufficient to guarantee a Lieder
singer who is worth hearing. Oelze and Blochwitz both have fine voices and
both are German, but their Wolf was as bland as could be.
Barely any song managed to pin down its central emotion with real
decisiveness, though when Oelze did start to lead the way and get a grip on
the more extrovert songs, the pianist Eric Schneider usually followed in
sympathy.
In this set of songs Wolf shows a remarkably sharp ability to probe pain and
anguish, of which these two singers seemed blissfully unaware. After 90
minutes of nice singing one came away feeling thoroughly anaesthetised.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Arts: Something stirs in the southern woods - William Packer
welcomes a new sculpture park on the Sussex Downs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
he idea of the Sculpture Park is not exactly new. Sculpture, after all, has
been an art of the out-of-doors since art began, and the principle that
contemporary work in particular may be shown to advantage in a sylvan or
rural setting is a modern commonplace. To think of the progress from the old
London County Council's pioneering shows in Battersea Park to the present
Sculpture Trails through Grizedale Forest and the Forest of Dean, and to the
Yorkshire Sculpture Park at Wakefield, is to make the point.
But that is not to say we have too much of a good thing. The Yorkshire
Sculpture Park may now be one of the most popular cultural attractions in
the entire north of England, but there is nothing yet of similar scope and
permanence in the south. Whether or not the Hat Hill Sculpture Foundation at
Goodwood will now supply the deficiency, we shall see. One swallow may not
make a summer, and one short inaugural season hardly achieves a policy, but
the initial commitment is nonetheless impressive, with Pounds 1m already
raised and more to come from public and private sources.
Wilfred and Jeannette Cass have been patrons and collectors of contemporary
art for many years. Needing more space, they bought Hat Hill Copse four
years ago, a modern house standing in some 20 acres of woodland on the
southern slopes of the Sussex Downs, close to Goodwood House. Their
foundation sprang from that move. It was set up in 1991 as a registered
charity. Now it has a newly-built education centre and gallery, a
state-of-the-art electronic archive, a resident curator. Rides and walks
have been cut through the forest, clearings cleared, sculptures begged,
borrowed or commissioned.
It is a brave undertaking indeed and, for the moment, beyond criticism. The
stated aims are unexceptionable - 'to promote the understanding, enjoyment
and development of contemporary sculpture; to support artists and designers;
to act as a catalyst and focus for siting sculpture in the open air.' We may
boggle a bit at the thought of the focused catalyst, or perhaps it is a
catalytic focus. A question or two are begged - does contemporary sculpture
really need such specially promoted understanding and enjoyment: such
focused siting? But it all boils down to Good Works, and good luck to them.
It looks very new, the paths still rather bright and unweathered, the turf
new-laid, the tracks and rides still a little stark. Nature will recruit
herself soon enough and, in a second season, all will seem long established.
But, in the copse's wilder parts, are not some of the set sites for
sculpture now just a little too well-cleared and fixed? We hear of these
grounds having been specially landscaped to the purpose, yet it is always
hard to get these things right first time. Just as in moving into a new
house, might it not have been wiser to leave the pattern of use to declare
itself by degrees over a year or two, as different shows and new works
reveal fresh aspects of the woods themselves?
Certainly, for the moment, the better sitings are either those in the older,
more open and formal parts of the garden - such as Nigel Hall's 'Soglio' - a
huge wedge and circle of rusted steel, or those more secret and discreet
within the woods. In this latter respect, William Turnbull's totemic 'Spade
Venus', Peter Randall-Page's carved limestone lumps, Andy Goldsworthy's
'Herd of Arches' that prances through the wood beside the path, and David
Nash's tall and black 'Charred Column', are all shown to particular
advantage. It is a profound irritation, by the way, that while a map, and
not the most accurate, is provided, the works themselves are neither
numbered nor labelled, which can confuse and frustrate even the most
experienced of visitors.
We are promised, in coming seasons, a programme of temporary exhibitions and
a changing display of particular works, as loans are replaced and sales
made. This first show consists of some 40 works by some 30 sculptors. There
is no theme to it, nor is it a survey in any real sense: rather it is simply
a slice cut from the larger cake, and none the worse for that. It offers
work across the full range of current activity, from the figurative to the
abstract, from carving and modelling to construction and assemblage, from
the symbolic and totemic to the minimal and the conceptual. Stephen Cox,
Phillip King, Paul Neagu, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Grenville Davey, Anthony
Caro, Michael Sandle, Bill Woodrow and Tony Cragg are among the established
sculptors represented. Less familiar artists, too, are given their chance,
while many distinguished names are conspicuously absent.
So be it, for the roll-call for once is not the point. The immediate purpose
of 'Sculpture at Goodwood' is to demonstrate an opportunity and propose
possibilities for the future. Mr and Mrs Cass are certainly to be
congratulated on their initiative, and their Hat Hill Sculpture Foundation
offered a real if cautious welcome.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Arts: Lucerne loosens its collar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Lucerne Festival has begun to shed some of its inhibitions.
Switzerland's premier music festival - famed for its well-heeled audiences,
its conservatism and predictability - is branching out into activities which
are less exclusive, more experimental.
The popular hit this summer has been a late-evening open-air spectacle, in
which audiences were taken round a theme-park of dance, mime and lighting
shows. There have been concerts of Swiss folk music and avant-garde jazz,
plus a modified version of the street music competition introduced two years
ago. The line-up also includes an improvisation concert, designed to turn
traditional concert ritual on its head, and an event in which the renowned
Swiss clown Dimitri assumes the role of conductor.
For many Swiss, all this has come as a pleasant shock. The festival has long
been identified with imported culture - a parade of top-class orchestras,
conductors and soloists from anywhere but Switzerland. Its traditional
public is rich and stuffy - the kind of people who wear evening dress for a
concert and pay SFr180 (Pounds 90) for a ticket. Locals have complained that
they feel excluded, that the festival has little relevance to Lucerne and
its people.
That has begun to change. True, this year's programme is as strong as ever
on expensive international stars, headed by Maurizio Pollini and Anne-
Sophie Mutter, the Berlin Philharmonic with Abbado and the Vienna
Philharmonic with Muti. Now there is a counterbalance - a series of
unconventional events which have captured the popular imagination.
The change has been engineered by Matthias Bamert, the Swiss conductor who
became festival director three years ago. Lucerne and Bamert looked an odd
couple. Bamert, 52, has spent most of his career outside Switzerland,
learning his craft under Stokowski and Szell in America, before emerging as
a leading interpreter of contemporary music in Europe. Since 1987 he has
lived in London, working regularly with British orchestras and winning
plaudits for his performances of British and French music. With his taste
for the off-beat and the new, he was the antithesis of what Lucerne stood
for.
But the two seem to get on well. Bamert began by pledging to maintain the
quality of the symphony concerts which underpin the festival's reputation.
This allayed any fears harboured by the Friends Organisation - a group of
300 wealthy individuals who pay an annual subscription of up to SFr8,000 for
priority booking. He has also proved a dab hand at fund-raising. Although
absent for most of the year, leading the peripatetic life of a conductor,
Bamert has increased sponsorship by five times. Privately-generated income
now accounts for 35 per cent of the festival's SFr8m budget. Public subsidy
is only 5 per cent. The rest comes from box-office.
Bamert argues that as long as the festival remains financially stable, he is
free to experiment. His aim, he says, is to make the festival less
predictable, and to give it a more local flavour. 'Predictability kills
curiosity. I don't want people to have a fixed idea of what the Lucerne
Festival is like. I want them to be constantly surprised.'
He is adamant that his festival should not be interchangeable with others.
'The way to make it distinctive is to reflect the colour and flavour of
Lucerne. That's why I want local people to be involved. A third of this
summer's performances are geared to the people of Lucerne, rather than the
international festival public. Only when everyone here feels 'festival
fever' will we have the vibrant festival I dream of.'
Bamert inherited a smooth-running organisation which catered well for a
particular public. Sceptics say there was no need to change a successful
formula, that Bamert's innovations are gimmicks which have no place at an
international festival. Change has involved risks. His theme-park spectacle
this summer generated publicity and goodwill - but if it had been rained
off, the event would have been a financial and artistic wash-out. He has
placed a huge amount of faith in local 'alternative' artistes.
Another gamble was to hand the opening concerts to a new festival orchestra,
made up of former members of the European Community and Gustav Mahler Youth
Orchestras. That paid off, thanks to the skill and enthusiasm of the
players, and the experience of conductors such as Kurt Sanderling and
Gennady Rozhdestvensky.
Bamert's challenge is to weld together the old and the new. His programme
theme this year - 'Forms of Interpretation' - was broad enough to embrace
just about everything. Finding equally versatile themes for next year and
beyond will test Bamert's lively imagination to the full.
The festival runs until Saturday. Box office: tel (41) 233080 fax (41)

FT  06 SEP 94 / Technology: Hand in hand - The barriers between
biotechnology and pharmaceuticals are gradually disappearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The technological distinction between biotechnology and pharmaceuticals has
become so nebulous that many people in the industry now differentiate simply
between large companies, mostly pharmaceuticals, and small companies, mostly
biotechnology groups.
Drug discovery methods in the two fields are merging to create a new
multi-faceted approach. 'Pharmaceuticals are starting to look at
biotechnology not as a different industry but as part of their industry,'
says Jeremy Levin, president of New York-based Cadus Pharmaceutical. 'And
biotechnology companies have realised that they have a lot to learn from
pharmaceutical companies in terms of drug discovery methods.'
The result is a hotch-potch of tools ranging from structure-based drug
design - crystallising and X-raying a molecule to come up with a computer
model - to robotic screening, using robots for high-speed random testing.
Pharmaceuticals are quickly adopting what were once considered biotechnology
methods. Bristol-Myers Squibb of New York, for instance, says it used
computer-based design, traditionally a biotechnology tool, to help it come
up with one of its best-sellers, the hypertension drug Capoten.
Biotechnology companies are becoming adept at traditional pharmaceutical
strengths such as chemistry. The boundaries between the two industries have
become so foggy that Chiron, a large Californian biotechnology company, is
now providing chemistry assistance in a joint venture with Syntex, a
neighbouring pharmaceutical group. 'We're doing the chemistry, Syntex the
biology,' says Walter Moos, vice-president of Chiron Technologies. 'That's
not the way it usually works, but it just shows you how weak the divisions
are these days.'
Until recently, many biotechnology companies scorned pharmaceuticals' old
method of random screening as nothing more than a game of chance.
Pharmaceutical companies test hundreds of thousands of compounds in a
laboratory until they achieve the desired chemical reaction.
Biotechnology companies believed they could find cures in a more direct
manner. Structure-based design - sometimes called rational drug design  -
allowed them to look at molecules in detail. The answer, many believed, was
to study the particular molecular site in the body where binding was
desired, and design a molecule to fit into it. Biotechnology companies hoped
to produce molecules like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, creating an exact match
in the right place.
The last few years have revealed weaknesses in the computer-based approach,
however. Determining the structure of a site is difficult. It often depends
on being able to turn a floppy protein molecule into a crystal for analysis.
But the structure the computer software predicts will fit into the structure
simply may not. Scientists often discover the model's weaknesses as soon as
they begin testing in the laboratory.
Even if the new molecule fits into a site, it may not lead to a cure,
especially for complex diseases such as cancer, arthritis or Aids. 'The idea
was that by targeting a single molecule, you could stop a disease,' says
Levin, 'but most illnesses are a lot more complicated than that.'
While scientists were coming to grips with the weaknesses of computer-based
design over the last few years, pharmaceuticals' traditional screening
methods were undergoing a renaissance. Sophisticated robotics, for instance,
mean that companies can now screen compounds far faster than previously.
'It's like gambling,' says Prabha Fernandes, vice-president of bio-molecular
screening at Bristol-Myers Squibb. 'The more you play, the better the
chances of getting a hit.'
Drug companies are also starting to adopt screening methods which bundle
dozens, even thousands, of compounds in a single test tube. Those that get
no reaction are immediately discarded, rapidly narrowing the field.
Although the screening methods are becoming more sophisticated, they are
increasingly viewed as just one tool in the drug discovery process.
Computer-based design may not be perfect, but it can provide scientists with
key leads in their search for the right molecule.
'What we're seeing is an interplay between screening and rational drug
design,' says Marilyn Hartig, head of external science and technology at
Bristol-Myers. 'The methods get worked and re-worked in a cycle until you
get the molecule you want.'
The biotechnology firm Procept, for example, uses structure-based design to
come up with a 'lead' - a clue as to what the right molecule will look like
 -then follows up with extensive screening. 'We define shape, size and
grooves and compare that to our existing database,' says James Jenson, the
group's chief scientist. 'Then we screen only the molecules we think have a
good chance of working.'
Biotechnology methods can also be used to help build up a 'library' of
molecules for screening. Lib-raries - databases of natural and synthetic
compounds that can be tested for effectiveness in treating certain diseases
 -are becoming a priority as screening regains ground. Pharmaceutical
companies usually hold libraries of hundreds of thousands of molecules.
Biotechnology companies are starting to catch up. Chiron, for instance,
claims its library now compares in size with that of many of the large
pharmaceutical groups.
The question remains whether the new multi-faceted approach to drug
discovery is just an interim step as the industry waits for structure-based
design methods to mature. 'Rational drug design is getting stronger and will
one day be able to stand alone,' predicts Peter Johnson, president of
southern California's Agouron, which relies heavily on computer-based
design, but has, over the last few years, boosted its screening
capabilities.
Meanwhile, the increasingly complementary drug discovery methods used by the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical groups will probably help stimulate more
collaborations between the two industries.
Non-technological distinctions between biotechnology and pharmaceutical
groups remain clear. Pharmaceuticals have the capital many biotechnology
companies desperately need. Biotechnology groups have the agility and
entrepreneurial attitudes of smaller companies. Both need each other, and
with each side crossing increasingly into the technological hemisphere of
the other, collaboration should become even more fruitful.

Colin Day, chairman of Henderson Pension Fund Management (HPFM) is a very
happy man, having secured the agreement of Dugald Eadie to join as managing
director of HPFM.
Eadie, 50 next month, is acknowledged as one of the leading international
figures in measuring investment performance, having been with the
Edinburgh-based Wood Mackenzie since 1968. He became a partner of the firm
in 1973.
Wood Mackenzie was acquired by Hill Samuel in 1984, whereupon the firm's
computer services business became a separate entity, known as WM Company,
with Eadie as its chairman. WM Company was in turn acquired by Bankers Trust
in 1987 for Pounds 9.8m.
In May this year it was reported that Eadie was standing down as chairman of
WM, but would continue as a non-executive director and senior consultant.
Eadie is a figure closely associated with the creation of the UK investment
performance measurement industry, as well as one of its leading exponents -
hence the jubilation of Colin Day at getting him to join HPFM from November
1.
The European Federation of of Financial Analysts' Societies (EFFAS) recently
appointed Eadie to establish a permanent commission on performance
measurement.
Eadie too is keen to start his new role, which will be much more of a
business development function.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Technology: Superhighway in need of a route - Geof
Wheelwright meets the man who coined the term 'cyberspace'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The technologists, politicians, and policy thinktanks have all had their say
on the information superhighway. Most agree that it will not only be a place
to work, but also to play. Films, books and music are all expected to become
widely accessible 'on-line' as the rush towards the information highway
becomes a traffic jam.
But what of the artists whose work is supposed to become a featured
attraction on this journey? Aside from the announced corporatist objectives
of movie moguls such as George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, little has been
heard from the artistic (creative) community.
A fresh perspective comes from William Gibson, the Vancouver-based author
who coined the term 'cyberspace' in the mid-1980s in his best-selling
science fiction novel Neuromancer.
Gibson says the whole notion of an information highway is misconceived. He
is firmly of the opinion that all the hoopla is nothing more than an attempt
by industry to sell us things we don't want and by governments to be
involved where they really aren't needed. 'My feeling is that it all
originates from an ad agency somewhere - which is basically the US
government,' he says wryly. 'The notion of an information highway is a bogus
metaphor - what they are offering is a lot more like a (shopping) mall.'
Gibson also believes that business people and politicians have no concept of
why the Internet - the best example yet of a so-called 'information highway'
in action - is such a success, with an estimated 30m users worldwide.
'The Internet is strange. It doesn't make any money. It is transnational,
beyond anyone's control. It is the great anarchist event,' says Gibson. 'If
what these guys (in governments and industry) are calling the information
highway is an infrastructure upgrade (to fibre-optic cabling and high-speed
switching systems) that's great.' But if they want to create a system that
is controlled and generates business 'it won't work,' he warns.
He doubts that the information highway will be commercially viable until
whatever is behind the growth of the Internet is better understood. 'Is it
an historical anomaly, or is there some inherent value in the technology
used to create it?' he asks rhetorically.
Gibson says that the mystery of the Internet's success is likely to prevent
it from being completely 'hijacked' by commercial interests. 'The commercial
interests are looking at this as a medium like television,' he notes. 'But
it is actually much more like a language than a traditional medium of
communication.'
Gibson says it is the universality of the Internet that makes it similar to
a language - it is open to everyone and used by all manner of people. This
universality is evident when you start browsing around the discussion areas
 -which include everything from pornography to religious fundamentalism to
topics in the news.
The Internet also provides the means to break down government-imposed
barriers. During the darkest days of the 1991 failed coup attempt against
Mikhail Gorbachev in the old Soviet Union, for example, it was the Internet
that provided an international route out for many messages about what was
really happening.
Despite its usefulness as a mechanism for free speech, Gibson says it is
still hard to define what anybody means when they talk about an information
highway. He suggests that the technology underlying any 'information
highway' is currently akin to the many mechanical devices designed in the
Victorian era to achieve cinema-like effects before the first really
effective uses of film technology arrived.
He adds that this is partly because the potential of the various converged
technologies is not really apparent until the convergence takes place - and
suggests that if you look back to the turn of the century and read the
Victorians' visions of what life would be like in 2000, you get some idea of
how the public fascination with the possibilities of emerging technologies
often outstrips any kind of realistic analysis of what the future might
hold.

FT  06 SEP 94 / People: Crawford relocates to Scottish Enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Enterprise, the development organisation for Scotland outside the
Highlands, has put most of its key operations into a single unit and made
Robert Crawford, below, its managing director.
Crawford, 43, is currently director of Locate in Scotland, Scotland's inward
investment agency.
The new unit, called the national operations group, will incorporate Locate
in Scotland, as well as Scottish Enterprise's Scottish and international
operations division, run by Bob Downes, and its business development
division under Russel Griggs. A new director will be sought for Locate in
Scotland.
The new group is being created by Crawford Beveridge, Scottish Enterprise's
chief executive, to integrate different parts of the organisation dealing
with businesses. While foreign companies wanting to set up plants in
Scotland deal with Locate in Scotland, those wanting to trade with Scottish
companies may go to Scottish Trade International, part of Scottish and
international operations.
Robert Crawford will now be in charge of a big chunk of Scottish
Enterprise's headquarters in Glasgow, though most of the organisation's
Pounds 450m budget is spent by the 13 local enterprise companies all over
southern Scotland.
He has had a successful three years running Locate in Scotland; prior to
that he was head of its operations in the US where he helped persuade Sun
Microsystems to locate its European plant in Scotland.
Crawford was educated at Strathclyde university and was then a Kennedy
scholar at Harvard.
After a spell as research officer for the Scottish National party he did a
PhD at Glasgow university, then spent a year with Citibank and three years
with the Fraser of Allander economic institute in Glasgow.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Technology: Heat of the moment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ceram Research, a consortium of ceramic manufacturers and electricity supply
companies, is testing kiln technology that will provide savings in energy,
time and spoilage.
In the UK alone the annual energy saving could amount to Pounds 12m,
according to Ruth Wroe of EA Technology, the company managing the project.
The potential savings in Europe would be about 10 times as much.
Microwave-assisted gas firing (MAGF) saves energy because microwaves heat
ceramic objects volumetrically (uniformly). Volumetric heating eliminates
the temperature stresses that occur as heat is conducted into the object
from the surface in a conventional kiln.
The absence of heat stress means temperatures can be raised much more
rapidly, reducing firing time. Even though microwaves are more expensive,
the energy cost (typically 8 per cent of the production cost) can be reduced
by up to 40 per cent, according to Wroe.
Ceramics do not absorb microwaves at low temperatures, so they cannot be
fired efficiently with microwaves alone. MAGF uses conventional gas firing
to raise the temperature to the point at which microwaves become effective.
It may be possible to add microwave assistance to conventional kilns.
The trials for the ceramic manufacturers include the construction of three
kilns. The largest will be a 15-metre tunnel kiln for large-scale trial
firings of consortium members' products. The first kiln has been
commissioned.
Consortium members will have the right to a non-exclusive royalty-free
licence to the MAGF technology. Non members will be able to license MAGF
later for a price at least three times that of consortium membership. The
list of consortium members is confidential, but Wroe says it includes about
half the leading UK ceramics companies.

FT  06 SEP 94 / People: Hampson powers onwards
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chris Hampson, former director of Imperial Chemical Industries, is to become
chairman of Yorkshire Electricity in the latest appointment of a relative
outsider to one of the power industry's top jobs.
He is taking over from John Tysoe, who steps down in October after nearly 30
years in electricity.
Hampson's appointment follows that of Sir Bob Reid, British Rail chairman,
as chair at London Electricity, and Nigel Rudd, chairman at conglomerate
Williams Holdings, as chairman at East Midlands Electricity.
Most chief executives at the 12 regional electricity companies have come up
through the ranks, but relative newcomers include Mike Hughes at Midlands
and John Devaney at Eastern. Hampson joined Yorkshire's board earlier this
year as a non-executive director, after a career with ICI including spells
in Canada and Australia.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Business and the Law: Warning note is sounded - The
implications of labels on computer keyboards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent decision by Compaq Computer of the US to put a health warning on
the keyboards of its personal computer products is expected to have a
significant impact on computer-related personal injury litigation worldwide.
Compaq's label draws users' attention to the risks of repetitive strain
injury (RSI) - an umbrella term for disorders with symptoms including
swelling and chronic pain in the hands, arms and shoulders. In the US, more
than 2,000 law suits have been filed against computer manufacturers by
individuals who claim to have been injured through using keyboards.
The UK and Australian courts are also handling numerous injury claims.
Unlike in the US, where employers are largely protected from liability for
workplace injuries by workers' compensation insurance, employers are the
primary target of litigation in countries such as the UK.
US lawyers say that Compaq, the world's largest personal computer
manufacturer, has started using the warning label to limit its liability to
future claims. However, Compaq's action may increase the vulnerability of
other computer makers, as well as employers, to injury claims.
The US version of Compaq's keyboard label reads: 'WARNING] To reduce risk of
serious injury to hands, wrists and other joints read the Safety &amp; Comfort
Guide.' The guide reinforces the message in even stronger terms: 'There may
be a risk of serious injuries from working at your computer workstation'
(Compaq's emphasis). It then gives guidelines on minimising the risk.
The warning 'represents an acknowledgment that there is an association
between keyboard use and injury', says Mr Arnold Lakind, a partner in the
New Jersey firm of Szaferman, Lakind, Blumstein, Watter and Blader, which is
representing about 200 plaintiffs in RSI complaints against computer
companies in the US.
Lawyers acting for people bringing RSI cases against employers in UK courts
also regard Compaq's statement as significant. They say it is the first
explicit admission by a manufacturer that the use of keyboards can be
dangerous.
According to Mr Lakind, Compaq's move is wise. The label 'will help Compaq
immensely because, to the extent that somebody uses the keyboard after the
warning, they may be assuming the risk of further injury. It is a very
positive move by Compaq.'
He points out, however, that Compaq's action may have repercussions for
other manufacturers. 'In several respects, Compaq's warning labels increase
the liability of other manufacturers that do not put labels on their
products.'
Compaq has demonstrated that there is an effective way to alert users to the
risks of keyboard use, says Mr Lakind. 'Other companies now have a greater
likelihood of being sued, because Compaq has shown that it is feasible to
warn users while other companies have declined to do so.'
Similarly, UK lawyers acting for insurers or employees say warning labels
will undermine the argument that employers are unaware of the dangers of
keyboard use, making it more difficult to defend against injury claims.
Mr David Scrutton of Kennedys, a law firm that often acts for insurance
companies, says that employers will be under increased pressure to abide by
the European health and safety directive which compels them to take a number
of precautions to avoid injuries to staff. 'Just plonking a computer on a
desk and relying on the manufacturer's warning will not be sufficient to
satisfy these regulations,' he says.
Claims by medical experts that there is no link between RSI and keyboards -
a feature in some cases currently before the courts - will now scarcely be
tenable, says Mr Peter Woods of London law firm Stephens Innocent.
Mr Tom Jones of Thompsons, an-other London firm, believes warning labels on
PCs will shift the direction of court cases. Rather than arguing about the
link between keyboards and RSI, they are likely to concentrate more on the
efforts undertaken by employers to protect their staff - a move that could
make litigation even more complex.
In what appears to have been a last-minute change prompted by legal
concerns, Compaq has said that the warning label on PCs sold in the UK and
Australia will be toned down. It will read: 'IMPORTANT NOTICE: For
comfortable and safe use please read the Safety and Comfort Guide.'
The purpose of this label and of the US one is the same, according to Compaq
 -to draw users' attention to the guide book, which will be the same
throughout the world. The different wording is a 'cultural' issue, the
company says.
The variation, however, also reflects the different legal climates. In the
UK and Australia, where employers have been sued, computer manufacturers
must balance concerns about liability with the interests of corporate
customers.
In the US, it is computer manufacturers which are being accused of failing
to warn customers about the alleged risks of injury. These cases will
revolve around the question of 'what the computer companies knew and when
they knew it', says Mr Lakind. To date, no damages have been awarded in
these product liability suits, although there are rumours of out-of-court
settlements.
Because there is no definitive scientific evidence linking keyboards to
injuries, other computer manufacturers have so far been reluctant to issue
warnings. 'A warning suggests that there is a problem with the product,'
says one official at IBM, the computer giant. IBM maintains that it is the
way that some people use the products, rather than an inherent feature of
keyboards, that can cause injuries. The company has no plans to put a
warning label on its keyboards.
However, Microsoft, the leading supplier of software for PCs, which is soon
to introduce its first keyboard, will put a warning label on the product, a
company official says. And members of the Center for Office Technology, a US
PC industry group that has focused on RSI problems, plan to meet this month
to reconsider the labelling issue.
The outcome of an RSI claim against IBM, due to go to trial in Rhode Island
next month, may determine whether warning labels become a standard feature
of PCs.
If they do, and the link between RSI and keyboards becomes more explicitly
acknowledged, it will be increasingly incumbent on employers worldwide to
provide safeguards against keyboard-related injuries.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): From 'must have' to 'nice
to have' - One man's way of reinvigorating sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You have developed a business on the back of one niche product. The business
has taken off but large competitors are catching up and sales growth is
levelling off. How do you reinvigorate sales? The answer is, with
difficulty.
One approach is to work with the existing product - push it into different
markets or develop it further. Another is to launch a new product for the
same customer base.
Martin Yates, managing director of Saladin, an information technology
company, had this problem and adopted the second approach but found it threw
up all sorts of unexpected challenges.
Saladin's original product was directed at the global oil trading markets
and provided traders with data consultancy services and software to
manipulate information. If you wanted to know the value of products that
could be refined from a Nigerian crude oil at any refinery - the so-called
net-back calculation - Saladin's service provided it.
Yates and his partners bought an early prototype and some software from the
Guinness Peat group where he was working as the ailing banking group cut
back its peripheral operations in 1986. With backing from a Gulf investor,
his team developed the product, launched it at the 1987 Institute of
Petroleum oil conference and soon after won an order from Exxon in New
Jersey.
From a standing start, Saladin found its Petroleum Analysis Work Station
took off, and before the company was walking it was setting up international
offices near its customers.
Then the momentum began to flag. 'Three years ago we realised we had
penetrated pretty deeply and we had to do something else,' says Yates.
'Each incremental sale was getting more difficult. As competition was
increasing, the challenge was how to get sales from Pounds 3m to Pounds 5m
and Pounds 15m.'
Yates recognised what dealers wanted was the same information in a Windows
environment and a way of pulling together on one screen different feeds from
diverse sources such as Reuters, Platts and Knight Ridder. But most of all
they wanted the manipulated historical data integrated with real-time
information.
The first problem was getting additional backing. The business was only
breaking even and Yates anticipated development costs could be as high as
Pounds 2m. Yates's original backer was not interested in growing the
company. Finally the investor was persuaded to sell to venture capitalists
including Advent UK and Geocapital.
Another problem was the development project itself. In order to bring in
fresh ideas - and to avoid taxing the management team's time - Yates brought
in an external information consultant on contract. But while he knew his
subject backwards, he trod on toes and put noses out of joint.
'He challenged the status quo, which was good,' says Yates. 'If we were
going to compete with Reuters and Telerate we needed something different.'
Taking on an outsider was 'a real flyer', Yates says. 'It created tremendous
turmoil. I did not realise the organisational and human problems that would
be caused by it.'
Saladin spent an amount equal to a quarter of its 1992 turnover developing
the new product. But inevitably, it was not able to develop the new Crusader
product without additional backing and further dilution for the founder
shareholders.
But Saladin did get its new product. Yates says the company will be
profitable this year and next year sales should rise to Pounds 7m, although
leads are only slowly turning into firm orders.
'The first product was certainly easier because there was a gap in the
market,' he says. 'The new product is not a 'must have' but a 'nice to
have'.'
Was there an alternative strategy, like not developing a new product? Yates
says no. Quite apart from technological change, which meant traders wanted
real-time information on Windows, Yates had no intention of managing a small
business that was not growing.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Expect the unexpected -
Hidden costs can mean the difference between success and failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN SONSINO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Starting a business is a dream for many people. But turning that dream into
profitable reality is much tougher than anyone ever admits.
The biggest difficulty for the new business is invisible: hidden costs.
These unexpected expenses cannot be budgeted for and can mean the difference
between survival and going under.
'None of the business advisers that I spoke to gave me any hint that huge
bills can suddenly be slapped on you,' says Christina Simons, managing
director of Simons Communications. She launched her Surrey-based public
relations company in February 1993 and won the Lloyds Bank Award for Best
Financially Controlled Business in Sutton in May 1994.
For Simons, cost control is critical, but hidden costs undermine that
control. 'With no idea of what you face in advance, there is no way you can
plan what you need precisely. You can't calculate your set-up costs
accurately.'
I launched a small company in 1993, the Journalism Training Centre, and
borrowed Pounds 20,000 from Barclays for computer equipment.
The bank was unable to tell me the precise cost of arranging the loan until
just before we signed the agreement. It turned out to be Pounds 300.
Another cost arose because the Loan Guarantee Scheme is available only for
companies with no security for the loan. So Barclays demanded I sign a
debenture, establishing a charge over my assets. For arranging the
debenture, the bank charged an additional Pounds 175. I challenged this cost
and it was eventually waived.
To discover the total expense forced on the centre over the past 18 months,
I analysed all of its set-up costs. Of the Pounds 80,000 spent equipping it,
I discovered that hidden costs accounted for a quarter - more than Pounds
20,000.
The largest hidden cost occurred when the centre moved into a three-storey
unit in a modern business park in Mitcham, Surrey. The Sun Alliance
insurance company demanded the installation of security equipment to protect
the computers.
A security consultant recommended extra door and window locks, as well as an
infra-red sensor system on all three floors. I was advised to mark all
electronic equipment indelibly and to install metal shutters on the ground
floor.
Another hidden security cost was revealed when the alarm was linked by
telephone line via a monitoring station to the police. British Telecom
charged Pounds 150 to install the line and Pounds 450 annual rental. This
was a surprise, and brought security costs to Pounds 5,400.
Office telecommunications also proved surprisingly expensive: eight lines
for the switchboard and a fax line cost Pounds 1,350. Visits by BT engineers
to check the system cost Pounds 25 each. The installation bill - excluding
switchboard, fax and handsets - amounted to Pounds 1,570.
While BT and other public utilities cost more than expected - extra power
points, for example, and inaccurate heating estimates amounted to further
costs of Pounds 3,825 - another hidden extra arose from our suppliers.
One of my colleagues says he is especially annoyed by the poor service most
suppliers provide. It always involves extra costs, he claims. Simons, too,
is angry over suppliers' service. 'However long suppliers say delivery or
installation will take, it always takes twice as long. And many of them foul
up.'
The worst suppliers in her experience are computer dealers and
telecommunications suppliers. 'BT cut us off by accident on our second day
of trading,' she says. 'It took me hours to sort out. And that's another
hidden cost - management time.'
The most costly supplier setback at the Journalism Training Centre was the
late delivery of a computer system. The hardware was delayed by nine days,
forcing me to borrow software and rent machines for the trainees. It cost
Pounds 2,100.
The software never arrived. I am now in dispute with the supplier. If you
are going to have to rely on a piece of equipment, be sure to allow extra
time for delivery.
What is disappointing is that so little of the small business literature,
and so few consultants, prepare the entrepreneur for hidden costs. Even with
the best of present advice, up to a fifth of all small businesses in the
area, the London Borough of Sutton, go out of business in their first year.
A third or more - 30 to 40 per cent - go down in the second year.
John Wren, former executive director of the Sutton Enterprise Agency, says:
'When I review any business plan I look to have a contingency figure in
there. People ask what it is for and I tell them: 'If I knew what it was
for, it wouldn't be a contingency.' There rarely is enough there to cover
the hidden costs.'
For many entrepreneurs, on the threshold of creating their business dream,
unexpected expenses can be a recurring nightmare.
To minimise these surprise extras, businesses can try to follow this
checklist:
Shop around for suppliers, but remember that a short-term gain from a cheap
supplier could be a long-term loss.
Cost control is an important key. Simons says: 'If it isn't vital for life
we don't buy it.' Get every detail of every deal with every supplier in
writing.
Before you launch a business, talk to someone who has already done it. Ask
what their hidden costs are.
Build in a contingency factor: add an extra 33 per cent to your most
accurate quote on everything.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Most companies flout
safety laws - In a nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Seventy per cent of UK companies admit they are not complying with health
and safety legislation 18 months after it came into force, according to
Eagle Star, one of the UK's largest employer's liability insurers.
Only 30 per cent of the 405 companies surveyed had fully implemented changes
required by the workplace safety regulations which came into effect in
January 1993. The activities covered were as varied as the use of visual
display screens and manual lifting of loads.
Eagle Star says companies are running the risk of prosecution and unlimited
fines. Moreover, accidents are costing employers 30m lost working days a
year.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Putting the marital home
on the line - In a nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Before you put your house on the line to obtain finance for the business,
tell your spouse. According to chartered accountants Moores Rowland, banks
are increasingly likely to insist that partners know the full extent of
their other half's commitments before agreeing overdrafts.
The concern follows the case of Barclays Bank v O'Brien. The House of Lords
has ruled that a charge the bank had on the marital home should be set aside
because it was felt the bank had failed to bring home to Mrs O'Brien the
risk which she ran by signing the documents.
Mrs O'Brien's husband had led her to believe the security was limited to
Pounds 60,000 and would be in place for only three weeks, says David Rogers,
Moores Rowland partner. When the overdraft reached Pounds 150,000 the bank
brought proceedings to enforce the charge.
The charge was set aside because the document Mrs O'Brien signed secured
finance to her husband's company in which she did not have an interest.

FT  06 SEP 94 / The British Association: Moser renews education plea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Claus Moser, whose presidential address to the British Association in
Swansea four years ago played an important part in pushing education up
Britain's political agenda, returned aggressively to the theme when this
year's conference opened yesterday.
Sir Claus, former head of the government statistical service and warden of
Wadham College, Oxford, called again for sweeping improvements in education
to achieve 'a thriving economy and a healthy and civilised society'.
His speech picked up several recommendations made last November by the
National Commission on Education, set up with charitable funding as a result
of the Swansea speech.
'The call for action now needs to be as strong as four years ago,' said Sir
Claus. 'We still have a long way to go to make this truly an educated nation
for the majority rather than for the privileged minority, let alone to keep
up with other nations.'
Sir Claus conceded there had been advances: a 'sea change' in public
attitudes to education, improved planning of the school curriculum, the
prime minister's 'apparent commitment to nursery education for all' and the
'refreshing and encouraging' approach by Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education
secretary, to the teaching profession.
On the negative side, Sir Claus pointed to the continuing increase in
primary school class sizes and 'the government's lonely position in
maintaining its support for A-levels in England and Wales as an educational
gold standard'. Economic history showed that gold standards were not worth
sticking to, he said.
His priorities for urgent action included:
More private funding of higher education, with an extended student-loan
system on Australian lines. 'The only alternatives to a shift towards
private funding are to stop expansion, which is evidently and rightly ruled
out, or further to reduce unit costs, which could have the most damaging
consequences,' he said.
A broader school curriculum to bridge vocational and academic education and
provide sixth-formers with a wider range of subjects. Sir Claus said
A-levels damaged science because they forced pupils interested in science
and the humanities to choose between them - and 'many are not prepared to
give up humanities, quite rightly in my view'.
An emergency programme of educational aid for Britain's most deprived areas.
Sir John Cassels, director of the National Commission on Education, said
renewed funding from the Paul Hamlyn Foundation would enable it to go on
working until May.
He said commission was studying the factors that made schools successful in
deprived areas.
'A lot of the reforms that have been good for schools in the leafy suburbs
have gone right over the heads of schools in some of the most deprived
areas,' Sir John said.

FT  06 SEP 94 / The British Association: Ill-health linked to low status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Low social status rather than the impact of poverty is the main reason poor
people do not live as long as the rich and become ill more often, the
association was told yesterday.
Professor Robert Evans, a health economist from the University of British
Columbia, used studies of monkeys living in captivity, free-living baboons
in East Africa and Whitehall civil servants to support his argument that
ill-health is caused by the stresses of social interaction between people -
or baboons - of different status.
Civil servants were divided into four categories of increasing social
status. Those in the upper echelons had longer life expectancy and lower
incidence of disease than those in the categories beneath them.
The baboons of the Serengeti showed a similar difference in health status
correlated with their position in the pecking order.
Reasons for the difference also emerged from measurements of stress-related
hormones (glucocorticoids) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) in blood
samples taken at different times after social contacts between males of
different status, he said.
Glucocorticoid levels were higher in males of low social status. Levels in
both groups peaked after encounters in which dominant males yawned at
low-status males - to show their teeth - while the low-status males were
eating or mating.
The higher glucocorticoid level in submissive baboons persisted long after
the encounter.
Long-term glucocorticoid elevation also caused increases in LDL, a risk
factor for heart attacks. High LDL levels were found in the blood of
low-status but not high-status males.
To measure glucocorticoid levels it was necessary to shoot the baboons with
anaesthetic darts to take blood. Although this could not be done with the
civil servants - nor is it likely that their superiors yawn at them while
they are mating - the measurement of their disease rates left little doubt
that the results would have been similar.
Prof Evans was speaking in a session on the challenges facing the National
Health Service. He argued that changes to the NHS could not remove the
inequality between rich and poor, because that difference does not result
from differences in treatment. The results from the civil servants
established that the inequality was not simply a difference between the well
off and the destitute.
Other speakers discussed how the internal market could improve healthcare in
the UK. The correlation between health and socio-economic status was first
systematically described 15 years ago in a report by Sir Douglas Black.

FT  06 SEP 94 / The British Association: Benefit cash claimants
'understated'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of people claiming welfare benefits is underestimated by at least
a third, according to a survey whose first results were released at the
British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Loughborough
yesterday.
The survey, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, shows that
people are moving in and out of jobs, family relationships and welfare
programmes much more quickly than in the past - and more quickly than social
scientists had previously realised.
Far more people depend on benefits to top up their incomes in the course of
a year than claim at any given time.
The underestimate of the coverage of welfare benefits is most acute for
couples and single people of working age; for example the number of families
with children receiving income support is 64 per cent more than the figure
implied by the official counts of monthly claimants.
Single parents and pensioners, on the other hand, have less tendency to move
on and off benefits.
'What strikes me is how important the welfare state remains,' Professor
David Rose of Essex University's Centre on Social Change, a survey
organiser, said. More and more middle class people were realising that they
were 'just one monthly pay packet away from income support'.
The survey is based on a random selection of 5,000 households containing
14,000 people, who are interviewed every autumn about their social and
economic circumstances. It started in 1991 and will continue to track the
same group for many years.
The purpose is to discover the dynamics of changing lives - information that
is impossible to extract accurately from government statistics and from
large one-off 'snapshot' surveys.
Many people in the survey experience large fluctuations in income. Fifteen
per cent of individuals experienced a growth in family income of more than a
third between 1991 and 1992 and 13 per cent suffered a fall of more than a
third in the same period. So more than a quarter saw a substantial change in
living standards within one year.
Changes in family composition - children being born or leaving home, couples
forming or splitting up - were the most important reason for large changes
in income.
But changes in employment also played an important role, particularly for
women. The proportion of women moving backwards and forwards between
full-time, part-time, short-term and no employment at all within the course
of a year doubled from 10 per cent in the 1960s to 20 per cent at present.
'People are coping with a great deal of turbulence in their everyday lives,'
said Professor Jonathan Gershuny, director of the British Household Panel
Survey at the University of Essex.

FT  06 SEP 94 / The British Association: Warning on acid rain campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Success in reducing the sort of industrial pollution that causes acid rain
would increase the rate of global warming through the greenhouse effect, the
British Association meeting heard.
Dr David Carson, director of the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and
Control at the UK Meteorological Office, said: 'It is now known that sulphur
dioxide emitted in industrial processes can lead to sulphate particles,
which reflect sunlight back to space and cool the surface - an effect
opposite to that of the greenhouse effect.'
Sulphur dioxide emissions - the main cause of acid rain - result from
burning sulphur containing coal and oil. Because acid rain does so much
damage, many countries are trying to reduce such emissions by switching to
low-sulphur fuels and installing sulphur-removing equipment in power
stations.
'If we reduce sulphur emissions now, we would expect a more rapid rise in
temperature than we have observed to date,' Dr Carson said.
He did not advocate an end to sulphur reduction programmes as a
countermeasure against global warming, but said it illustrated the complex
interplay between different types of pollution and the need to allow for
them when developing computer models of the climate.

FT  06 SEP 94 / The British Association: Contraceptives research urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An urgent scientific programme to develop safe and effective new
contraceptives is needed to support other initiatives to limit the world
population, Dr Anne McLaren, president of the British Association, said
yesterday.
Speaking at the association meeting, which coincides with the international
population conference in Cairo, Dr McLaren said 'all the present approaches
were developed a long time ago and they all present problems, even for women
in developed countries.
'There are all sorts of new approaches now, which are not being fully
exploited today because there is not enough money for research,' she said.
Drug companies were doing 'very little' research and development in this
area, said Dr McLaren, a distinguished geneticist who recently chaired a
World Health Organisation scientific committee on new contraceptives.
'One can understand that because they are interested in recovering the costs
of very expensive R&amp;D and making profits - and they are not going to get all
that much money back from contraceptives designed for the Third World,' she
said.
Promising approaches, according to Dr McLaren, include contraceptive
vaccines which prevent the newly fertilised embryo implanting in the womb,
and male contraceptives which reduce sperm counts to zero without affecting
sexual desire or potency.

FT  06 SEP 94 / The British Association: Drive to save wildlife 'would cost
Pounds 800m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arresting the extinction of species of wildlife in the UK would cost Pounds
800m, the price of a few miles of motorway, Professor Bob May of Oxford
University told the British Association yesterday.
He pointed out that most of the species that have existed on the planet are
already extinct - the difference is that in the past 100 years the rate of
extinctions has been 100 to 1,000 times as fast as it is in the fossil
record.
In Britain there have been some isolated successes, such as the
reintroduction of the red kite and the sea eagle. But many other species
were in danger of extinction.
Farmland birds such as the tree sparrow, the linnet and the partridge are in
precipitous decline, and a host of insects and invertebrates are vanishing
fast, he said.
Dr Jeremy Thomas of the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology told the conference
that if present trends continued, one third of the UK's butterfly species
would disappear within 50 years.
Prof May, one of the world's leading population biologists, said the main
species under threat in the UK were birds and invertebrates. Most of the
mammals remaining in Britain were safe from extinction, although most of the
really exciting ones which once lived in the UK - such as the wolf, the
beaver and the bear - had been extinct for hundreds of years.
Prof May said there were proposals to reintroduce wolves on the island of
Rum, in the Inner Hebrides, where there were enough free-living deer to
support a viable wolf population. Beavers, which would improve several
wetland habitats could be introduced on a much wider scale. However, at
present there were no definite plans to reintroduce either species.
According to Professor John Lawton of Imperial College in London, our
present nature reserves are 'too few, too isolated, and frequently too
poorly managed' to allow effective conservation. The decline in the
butterfly population is as severe in nature reserves as it is elsewhere.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Barclays recruits as it cuts jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Bank is facing staff shortages in spite of being in the middle of a
large-scale redundancy programme, and has been forced to recruit temporary
workers.
Half of the bank's 20 regions in the UK are recruiting workers on temporary
contracts of up to six months. One region is even asking for people who used
to work in its branches.
The magazine Personnel Management quotes a memo from an area headquarters
saying: 'The most likely candidates would preferably have worked for the
bank in the recent past (including those who left under the voluntary
redundancy programme).'
Barclays employs 66,000 people in the UK. Since 1991 it has reduced its
workforce by 18,500 and plans to shed a further 3,500 by the end of next
year.
The bank said the organisation was going through a period of unprecedented
change.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Canary Wharf faces TV claim
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Residents of London's Docklands have been given leave to take court action
against the owners of Canary Wharf on the grounds that the capital's tallest
office block interfered with their reception of television pictures for more
than two years.
Judge Richard Havery QC, a High Court official referee, ruled yesterday that
the Pounds 1.5m damages claim could go ahead.
He said individuals were entitled to have their rights to interference-free
viewing protected by the courts.
But he ordered that the full hearing of the residents' case be stayed to
give Canary Wharf Ltd the opportunity to appeal against yesterday's
decision.
The residents claim that the building of the 790ft tower caused the loss of
their television programmes between 1989 and 1992.
Ms Sally Moore, solicitor for the 680 residents who launched the action,
said the ruling superseded a 1965 court decision that television
interference was not an actionable nuisance because television was purely
for recreational purposes and was not important enough to have the
protection of the courts.
The court rejected an argument by Canary Wharf that the government's scheme
to encourage redevelopment in Docklands had provided a defence to the
residents' action.

FT  06 SEP 94 / AEA calls for new nuclear agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The creation of a single agency to manage the country's nuclear
'liabilities' was called for yesterday by the government division of the UK
Atomic Energy Authority.
The plan would help answer critics who argue there are too many
organisations within the industry providing similar services.
Liabilities are described in the submission as facilities approaching or
reaching the end of their useful life and where decommissioning costs exceed
future profits. These include Magnox reactors and fuel plants and the AEA's
research facilities.
Liabilities are handled by Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, the two
main generators, as well as BNFL, the reprocessing company, and the AEA.
In the presentation of the AEA government division's evidence to the
government's nuclear review, Mr Derek Pooley, chief executive, said a single
agency would cut costs for the taxpayer.
It would help the nuclear industry by freeing profitable plant for
commercial operation and more involvement by the private sector and create a
strong decommissioning industry to compete in world markets.
The submission also floats the idea of two agencies, each responsible for a
number of net liabilities. 'This option would enable government to compare
each agency's success and avoid possible misuse of monopoly powers.'
The government division, which manages the AEA's liabilities, says it could
provide the nucleus for the suggested agency but stresses that no
liabilities management organisation should operate or decommission plants
itself. Contractors should do it.
AEA's proposal to provide the nucleus for the single agency will be greeted
with scepticism from other companies in the sector. Estimates for AEA's
liabilities were recently doubled to Pounds 8bn.
There are doubts about the advisability of putting all liabilities under one
management on the grounds that if it made mistakes, the problems would be
greater.
The submission divides nuclear facilities into net liabilities and net
assets.
Assets would enable owners to cover the costs of decommissioning out of the
plant's income. Nuclear Electric's Sizewell B and advance gas-cooled reactor
generators and BNFL's Thorp are examples.
The submission says net asset facilities should remain part of the
commercial nuclear companies as candidates for privatisation but management
of net liability facilities 'needs to be clearly separated'.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Housebuilding rises despite slow market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Building of new houses increased early this summer in spite of a sluggish
housing market, figures published yesterday by the Environment Department
indicate.
These show that the number of new homes started by builders rose by 15 per
cent during the three months to the end of July compared with the
corresponding period last year.
Housing starts were also 1 per cent higher than during the previous three
months, said the department. Private-sector starts, although 13 per cent
higher than the corresponding period last year, were 2 per cent lower than
during the previous three months.
The number of private homes started by builders in the first seven months of
this year rose by 14 per cent to 91,200 compared with 79,800 at the same
stage last year.
New-house sales, although only about 10 per cent of the market, have
outperformed the general housing market this year, taking market share from
sales of existing houses and flats which have remained sluggish.
House prices as a result have barely moved. According to Halifax Building
Society they fell by 0.3 per cent during the 12 months to the end of August.
New house prices had risen by 2.6 per cent over the same period, the society
said.
Builders, which had become concerned at a dip in sales during June and July,
have recently reported a recovery in August. Persimmon, the country's
eighth-largest builder, last week said that its August sales were a quarter
higher than during the corresponding month last year.
Wilson Bowden, which yesterday announced a 46 per cent rise in operating
profits to Pounds 16.5m, said that it had seen a slight increase in August
but not to the same extent as other builders had reported.
Mr David Wilson, chairman and chief executive, said that new house prices,
after allowing for the removal of sales incentives and discounts, had risen
by about 3 per cent over the past 12 months. Sales traditionally rise in
September and October after the school holidays.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Credit card users make net repayment in July
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British consumers repaid a significant proportion of their credit card debts
in July, after borrowing heavily on their cards in June, official figures
showed yesterday.
The Central Statistical Office said there had been a seasonally adjusted net
repayment of Pounds 35m on bank credit cards registered with the Visa and
Mastercard system in July.
This net repayment marked a significant reversal from June, when net
borrowing on credit cards had unexpectedly surged to a record level of
Pounds 267m.
This repayment also contributed to a significant fall in net consumer
borrowing in July, the CSO said.
Net lending to consumers through finance house agreements, non-mortgage
building society loans and bank credit cards operating under Mastercard and
Visa - a collective measure known as the 'narrower coverage' - fell to
Pounds 296m in July.
This was sharply lower than in June, when net lending had reached the record
level of Pounds 683m. The figure was also lower than the City had expected,
and some analysts yesterday warned that the drop might indicate a slight
fall in the level of consumer spending.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at brokers DKB, said: 'My feeling is that
tax increases are affecting the economy and there is a slowdown in consumer
spending. Today's figures are just the latest sign of this.'
The net level of non-mortgage building society loans also fell to Pounds 7m
last month, down from Pounds 24m in June. Meanwhile, net lending by finance
houses - a category which includes car loans and in-store retail loans -
fell to Pounds 324m, down from Pounds 392m in June, but higher than levels
seen in April and May.
Nevertheless, other analysts argued that the fall was distorted by a record
level of consumer borrowing in the previous month, and insisted that the
underlying trend remained relatively strong.
Measured on a three monthly basis - a figure which is a better guide to the
trend than the volatile monthly data - total consumer borrowing was Pounds
1.19bn in the three months to July. This was fractionally below the level of
lending in the three months to April, when consumers borrowed Pounds 1.28bn,
but well above the levels of lending seen at the same point last year.
Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist at Nomura, said: 'There is nothing in these
figures to suggest that consumer spending is slowing. Consumers are
borrowing as much now in nominal terms as they did in the 1980s boom.'
Measured in terms of new consumer lending, the data showed that the level of
new credit advanced in the month fell in all categories last month. New
lending on credit cards was Pounds 2.81bn, down from Pounds 2.99bn in June,
while new borrowing through finance houses was Pounds 1.86bn in July, down
from Pounds 1.95bn in June.
Measured in terms of the broad credit coverage - a measure which also
includes loans on all credit cards, personal accounts, non-bank credit
sources, insurance companies and retailers - the data showed that net
lending rose to Pounds 1.36bn in the three months to June, compared with
Pounds 872m in the three months to March.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Mortgage figures highlight uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The uncertainty over the recovery in the mortgage market was highlighted
yesterday with the publication of seasonally adjusted figures showing new
gross and net mortgage lending in July lower than in June.
Figures released by the Bank of England painted a similarly bleak picture
for new loans approved - which are seen as an important forward indicator as
they are reflected in lending undertaken in the following few weeks. The
approvals in July fell compared with approvals in June.
However, the monthly statistics - which include banks, building societies
and centralised lenders operating through intermediaries rather than through
branch networks - did suggest some slight advance over the position last
summer.
New gross lending in July totalled Pounds 4.54bn, some 3.5 per cent lower
than the Pounds 4.71bn undertaken in June, though just higher than the
Pounds 4.57bn carried out in July last year.
New net lending - which deducts from the gross lending the loans redeemed by
the borrowers - came to Pounds 1.52bn in July, compared with Pounds 1.79bn
in June and Pounds 1.37bn in July 1993.
Within the generally flat levels of lending, the figures also reveal a
strengthening of building societies' market share at the expense of banks.
Last summer the banks were competing aggressively in the market,
particularly with fixed-rate mortgages.
But societies have since been regaining market share, both through their own
fixed-rate loans and, more recently, through ranges of 'cashback' offers and
discounted variable rate mortgages.
Within the overall figure of 79,000 loans approved to a value of Pounds
4.32bn in July, societies accounted for 49,000 and Pounds 2.89bn of the
total. In terms of values of loans approved, societies have increased their
market share by almost 15 per cent from the Pounds 2.52bn they accounted for
in July last year.
In the same month, they accounted for 45,000 of the total 79,000 loans
approved.
The totals for loans approved in July this year are both lower than the
comparable figures of 84,000 and Pounds 4.92bn for June.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Aitken targets housing benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Housing benefit will be at the centre of government cost-cutting in the
autumn public spending round, Mr Jonathan Aitken, Treasury chief secretary,
signalled yesterday.
Mr Aitken, a rightwinger who replaced Mr Michael Portillo in the summer
cabinet reshuffle, identified the Pounds 80bn social security budget as the
key target for cuts.
'There are areas such as the exponential growth in housing benefit where you
have to look very carefully to make sure taxpayers' money is not being
wasted,' he said.
Mr Aitken said that 'quite a lot' of housing benefit recipients were 'living
in houses that are too big for them' or had spare rooms.
He also accused landlords of 'pushing up' private-sector rents to exploit
the level of housing benefit payments.
Mr Aitken also told the BBC in a radio interview that the Pounds 15bn
running costs of Whitehall were a key target for efficiency savings.
'If you look hard at back-office expenses in the light of best business
techniques and in the light of bringing in private finance, we can make some
substantial expenditure cuts,' he said.
Mr Aitken's comments suggest the Treasury is pressing Mr Peter Lilley,
social security secretary, to aim housing benefit more accurately at
low-income families.
The cost of housing benefit has grown from Pounds 3.75bn in 1988-89 to an
estimated Pounds 8.5bn last year.
The Treasury forecasts a figure of nearly Pounds 11bn by 1995-96 on current
trends.
Labour said the increased cost was caused by unemployment and low pay,
combined with big increases in local authority and housing association
rents.
Ms Harriet Harman, the shadow chief secretary, accused the government of
'threatening' housing benefit recipients to cover its failure to reduce
public spending as a proportion of gross domestic product.
In a policy paper published in response to Mr Aitken's comments, Labour said
that social security costs had increased by Pounds 17.5bn in real terms over
the last five years.
'This staggering increase is the price we are all paying, in the form of
higher taxes, for the recession and the government's economic incompetence,'
the paper said.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, said Mr Aitken's
'prescription of hounding the vulnerable is a sickening reminder that the
rightwing is alive and kicking.'

FT  06 SEP 94 / Tories face accusation on rail strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, last night accused the
Conservatives of wanting to keep the rail strike going until their party
conference next month.
Addressing a fringe meeting at the Trades Union Congress in Blackpool, Mr
Prescott supported the demands of the RMT and said the government wanted to
use unions 'as whipping boys for what is wrong with the economy'.
Significant numbers of British Rail staff have been recruited to help
Railtrack managers and supervisors keep over half the network open during
Thursday's 24-hour stoppage by signal workers. Two members of BR's staff
helped in signal boxes last week - the first time BR had intervened in the
13-week conflict.
Railtrack said that more than half of services would be running on Thursday,
the highest proportion so far, and that it would provide a full service
between London and Bristol for the first time during the conflict.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, leader of the RMT transport union, displayed his anger at
BR's co-operation with Railtrack by boycotting a planned dinner last night
with BR.
However, he said BR was exaggerating the effect of what he called its
'secondary action'. He said he did not believe there were enough BR staff
with experience to make a real impact on signalling operations.
Mr Knapp said that commentators should not be surprised that the travelling
public were supporting the signal workers. 'Many members of the public,
especially the south-east commuters, know what it is like to be badly
treated by the railways,' he added. 'But more generally many of them know
what it is like to be treated badly at work.'
In a resolution to be debated on Thursday, the RMT - backed by Aslef, the
train drivers' union - calls on the TUC to organise a national demonstration
in London in support of the signal workers.
The motion says there 'must be a negotiated settlement to the dispute and
calls on Railtrack to return to the negotiating table immediately'.
Mr Prescott's speech increased pressure on Labour leader Tony Blair to
support unequivocally the signal workers' cause, after a number of his
parliamentary colleagues supported the RMT.
Shadow employment secretary Ms Ann Clywd called on Railtrack chairman Mr
Robert Horton to resign to settle the dispute.
'He is the Eddie the Eagle of big business - incompetent, graceless and
doomed to be remembered as a sick joke,' she told a TUC rally.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Employer moves attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly half of all employers who derecognised unions between 1987 and 1990
introduced no new employee involvement initiatives during that time, says a
report on human resource management published yesterday by the TUC.
The report stresses that unions are broadly in favour of the principles
underlying human resource management - treating workers as assets rather
than factors of production and developing a wide range of communication
systems - and that there is no necessary link between it and anti-unionism.
The report says: 'The more anti-union the employer, the less likely it is
that HRM techniques will be used.'
The report shows that workplaces which recognise unions are likely to have
more channels of communication, more opportunities for staff to influence
their working lives and as much likelihood of having financial participation
schemes as non-unionised workplaces. But Ms Bernadette Hillon, of the
shopworkers' union Usdaw, said that some hostile employers are using human
resource management as a smokescreen for an anti-union strategy. Mr John
Monks, TUC general secretary, singled out the printing and publishing
industries for criticism in the latest issue of the Personnel Management
magazine.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Broadcasters discuss plans for digital TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC, Channel 4 and ITV representatives are working on plans for digital
terrestrial television in the UK.
Exploratory meetings have been held between the broadcasting organisations,
and more are planned.
A key stage in the process, however, is to agree on a European standard for
digital terrestrial television.
The Digital Video Broadcasting project, which brings together 140
broadcasting organisations and manufacturers, has already produced standards
for digital satellite cable and is working on an agreed standard for digital
terrestrial TV.
The new system would have up to 16 new channels and would use digital rather
than existing analogue technology, but would be broadcast from normal land
transmitters.
The clearest hint that the BBC was interested in developing digital
terrestrial services came in July in the white paper on the future of the
corporation.
The document, taking its cue from the BBC, said the corporation intends to
start experimental digital terrestrial services next year.
It would hold talks with equipment manufacturers on the availability of
receivers and invest in equipment to produce programmes in wide-screen
format.
'It would aim to launch digital services, which could be received in
wide-screen or conventional format, by the autumn of 1997,' the white paper
said.
The BBC is conducting a feasibility study on digital terrestrial and will
take into account the plans of Britain's other broadcasters.
In July the government outlined its decision on the future of Channel 5 - a
compromise that set limits to the reach of a conventional Channel 5 in order
to retain enough frequencies for the eventual launch of digital services.
The existing broadcasters, including the operator of a Channel 5, would get
a digital channel to match each of their existing channels.
This would be for 'simulcasting' so that no one would be deprived of
service. Broadcasters such as the BBC hope they would also get additional
channels to launch new services.
Mr Stephen Castell, a communications consultant, says he intends to bid for
a Channel 5 licence to provide a digital multi-channel service.
Mr Castell is not backed by any of the large groups, which are planning to
operate a conventional analogue Channel 5. Instead he is promoting the idea
of 'owner-viewers' who would invest in his company, Channel 5 Digital
Television, and get a free receiver and discounted access to premium
channels.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Ashdown aims conference to bolster broad appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, is seeking a formula
which will help his party demonstrate its ability to remain a distinctive
political force when it opens the party conference season at Brighton on
September 18.
Appearances by Sir Brian Nicholson, president of the CBI, and Mr John Monks,
general secretary of the TUC, at fringe meetings will help bolster the
party's claim to have a broader appeal than either the Conservatives or
Labour.
But Mr Ashdown is still at odds with some of the senior figures in the
party, including Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, the Liberal Democrat leader in
the Lords, over the desirability of publicly emphasising its readiness to
co-operate with Mr Tony Blair's new-look Labour party.
The difficulties Mr Ashdown faces in staking out the ground on which the
party can exert a dominant influence in the run-up to the next general
election were played down when the conference agenda was published
yesterday.
Party managers want the conference to focus on successes at local government
level and in parliamentary by-elections, which increased the number of
Liberal Democrat MPs in the Commons to 23.
Mr Charles Kennedy, the party president, insisted yesterday that these
outweighed the party's disappointing showing in having only two MPs elected
to the European parliament in June.
Demands for the repeal of the financial services act and the establishment
of a powerful regulatory body to oversee the operation of financial
institutions are also made. Mr Jeremy Hanley, chairman of the Conservative
party, said the Liberal Democrats were showing their 'true colours'in
agreeing to debate the abolition of the monarchy.
He stressed that this followed publication of a 'punitive taxation policy'.
Mr Hanley said: 'How those who voted Liberal Democrat at recent by-elections
must feel cheated and betrayed by what portrays itself as a moderate party
but is in reality more socialist than the socialists.'

FT  06 SEP 94 / Leadership tries to stop debate on IRA motion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The TUC leadership was last night trying to prevent a debate over the IRA
ceasefire which it thinks might appear to give support to the terrorist
organisation.
The National Union of Journalists wants to move an emergency motion that
says it 'welcomes' the IRA's declaration of a 'complete cessation of
military operations'.
TUC leaders oppose this, pointing out that the words go much further than
any motion passed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the Irish
Republic.
The NCU communications union and construction union Ucatt have proposed
motions on Ireland that fall short of the NUJ's explicit welcome.
Congress organisers have told the three unions to try to work out a
composite motion for debate on Thursday, but they oppose any wording that
would appear to give open support to the IRA position.
Union leaders in the UK have always been sensitive about the impact of the
Irish troubles on members. They have both Protestants and Catholics in their
Northern Ireland branches and unions in Northern Ireland have managed to
stay free of sectarian conflict.
Mr John Foster, NUJ general secretary, denied last night that his union's
motion in any way suggested support for the IRA. He pointed out that the
union had always sought to avoid taking any position that would put its
media members in Northern Ireland at risk.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Calor workers ballot on action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Workers at Calor Gas, the gas products company, are holding a strike ballot
over the introduction of personal contracts and pay cuts for some staff of
up to Pounds 100 a week.
The TGWU general union is balloting 370 drivers, filling-plant operators and
distribution workers at the company and an additional 50 drivers working for
Calor Transport, the contract transport division.
The dispute arose, the union said, when the management proposed earlier this
year to cancel the collective agreement for manual employees and replace it
with personal contracts. At about the same time, drivers in the transport
division were asked to accept a new agreement that would in effect cost them
between Pounds 90 and Pounds 100 a week in pay.
Calor said yesterday that the contracts and drivers' pay situations were
separate, but that the union had chosen to lump them together.
Mr Danny Bryan, national secretary for the TGWU commercial transport group,
said that the union had previously had good industrial relations with Calor.
'Many of the people here have long service records with the company and
can't understand why it is seeking to change things now,' he said.
Calor said that it wanted to put employees on a salaried footing. Mr David
McKinlay, communications manager, said: 'We are not wanting to derecognise
the union. All we want to do is talk about pay and conditions with the
individuals concerned.'
The union is opposing the new contracts because they will make pay rises
subject to personal assessments and introduce a new method of calculating
pay.
Mr McKinlay said nearly half the manual employees who had been offered
individual contracts had accepted them.
The pay reduction for drivers, he said, reflected a downturn in the road
haulage market. The result of the ballot is expected later this week.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Blair to pick spokesman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair is planning to appoint a high-profile media spokesman to beef
up Labour's public relations team as he tightens his grip on the party's
policies and organisation.
The appointment follows the announcement that Mr Larry Whitty, Labour's
general secretary for nine years, is to take up a new post as the party's
European co-ordinator.
It marks a break with the restrained approach of the late John Smith, the
former Labour leader, who left media relations largely to the party
headquarters' press office.
The last Labour leader to have a personal media spokesman was Mr Neil
Kinnock, who resigned in 1992.
Mr Blair is said to believe that a spokesman appointed specifically to relay
his views on current issues will help sharpen Labour's image in the run-up
to the next election.
The division of responsibilities will also allow the headquarters' public
relations machine, headed by Mr David Hill, to concentrate on policy issues
and planning campaigns.
Mr Blair is understood to have approached several prominent journalists with
Labour sympathies since his election as leader in July, and an announcement
is expected shortly.
The appointment is part of Mr Blair's attempt to refocus Labour's
organisational machine on campaigning, communications and rebuilding the
party's declining membership. The party has gained several thousand new
members since Mr Blair's election as leader in July.
Mr Whitty is expected to be replaced by Mr Tom Sawyer, a senior official of
Unison, the public sector union, and a long-standing ally of Mr Blair.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Britannia improves pay offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The threat of strike action at Britannia Airways, the UK's second largest
airline, was receding last night after the company improved its pay offer to
cabin staff.
The 1,000 cabin staff, members of the British Airlines Stewards and
Stewardesses Association, part of the TGWU transport union, had voted to
strike in support of a pay claim worth between 11 per cent and 15 per cent.
The company responded by training volunteers from other companies in the
parent Thomson Travel Group to take over cabin staff duties in the event of
a strike.
The deal is worth 3 per cent on basic pay this year, with a lump sum payment
to make the annual rise worth about 5 per cent.
In addition, the company has agreed to increase incremental pay scales for
senior cabin crew by Pounds 100.
The two-year deal uses a formula of retail price index plus 1 per cent in
the second year with a minimum increase of 4 per cent. Other improvements to
conditions have also been negotiated.
Mr George Ryde, the TGWU civil and air transport official, said the pay
offer was a breakthrough. 'I have no doubt we will be recommending it
because it's quite a substantial move.'
He said the union would be putting the offer to a vote and the result would
be known by the end of the week.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Relaunch meets with general approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union leaders yesterday congratulated themselves on a successful relaunch of
the TUC, although some dissenters complained about aspects of the internal
reforms and the change in style which has accompanied the move.
Mr John Monks, the TUC general secretary, who has pushed through the
relaunch, said it was about 'redirecting resources to where the action is,
that means to Brussels and to the shopfloor'.
The congress passed a composite motion broadly approving the relaunch, which
stressed concentrating resources in fewer areas, reorganising the TUC
committee system, and turning the TUC into a more effective lobbying
organisation.
However, Mr George Brumwell, general secretary of building union Ucatt,
implicitly criticised Mr Monks' attempt to turn the TUC into a
non-party-political lobbying organisation. 'It is futile lobbying in the
corridors of power,' he said.
There were also complaints about the smaller executive committee which now
convenes between the quarterly meetings of the TUC general council.
In addition, smaller unions believe some of the changes have been against
their interests.
Union officials say privately that the biggest test for the reforms will be
whether the organisation can cease being a remote London-based body and can
start to provide a useful service to local activists.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, told congress
that some of the Pounds 8.5m spent annually on the TUC goes on servicing
local activists rather than union executives.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Booker shortlist fields a 'B-team'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNALENA MCAFEE, Arts and Literary Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shortlist of six for the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction,
announced yesterday, immediately prompted the question 'Who?' from many in
the publishing industry.
According to one insider, some on the list 'are B-team writers at best'.
The six include Alan Hollinghurst's The Folding Star (published by Chatto
and Windus), a melancholy study of homosexual obsession which was tipped as
a likely candidate from the initial 'long list' of 15, The Reef (Granta) by
young Sri Lankan writer Romesh Gunesekera and How Late It Was, How Late
(Secker and Warburg) by gritty Glasgow realist James Kelman, which was
almost universally well-reviewed.
As for the other three - Knowledge of Angels (Green Bay) a philosophical
fable by children's author Jill Paton Walsh, Paradise (Hamish Hamilton) by
Zanzibar-born writer Abdulrazak Gurnah and Beside the Ocean of Time (John
Murray) by 72-year-old Orcadian poet George Mackay Brown - 'frankly, they
don't make the grade'.
The shortlist for the Booker, the UK's most hyped literary prize and one of
the most lucrative, is all the more surprising in a bumper year for new
fiction fulfilling the criteria - English language and non-American - for
consideration for the award. Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride seems an
astonishing omission, as do new novels by Peter Ackroyd, Peter Carey, Candia
McWilliam, William Trevor and Jim Crace.
But if the shortlist of the final six candidates for the prize may be
disappointing, the traditional controversy surrounding the award is as rife
as ever.
One unsurprising omission from the final selection was When The World Was
Steady, a first novel by Claire Messud, which was on the 'long list' before
it was pointed out that the author was the wife of James Wood, chief
literary reviewer of The Guardian newspaper and a Booker judge.
Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker panel and husband of former
Booker Prize winner Dame Iris Murdoch, expressed surprise at Mr Wood's
failure to reveal his relationship with Ms Messud.
But it is the final list, rather than the controversy, that discredits the
award according to some critics. 'This list,' said one man of letters, 'must
have dealt a final death blow to the Booker.' The winner, selected from an
original 130, will be announced on October 11.

FT  06 SEP 94 / CBI puts spotlight on late payers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The problems caused by late payment of bills are highlighted today with the
launch by the Confederation of British Industry's northern region of a
detailed survey, based on responses from 5,000 companies.
The survey, conducted with accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Durham
University Business School, hopes to gauge the extent to which companies are
victims of late payment and how much they increase the problem by delaying
payment to their suppliers.
Mr Julian Kenyon, CBI assistant regional director, said the CBI hoped the
research would help to change the business culture on payment and ease the
cash flow difficulties.
The CBI estimates that nationally one in five companies risk going out of
business because of unpaid debts, which are said to total Pounds 145bn.
However, the CBI does not favour legislation, fearing it might result in
companies deferring payments until the last possible date.
The 5,000 companies include the top 250 by turnover in north-east England
and Cumbria. The rest are small and medium-size businesses employing under
500 people.
In tandem with the research, to be published in November, the CBI is
challenging northern businesses to sign up to its Prompt Payers Code, under
which companies pledge to adopt and stick to a clear, consistent policy on
paying bills.

FT  06 SEP 94 / County review defies guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Derbyshire's two-tier system of local government should stay intact, the
Local Government Commission announced yesterday, in defiance of the
government, which favours replacing two-tier counties and districts with
all-purpose unitary authorities.
While the commission recommends Derby becomes a separate all-purpose unitary
authority, it says the rest of Derbyshire, which is traditionally
Labour-dominated, should continue to be administered by a county council and
eight district councils.
It has withdrawn its earlier proposal to form a separate unitary authority
by merging the districts of Bolsover, Chesterfield and North East
Derbyshire.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, rejected that proposal for the
county because he thought it possible to find a unitary solution for the
rest of the county.
The commission now favours creating just the Derby unitary authority. It
said: 'During the last nine months, support for a new unitary council in the
north-east of the county has eroded. At the same time, the county council
and five district councils have proposed ways to make the two-tier system
work more effectively.'
It said a unitary Derby would cost between Pounds 3m and Pounds 5m to set up
but was unsure of the effect on annual costs, which it believes could be
either Pounds 2m greater or Pounds 2m less as a result of the change.
The alternative of setting up a separate 'north-east Derbyshire' as well as
unitary Derby, which the commission described as 'viable', would cost
between Pounds 8m and Pounds 10m, with possible further annual costs of
Pounds 1m.
The Association of County Councils, which supports the new proposal, said
the commission had 'sent a clear signal to the government that it will not
be bullied into finding a unitary solution just for the sake of it'.

Mr George Walker, the former chairman of the Brent Walker Group accused of
fraudulently inflating his company's profits, yesterday stepped into the
witness box at the Old Bailey to give evidence in his defence.
In two hours of questioning by his barrister, Mr Walker outlined his rise
from boxer to head of the property and leisure group.
He said he was the ideas man and deal-maker but trusted others to carry out
the detailed work of building up the company. Mr Walker and his former
finance director, Mr Wilfred Aquilina, are accused of fraudulently inflating
the profits of the Brent Walker group by Pounds 19.3m between 1984 and 1987.
The prosecution alleges this was achieved through bogus film deals which
enabled the company effectively to fund its own profits.
The markets were therefore given a much healthier picture of the company's
fortunes than was actually the case, it is alleged.
Mr Walker denies four charges of theft totalling Pounds 17m, two charges of
false accounting and one of conspiracy to falsify the Brent Walker accounts
to overstate profits. Mr Aquilina faces one charge of the theft of Pounds
4.5m, three of false accounting and one of conspiring to falsify accounts.
Questioned by Mr Colin Nicholls QC, Mr Walker explained how, from helping
run his wife's family garage in the late 1950s, he built up his business
empire.
Milestones in the development of the company included the 'Billy's Baked
Potato' fast-food chain in the 1960s, the development of the Brent Cross
shopping centre in the 1970s and the creation of the Brighton marina in the
1980s.
The expansion into film production with films such as The Stud and The Bitch
took place in the early 1980s, he told the court.
Asked if he was ever concerned with the accounting of the film division, Mr
Walker said his mental arithmetic might have been 'better than most', but he
lacked the necessary basic accountancy skills.
'I would not have the ability to do it,' he said.
The trial continues today.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Truce agreed in lecturers' dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Natfhe lecturers' union and the further education colleges have agreed a
truce in the long-running dispute over the introduction of new contracts and
conditions of service, John Authers and Richard Donkin write.
The union has been in dispute with the Colleges' Employers' Forum over the
contracts since colleges were removed from local authority control in April.
Local union branches in up to 120 colleges were due to hold strikes this
month over the contracts, which would involve halving lecturers' annual
holiday allowance.
College principals feared that strikes during this period would inflict
serious damage, as most course enrolments are handled in September.
Natfhe abandoned national negotiations in March after the appeal court ruled
that its ballot over national action was unlawful. But in a joint statement
Natfhe and the forum said they had agreed a formal schedule of negotiations
to last until the end of this month. This aims to reach 'a national
framework collective agreement that will embrace flexibility, productivity
and necessary contractual safeguards'.
While negotiations continue, the forum has recommended its members not to
introduce any new contracts, and the union has asked its branches to suspend
all industrial action.
Mr John Akker, Natfhe general secretary, said the statement followed
'intensive talks between the two sides'.
The joint statement added that 'substantial progress' had been made on the
length of the working week, the length of the working year, and workload
protection.
Mr Roger Ward, the forum's chief executive, said that about 40 per cent of
lecturers and about 90 per cent of college middle-managers had signed new
contracts.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Mayhew hopes Sinn Fein is in the frame: Sir Patrick tells
Tim Coone why he is insisting the IRA must make it plain that the violence
is over for good
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, is hopeful that the
republican movement will respond to British requests for clarification of
the IRA ceasefire and that the process of involving Sinn Fein in direct
exploratory talks leading to round-table negotiations can begin within three
months.
In an interview with the Financial Times yesterday, he explained why London,
unlike Dublin, does not yet accept IRA bona fides that the violence is
permanently over and also what role he hopes the US will play in the peace
process.
He also hinted at the contents of a forthcoming 'framework document' for
round-table talks, being drafted by the British and Irish governments.
He said the ceasefire was 'a remarkably important step and a very welcome
one'. He added: 'There was no condition attached. There was no finite
character to it. Those are very welcome features.'
But he said that the 'profound levels of suspicion which are endemic on both
sides of the community and very strongly present in the unionist side' made
it essential to clarify that the ceasefire was permanent.
'Both governments have insisted that there shall be a permanent end to
violence. I don't doubt for a minute the sincerity with which the Irish
government believe that it is over for good. We have to be satisfied from
what these people say themselves about their own intentions. We are not
insisting on a particular form of words. We just need to have an unequivocal
assertion that they intend it should be over for good.'
In a seeming effort to make it easier for Sinn Fein and the republicans to
respond, he repeatedly stressed that the key to opening the door to talks
was a public assurance by republicans that the intention behind the
ceasefire was a permanent end to violence.
Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, wrote last week in the Irish Times
that Dublin, the US and the nationalist Social Democratic Labour party in
the province had responded 'positively and correctly' to the ceasefire. Sir
Patrick said: 'That just falls short, why not just say 'they got our
intention right'. If Mr Adams were to say 'the Irish have correctly
perceived our intention, to give it up for good' that's fine. Why not say
it?'
He ruled out a proposal mooted in Dublin last week for a trilateral heads of
state summit between the US, the UK and the republic, but saw a positive
role for the US in using 'its unique channels of communication with
republicans' to persuade them to make it plain publicly that they intend
that violence is over for good.
The US understood the realities of Northern Ireland, he said, and it would
be very helpful if the Clinton administration were to point out to the
republican movement the genuine basis for the British government's
uncertainty over IRA intentions.
If British concerns could be satisfied, he said, it was worth remembering
that Sinn Fein could be included in direct exploratory talks with London
within three months. The word 'within' had been used, he said, to preserve
some sort of flexibility.
The framework document intended to kick-start all-party talks later this
year, would be a negotiable document. 'There is no question of imposition.'
He acknowledged there were on-going difficulties but said London now
accepted that amendment to the republic's territorial claim to Northern
Ireland 'would need to be put as part of an overall package'. This would be
essential to win unionist support for an overall accommodation.
Sir Patrick was ambivalent on whether Dublin's insistence on amendment of
the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which established partition, would be
included in the framework document.
'Everybody knows the government of Ireland Act is relevant to the package.
What the circumstances in which they are going to be relevant maybe time
will tell.'
He said the dispute over whether future cross-border structures would have
executive powers could possibly be dealt with by legislatures in both
Northern Ireland and the republic delegating powers to joint boards or
bodies. 'That seems to make a lot of sense,' he said.

FT  06 SEP 94 / OFT sets sights on drug prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading said yesterday it would challenge fixed prices
for over-the-counter drugs and medicines if it succeeds with a similar
action to end the Net Book Agreement.
Although it has only begun a preliminary examination of pharmaceutical
retailing, the OFT warned that the removal of a system of prices fixed by
manufacturers on proprietorial drugs would be a logical move if the
Restrictive Practices Court accepted its demand to end the system with
books.
This allows publishers to set minimum cover prices for books, and is the
only other area still covered by retail price maintenance.
Over-the-counter drugs and medicines have been subject to retail price
maintenance since 1971, when they were granted an exemption under the
Restrictive Practices Act to ensure the widest possible availability of
common treatments such as aspirin.
Analysts said the removal of price maintenance could lead to reduced profits
among pharmaceutical manufacturers because lower prices were unlikely to be
offset by sharp increases in volume sales.
Any change in the pricing formula would not affect own-label products sold
by large retailers such as Boots, which are not subject to the price
maintenance formula.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Loyalist gunmen 'will not dance to IRA tune'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Loyalist paramilitary groups remain reluctant to back a ceasefire because of
continuing fears that Sinn Fein and the IRA are dictating the pace and
direction of government policy towards Northern Ireland.
Sources close to the paramilitaries said Sunday night's bomb attack by the
Ulster Volunteer Force on a Sinn Fein office in Belfast was a 'warning shot'
aimed at underlining their resolve to defend Protestant interests.
'The situation is still being analysed but the message for now is unchanged
from what it was after last week's IRA ceasefire. We are not going to dance
to the IRA's tune,' said one source.
The view was confirmed yesterday by a Presbyterian minister who has acted as
intermediary for the paramilitaries.
The Rev Roy Magee said: 'The loyalist paramilitaries are saying, 'We are
still here and as far as we are concerned the war goes on'.'
While the IRA's ceasefire appears to be holding, loyalist paramilitaries
believe they have the capacity to exploit uncertainties and anxieties within
unionist communities.
Community workers meeting in the Shankill Road yesterday backed an end to
all terrorist violence, while expressing fears about Sinn Fein's call for a
campaign of civil protest by the Catholic community.
To some Protestants the campaign - which has already led to the illegal
reopening of cross-border roads by demonstrators - has resurrected memories
of the campaign of Catholic civil disobedience in the early stages of the
troubles.
Mr Alfred McClory, who runs a community centre in the Shankill and liaises
with loyalist prisoners, said yesterday: 'We are living from one day to the
next. Peace is here today but it could just as well be gone tomorrow.'
He said many working class Protestants wanted to see what reassurances, if
any, the Rev Ian Paisley gets from his planned meeting in Downing Street
with Mr John Major today.
In the Shankill, as in other Protestant strongholds, the fear remains that
the IRA and Sinn Fein, together with Dublin, are moving the peace process
inexorably towards Irish unity.
Mr Jim Rogers, an Ulster Unionist party councillor in Belfast, said: 'We
want to see no change in Northern Ireland's constitutional position as part
of the United Kingdom.'
He added that while he did not condone violence, he could understand the
logic behind the continuing existence of loyalist paramilitaries.
'Some of our people are saying they will need the actions of paramilitaries
before the battle for real peace is won,' he said.
Mr Rogers conceded that loyalist paramilitaries risked becoming isolated
from their communities if they launched a full-scale military offensive. 'If
they do that the loyalists will increasingly look like the baddies in the
film and the IRA the goodies.'
Such an assessment is understood to be shared by some members of the UVF and
the Ulster Freedom Fighters, the two main paramilitary organisations.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Tests for pupils aged 11 ordered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, yesterday announced that all
pupils aged 11 in England and Wales must take national curriculum tests next
year.
She also unveiled a package of concessions designed to ensure that the tests
are not disrupted by a teachers' union boycott for the third year running.
The Department for Education will reduce teachers' workload by paying for
all written tests to be marked externally, at a cost of between Pounds 12m
and Pounds 18m.
Central government funds will also meet 60 per cent of any costs of supply
teachers needed to supervise primary school tests, creating a potential
extra bill of Pounds 11m. The remaining costs would be paid by local
education authorities.
Mrs Shephard also announced that no league tables of school performance
based on the tests would be published this year. Plans to publish them for
pupils aged seven and 14 have been abandoned completely, while league tables
of tests for 11-year-olds will not be published until 1996 at the earliest.
Teachers' assessments of children's work will be given equal importance to
the tests, and all mandatory external audit of the teachers' own assessments
will end.
The move means that national curriculum tests, which have been widely
boycotted by teachers' unions for the past two years, will now be compulsory
for all children at the ages of seven, 11 and 14.
Mrs Shephard said that acceptance of the testing regime was increasing, with
half of primary schools and 30 per cent of secondary schools reporting
results from this summer's tests, compared with only 2 per cent last year
when all the three biggest teachers' unions boycotted them.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, the
only union to boycott the tests this year, said he would consult his members
before deciding whether to continue the industrial action for a third year.
But he was initially sceptical. He said: 'It's my belief that teachers,
particularly in primary schools, will find the introduction of external
markers a threat to their professionalism.'
The National Association of Head Teachers maintained its opposition to
'totally unjustified' league tables. Mr David Hart, the association's
general secretary, said the decision to employ external markers had 'more to
do with political imperative than educational need'.
However, Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association
of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, which called off its boycott last
year, said: 'With a slimmed-down national curriculum, a slimmed-down testing
and assessment system, teachers can now concentrate on teaching in the
classroom, which should always be their first priority.'

FT  06 SEP 94 / Recycling may cost less than forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recyling an extra 25 per cent of domestic packaging waste would cost Pounds
100m and add just 1p to every Pounds 10 spent by consumers, according to the
preliminary findings of a report by the Producer Responsibility Group.
The PRG says estimates that industry could face Pounds 500m a year in extra
costs, which would increase inflation by 0.5 per cent if passed on to
consumers, are exaggerated. A weekly shopping basket costing Pounds 50 would
increase by 5p, adding no more than 0.2 per cent to inflation.
The PRG is headed by Sir Sydney Lipworth, a former chairman of the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, and members include J. Sainsbury, Boots,
Asda and Tesco. The group was formed early in 1993 after Mr John Gummer,
then environment secretary, asked retailers and other industries in the
packaging chain to come up with a scheme to recycle an extra 25 per cent of
packaging waste, mainly from the domestic sector. It was intended that the
packaging industry would bear the costs, possibly through a levy.
The extra 25 per cent of recycling from the domestic sector would complement
industrial recyling and mean that between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of
total packaging waste would be recycled.
'The final report is due out next month, but I do not think it will find the
levy would amount to Pounds 500m,' a PRG spokesman said.

FT  06 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Airbus welcomes chance for wider role - FT
reporters on projects unveiled yesterday at the Farnborough Air Show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision to form a military subsidiary for the European Airbus
commercial aircraft consortium could speed up the transformation of Airbus
into the Boeing of Europe.
The move, announced yesterday at the Farnborough Air Show, is designed to
integrate the European future large military transport aircraft programme
(FLA) into the successful Airbus commercial aircraft manufacturing and
development system.
This integration would boost the FLA's chances in its competition against
Lockheed of the US and its new generation Hercules transport aircraft.
A decision is also expected to have broader implications for the
restructuring and consolidation of the European aerospace industry.
Airbus would gain access to the military market to match its bigger rival
Boeing, whose defence operations account for around 20 per cent of its
annual turnover. 'There is no better framework for the new military
transport aircraft in Europe than Airbus,' said Mr Louis Gallois, chairman
of Aerospatiale, the French company with a 37.9 per cent stake in Airbus.
The creation of the military subsidiary for Airbus represented a 'tremendous
chance and challenge' for Airbus, he added. Although Airbus has secured 30
per cent of the world's civil aircraft market, it is under increasing
pressure from Boeing, which yesterday announced further moves to improve
productivity and customer services.
'A challenge for Europe and Airbus is to become every day more competitive
versus Boeing,' said Mr Gallois. The integration of the FLA project within
the Airbus structure was one important step.
Apart from broadening Airbus activities into the military sector, the
proposal could also form the framework for expanding Airbus activities into
other new commercial aircraft sectors. Moreover, it is positive news for new
collaborative ventures with other international partners in programmes
ranging from smaller turbo-prop and regional aircraft to the development of
a new generation of 600 to 800 seat Jumbo jets.
The new Airbus military subsidiary would enable other European companies
currently not part of the Airbus consortium to participate in the European
aircraft group. At present, Airbus partners include Aerospatiale of France,
Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain.
The new military subsidiary would also involve the participation of Alenia
of Italy and the other associate partners in the FLA military transport
project, including Belgian, Portuguese and Turkish aerospace companies which
are not Airbus shareholders.
Although Airbus partners are still in discussion with Boeing over
collaborating on the possible joint development of a new super Jumbo, Airbus
is this month also due to start marketing its own A3XX 600 to 800 seater
Jumbo aircraft projects. This programme could involve a number of partners
outside the consortium, and senior Airbus officials suggested these could be
grouped into a separate Airbus subsidiary, similar to the military
subsidiary Airbus is proposing for the FLA.
At the same time, other subsidiaries could be set up to integrate the
European regional turbo-prop and jet manufacturers in a market suffering
from excess capacity and many competing projects.
Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus chief executive, also confirmed the Airbus
partners were setting up a separate financial company to support the
company's sales and marketing drive, as well as proposing to create a new
aircraft asset management group to monitor the worldwide Airbus fleet and
remarket used aircraft. 'The development of an active market for used
aircraft will play an increasingly important role for Airbus,' he said.
While considerable political and institutional obstacles remain to the
conversion of the existing Airbus structure into a public limited company,
the establishment of a military subsidiary and, eventually, other
subsidiaries, could open the way for a transformation of the Airbus system
to reflect its main US rival, Boeing.

FT  06 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Westland to bid for UK contract - FT
reporters on projects unveiled yesterday at the Farnborough Air Show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westland, the UK helicopter maker, has formed a team to bid for the Pounds
2bn (Dollars 3.1bn) contract for 91 attack helicopters for the British Army.
The group, called Team Apache, brings together McDonnell Douglas, Martin
Marietta and Westinghouse of the US with Westland and Shorts of Belfast to
offer the Longbow Apache helicopter for the Ministry of Defence competition.
Mr Alan Jones, Westland's chief executive, said that if the Apache won the
contract Pounds 1bn of work would come directly to UK companies working on
the programme, with a further Pounds 1bn of contracts placed for other work.
Over 100 UK companies have already committed themselves to bids for the 300
work packages available of the Apache, including Rolls-Royce, Lucas, Racal
Electronics, Smiths Industries, Hunting Engineering and Royal Ordnance.
The competition is between the Apache, the Bell Cobra Venom in co-operation
with GEC, the BAe-Eurocopter Tiger and the Denel-Marshalls Rooi-valk from
South Africa. The Apache is thought to be the favourite with the army.
Final bids must be in early in the autumn, with a final decision expected to
be made next spring.
'Westland Apache can be delivered to meet the British Army's preferred
in-service date of 1998,' said Mr Jones. He also stressed that with the
Apache in service with the US army and other forces worldwide, the
helicopter was a low-risk choice.
The Apache was on show at Farnborough, having been flown in from the US in a
giant C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft.

FT  06 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Boeing launches big 737 version on back of
orders - FT reporters on projects unveiled yesterday at the Farnborough Air
Show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boeing, the world's largest manufacturer of civil aircraft, yesterday
launched a new version of its 737 twin-engine narrow body airliner family
after securing commitments from four airlines, writes Paul Betts.
The 737-800, launched at the Farnborough Air Show, is the largest member of
the new generation of Boeing 737 aircraft. Mr Ron Woodard, president of
Boeing's commercial aircraft operations, said four undisclosed customers had
committed themselves to order more than 40 of the airliners.
The new 737-800s will seat 164 to 189 passengers and complement the new
737-700, which seats around 144 passengers. South West Airlines of the US
and Maersk Air of Denmark have already placed launch orders for the 737-700.
Mr Woodard said commitments for the 737-800 and 737-700 were worth around
Dollars 2bn.
Boeing also confirmed it was planning to launch a new smaller version of the
737, seating more than 100 passengers, as soon as it has secured sufficient
initial commitment from airline customers.
The group is also studying the development of a smaller 80 to 100 seat
regional jet in collaboration with an Asian partner. The company is in
active discussions with China and Japan over this project. Boeing indicated
it is prepared to be a minority partner in a regional jet project with Asian
partners, while maintaining overall leadership on the technology of the
aircraft, which was likely to draw heavily on the 737 airline family.
Boeing also announced four firm orders for Boeing 767-300ER jetliners -
valued at Dollars 384m - that will be leased to KLM Royal Dutch Airlines by
International Lease Finance Corporation.
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is rationalising its aircraft fleet by replacing
ten European Airbus A310 wide-body airliners with US Boeing 767-300
aircraft. It will lease seven Boeing 767 aircraft.
The decision is a disappointment for Airbus, and reflects a trend among
international airlines to rationalise their fleets to reduce costs and
improve efficiencies. Boeing also announced it was starting next-day
shipment on available routine spare parts orders, in a move it said would
potentially save customers millions of dollars.
Mr Woodard said more than 400,000 different parts would be available 'ready
for shipment the next day', or 30 times faster than the industry standard,
through its Spare Parts Distribution Center in Seattle.
Next-day shipment will be phased in at other spare parts centres in Altanta,
Brussels, Singapore, London and, soon, in a new site in Beijing.
Aircraft on ground orders, the most urgent category of spares, are now ready
for shipment within two hours of the receipt of orders.

FT  06 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Rolls-Royce wins Dollars 20m order from
Hungary - FT reporters on projects unveiled yesterday at the Farnborough Air
Show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce has won a Dollars 20m order from the Hungarian airline Malev for
Tay engines to power four Fokker 70 passenger jets, writes Our Foreign
Staff.
Fokker has announced that three of the aircraft are being leased from
American International Group's International Lease Finance Corporation and
the fourth is being bought from Fokker.
Fokker said the order, for delivery between autumn 1995 and spring 1996,
brings total orders for the new twin-engined aircraft to 33.
Fokker chairman Mr Ben van Schaik said at the show more orders were on the
way for the aircraft, which is due to be delivered to its first customers
this October.
Anglo-German aero-engine maker BMW Rolls-Royce has awarded a contract to
RoSEC, a joint venture between Rolls-Royce and Smiths Industries, to design
and manufacture the digital engine control system for the BR715 engine. It
said the deal could eventually be worth Dollars 75m.
BMW Rolls-Royce is 50 per cent owned by Bayerische Motoren-Werke.
Aerospatiale sales for the first half of 1994 have fallen 3 per cent
compared with the same period in 1993, chairman Mr Louis Gallois said.
Mr Gallois said first half orders were weak, particularly for helicopters
and civil aircraft, and Aerospatiale needed to continue efforts to cut
costs.

FT  06 SEP 94 / World Trade News: VW to import light trucks to Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen is to import light trucks from Brazil for sale in the European
market for the first time, writes Kevin Done.
The introduction of the Brazilian-built 7.5 tonne truck, the L80, is aimed
at closing a gap in the VW range of light commercial vehicles caused by the
termination early last year of its previous light truck joint venture with
MAN, the German truck and bus maker.
The L80 was originally developed by Autolatina, Volkswagen's majority-owned
Brazilian subsidiary, for the South American market.
Volkswagen said that it was planning to sell around 2,500 trucks in a full
year in Germany, where the L80 will go on sale from the start of next year.
It will be launched a year later in several other European markets.
The L80 truck will be supplied from Brazil as a chassis-cab with
Brazilian-produced engines supplied by a local subsidiary of MWM, a German
engine manufacturer.
VW said that it was seeking eventually to expand its presence in the west
European commercial vehicle market to include trucks up to 10 tonnes in
addition to its present range of German-built vans, light trucks and
pick-ups.

FT  06 SEP 94 / World Trade News: VW enters joint venture to produce cars in
India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen of Germany, the leading European carmaker, has linked up with
Eicher Goodearth, the Indian motor vehicle and tractor manufacturer, to
produce and market a range of Volkswagen cars for the Indian market.
The two companies announced that the new joint venture company would invest
up to Rs6bn (Dollars 191m) in a manufacturing plant, expected to start
production in 1997. The two partners would start the venture and decide the
extent of equity for each company after a feasibility study.
Volkswagen will be competing with several of the world's leading carmakers
to establish a presence in India's newly liberalised passenger car market,
which is estimated to double by the year 2000 to between 450,000 and 500,000
cars.
These include General Motors, Chrysler, Ford, Peugeot, Daimler-Benz, Volvo,
Hyundai, Mitsubishi and Daewoo.
VW will also have to compete with the Indian Maruti, made in collaboration
with Suzuki Motors of Japan, which has a dominant place in the Indian
market.
Mr Martin Posth, VW board member and chairman and president of Volkswagen
Asia-Pacific, said that his company considered India one of the world's
major emerging markets, especially since Asia is expected to account for
most of the growth in the global vehicle market.
Mr Posth said his company chose Eicher as a partner because of its
widespread distribution network and professional management.
Eicher manufactured India's first tractor in 1960 and entered into the light
commercial vehicles sector in the 1980s, manufacturing small trucks and
pick-up vans in collaboration with Mitsubishi Motor Corporation of Japan.
Eicher has achieved a local content of over 90 per cent for these vehicles.
Volkswagen is keen to maximise the level of local content, and hopes to
capitalise on Eicher's experience in this area. Only then could their cars
be competitive in the Indian market, Mr Posth said, indicating that his
company would focus initially on medium-sized cars.
Mr Vikram Lal, chairman of the Eicher group said that India offered the VW
group the advantage of a diverse and cost-effective additional automobile
base.
Volkswagen will not restrict itself to a single model, but proposes to
introduce a range of cars in India - though focusing initially on
medium-sized cars - unlike several other global vehicle giants entering the
market with a single car.
Bharat Shell, a joint venture between the Indian government-owned Bharat
Petroleum Corporation and Shell Overseas Investment, is to construct a new
lubricant blending unit at Uran, near Bombay, to manufacture Shell brand
lubricants for the Indian market, writes Shiraz Sidhva.
Mr Vikram Mehta, managing director of Bharat Shell, said yesterday that the
company decided to set up its own unit because of capacity constraint at
Bharat Petroleum's unit at Bombay, where the Shell range of lubricants are
blended. The Rs1.3bn company, in which Shell has a 51 per cent stake, hopes
to enter India's domestic liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) market, which the
government has yet to privatise.
Bharat Shell already manufactures LPG for industrial use for markets in
western India and plans to enlarge the spread its network nationally.

FT  06 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Batam chosen for air maintenance centre
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Companies from Singapore and Indonesia are setting up an aircraft
maintenance centre on the Indonesian island of Batam.
Singapore Aerospace, a listed company which has traditionally focused on
military maintenance and overhaul, and Nusantara Aircraft Industry (IPTN),
Indonesia's state-owned aircraft manufacturing company, will each hold 25
per cent in the project. A company controlled by Mr Liem Sioe Liong,
Indonesia's richest businessman, is also involved in the venture.
Batam island, which in recent years has been developed into one of
Indonesia's key industrial zones, is about 20 km south of Singapore.
The project's backers say the initial cost of the Batam facility will be
Dollars 10m.
The facility will concentrate on Indonesia's fast expanding aerospace
sector, but is likely to undertake other regional work in the future.
Singapore's aerospace industry, faced with rising wage costs and constraints
on land use, has been expanding overseas. Last year Singapore Engineering,
the wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, announced it was taking a
10 per cent stake in a Dollars 63m aircraft maintenance and repair facility
being set up in Xiamen in China.
Last month Singapore Aerospace and other Singapore companies said they would
be taking a 46 per cent share in another aircraft repair centre at Shenzhen
in southern China.

FT  06 SEP 94 / World Trade News: EC and SADC unveil plans for closer links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union and the Southern African Development Community (SADC),
which groups the region's 11 countries, will today unveil a programme aimed
at increasing closer economic co-operation between the organisations.
'The time is ripe for the co-operation between both our regions to move on
to a new stage,' said Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister.
He was speaking on behalf of EU foreign ministers in Berlin at the opening
of the first high-level ministerial meeting with SADC.
EU and SADC officials said they would identify a number of projects, ranging
from telecommunications and transport to infrastructure and energy, which
would be supported by Brussels.
However, SADC officials stressed they were not in Berlin to ask for
assistance.
'This is not a donor's conference. It is not a pledging conference,' said Mr
Kaire Mbuende, the SADC executive secretary. 'It is about SADC trying to
base its relations with the EU on trade, genuine co-operation, and
investment. We want to create institutional mechanisms for a partnership
between the two regions.'
SADC is the successor to the Southern African Development Co-ordination
Conference, which was set up in 1980 to reduce its members' trade with South
Africa. It was renamed SADC in 1992 and the organisation shifted its
policies from opposition to South Africa to economic development.
The member states are Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Zimbabwe,
Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Namibia and Zambia.
Mr Mbuende said inter-regional trade amounts to no more than 6 per cent of
total trade. To increase this volume, he hoped the SADC would agree to a
trade promotional protocol by January 1995. This would facilitate greater
mobility of capital and investments in the region.
Most of the SADC economies maintain complex trade and tariff regulations
which will take a long time to dismantle. In addition, the relative size of
South Africa - it contributes over 75 per cent to a regional GDP of around
Dollars 125bn (Pounds 80.6bn) - makes other countries nervous of being
flooded with cheaper South African goods should all restrictions be removed.
Mr Mbuende said SADC has to start thinking about harmonising its regional
travel, visa, banking, currency and trading relations.
EU officials yesterday said a more integrated and co-ordinated SADC economic
structure would help improve trade and investment links with the EU.
The EU already buys more than a quarter of SADC's exports.
Over the past 20 years, Brussels has extended Ecu4.6bn (Dollars 5.61bn) in
financial and technical aid.
More than Ecu110m has already been earmarked this year for a special
programme set up to dismantle the remaining vestiges of apartheid in South
Africa.

FT  06 SEP 94 / New Brazilian finance chief sticks to plan: Minister
promises continuing anti-inflation policy but stock and bond markets slip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Brazilian government yesterday tried to assure domestic and
international observers that the country's latest anti-inflation plan
remained on course, despite the weekend resignation of Mr Rubens Ricupero as
finance minister.
Worries over the resignation and the possibility that it would affect the
presidential election chances of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the
government's candidate, led to the Sao Paulo stock market closing 10.5 per
cent down yesterday, from the Friday close, and to falls for Brazilian bonds
on international markets.
The new minister, Mr Ciro Gomes, met President Itamar Franco yesterday and
said the present anti-inflation plan - with its main component, a new
currency called the Real - would not be changed. Mr Gomes stressed that the
team of economists which has overseen the Real's introduction would stay at
the ministry.
Mr Gomes, the governor of Brazil's poor north-eastern state of Ceara until
his new appointment, said the resignation of Mr Ricupero was the result of
'lamentably bad luck'. The latter had quit after his private comments were
broadcast by mistake on satellite TV. He said he had no scruples about the
government using the anti-inflation plan to help its candidate in the
presidential election next month.
Advisers to Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, presidential candidate of the
left-wing Workers' Party and Mr Cardoso's main opponent, said they would
appeal to the electoral court, claiming unfair government support for Mr
Cardoso. Mr Orestes Quercia, another candidate, demanded that the court
disqualify Mr Cardoso. This is seen as very unlikely.
Mr Cardoso, who is leading in the latest opinion polls by 45 per cent to Mr
da Silva's 23 per cent, tried to brush off the incident. In an election
broadcast on Sunday night, he emphasised the Real plan, which has cut
monthly inflation from 50 per cent earlier this year to less than 5 per
cent.
The price of dollar-denominated Brady bonds - bank loans repackaged as
bonds, which form the largest part of the Brazilian bond market - yesterday
fell by more than two points before recovering slightly in later trade. The
US markets were closed for a holiday so most of the trade took place in
London, with some in Brazil and Argentina.
'The other main presidential candidate (Mr da Silva) is seen by investors as
more inflationary, and that is worrying the market,' said Miss Ingrid
Iversen, senior economist at Morgan Grenfell in London.

FT  06 SEP 94 / One strike and still out]: The US baseball dispute shows no
sign of ending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It was Labour Day yesterday in the US, as in 'Thou shalt not'. Professional
baseball players were taking the injunction seriously.
For the first time since this public holiday was established in the US a
hundred years ago, there was no major league baseball to watch on the
holiday that, by tradition, marks the end of summer. The players' strike was
into week four.
Hopes are fading that the deadlock between the players and the team owners
might be broken in time for a truncated championship play-off at least.
Mr Bud Selig, acting baseball commissioner - he is one of the team owners
standing in for the last commissioner, who was fired for showing too much
interest in the game and not enough in the owners' balance sheets - said
this week that he would cancel the entire season if there were no movement
by Friday.
Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary, has offered to mediate between the two
sides, but he said yesterday that there was no point in mediating unless
both sides want to negotiate.
The owners insist that the players must agree to a salary cap. The players
insist that there can be no serious talks until that has been dropped.
On a Labour Day when New York City's more traditional trade unions could not
muster enough support for their parade, the doggedness of the players'
union, on its eighth strike in 23 years, stands in contrast to the weakness
of the rest of the union movement.
Today, only 11 per cent of the private sector US workforce is represented by
a union, and only the public sector unions show anything like the tenacity
of the professional games players.
Sofa sports fans, who have had to content themselves with Little League
baseball during the strike, now at least have the new American football
season, which began on Sunday. In that game, the players agreed to a salary
limit per team, and many have had to agree in the last few weeks to a pay
cut.

</HEADLINE>

   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ciro Gomes, Brazil's new finance minister, is a high-flying politician
with very close links to Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, government candidate
and front-runner for the presidential election in October.
The new minister is best known for his efficient and honest government of
Ceara, a small state in the Brazilian north-east, a region more often
associated with bad government and corruption. Now 37, he represents a new
crop of Brazilian politicians who remain populist and aware of the
importance of the media, but who are less nationalist than past generations.
Mr Gomes was born in Sao Paulo but grew up in Ceara, where several family
members have held political office. He practised law before switching to
politics.
In 1988, he was elected mayor of Fortaleza, the Ceara capital, and emerged
as a principal follower of Mr Tasso Jereissati, The latter was elected state
governor in 1987, modernised its government and balanced its budget.
Mr Gomes succeeded as governor in 1990, and continued his policies of
controlling public spending and improving government efficiency. This has
led to a wave of foreign investment in Ceara and its economic growth has
outstripped that of all Brazil by a factor of five in the last seven years.
However, opponents argue that it has taken too long for the benefits of
growth to reach the poor.
The new minister has also won plaudits, and criticism, for his skilful
handling of the Brazilian and international media. He is a well-known figure
in Brazil, despite the relative obscurity of his state.
His media presence will help him continue the work of his predecessor at the
finance ministry, Mr Rubens Ricupero, whose work of explaining Brazil's new
Real currency to the public, as well as fighting industrial groups wanting
to raise prices. He is likely to be weakened, however, by his links to Mr
Cardoso. Other candidates are unhappy that one of the presidential
front-runner's closest allies has been appointed finance minister so close
to the elections.
Mr Jereissati is well ahead in opinion polls to secure a second term as
governor of Ceara. Both men are key members of the same political party as
Mr Cardoso, the social democratic PSDB.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Talks aimed at reopening peace negotiations between the Mexican government
and armed rebels in the south-eastern state of Chiapas will start this week,
after a weekend of protests there, writes Ted Bardacke in Mexico City.
Bishop Samuel Ruiz, a local mediator in the crisis, announced a series of
'urgent meetings' after about 20,000 indigenous peasants had blocked all
roads in and out of Chiapas at the weekend and demonstrated in at least 40
towns. Officials warned of a possible resumption of hostilities in the
state, where Zapatista left-wing guerrillas began an uprising on January 1.
Demonstrators are now seeking to prevent Mr Eduardo Robledo of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party from taking office as governor, after his
election on August 21. They allege fraud and are demanding that Mr Amado
Avendano of the opposition Party of Democratic Revolution, who was openly
supported by the rebels, be declared victor.
Bishop Ruiz said that a 'clarification' of electoral irregularities, as well
as a new round of peace talks, was the key to any permanent settlement in
the state. Mr Robledo 'is going to have very serious problems,' he added.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The latest Brazilian political scandal has strongly increased the chances
that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico will become head of the
new World Trade Organisation, diplomats and analysts said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Geneva.
Mr Rubens Ricupero, who resigned as Brazil's economy minister at the
weekend, was widely seen as the main rival to Mr Salinas for leadership of
the WTO, due to come into being next year under the world trade accord
signed in April.
'I cannot see Ricupero remaining seriously in the race after this affair,'
said one trade envoy, whose country had favoured the Brazilian, a
widely-respected former ambassador to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
An experienced Gatt-watcher said Mr Ricupero's admission that he hid bad
financial figures so as to help the Brazilian presidential election campaign
of his ministerial predecessor, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, 'must spoil
his chances for the WTO.'
Mr Salinas, who already has the implicit backing of the US and many Latin
American governments to become the first head of a world trade body from a
developing country, was already viewed as the front-runner for the post.
Many trade officials and diplomats say that his record as a president who
put aside protectionist policies and liberalised the Mexican economy would
provide added political weight to the fledgling WTO.
The European Union is expected to endorse the candidature of Mr Renato
Ruggiero, an Italian former trade minister, although there is little sign
that he has much support among other countries in the 125-member Gatt.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Quebec warned on independence
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A growing chorus of Quebec business leaders and other federalists has warned
of dangers to the francophone province's economic prospects if the Parti
Quebecois presses ahead with its agenda for a quick drive towards
independence from Canada after the provincial election next Monday.
The warnings reflect the PQ's virtually unassailable lead in public opinion
polls over the ruling Liberal party. According to the latest polls, the PQ
is set to win about two-thirds of the 125 seats in the provincial assembly.
With a PQ win next week all but assured, both separatist and federalist
forces have begun to look to the next stage of the struggle, which will
determine whether, when and to what extent Quebec severs its ties with the
rest of Canada.
The PQ's election platform pledges that the assembly will pass a 'solemn
declaration' immediately after the election, so as to affirm Quebec's desire
to become an independent country.
The party has also promised to hold a sovereignty referendum within a year
of taking office. In the meantime, it has threatened to shun negotiations
between the federal government and the other nine provinces on issues of
overlapping jurisdiction, such as welfare and healthcare reforms.
A group of 10 prominent Quebec federalists, led by Mr Michel Belanger,
former chairman of the Montreal-based National Bank of Canada, warned that
the 'solemn declaration' would sow confusion among domestic and foreign
investors about Quebec's future.
Mr Jean Campeau, former head of the Caisse de Depot public-sector pension
fund and one of the PQ's few supporters in the top echelons of Montreal
business, insisted the declaration would only be 'a symbolic event', meant
to 'inform the Quebec people of the government's desire to hold a referendum
to decide whether Quebec should be sovereign.'
With only a few exceptions, the business community and federal politicians
have kept a low profile during the election campaign. Most have confined
their involvement to behind-the-scenes advice to Mr Daniel Johnson, premier
and Liberal leader. However, they are likely to become more outspoken about
the costs of independence, if and when the referendum campaign unfolds.
Federalists have taken heart from polls which show that, despite the PQ
support, a solid - even a growing - majority of Quebeckers is opposed to
outright independence.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Emancipation helps Tunisia to steady growth: A 'Personal
Status Code' has given women rights not enjoyed elsewhere in the Arab world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid all the controversy surrounding the United Nations Population
Conference in Cairo, the example of one small Moslem country, Tunisia,
traditionally tolerant and open to western influence, suggests the
emancipation of women has been a significant factor in reducing population
growth from 3.2 per cent a generation ago to 1.9 today.
Vastly improved standards of education and health care are other ingredients
which explain Tunisia's steady economic performance in recent years. Real
growth has averaged 5 per cent a year since 1989 and inflation is running at
a little over 3 per cent. Over two-thirds of all households own or are
buying a house or apartment.
The successful implementation of a structural readjustment programme has,
since 1987, won plaudits from both the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank, and contributed to the resilience of the economy in overcoming
the impact of the Gulf War and, last winter, a severe drought. The tourist
sector is attracting 2.5m Europeans this year and contributing an estimated
Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 800m) to exports of goods and services.
Most striking is the coherence of the 'Personal Status Code', promulgated by
former president Habib Bourguiba in 1956, the year Tunisia gained
independence from France, which abolished polygamy and established all the
laws governing family planning, divorce and the education of women which
have given Tunisian women rights not enjoyed elsewhere in the Arab world.
In 1963, free prescriptions of the pill and free confidential advice on
contraception were made available to women, 10 years before France. The
programme spread to even the smallest village. The birth rate has declined
from 45 to 24.4 per 1,000, mortality from 15 to 6.1 per 1,000. Illiteracy
has been cut from 87.7 to 35 per cent, though the figure is higher among
women in poorer areas.
Women are increasingly visible in teaching, medicine and architecture, in
factories as workers, engineers and owners. The world of politics remains
very much a man's world, although the professional skills and sureness of
touch which Mrs Neziha Mezhoud, minister in charge of family issues, and a
growing number of other highly-articulate women bring to their jobs,
suggests it is only a matter of years before senior cabinet posts will go to
women.
Though leaders of the opposition Islamic al Nahda (Renaissance) party have
said they would accept many of Mr Bourguiba's policies, women are mindful of
the often violent record of some supporters of the party, notably the
throwing of acid in the faces of university students on the campus in Tunis.
Many Tunisian women are convinced radical Islam is not sympathetic to the
idea of equality between the sexes or to their presence in public places.
The laws on divorce and alimony are remarkably close to their European
counterparts. Indirectly, they allow women a far greater share of
inheritance than the Koran allows. To bolster these moves, the books of
people such as Hassan el Banna, the founder of modern fundamentalism, have
been withdrawn from schools and public libraries, and references to the
inferior status of women erased from all school books.
Women today have 25 per cent of all jobs in Tunisia, 35 per cent of all jobs
in industry, 22 per cent in the growing services sector and 40 per cent in
agriculture, where they manage 10 per cent of all farms. Ten per cent of all
new companies are created by women.
The cycle of emancipation, education, public presence, most notably in the
workplace, success in the professions and industry helps to explain why a
country of such slender natural resources has progressed so much faster, not
least economically, than many of its peers in the Middle East and Africa.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Translation traps trigger diplomatic divisions

Linguistic traps are complicating the attempts of 182 countries at the Cairo
population conference to draw up a final text of United Nations policy on
population and family planning. The euphemisms, metaphors and abstractions
of the debate are proving so tricky in translation that they are triggering
serious diplomatic divisions, some delegates claim.
The Al Ahram Centre for Journalism, a research group attached to one of
Egypt's leading newspapers, has published an analysis of poor translations
in the Arabic version of the official UN text, which have potentially
inflammatory connotations in Moslem societies, it says.
The conference's emphasis on women's rights, a marked departure from
previous UN meetings which have focused on demographic projections and
contraceptive techniques, is responsible for much of the difficulty.
Arabic and Chinese translators said yesterday they were having particular
trouble with 'reproductive rights' and 'empowerment of women', the two
central principles of the draft policy document, drawn up at the UN in New
York.
'In Arabic, the closest we can get to 'empowerment' is 'enabling', but then
you have to specify what you were enabling women to do,' one translator said
 -a level of precision which the conference has not attempted.
UN translators and the Al Ahram centre both seize on 'single-parent
households' as another pitfall. According to the centre, the phrase should
have been translated as 'households which are financially supported by one
person', so that it explicitly included wives who had been divorced or
widowed. Otherwise, the phrase implies that all 'single' parents are those
who have had children outside marriage, it suggests.
The centre also criticises the way that 'breast-feeding' was translated into
Arabic using the word 'breast' instead of the term normally used, 'natural
feeding'. 'Breast', it says, has unwelcome sexual connotations which it
describes as Freudian. Chinese translators also invoke Sigmund Freud in
explaining the problems of translating 'human sensuality' from English into
Chinese. 'In Chinese this comes across as 'sexual life' ..but this does not
catch the implication in the English version that sexuality is a fundamental
characteristic of human behaviour,' one said.
UN Arabic translators also argued that delegations may be seizing on
linguistic difficulties to escape the real philosophical and political
differences between countries. The disputes 'aren't just the fault of
translations, unless the Pope has also been working from the Arabic text,'
one said, referring to the alliance of the Vatican and conservative Moslem
religious leaders on some of the conference's thorniest issues.
Cultural differences have surfaced in countries' differing reactions to the
declaration that controlling fertility is a 'right of individuals'. Several
delegates comment that the notion of 'individual rights' is drawn from the
relationship between an individual and the state in western democracies and
is foreign to many other societies.
But according to one translator, 'the debate over rights shows that the
problems are not all a matter of comprehension. People know perfectly well
what rights are, it's just a question of whether governments want to give
them to women.'

FT  06 SEP 94 / Uzbekistan triples bread price
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Bread and flour prices were tripled yesterday in Uzbekistan, in an apparent
attempt to accommodate International Monetary Fund recommendations and
finally obtain currency support.
President Islam Karimov also issued a decree awarding direct payments to
'virtually every adult to compensate for the price rise'.
Taken with other recent policy changes in Uzbekistan, the announcement
implies Mr Karimov is more willing to risk shifting from the safer political
ground to which he has adhered since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
The price rises follow a halting of subsidies to state enterprises and a
move to a floating exchange rate. An IMF mission is due in Tashkent starting
Sept 16, to evaluate the economic impact of the introduction of Uzbekistan's
currency, the som, on July 1 last.
Until now, the IMF has refused to provide support for the Uzbekistan som,
which since its introduction has weakened from seven to 18 to the dollar.
The IMF has insisted the government adopt structural changes, chiefly
freeing interest and currency exchange rates.
Mr Karimov may have trouble persuading the IMF to reverse its position.
Economists say he has kept indirect subsidies to state banks, and retained
the ability of targeted enterprise to buy cheap dollars for imports or
equipment.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Bruntland cuts to heart of Cairo conference

Mrs Gro Harlem Bruntland, Norway's prime minister, cut to the heart of the
controversies surrounding the International Conference on Population and
Development at its opening yesterday with a plain-speaking defence of its
centrepiece text's position on abortion.
Mrs Bruntland's speech, which accused some religious critics of hypocrisy,
drew loud applause and a final standing ovation during an opening session
marked otherwise by conciliatory and grandiose opening addresses.
'I have tried in vain to understand how the term 'reproductive healthcare'
can possibly be read as promoting abortion as a means of family planning.
Rarely if ever have so many misrepresentations been used to imply a meaning
that was never there in the first place,' Mrs Bruntland declared.
'Morality becomes hypocrisy if it means mothers suffering or dying in
connection with unwanted pregnancies and illegal abortions and unwanted
children,' she added.
Ms Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's prime minister (the opening's other star
female speaker in a conference which has women's rights as a central theme)
made a spirited defence of Islamic and family values. While claiming the
conference's draft text contained 'serious flaws', she said the world must
not see the event as 'a universal social charter seeking to impose adultery,
abortion (and) sex education'.
Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, the conference host, Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, UN secretary-general, and Mr Albert Gore, US vice-president, called
the gathering 'one of the most important conferences ever held'.
Most other speakers reiterated with little change of emphasis the central
thrust of the gathering, which is to provide a consensual global programme
to stabilise world population based on a 'holistic' developmental approach
with the education and empowerment of women at its core.
Speakers and delegates made energetic efforts to stress the high degree of
agreement among the event's 170 participants on the conference document,
detailed negotiations on which began yesterday and will continue until the
conference closes on September 13.
Mr Gore said what was 'truly remarkable' about the meeting was 'not only the
unprecedented degree of consensus about the nature of the problem, but the
degree of consensus about the nature of the solution'.
By the end of yesterday, delegates were congratulating themselves on having
made progress in trying to heal rifts over the document's language. EU
states agreed internally to back a proposed amendment clarifying the
document does not promote abortion as a means of family planning.

FT  06 SEP 94 / US leads growth in world medicines sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of US prescription medicines have rebounded this year in spite of
healthcare reforms, while Japanese and European markets for medicines
continued to splutter.
The US pharmacy drugs market has recovered strongly, rising 7 per cent
during the first six months, compared with growth of only 3 per cent during
the same period last year. Sales increased from Dollars 22.7bn (Pounds
14.6bn) to Dollars 24.3bn, according to IMS International, specialist market
research company.
Pharmacy sales in Japan rose from Dollars 9.4bn to Dollars 10.4bn, but rose
only 1 per cent in yen terms. The sector has been hit by government-inspired
price cuts introduced in April.
In Europe's seven largest markets, drugs sales slipped from Dollars 23bn
during the first six months last year to Dollars 22.2bn in the same period
this year. The figures, however, were distorted by currency devaluations and
fluctuations. In local currency terms, sales increased 2 per cent compared
with a growth rate of 10 per cent during the first half of 1992 and 1 per
cent in the 1993 period.
The German market continued to recover from last year's steep falls. Sales
rose 6 per cent compared with an 11 per cent fall during the same six months
last year. All therapeutic categories registered growth, apart from asthma
products, which fell 1 per cent.
All other European markets registered decelerating growth or even falls in
sales. The Italian market fell 7 per cent, following last year's drop of 2
per cent. The French market was static after growth last year of 7 per cent.
The UK remained Europe's fastest growing market, up 8 per cent, though this
was less than last year's 13 per cent growth. The Spanish market also
decelerated, growing at 3 per cent compared with 11 per cent. Sales in the
Netherlands rose 5 per cent, (13 per cent). and those in Belgium 4 per cent
(6 per cent).

FT  06 SEP 94 / Government of Kyrgyzstan resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TASHKENT, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The government of the central Asian state of Kyrgyzstan resigned yesterday,
apparently to strengthen the hand of the pro-reform president, Mr Askar
Akayev, against the conservative-dominated parliament. Mr Akayev has ordered
new elections to the parliament before the end of the year.
The sudden open confrontation between the reformist and conservative forces
in the smallest of the former Soviet central Asian republics pits communist
deputies, many of them representing the large Russian diaspora, against a
minority in parliament who support the reformist strategy which Mr Akayev
has struggled to push through.
The country, one of the poorest in the region, introduced its own currency
backed by a loan from the International Monetary Fund last year, and has
reduced its inflation rate to 3.8 per cent a month in July.
However, faster progress with reforms and a start to an ambitious, but
stillborn, privatisation programme has been stymied by a majority in
parliament opposing economic reform which will threaten the further
existence of the rickety industrial sector reliant on continued state
subsidies.
The cabinet issued a resignation statement saying that government had become
paralysed 'because of political games in parliament' which 'disturb social
life and create tensions. The parliament has been unable to take decisions
and thus interrupted its own work. The government considers it its duty to
say that it supports the president's policies'.
Parliament was due to convene for a final session of the year on September
27, when a new barrage of anti-government moves and resolutions would have
been unleashed.
Mr Akayev's announcement shifts forward the election date from
February/March of next year to some time in the next five months. 'There is
no way now for the opposition to organise before an accelerated election,'
said one western analyst said in Bishkek, the capital.
Mr Akayev stands in contrast to most central Asian leaders: he is not a
former first secretary of the communist party, and has fully embraced market
reform, though he lacks a strong industrial base and leads a country where
natural energy and precious minerals are in short supply.
The som, the Kyrgyz currency, has stabilised and the IMF has granted a
three-year loan of Dollars 104m (Pounds 69m), the only one of its kind in
central Asia. Attacks on the president point up the fact that, of the five
central Asian states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and
Uzbekistan, only Kyrgyzstan permits an active opposition, a source of pride
to President Akayev, but one which has thrown him on the defensive.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Singapore caught in media dilemma: Kieran Cooke on
reconciling censorship with the global information network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Out-of-work veterans of Washington's ill-fated 'Star Wars' programme should
look no further. Singapore needs you.
Singapore wants to turn itself into a global media hub. The problem is that
Singapore's leaders remain deeply suspicious of outside influences.
'We have to stay special and unique,' said Mr George Yeo, Singapore's
minister for information and the arts, recently. 'To achieve this, we need a
kind of semi-permeable membrane to preserve our own bubble in Singapore.'
While Singapore does not plan literally to wrap itself in a cocoon, Mr Yeo's
remarks are very much a reflection of the dilemma the government feels it is
facing.
On one hand, Singapore's planners see the economic necessity of being
plugged into the global information network. Singapore has the technology
and expertise to be the information entrepot of the dynamic south-east Asia
region. Its 2.7m people are already among the world's most
computer-proficient.
'The future belongs to countries whose people make the most productive use
of information, knowledge and technology,' says Mr Goh Chok Tong,
Singapore's prime minister. 'These are now the key factors for economic
success, not natural resources.'
But, on the other hand, the government is deeply concerned about losing
control over information flows within Singapore. Satellite ownership is not
allowed for the general public. The local media faithfully reflect
government policy. The importation of foreign newspapers and magazines,
ranging from the Far Eastern Economic Review to Cosmopolitan, is carefully
controlled. Even newspapers from neighbouring Malaysia are not allowed to
circulate in Singapore.
Singapore's leaders have shown no hesitation in taking court action, usually
involving substantial damage suits, against foreign media which, they feel,
have impugned their integrity.
But as technology changes, censorship becomes ever more difficult. Services
such as Internet, the global information network, can be used not only to
access research materials. They can also be used to transit newspapers and
pornography.
The government admits that where technology is concerned, it is fighting a
losing battle. 'Censorship is becoming quite impossible to enforce at the
individual level,' says Mr Yeo. 'Once digitised, an objectionable book,
magazine or video can be sent through the telecommunications network.
'We can inspect magazines, books, tapes and discs but we cannot possibly
screen every bit or byte that comes down the information highway.' Instead,
says Mr Yeo, Singapore needs what he calls an immune system capable of
fighting off infection from within.
A code of what are seen as Asian values, emphasising the family and the
primary role of the male, discipline and above all, the needs of society
above those of the individual, is the pill the government wants Singaporeans
dutifully to swallow to counteract foreign viruses.
'Asian values' was the main theme of a national day address at the end of
last month by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. The maintenance of such values
is seen as vital for Singapore's continued economic success. 'You may think
decline is unimaginable,' said Mr Goh. 'But societies can go wrong very
quickly.'
While the Singapore government remains deeply sensitive to outside
criticism, Mr Goh had no hesitation in painting a bleak picture for his
audience of what he sees as moral decay and lawlessness in the west, most
notably in the US and Britain.
He warned Singaporeans not to fall prey to corrosive outside influences,
such as welfarism, divorce, or children being allowed to call their fathers
by their first names. 'We must not unthinkingly drift into attitudes and
manners which undermine the traditional politeness and deference Asian
children have for their parents and elders.'
Mr Goh admitted that drug addiction and juvenile delinquency in Singapore
had risen. So had divorce, and there were single-parent families. Unmarried
motherhood could not be considered a respectable part of Singapore society,
Mr Goh declared. In future, unmarried mothers would not be allowed to buy
government flats direct but only on the more expensive resale market.
There are those who wonder what all the fuss is about. Singapore shows few
signs of descending into anarchy and moral mayhem. Its economy grew 9.9 per
cent last year and looks on course for similar growth this year.
Singaporeans enjoy per capita incomes higher than in New Zealand and only
slightly behind Australia and Britain. More than half the population can
afford to travel abroad each year where they benefit from the strength of
the Singapore dollar. 'In Perth, Singaporeans are called 'birds',' said Mr
Goh. 'When they are in the shops, they go: 'Cheap cheap]'.'
Analysts say that political pressures are part of the reason for Mr Goh's
tough stand. On one side, as prime minister for the last four years, he has
to contend with the formidable presence of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, patriarch of
modern Singapore. On the other side is Mr Lee's son, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, who
has made no secret of his willingness to serve as prime minister.
When he came to office, the mild-mannered Mr Goh promised a more open,
consultative form of government. But that seems to have given way to a more
hard-headed approach. Mr Goh needs to show his cabinet colleagues that he
has a firm grip, particularly with a general election likely to be called in
the first half of next year.
Mr Goh's comments could win votes among the more traditionally-minded,
Chinese-educated population.
But some Singaporeans find the government's attitude hard to stomach. 'It's
the old story in Singapore,' said a local academic. 'The government still
has a siege mentality. It wants to open up to media and other outside
influences insofar as they will benefit the economy.
'But it still wants to control everything, from what we see at the theatre
to what we read. We are the children, it is the father figure. Talking about
Asian values is another way of saying:'We know what is good for you. Obey
us'.'

FT  06 SEP 94 / End of oil strike enhances Abacha's position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of Nigeria's two-month oil industry strike, aimed at forcing an
end to military rule has left Gen Sani Abacha's regime in a strong position
and the civilian opposition in disarray. It has also left the political and
economic problems underlying the recent crisis unsolved.
When pro-democracy groups came together in June to challenge the authority
of Gen Abacha, and secure the release of Chief Moshood Abiola, widely
regarded as the winner of last year's annulled presidential election, his
regime had yet to be tested.
Now Nigerians can be in little doubt that their head of state responds to
opposition with force and is offering a handover to civilian rule on his
terms and in his own time.
Nupeng, the blue collar oil workers union, and Pengassan, the senior staff
association, saw themselves as the vanguard of a movement to restore
civilian rule, but soon found themselves out on a limb.
Damaging though it was, the oil strike was a long-term weapon in a campaign
which had to be won quickly. Nigerian workers lack savings to sustain a long
strike and there was a lack of political leadership to direct a protest
capable of deposing a regime.
The strike paralysed fuel distribution and the refineries and brought the
commercial capital Lagos almost to a halt. In the oil fields in the east,
output of crude oil, Nigeria's only big export, dropped within a fortnight
by 20 per cent.
But essential services such as water and electricity survived the crisis.
Support for the strike was slow in coming from the Nigeria Labour Congress
(NLC), which represents all the main unions. The general strike they called
in July lasted less than two days.
'I feel let down by the NLC leaders. They made a lot of noise but came up
with nothing,' said Mr Milton Dabibi, general secretary of Pengassan in
Lagos yesterday after agreeing a communique with some of his branch leaders
authorising a return to work today.
Mr Dabibi admitted that the mass of the unions' members had had enough of
the strike and that the government's tactics, which he described as 'brute
force', had disrupted the leadership, with four branch leaders in the
state-owned refineries and fuel distribution network under arrest for trying
to carry on the strike.
The army benefited as it took over distribution of scarce supplies of fuel,
but in the big cities ordinary people suffered from the lack of transport
and the closure of factories and banks.
Divisions within the military over whether to appease or suppress the threat
delayed the government's response until mid-August when Gen Abacha barred
the national executives of Nupeng, Pengassan and the NLC from their posts,
closed down the leading independent daily newspaper and arrested Nupeng's
general secretary Mr Frank Kokori and several leaders of the National
Democratic Coalition (Nadeco), which was the focus of civilian opposition in
the south-west.
A wave of attacks on the homes of prominent government critics in Lagos have
been blamed by lawyers on the government. Although the allegations are
unproven, the attacks increased the climate of fear.
The government now has its own administrators in the unions and a partial
lifting of the ban on political activity has allowed the largely anti-Abiola
delegates at the constitutional conference in Abuja to start creating the
nucleus of political parties ready for next year's polls. A purge at the
highest levels of the armed forces and the public sector has placed Abacha
loyalists in key posts.
Mr Abiola is still in jail, needing hospital treatment according to doctors
and Nadeco has proved to be a source of rhetoric but little action. By
calling the opposition's bluff, the government will feel more secure than at
any time since Mr Abiola re-launched his claims to the presidency.
But the grievances felt by the Yoruba tribe in the south-west and the
minorities in the oil-producing areas towards an increasingly rigid and
northern dominated military regime are as deep as ever.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Longing for an economic miracle: It will be a hard climb,
but many remain sure of the future
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
As hundreds of thousands of South Africans gathered a few days ago to give
thanks for the political miracle that led to the establishment of their
country's first democratic government, that same government was coming to
realise how difficult achieving a similar economic miracle was going to be.
While Peace Day marchers nationwide sang the country's two national anthems,
the release of worse-than-expected inflation figures caused bond yields to
soar over 17 per cent, effectively ending the possibility of any further
interest rate cuts.
In response, economists downgraded growth estimates for the year to between
2-2.5 per cent from the previously-expected 3-4 per cent.
All this puts further pressure on President Nelson Mandela and his African
National Congress-led goverment. With nearly half the potential workforce
unemployed and 7m people out of 40m without proper homes, they desperately
want to provide tangible evidence of the fall of apartheid to their
constituents in the form of jobs and housing. But they are constrained by
the need to maintain economic credibility in the eyes of the global
financial community so as to attract new foreign loans and investment to the
country.
In his June budget, Mr Derek Keys, outgoing finance minister, restricted the
allocation to the government's centrepiece Reconstruction and Development
Programme to only R2.5bn (Pounds 696m), to keep to his commitment of
lowering the budget deficit. Despite this, as signalled by last week's
collapse in bonds, the markets still believe a degree of overspending is
inevitable, given the wide range of demands on state resources, particularly
as the new network of local and regional governments is established during
the year.
But, damaging though this might be, the biggest problems faced by the South
African economy are structural and not susceptible to short-term monetary or
fiscal panaceas. A legacy of economic problems from the previous government
(at least before Mr Keys was appointed two years ago) has left the new
administration with a very limited set of policy options.
During the 1980s, growth stagnated but government spending rose
relentlessly. In consequence, the budget deficit rose from next to nothing
to more than 8 per cent of Gross Domestic Product in 1992. Although that
figure has now been brought below 7 per cent, and is budgeted at 6.6 per
cent for 1994-5, government spending still takes up an exorbitant 21 per
cent of GDP, well above international norms.
Given the high personal tax levels already in place, the only viable way of
reducing this is through real cuts in government spending and a willingness
to jettison controversial policies such as the maintenance of high tariffs
for a largely uncompetitive manufacturing industry.
In delivering his annual report last month, Mr Chris Stals, Reserve Bank
Governor, pulled no punches in driving home this point. He emphasised that
unless deep-seated problems such as excessive protectionism, high labour
costs, widespread labour unrest and persistently high inflationary
expectations were tackled immediately, the longer-term growth potential of
the economy would be seriously damaged.
Formidable though these obstacles might be, the outlook is not one of
unrelieved gloom. Inflation may be on the rise again, but even its current
8.2 per cent is well down on the 15-16 per cent reached only a few years
ago; overall inflation for the year is expected to remain in single digits.
While the wave of labour unrest may be damaging, total strike action remains
below levels seen as recently as 1991. Many analysts believe this year's
disputes are artificially exacerbated by the heightened expectations
resulting from the election and the inexperience of a new wave of labour
leaders. Next year's wage talks are expected to be markedly calmer.
Even more encouragingly, the government is publicly committed to a strategy
of pursuing export-led growth and reducing protection for industry in line
with the new Gatt arrangements.
In recent weeks, Mr Trevor Manuel, trade and industry minister, has warned
manufacturers the goverment intends to reduce protection even below
Gatt-required levels in some over-protected industries such as textiles and
the motor industry.
Fixed investment and private savings have both turned around after years of
decline and are rising, while business confidence is at a five-year high.
Exports, in both commodities and manufactured goods, have been expanding
steadily. Foreign reserves remain at pitifully low levels, barely able to
cover five weeks' imports, but indications are that the huge capital
outflows which bled South Africa over the past few years have now largely
ceased.
With total foreign currency-denominated debt at only Dollars 16.7bn (Pounds
11.1bn) and interest payments accounting for just 7 per cent of exports in
1993, South Africa has some scope for new borrowing.
While foreign investment has so far been largely restricted to shorter-term
investments in the bond and equity markets, deterred in part by the
maintenance of the country's two-tier currency, many foreigners remain
remarkably sanguine about the country's prospects.
'I've been very impressed with the sophistication of the infrastructure and
the quality of the people,' notes Mr Steve Walsh, chief executive officer of
the US-based group Pillsbury International, which has just embarked on a
R152m joint venture with the South African food-processor Foodcorp.
'I think this country has a lot of potential,' he says.
The problems are immense, and the country is far from being able to achieve
the Asian 'tiger'-type growth rates it so desperately desires, but the fact
remains that South Africa's overall economic outlook is better than for
decades.
As a report on the country to be released this week by the Union Bank of
Switzerland concludes: 'South Africa has the main ingredients required to
place the country firmly on the high road to development.' It will be a long
hard climb, but South Africans will be hoping that soon, national
celebrations of the country's economic success will be held to complement
this year's political ones.

FT  06 SEP 94 / South African motor industry strike ends
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The five-week long strike that has paralysed the South African motor
industry ended yesterday as workers agreed to return to factories tomorrow.
But no formal resolution to the wage dispute has been reached, and union
leaders say discussions will continue on the issue.
The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, which organised the
25,000 strikers, said the decision to end the stoppage came after
consultation with the union's branches over the weekend. Workers have been
demanding 11 per cent across-the-board wage increases while employers have
been offering 10.5 per cent. The strike is estimated to have cost between
R2bn (Pounds 360m)-R3bn in lost production.
The decision follows an announcement last Friday by Mr Trevor Manuel, trade
and industry minister, that he was scrapping the 15 per cent import
surcharge on motor vehicles as well as cutting tariffs on motor imports from
115 to 80 per cent.
Numsa reacted furiously to the moves, accusing the government of
deliberately weakening its bargaining position with employers. But Mr Manuel
defended the cuts as being in line with recommendations made by an industry
task group that had included union representatives, to help bring tariffs
down to their Gatt-required level of 30 per cent by 2003.
The conclusion of the strike comes just ahead of a critical four-day
national conference for the 1.3m member Congress of South African Trade
Unions, due to open tomorrow At the top of the agenda will be an attempt to
re-define the federation's role in the post-apartheid era.
President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress and Cosatu are formal
political allies and worked closely together in the run-up to the April
elections. Since then, widespread industrial unrest, as well as the
government's tough stance on tariff reduction, has started to sour the
relationship and Cosatu is now keen to reaffirm its links with the party.
Nevertheless, the government is worried that the recent strike wave has been
deterring much-needed foreign investment as well as hampering economic
growth and has called for restraint from the unions. Cosatu's general
secretary, Mr Sam Shilowa, has said publicly that he feels legitimate
industrial action has no effect on international investor sentiment.
Mr Shilowa is reported to have come under criticism from federation members
for lacking the strategic vision to carve a new role for Cosatu in the
post-Apartheid era, and his leadership may be challenged at the conference.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Yeltsin provokes anger of both left and right

<TEXT>
Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, who returned to holidaying in Sochi
after visiting Germany and welcoming the Chinese leadership to Moscow, might
well be tempted to extend his stay after coming under fire from both ends of
the political spectrum.
In Moscow yesterday, Mr Boris Mironov, a junior minister who headed the
state press committee before being sacked for expressing extreme nationalist
views, launched a stinging attack against the president, accusing him of
failing to defend Russia's interests. He said Mr Yeltsin had 'viciously
rooted out' Russian patriotism and no longer deserved the trust of the
people.
'Russia was and remains a great power whose revival and return to its former
position in the world is feared by other countries who have declared
themselves to be the leading seven,' he said. Mr Mironov said Mr Yeltsin had
rejected a programme of national revival needed to remedy Russia's
'spiritual crisis'.
Mr Mironov was sacked on Friday after declaring 'if Russian nationalism is
fascism, then I am a fascist' and suggesting that greater restrictions
should be imposed on the media.
The liberal press reacted with outrage with one newspaper comparing Mr
Mironov's remarks to those of the Nazi propaganda chief, Josef Goebbels. A
government spokesman explained Mr Mironov's removal had shown how the
authorities reacted to the popular mood.
But Mr Mironov defended himself at his former place of work yesterday
despite attempts by his superiors to cancel the meeting. He rejected charges
of anti-Semitism and accused the so-called democratic papers, with the help
of the president, of whipping up a 'hysterical campaign' against him.
However, Mr Yeltsin cannot rely on the uncritical support of the liberal
media.
A front-page article in Izvestia over the weekend criticised Mr Yeltsin for
his behaviour in Germany when television pictures showed him stumbling after
drinking at a state luncheon and then insisting on conducting an orchestra.
The newspaper, which has until now been a staunch defender of Mr Yeltsin's
presidency, said Russians had watched the withdrawal of their troops from
Germany with pride in what had been achieved in 1945.
'But there were also completely different minutes in which millions of our
compatriots experienced completely different feelings of awkwardness, if not
of shame,' it said.
The newspaper compared Mr Yeltsin's behaviour with that of former Soviet
leader Nikita Khrushchev, when he banged his shoe on the table at a United
Nations meeting.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Russia boosts economics teaching: Plan for western-style
research bodies and schools to be established soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government yesterday shattered the inert world of post-Soviet
academic economics by announcing that it would establish a series of new
institutions teaching market economics.
Even more radically, it announced that the new economic research institutes
would not contain 'several hundreds of people' as in Soviet days, but would
be lean, stripped-down think tanks with a small core of specialists and a
circle of associated economists - 'of the western type'.
The announcement appears to signal the end of a prolonged period in which
economic teaching has languished in a trough between full-blown
Marxist-Leninist command economics and a market-driven approach.
Announcing the move, Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister and himself
a former academic, said that 'unfortunately even the financial crisis in the
academy in Russia did not succeed in destroying the old-fashioned academic
approach - so that what you have in the world of institutes are monsters
with several hundred researchers which attract finance according to a head
count. We call on the Academy of Sciences to break with this old system'.
However, as Mr Shokhin said, the Academy has so far failed to respond -
forcing the Economics Ministry in concert with the committee on higher
education to reshape economic teaching round two main institutions - the
Higher Economic School, established two years ago, and a separate but linked
Academy of Contemporary Economics.
The School is already largely dedicated to teaching teachers of economics
and will extend this work; the academy is designed to be self-financing,
offering paid courses to business people and others on the stock market,
macro- and micro-economics and accountancy.
Mr Shokhin said that Russia 'must offer the same level of education in
economics as other leading countries in the world' - stressing that he saw
the new institutes, and their regional affiliates, as forcing houses for
central and local government officials with the loss of an established
aversion to the market. Mr Vladimir Kirelov, the minister for higher
education, said that 'it is important people know what is happening in the
Russian economy'.
The academic godfather of the school is the remarkable Professor Yevgeny
Yasin - a man whose name has been linked to economic reform ever since Mr
Mikhail Gorbachev tried and failed to breathe some reformist life into a
decaying communism in the late 1980s, but who has never been so identified
with any one programme or faction as to join the other casualties littering
the road to reform. Mr Shokhin, himself the only senior survivor from the
first Russian cabinet of 1991, noted that he and Prof Yasin had helped form
a club of reform economists working in the government - 'but since many of
these who had been part of it have since ceased to play leading roles, it
has been wound up'.
Mr Yasin is likely to take the position of president of the new academy  -
though the energy and initiative for the project comes from Mr Yaroslav
Kuzminov, provost of the Higher Economics School - who has doggedly pushed
for reform of the teaching of economics for two years and yesterday appeared
to see it bear fruit.
Mr Yasin said that 'a lot of what is written about reform here and its
effects by journalists and publicists is an emotional reaction and one not
really informed by knowledge of how a modern economy works.
What we have discovered in the last few years is that an economist can be
very well educated in the economics of Marxism-Leninism and be not at all
educated as aneconomist'.
He said that there was a need for specialists to work in the government
departments dealing with the economy. 'This initiative that we academics and
professors are starting is not for us and our generation - it is for the
students of today and tomorrow'.
The programme is being assisted by an Ecu5m (Pounds 3.9m) from the European
Union and will be linked with the Erasmus University in Amsterdam, the
University of Paris 1, together with Milan, Oxford and Cambridge
universities.
Part of the EU grant has gone to purchase copies of the textbook 'Economics'
by David Begg, Rudi Dornbusch and Stanley Fischer - described by Mr Michael
Emerson, the EU ambassador in Moscow and himself a distinguished economist,
as 'the best of its kind'.
Mr Dornbusch has been a sometime adviser to both the Russian and the
Ukrainian governments - while Mr Fischer is now in place as the first deputy
managing director at the International Monetary Fund, where one of his key
tasks will be reviewing the Fund's work on Russia.
He will no doubt be gratified that soon, the new economists will be speaking
his language.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Greeks take the route to central Asia: Entrepreneurs are
seizing their chance to follow the trail of Alexander the Great
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One short business trip was all it took to persuade Mr Pericles Tsompos, an
Athenian importer of hides, that Uzbekistan was a place where Greek
entrepreneurs could flourish.
Mr Tsompos paid Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 129,000) to dismantle the contents
of a bankrupt Greek match factory and transport it by train to Tashkent,
where he set up a joint venture with the Uzbek Timber and Construction
Ministry to start producing matches.
The Dollars 6m investment, in which Tsompos Holdings and other Greek
partners hold a 37 per cent stake, was designed to profit from the collapse
of the centrally planned economy in the former Soviet Union. 'Every box of
matches sold in Uzbekistan used to be imported from Moscow, so this was
clearly an opportunity not to be missed,' says Mr Tsompos.
The risk involved in investing in the ex-Soviet republics does not seem to
deter the Greeks. Some Greek businessmen maintain this is because they are
used to working in a politically volatile environment at home, often without
the help of formal asset evaluations, bank financing or even export
guarantees. Mr Tsompos has also opened a hard currency shop in Tashkent's
museum of modern art, in partnership with the Culture Ministry. It serves as
a showcase for manufacturers of Greek consumer goods, bringing in orders
from Uzbek importing companies.
Tsompos Holdings' latest venture was to become the Greek representative of
Uzbekistan Airways, the state carrier formed when the Aeroflot fleet was
divided up among the former Soviet republics. The Athens-Tashkent flight
every two weeks carries both businessmen and cargo.
Mr Tsompos now plans to offer package tours to Samarkand and Bokhara in
co-operation with the Uzbek state tourist organisation, 'to cater for people
wanting to follow the trail of Alexander the Great through central Asia'.
Other Greek entrepreneurs have started to follow Mr Tsompos, forming joint
ventures with state-owned processors of marble and astrakhan. Before long,
more secondhand machinery should start arriving from Greece, as it is time
to give Uzbekistan's neglected fruit and vegetable processing industry a
boost.
For Greeks who want to do business in central Asia, it helps that Alexander
Makedonska is almost as familiar a name as Tamerlane the Great. Another
factor is an influential, though diminishing, Greek community in Tashkent,
originally refugees who fled when the communists were defeated in Greece's
civil war in the 1940s. 'There's no doubt that being part of the local
heritage helps to open doors for Greek businessmen,' says Mr Yannis Tzen,
head of OPE, Greece's export promotion board.
To establish a longer-term presence in the ex-Soviet market, OPE has opened
a business centre in Odessa. It occupies the building where 200 years ago
the Filiki Etairia, a secret society backed by prominent Greek merchants,
plotted the liberation of Greece from Ottoman rule.
Greek exports to the former Soviet Union amounted to Dollars 230m last year,
against Dollars 124m in 1992, while imports rose from Dollars 427m to
Dollars 513m. According to the Greek Exporters' Association, food and
consumer goods account for most of the rising trend in exports.
Greek trade with Ukraine was valued at Dollars 60m in 1993, handled mostly
through Odessa, where Greek shipowners and traders appear set on reviving
the status they held under Catherine the Great. Investment is starting to
follow, again based on exports of secondhand machinery to start up a joint
venture. In one such partnership, Mr Athanasios Daskarolis, owner of Deka, a
meat-processor which recently upgraded its plant in southern Greece, has
joined forces with Tirs, a Ukrainian trading company, to produce salami near
Odessa.
Mr Daskarolis believes it will be three to five years before his 40 per cent
stake in Deka-Tirs, the joint venture, starts to produce 'a real return. But
it's a good market to get a foothold in while investors from elsewhere in
Europe are still feeling nervous about the former Soviet Union.'

FT  06 SEP 94 / Russian troops on full alert over Caucasus fighting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forces loyal to Mr Dzhokhar Dudayev, president of the break-away Chechen
republic, yesterday seized a rebel strong-hold. Mr Dudayev's victory comes
in the wake of stepped-up Russian efforts to unseat the separatist leader by
backing pro-Russian opposition forces.
The escalation in the fighting in Chechnya prompted General Pavel Grachev,
the Russian defence minister, to put Russian military forces in neighbouring
regions on 'full combat alert' in an effort to prevent the Chechen conflict
from spreading to other parts of the volatile Caucasus.
According to the Russian news agency Interfax, Mr Grachev also said that
military check-points would be established on roads leading to Chechnya and
Russia would tighten its control over Chechen air-space to prevent Chechen
aircraft from harassing targets in Russia.
But despite the tightening of the Russian military net around the borders of
the break-away republic, Mr Dudayev's seizure of the town of Argun early
yesterday morning represents an important internal victory. Twenty
kilometres east of Groznyi, the Chechen capital, Argun was the strong-hold
of Mr Ruslan Labazanov, a 26-year-old rebel warlord who controlled one of
the two leading factions opposed to Mr Dudayev and who has vowed a
blood-feud against the president.
Mr Dudayev's victory, in a battle which Russian reports said claimed dozens
of lives, underscores the dangers attendant upon Russia's controversial
policy towards the break-away Caucasus republic. Chechnya's assertion of
independence three years ago has set a precedent which Russia fears other
regions might be tempted to follow. Mr Dudayev's defiance of Moscow has also
been perceived as a humiliation to which President Boris Yeltsin, keen not
be be outflanked by right-wing politicians, has felt obliged to respond.

FT  06 SEP 94 / General awaits call of destiny: Gen Alexander Lebed is a man
who makes the Kremlin nervous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a Russia which is desperately short of heroes, General Alexander Lebed's
popularity is on the rise. Commander of the 14th army in the Trans Dnestr
enclave, the tall, broad-shouldered, blue-eyed officer appeals to Russians
looking for an alternative to the discredited communist bosses of their past
and the uncertain, sometimes blundering democratic leaders of the present.
At Gen Lebed's headquarters in Tiraspol, the impoverished capital city of
the Trans Dnestr Republic which broke away from Moldova three years ago,
hero-worship is strong. As they sweep invisible dust off the driveway, the
immaculately uniformed young soldiers of the 14th army cannot find enough
superlatives to describe their 'comrade leader': he is 'as intelligent as
Albert Einstein and as strong as Arnold Schwarzenegger', 'a second Suvorov,
a second Kutuzov' (two of Tsarist Russia's greatest military leaders), 'in
all ways a remarkable man'.
The past few weeks have demonstrated that Gen Lebed's writ runs beyond
Tiraspol. The Kremlin has felt uneasy about Russia's most popular officer
since this spring, when Gen Lebed told a Russian newspaper that his country
needed a man like Pinochet, the Chilean military dictator, and described the
Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, as 'a minus'. However, when Russia's
top brass - which is losing its grip over regional commanders throughout the
former Soviet Union - took on the outspoken general in August, trying three
times to oust him, Gen Lebed won. Adoring Russians responded last week by
electing Gen Lebed to the 'Olympus' of Russia's 100 most popular
politicians, a list compiled monthly by the pollsters at Nezavisimaya
Gazeta, one of Moscow's top daily newspapers.
Ranked as the nation's 13th most popular leader, Gen Lebed drew more support
than better known hard-liners such as Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the
neo-fascist politician, and out-scored Mr Yegor Gaidar, the standard bearer
of market reforms.
But while, in the public eye, Gen Lebed appears to be rapidly growing into a
leader of national stature, he is careful not to express open political
ambitions.
'In these times of troubles, I cannot rule out anything,' is Gen Lebed's
careful answer to the question of whether he will one day be the leader of
all Russia. 'But I will do anything my country requires. I have served my
country in foreign wars and civil wars. Whatever my country needs, I am not
afraid to do.'
On the topic of what it is that his country needs, Gen Lebed is more
forthcoming. 'What's wrong with a military dictator?' the general asks,
recrossing long legs clad in camouflage fatigues which look freshly pressed
even late in the evening and enormous black boots gleaming with polish. 'In
all of its history, Russia has prospered under the strictest control.
Consider Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, Catherine the Great or Stalin.'
Gen Lebed's critique of Russian democracy is delivered with the calm
assurance of a battle-tested officer and the smooth charm of a gentleman.
'What our country is trying to do now is completely impossible,' Gen Lebed
explains, offering imported Danish biscuits and rising to prepare coffee.
His intense gaze helps to explain his soldiers' slavish devotion, but does
not detract from the toughness of his message. 'Our leaders have said, 'for
centuries our state has been totalitarian but starting this minute we will
be a democratic state'. This is just not possible. After all, we are still
Soviet people.'
Gen Lebed is also convinced - and many sophisticated political observers
would say he is right - that the democratic order Russian leaders have
struggled to build at such great cost is a matter of absolute indifference
to most Russians: 'Most Russians don't care whether they are ruled by
fascists, or communists or even Martians as long as they are able to buy six
kinds of sausage in the stores and lots of cheap vodka.'
Although Gen Lebed shares some of the hard-liners' preoccupation with
Russia's lost power - he speaks sadly of Russia, with 'our proud history',
now reduced to blindly following recipes 'dreamed up in Arkansas' - he is no
neo-imperialist.
He says he refused an offer to become the minister of defence in the Central
Asian republic of Tajikistan because 'why should I help one group of Tajiks
kill another?'
This sober realisation that Russia's greatness cannot be recaptured through
force of arms in foreign countries is only one way in which Gen Lebed
differs from Russia's civilian hard-liners, whom he dismisses as 'dangerous
populist fanatics'.
As a decorated Afghan veteran he embodies a military order leaders like Mr
Zhirinovsky can only describe and as a central figure in the defeat of the
1991 hard-line coup, democratic politicians cannot accuse Gen Lebed of undue
sympathy for the old, vanquished regime.
But, for all his insistence that order and discipline are the keys to
Russia's renewal and his coy disavowal of any overt political role, Gen
Lebed has a rather idiosyncratic notion of the command structure to which he
is subordinate.
'I have never served Tsars, or Commissars or Presidents,' Gen Lebed says.
'They are mortal men and they come and go. I serve only the Russian state,
and the Russian people, which are eternal.'

FT  06 SEP 94 / Swedish Elections: Swedish opinion polls jolt election
campaign - A walk-over that is now a race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's general election, for weeks apparently little more than a
triumphant victory march for the opposition Social Democratic party, has
suddenly acquired an air of uncertainty which has revitalised the campaign
with less than two weeks to go. Opinion polls published since Sunday showing
a slide in Social Democrat support and a marked swing to the Left and
Environment parties not only jolted politicians. They alarmed financial
markets which for the past two months have pushed up interest rates and
driven down the krona because of concern about the yawning budget deficit.
The prospect of a minority Social Democratic government reliant on a
resurgent red-green camp for a parliamentary majority yesterday helped knock
more than 2 per cent off the Stockholm stock exchange general index and send
five-year government bond yields up more than 40 basis points to more than
11 per cent. Such levels of interest rates already threaten to choke off
Sweden's faltering recovery.
What upset the markets and the Social Democratic leadership was not so much
the fall in support for the party to below 50 per cent - in one poll the
reverse was enough to deny it the parliamentary majority most polls have
predicted throughout the summer. Even the mighty Social Democrats, who have
ruled Sweden for most of the past 50 years, have rarely achieved such a
position in recent times and Mr Ingvar Carlsson, party leader, has long been
braced for a slip.
What he did not anticipate was such a powerful shift to the left, including
the projected return to parliament of a resurgent Environment party, which
failed to overcome the 4 per cent entry barrier to parliament in 1991. The
leftward shift was apparently prompted by the Social Democrats' recent
espousal, albeit reluctantly, of a programme of public spending cuts to trim
the deficit and curb Europe's fastest rising state debt.
Meanwhile, the four parties in the governing right-centre coalition - Prime
Minister Carl Bildt's conservative Moderates, the Liberal and Centre parties
and the Christian Democrats - fell back in the polls to less than 40 per
cent together.
This undermined Mr Carlsson's (and the markets') preferred option should he
fail to win a majority: to forge either a formal or informal alliance with
the Liberals, or possibly the Centre party, aimed at gathering broad
parliamentary support behind a rigorous, long-term fiscal policy.
The shock of the poll results was enough to shake Mr Carlsson out of what
had seemed a severe case of election complacency. Last week, he retired to a
mountain holiday house for three days to rest and plan for government. He
repeatedly refused to meet an increasingly desperate Mr Bildt in a
face-to-face television debate.
Then, on Sunday, he agreed, and within hours the two men were on air in a
strikingly hostile confrontation which clearly illustrated the ideological
split between them. Mr Carlsson insisted that three years of 'new
liberalism' under Mr Bildt had failed and promised investment to tackle
unemployment (now running at 14 per cent).
Mr Bildt attacked the Social Democratic plan to raise income, capital and
wealth taxes and said a return to traditional Social Democrat welfare
policies would be a disaster for Sweden. He warned voters not to 'buy a pig
in a poke' from a 'red-green mess that will undermine Sweden's credibility'.
The dispiriting reality for Mr Bildt, however, is that so far the polls show
no sign of enthusiasm among voters for continuing his campaign to reform
Sweden's overweight public sector and put the emphasis of job creation on
the private sector through favourable income, corporate and capital tax
regimes.
Instead, the latest leftward swing has put pressure on the Social Democrats
to stiffen their commitment to the welfare state. This at a time when
recession has pushed up public spending to a record level equivalent to
almost 70 per cent of gross domestic product.
Many in the Social Democratic leadership acknowledge that this imbalance has
to be tackled. Hence their preference to work with the Liberals, whose
leader Mr Bengt Westerberg supports the welfare state and has a friendly
attitude towards the Social Democrats. However, the polls have shown Liberal
support slipping as low as 6 per cent, compared with their 9.1 per cent
showing in the 1991 general election.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Five Swiss charged over Iraqi 'supergun'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Five Swiss businessmen have been charged with knowingly supplying components
to Iraq for the so-called supergun in contravention of the Swiss weapons
export control law.
The supergun, which was apparently designed to fire a tonne of anthrax on
Israel, has already become a cause celebre in the UK. A trial of British
businessmen for supplying components for the supergun and other Iraqi
military projects collapsed spectacularly in November, 1992 when it emerged
that ministers had approved the activity and suppressed evidence.
The Swiss charged are four employees of Von Roll, a large metals group, and
a director of the trading company, Uldry. A federal prosecutor has submitted
the case to the federal court in Lausanne, which now has to decide whether
or not to proceed with it.
Von Roll said in a statement yesterday that it stood fully behind its
employees. The company said it had received a number of orders between 1988
and 1990 from the Iraqi Ministry of Industry.
They involved the supply of various machine parts, including cylinders,
which according to the client's declaration were intended for forging
presses.
'Apparently, the Iraqi client intended to use the components for the
construction of a so-called supergun, a cannon whose size and weight was
several times greater than any ever seen. Whereas the greatest barrel length
seen in the last 20 years was 37 metres with a calibre of 150 millimetres,
the supergun had a barrel length of 157 metres and a calibre of 1,000mm.
'That the machine parts could be used for a weapon had already been ruled
out because of their size. Our employees could not have foreseen the
possibility of these parts having a military use,' it said.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Cresson bound for Brussels: Commissioners nominated in
France and Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's new European commissioners are to be Mrs Edith Cresson, a former
Socialist premier, and Mr Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the top official in
charge of trade and European policy in the office of Mr Edouard Balladur,
the prime minister.
The contrasting couple starkly illustrate changing attitudes in Paris to the
European executive. France's outgoing Socialist president, Mr Francois
Mitterrand, has nominated an ex-premier. Mr Balladur, the Gaullist premier,
in naming a bureaucrat, has chosen to underline the new French conservative
desire to see commissioners as technocrats under the political thumb of
European Union ministers.
Mr Balladur yesterday invited Mr Jacques Santer, Luxembourg's premier and
Commission president-elect, to lunch to inform him of the nominations.
Sometime this autumn, Mr Santer will preside over a carving up of portfolios
among the new commissioners taking office next January.
The issue of precedence between France's two commissioners has been made
less acute by the Maastricht treaty which limits the number of Commission
vice-presidents to one or two, at the president's choice. In a college of
commissioners which, with Nordic and Austrian enlargement, could top 20, it
is not clear that either of the French appointees would make vice-president.
Mr de Silguy served in the Brussels office of French commissioner
Francois-Xavier Ortoli in the early 1980s, and spent 1990-93 with the
state-owned Usinor-Sacilor steel company. He is known to be interested in
the competition or external trade dossiers held by Mr Karel Van Miert of
Belgium and Sir Leon Brittan of the UK respectively. Some other
commissioners - and governments - will be wary, however, of seeing such
sensitive portfolios pass into French hands. Mr de Silguy played the key
role in orchestrating France's Gatt negotiations, and some of the toes he
trod on in Brussels remain bruised.
Mrs Cresson is most remembered in France for her unpopular stint as prime
minster in 1991-92, and abroad for her comments about the homosexual
tendencies of British men and of the ant-like characteristics of Japan's
workforce. But she remains close to Mr Mitterrand, whose desire to grant her
wish to go to Brussels posed Mr Balladur a problem of political imbalance
with his choice. In the end, Mr Balladur decided that the choice of Mr de
Silguy, who has also worked for Mr Jacques Chirac, would be impossible for
his presidential rival to oppose.
Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, leader of Germany's OTV public sector union, looks
set to become one of her country's two European commissioners after she was
proposed by the opposition Social Democratic party, writes Michael Lindemann
in Bonn.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl met Mrs Wulf-Mathies, 52, just as the SPD released
news of her nomination. Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, said Mr
Kohl respected Mrs Wulf-Mathies's 'ability and hard work', suggesting that
she has his backing. However, her formal nomination will depend on cabinet
approval.
The Free Democratic party, junior partner in the governing coalition, has
said it wants Mr Martin Bangemann, the present industry commissioner, to
remain in Brussels but much will depend on how well the party performs in
next month's general election.
All present commissioners, including Mr Peter Schmidhuber, the other German
one, end their five-year terms at the end of this year, although some will
be renominated. A new Commission formally begins work on January 7 but not
before the European parliament has approved all 17 members. For 12 years Mrs
Wulf-Mathies has lead the 1.9m-strong OTV and would be the first woman to
represent Germany on the Commission.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Economic Watch: German wholesale setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German wholesalers saw turnover in July fall to DM78bn (Pounds 32bn), a real
4 per cent lower than during the same period last year, according to figures
released by the federal statistics office, belying other statistics which
suggest that Germany's recovery is gathering pace. In nominal terms,
including seasonal factors, the sales figure fell by 1 per cent. Wholesale
turnover in the first seven months of this year totalled DM567bn, nominally
1 per cent higher than the very low levels last year when the country was
feeling the full force of its worst post-war recession, and flat in real
terms. Analysts have suggested that the poor wholesale figures reflect
higher demand for investment goods and exports as the economy recovers. High
unemployment and a zero wage round have dampened consumer demand so far this
year.
Spain's official currency reserves rose by Dollars 89.50m in August from
July, according to provisional figures released by the Bank of Spain
yesterday. The official reserves stood at Dollars 44.85bn as of August 31,
the central bank said.

Germany's record lottery jackpot failed to find a winner for the tenth week,
rising to DM42m (Pounds 17.4m) ahead of the next draw on Saturday. Lottery
officials said yesterday no winning card had been turned in for the latest
weekly draw, which would have netted a top prize of over DM35m. Ten players
each won DM1.9m for getting six of 49 numbers right, but winning the jackpot
requires seven numbers. Germans have succumbed to lottery fever as the
jackpot has mounted and bought more than 30m cards last week, with some help
from eager players who come over from neighbouring countries.

Mr Erich Mielke, 86, one-time boss of former East Germany's Stasi secret
police, yesterday once again side-stepped the German judicial system after
his defence accused the presiding judge of bias. The trial in Berlin was
adjourned after 25 minutes when lawyers for Mr Mielke accused the judge, of
bias because he had visited the former Stasi boss in prison last week. Mr
Mielke's defence has said it will try to have the case dropped on the
grounds that the defendant is too old. Mr Mielke first went on trial with Mr
Erich Honecker, the former East German leader, in November 1991 but was
later sentenced to six years imprisonment for the murder of two Berlin
policemen in 1931. To simplify the trial, Mr Mielke is now accused of
murdering a nominal six people who tried to cross the Berlin Wall.

The Hungarian and Romanian foreign ministers said yesterday they would
restart negotiations for a much-delayed friendship treaty between
theirstates. The Romanian foreign minister, Mr Teodor Melescanu, who
yesterday became the most senior Romanian government figure to visit Hungary
officially since the end of communism in 1989, said he hoped the treaty
would be completed by May 1995. Previous negotiations broke down in August
1993 on border and ethnic minority issues. Mr Laszlo Kovacs, the Hungarian
foreign minister, said normalising relations with Romania was a priority of
Hungary's new government and that Budapest was prepared to state in the
treaty it had no territorial claims on Romania - Bucharest's key condition
for signing. In return, he hoped Romania would grant its ethnic minorities
human rights according to European norms. Romania's treatment of its
1.6m-strong ethnic Hungarian minority has been a frequent source of tension
between the two countries.

The European Commission said yesterday it would investigate a plan by
Volkswagen to acquire Sachsische Automobilbau (SAB), a former East German
state-owned car factory, from the Treuhand privatisation agency. Brussels
said the German carmaker's bid for 87.5 per cent of SAB's shares could fall
under its merger rules, but reserved a final decision. In July, it cleared
the way for VW to receive around DM1.2bn in subsidies toward its investment
in SAB. The Commission has four weeks to decide whether the link-up could
harm competition. If it finds 'serious doubts' about the transaction, it
must launch a deeper probe.

Russia's deputy prime minister, Mr Alexander Shokhin, said yesterday he
expected the International Monetary Fund and Russia to hold talks by the end
of October paving the way for a Dollars 4bn standby loan. Moscow would then
be able to resume talks with the Paris Club of western government creditors.
Mr Shokhin, Russia's chief debt negotiator, said an IMF delegation would
come to Moscow this week to meet members of the government. Another
delegation would come after the IMF annual meeting due to take place October
3-4 in Madrid. Russia, which took over responsibility for servicing the
debts of the former Soviet Union when it fell apart in late 1991, owes
western creditors about Dollars 80bn. The IMF has already lent Russia
Dollars 3bn to help buttress the economy. Further loans will depend on
Moscow's willingness to press ahead with its economic reforms.

An investigating committee has asked the Greek parliament to bring criminal
charges against Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the former prime minister, over
allegations that he accepted bribes in the 1992 sale of a state cement
concern. Officials said the parliamentary committee handed a petition to Mr
Apostolos Kaklamanis, parliamentary president, asking that Mr Mitsotakis and
two of his former ministers be tried by a special 13-judge criminal court.
Mr Kaklamanis must now set a date within the next month for a debate and
vote on whether to lift the immunity of Mr Mitsotakis, who was conservative
prime minister from 1990 to 1993, and send him for trial. The 300-seat
parliament, where the governing Socialists have a clear absolute majority,
has already voted in a separate case to try Mr Mitsotakis on charges of
illegal wiretapping. Mr Mitsotakis is accused of accepting Dollars 22.5m in
bribes in the sale of the state-run Heracles cement company to Italy's
Calcestruzzi Cement and Greece's National Bank for Dollars 225m.

<TEXT>
The independent powers of Poland's central bank are under threat, Ms Hanna
Gronkiewicz Waltz, the bank's president, has warned. Her claims, made in a
newspaper interview, come amidst a row with Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, finance
minister, who wants the bank to lower its base rates and thus cut both the
internal and external debt service burden. The central bank, pointing to an
alarming growth in money supply in July, due mainly to the trade surplus and
mounting foreign currency reserves, wants to keep rates at their annual 31
per cent level. At the same time, the bank wants to lower the crawling peg
mechanism from its monthly 1.6 per cent zloty devaluation to 1.5 per cent, a
measure the finance ministry, in turn, is resisting.
Yesterday, Ms Waltz questioned the government's 16 per cent inflation
projection for next year and said this year's 23 per cent target was
unrealistic given current 30 per cent inflation. Mr Kolodko has said that an
interest rate cut and the switch to a lower devaluation rate should be
linked. He has also suggested that the bank should lose its supervisory
powers and a separate agency be established. Ms Gronkiewicz Waltz, nominated
by President Lech Walesa, yesterday said the government 'wanted to establish
political control over the banking system'.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Kohl plays down his party's plans for multi-speed EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany has sought to quell a diplomatic storm
over his ruling Christian Democrat party's proposals to create a 'hard core'
of five nations in a multi-speed European Union.
After the UK joined protests from Denmark and Italy, Mr Kohl distanced
himself publicly yesterday from the proposals put forward last week by Mr
Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary leader of the CDU-CSU coalition group.
Mr Dieter Vogel, chief government spokesman, disclosed that Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, had telephoned Mr Kohl yesterday and
that the Chancellor had reassured him, along with other EU leaders, that the
CDU-CSU paper was not official German policy.
'It is not a paper which has been agreed with the government,' said Mr
Vogel. He said Mr Berlusconi was 'satisfied with the explanation'.
However, Italian officials expressed surprise that Mr Kohl had failed to
step in earlier.
Speculation grew in European capitals that Mr Kohl may have given the paper
his unofficial blessing, in order to float a 'trial balloon' ahead of the
1996 inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty.
Several of the chancellor's closest advisers are known to favour a public
debate to head off misunderstandings and reach clear decisions on future EU
integration at the 1996 conference.
The CDU-CSU paper calls for France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg to press ahead faster with European integration. A day before it
was published, Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, suggested a
'three-tier' Europe with the Franco-German alliance at its core; but he did
not name names.
On Friday, the Italian foreign ministry warned that the CDU-CSU paper could
risk the 'break-up' of the EU. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister and
head of the FDP liberal party, the government coalition partner, condemned
the paper.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, intends to deliver a riposte in a speech
on Europe in the Netherlands tomorrow. He is expected to argue that instead
of a single hard core there should be different permutations of countries
pressing ahead with integration according to their priorities. A senior UK
official explained: 'The notion of first- or second-class citizens is not a
concept that we think is valid or can be sustained.'
Publication of the CDU/CSU paper appears to end the truce on constitutional
debate, reopening questions about Maastricht which struck a balance between
community-wide obligations and looser co-operation between EU governments in
areas such as foreign and defence policy.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Airbus will run project to build military aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FARNBOROUGH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Development and production of the Future Large Aircraft, Europe's proposed
military transport, will be managed by Airbus, the civil airliner
consortium, which announced plans to establish a new military equipment
subsidiary yesterday.
The move is designed to strengthen the FLA group and to help market the
aircraft to potential customers - including the Royal Air Force, which is
considering purchases of the FLA or the Hercules aircraft produced by
Lockheed of the US.
Announcing the move at the Farnborough International Air Show, Mr Dick
Evans, chief executive of British Aerospace, said Airbus had an excellent
record of managing aircraft development projects.
He used the occasion to promote the merits of the FLA against its American
challenger. 'The FLA is right operationally for the RAF. It is also right
economically, with lower life-cycle costs, and right industrially, as it
will protect 35,000 high-tech aerospace jobs in Europe. This is our only
opportunity for 35 years to become a part of a large transport aircraft
programme.'
The separate military subsidiary will include the Italian aerospace company,
Alenia, as well as the four Airbus partners, Deutsche Aerospace,
Aerospatiale, British Aerospace and Casa, of Spain.
The consortium estimates that there may be a market for 350 FLA in Europe
over the next 20 years. The intention is to provide customers with a
fixed-price, fixed-specification programme to reduce the risk of cost
overruns.
Exact shareholdings in the military subsidiary will depend on the financial
commitments from the companies involved and their respective governments,
and on the number of FLA each country requires.
The share-out of work will be determined by similar criteria. British
Aerospace hopes to make the wings for the new aircraft, while Italy and
Spain are competing for the final assembly line.
Shareholdings in the main Airbus Industrie consortium will not be affected
by the move. Mr Evans said the rapid consolidation of the US defence
industry posed challenges for European companies: 'Bringing FLA within the
Airbus consortium is one way of deepening ties between European companies.'
The FLA is competing with Lockheed's latest-generation C-130J Hercules to
replace the RAF's ageing transport fleet. Lockheed has valid export licences
for the UK, but it is under investigation in the US over alleged bribery,
Mr Evans said the FLA would carry more equipment further and faster than the
C-130J, at lower operating costs.
In a separate announcement, Lockheed said that refurbishing the existing RAF
Hercules fleet until the FLA became available in 2002 was not an option.
'Other Hercules fleet operators with newer aircraft have rejected the idea
of refurbishment,' said Mr Mickey Blackwell, president of Lockheed
Aeronautical Systems.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Move to break ceasefire deadlock: Mayhew says UK would
accept IRA statement of intent to end violence for good
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government made a new attempt yesterday to break the deadlock
over the wording of last week's IRA ceasefire declaration by inviting
republican leaders to state unequivocally their intention to end the
violence for good.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said: 'We are not insisting
on a particular form of words. We just need to have an unequivocal assertion
that they intend it should be over for good.'
Sir Patrick's remarks appeared to indicate that a response based on
republican intentions rather than specific wordings could be sufficient to
open the door to exploratory talks with Sinn Fein.
Referring to the British and Irish governments' differing interpretations of
the IRA statements to date, he said he did not doubt Dublin's sincerity in
accepting that the IRA had ended its campaign, but 'we have to be satisfied
from what these people say themselves about their own intentions'.
Sir Patrick met Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, last night at
Hillsborough, the Northern Ireland secretary's official residence. The
meeting was an attempt to agree a common response to the ceasefire and to
discuss progress on a framework document on new constitutional arrangements
for the province, due to be tabled at inter-party talks later this year.
After the meeting, Sir Patrick said: 'Both of us share the common hope of
seeing . . . a permanent end to violence.'
However, the two ministers appeared to be no closer to agreeing on whether
the IRA ceasefire was already a permanent cessation of violence.
Mr Spring said: 'There is a desire by the republicans to be part of the
democratic process . . . I would hope we can move on from here - that there
will be no more violence from the republican side in Northern Ireland, and
what is expected now is that there will be a reciprocation from the loyalist
side.'
He added: 'I personally believe that we can overcome any differences that
have arisen.'
Downing Street officials yesterday played down suggestions that Mr Gerry
Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, was about to receive permission from the US
authorities to make a tour of American cities. Leading Sinn Fein officials
confirmed that they were examining the possibility of a visit to the US by
Mr Adams and other senior republicans, including Mr Martin McGuinness, a
member of Sinn Fein's executive.
A Downing Street spokesman said the US government had given no formal
indication to London that it was prepared to give visas to Sinn Fein
officials.
However, the spokesman made clear that Mr John Major, the prime minister,
would prefer the US to refrain from granting Mr Adams a visa until Sinn Fein
and the IRA had stated that the ceasefire would be permanent.
Reacting to Sir Patrick's demands for a statement on republican intentions,
Mr Tom Hartley, Sinn Fein's national chairman, complained the British were
'piddling about'. He said: 'The Irish government are taking the process
forward. Will the British government not run with it. They're making the
problem worse by just prevaricating.'
Last night, speculation continued that the Ulster Volunteer Force, one of
the main loyalist paramilitary groupings, might call its own ceasefire. Mr
Chris Hudson, a Dublin trade union official who held talks with UVF
representatives last week, said that among unionists 'there was definitely
cautious optimism . . . that they were beginning to feel convinced there was
no sell-out, no deals done, no secret agenda'.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Rate rise fears ease on lower consumer borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The patchy nature of the recovery in UK consumer confidence was underlined
yesterday after official figures showed that consumer borrowing and new
mortgage lending fell back sharply in July.
The figures disappointed the City and slightly damped fears about an
imminent rise in UK base rates.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank
of England, will hold their monthly monetary meeting tomorrow. But although
financial markets still indicate that an interest rate rise will occur soon,
the weaker consumer data yesterday led some economists to suggest the rise
might be delayed until late in the year.
According to the Central Statistical Office, net lending to consumers
through finance houses, credit cards in the Visa and Mastercard system and
non-mortgage building society loans fell to a seasonally adjusted Pounds
296m in July. Net lending in June was a record Pounds 683m.
Measured on a three-monthly basis - a more accurate guide to the underlying
trend - net lending to consumers fell to Pounds 1.19bn in the three months
to July, down from Pounds 1.28bn in the three months to April.
The main reason for the monthly fall, the CSO said, was a significant
repayment of credit card debt. But with monthly credit figures known to be
volatile, analysts were divided about the significance of July's drop.
Although some argued that the data pointed to a weakening in consumer
spending, as April's tax rises gradually began to bite, others argued that
the figures had been distorted by June's record surge in consumer credit.
Doubts about consumer confidence were reinforced yesterday with the
publication of Bank of England figures for new mortgage lending in July. On
a seasonally adjusted basis lending undertaken and loans approved in total
by banks and building societies in July was at a lower level than in June.
City doubts about a rate rise were backed by Bank of England figures showing
the annual rate of growth for M0, the narrowest measure of money supply,
fell to 6.2 per cent in August - its third consecutive monthly slowdown.
Some analysts suggested that this fall might lessen the likelihood of an
interest rate rise.
But others pointed out that M0's annual growth rate remained well outside
the government's 0-4 per cent target range and had been slightly distorted
by a sharp fall in the level of bank deposits.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A move by British Rail to supply staff to help Railtrack keep trains running
during strikes by signal workers was played down yesterday by Mr Jimmy
Knapp, leader of the RMT transport union.
Significant numbers of BR staff have been recruited and Railtrack said that
more than half of services would be running during Thursday's 24-hour
stoppage, the highest proportion so far achieved.
Mr Knapp, pictured after his speech at the TUC conference in Blackpool, said
BR was exaggerating the effect of its 'secondary action'. He told delegates
that the signal workers were standing firm and would fight on.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French oil group is due to report on Wednesday first-half profits that
it has said will be broadly in line with those in the first half of 1993,
when it made an operating profit of FFr3.49bn and net group profit of
FFr1.86bn. Total has seen its crude prices and refining margins come under
the same downward pressure as other oil companies.
These were among the factors that led Elf-Aquitaine, the other French oil
major, to report a 10 per cent drop in first-half net profit last week.
But Total is significantly better placed financially than Elf. With debt
amounting to 23 per cent of equity at the end of last year, it has far fewer
financial charges to carry.

Soviet president, were yesterday locked in a public dispute, the outcome of
which could affect thousands of former property owners in east Germany.
Mr Kohl, who will meet Mr Gorbachev in Bonn on Wednesday, said on German
radio that the Soviet Union had linked its agreement on the German
unification negotiations to Bonn's acceptance as legal the Soviet
administration of what was occupied eastern Germany between 1945 and 1949.
During that time, the Soviet administration expropriated 8.2m acres of land
and hundreds of enterprises. The land was subsequently divided and
distributed to ethnic Germans fleeing eastern Europe.
Last week, however, Mr Gorbachev challenged Mr Kohl, claiming that Moscow
had never linked the expropriation issue with the Soviet Union's acceptance
of the unification talks. Yesterday, Mr Gorbachev was supported in this by
Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, his former Soviet foreign minister.
Their reluctance to support Mr Kohl, who is seeking re-election in October,
coincides with claims by former land-owners who argue that it was west and
east German politicians, not Mr Gorbachev, who agreed among themselves not
to give back land to, or compensate, Prussian aristocrats.
The former land-owners believe that Bonn used the so-called Moscow veto for
different reasons. Bonn, for example, could not finanically support full
compensation, while the first east German non-communist government believed
the former land owners were either former Nazi sympathisers or would return
and expel the small land-holders who had been established by the communist
regime.
After German unification, former property-owners, including Daimler-Benz,
tried to reclaim their property in the east but were over-ruled by Germany's
Constitutional Court, which cited the existence of the Moscow veto. These
former property-owners are seeking the same rights to restitution and
compensation enjoyed by those whose property in Germany was confiscated by
the Nazis between 1933 and 1945, and by the East German communist regime
between 1949 and 1990.
The meeting of Mr Kohl and Mr Gorbachev follows a crucial compromise
agreement by a special joint committee of Germany's lower and upper houses
of parliament about how the government should compensate former
property-owners whose land was confiscated by the Nazis or the communists.
This accord, expected to be passed by both houses this month, would end four
years of wrangling among politicians. It could also help acelerate
investment decisions in the eastern German states, dogged by property rights
disputes.
Its recommendations include:
A DM4,000 (Dollars 2,564) payment to those east Germans never compensed for
confiscated property under the former communists.
The level of compensation, to be calculated on the 1935 valuation of land
and financed from a DM12.6bn (Dollars 8.1bn) fund. Depending on the status
of the property, the value of land will be multiplied several times. Former
owners will be issued with bonds in 2004, redeemable five years later.
Former property owners of the 1945-1949 period will be allowed to buy back a
limited amount of their property at a price below the current market value.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Italian unions warn on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Italian government will this week step up discussion of budget measures
for 1995 in the face of growing threats from unions to create trouble if
their wishes on pensions reform are not respected.
The full cabinet will hold its first formal debate on budget proposals
tomorrow, although the Treasury stressed at the end of last week that no
decisions would be taken on the detail of the budget.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government has to find an estimated L45,000bn
(Dollars 28.4bn) from cuts or additional revenue in 1995, in an attempt to
bring the budget deficit down to L138,600bn. Plans must be agreed and
presented to parliament before the end of the month.
The Treasury has refused to confirm growing speculation that savings worth
an additional L3,000bn or more will be needed to cover the additional cost
of servicing Italy's large public debt following the half point rise in
interest rates last month. Figures released last week by the Bank of Italy
indicated that the overall debt had grown to nearly L1,900,000bn by May.
The Berlusconi government will come under attack internally if it reneges on
election campaign promises not to increase taxes. But Treasury experts
believe they still have some room to raise indirect taxes next year without
increasing the overal fiscal burden, because tax measures introduced by the
previous government expire in 1995.
Mr Innocenz Cipolletta, director general of Confindustria, the Italian
employers' federation, said at the weekend that even a budget which raised
L48000bn next year would not be enough.
But trade unions are resisting the drastic action recommended by the
Treasury to reform Italy's overloaded pension system. Two of Italy's three
main trade union federations - CIGL and UIL - have expressed serious doubts
about the government's plans. Only CISL, the Catholic federation, is taking
a softer line.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Ukraine and Russia patch up relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine and Russia are moving towards normalising their often strained and
fractious relationship. A weekend ministerial summit yielded a series of
agreements to be signed when President Boris Yeltsin visits Kiev in early
October. Also signalling a thaw in military relations was a compromise
splitting land facilities in the Crimea that had held up a final agreement
on the division of the Black Sea fleet.
Many treaties have been signed and broken, but the installation of a new
president in Kiev and the changed political atmosphere in Ukraine hold out
prospects for a lasting reconciliation.
Ukraine and Russia in principle have agreed to avoid double taxation, ease
custom regulations and start work on a customs union and a free trade
treaty. 'The agreements will not resolve all problems existing between
Ukraine and Russia, but it should establish a basis for developing
relations,' said Mr Hennady Udovenko, Ukraine's new acting foreign minister.
A shift in attitude toward Moscow follows the election in July of Mr Leonid
Kuchma, who promised closer links between the former Soviet Union's two
largest states. His predecessor, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, a communist turned
nationalist, often squabbled with Moscow over various issues including
control of the country's nuclear weapons and the Black Sea fleet, based in
the Crimea.
Mr Valery Shmarov, the defence minister, said on Friday that Ukraine would
agree to split the on-shore facilities of the fleet, breaking with previous
refusals to even consider the issue. The two this April had agreed to divide
the ships, with a bulk going to Russia, but details on lease terms and
compensation have yet to be finalised.
Over two years, at least four attempts to divide the 300 vessel fleet's
assets and on-shore installations have failed. An agreement is likely to be
linked to forgiving part of Ukraine's large oil and gas debt.
In the dispute over secessionist moves by Crimea, a mostly
ethnically-Russian peninsula given to Ukraine in 1954, Russia recently has
dealt directly with Kiev, often bypassing Crimean President Yuri Meshkov and
most recently rejecting Sevastopol's bid to join the Russian Federation.

Mazda is to set up a joint venture to manufacture commercial vehicles in
Fuzhou, China, from 1996. The Japanese vehicle group's partners are Fuzhou
Solid Motors, a local company, the Salim group of Indonesia and Tomen, the
Japanese trading company. The venture is expected to call for investment of
about Y10bn (Dollars 101m) and to have an annual output of 10,000 pick-up
trucks rising to 30,000 in 1997. This is in line with the Chinese
government's policy that small truck production should exceed 100,000 units
a year. Local parts procurement is also planned to increase to 50 per cent.
Mazda already has a joint venture in Hainan, in southern China, which
produces several thousand commercial vehicles a year. Last year it began
licensing small commercial vehicle technology to Fuzhou Solid Motor.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Cairo cobbles together a conference, at a price: Mark
Nicholson finds the United Nations population and development gathering
confused, chaotic and costly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Diplomats gnashed their teeth, United Nations officials wore a tired air of
resignation, journalists fumed and sweltering delegates inched their way
painstakingly through a glacially slow registration procedure  - but the
biggest international conference to be hosted by the Egyptian capital was up
and running. Just.
It has proved, according to United Nations conference organisers, one of the
most nerve-jangling exercises in just-in-time management in their
experience. 'In 20 years of attending and organising international
conferences,' said one senior official, 'I have never seen such chaos.'
UN organisers began arriving a week ago to find empty offices where they
expected to find desks, chairs, telephones, faxes and photocopiers. Hundreds
of local staff had not been hired. Telephone lines out of the press centre
were hooked up only two days ago.
But by yesterday, for all the gripes of organisers and some major
outstanding difficulties, some UN officials were privately voicing a stunned
awe at the conference hosts' ability to throw it all together, more or less,
at the last moment.
Some glitches remained. Like the fact that there were no telephone lines
into the press centre to serve a world of anxious news editors. Reporters
from Associated Press were none too impressed to find that the office they
had rented for Dollars 7,000 had been locked up and declared out of bounds
for security reasons.
Late-arriving representatives, meanwhile, were grinding through a
registration procedure averaging five delegates an hour: a combination of
there being too few computers, just two photo-ID machines to process around
4,500 delegates and some fairly grave problems with the spelling of names.
But inside the palatial Chinese-built conference centre 15,000 delegates and
representatives ebbed and flowed in purposeful confusion from makeshift
offices and halls which will host 100 meetings daily.
In what appeared an attempt to lend the affair a subliminal tone of calm and
majesty, dozens of computer terminals ranged around the conference centre
blared out an endless loop of the March of the Slaves from Verdi's Aida.
In what, at the same time, appeared an attempt to give the delegates some
sense of urgency, a digital Population Clock in the centre's foyer
relentlessly ticked up the growth in the world's population, which at noon
yesterday was 5,657,178,226 and rising faster than a person a second.
Outside, Cairo has been transformed. Security precautions are extraordinary.
White-coated police ring the conference centre at 10-metre intervals and
virtually line the main routes to and from hotels. Anyone carrying a bag of
any sort down the 2km of the Nile corniche in central Cairo is searched.
There is at least one security officer on duty for every delegate.
This vast and filthy city has also been given an unprecedented facelift.
Statues have been dusted, every single kerbstone along the main routes has
been painted black or white, flyovers have been repainted, roundabouts
grassed, a whole population of men with brooms has emerged from nowhere to
populate the roadsides.
Quite how much this is costing the Egyptian government is a matter for
conjecture. How they might be financing it, however, is perhaps less so. One
of the chief complaints of UN organisers, diplomats and others at the
conference is that the government appears to have taken every opportunity to
raise as much money from the event as possible.
They cite as examples the fact that hotel rates have been fixed at Dollars
145 a night at all the main hotels, well above the standard Cairo hotel
corporate discount rate of Dollars 80 the organisers had hoped for.
Hoteliers suggest at least 25 per cent of this goes straight into government
coffers. Organisations renting office space have been charged Dollars 10 a
day to rent such things as bookshelves and wastepaper bins. Only an outcry
forced the caterers to abandon charges of Dollars 8 for a sandwich.
A State Department booklet offering orientation and security advice to
visiting Americans stated that US delegates should watch out for 'scams and
rip-off schemes', saying these 'often consist of overcharging for
merchandise purchased or services rendered'. Did this apply to the
conference itself, asked one uncharitable US visitor.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (14): Tide of deregulation
sweeps Europe - Mark Newman sees state-owned operators give way to
competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continental Europe was slow to embrace competition in mobile communications
networks and services. Only three countries - the UK, France and Sweden -
had more than one cellular telephone operator before the launch of GSM
digital cellular networks in 1992.
But within the last two years most countries have licensed at least one
competitor to the state-owned telephone operator. Even Europe's most
reluctant deregulators - Spain, Belgium and Ireland - are being swept along
in a tide of deregulation and industry restructuring.
The transition to competitive markets is having major implications for the
telecommunications services sector as a whole. It has acted as the catalyst
for change at lumbering, inward-facing state-owned telephone operators whose
own mobile communications businesses had, for several years, operated in a
monopoly environment.
Deutsche Telekom has spun off its mobile communications division as a
wholly-owned autonomous subsidiary in a bid to inject private sector
discipline and commercial practices. In Belgium, Belgacom has sold a 25 per
cent stake in its mobile division to AirTouch Communications, the Pacific
Telesis subsidiary. Telefonica of Spain is also considering the recruitment
of a foreign partner, while Stet in Italy is being advised by its partners
to float its mobile communications subsidiary.
The introduction of competition has given expansionist-minded US telephone
companies the opportunity to gain a foothold in Europe. AirTouch, the
company spun-off from Pacific Telesis, is the most successful US
telecommunications services company in Europe. It has stakes in cellular
telephone networks in five European countries: Belgium, Germany, Italy,
Portugal and Spain.
Two other Baby Bells, BellSouth and US West, have also taken positions in
Europe. BellSouth is the dominant force in mobile data with stakes in
operators in the UK, France and the Netherlands. It is also a shareholder in
cellular operators in Denmark, France and Germany. US West owns 50 per cent
of Mercury One-2-One, the UK's third cellular operator.
Vodafone Group, the UK cellular telephone operator, is emerging as the
dominant force in cellular communications in Europe alongside AirTouch. It
has stakes in cellular operators in six European countries other than the UK
 -Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Malta and Sweden. Vodafone is relying on
its overseas interests to boost its profits in the second half of the 1990s
when competition in the UK will inevitably slow profits growth. Vodafone's
overseas cellular interests, which also include stakes in cellular operators
in Australia, Hong Kong and South Africa, are valued at around Pounds 1.5bn.
In most cases, companies such as Vodafone and AirTouch have taken only
minority stakes in cellular operators. Licences are awarded on the basis of
'beauty contests' and national licensing bodies tend to favour bidders with
strong local interests. The largest single shareholder in a bidding
consortium is usually a local company. For example, German industrial group
Mannesmann has a 51 per cent stake in Mannesmann Mobilfunk, and in Italy,
Olivetti is a 36 per cent shareholder in Omnitel Pronto Italia, the group
which won Italy's second cellular telephone network licence earlier this
year.
For companies like Olivetti and Mannesmann with little or no tradition of
operating in the telecommunications sector, the award of licences has
offered them the possibility of expanding into a profitable new sector and
reducing their reliance on core businesses.
The European Commission firmly endorses the transition to competitive
markets. Its green paper on mobile communications published in May says
member states should license at least two GSM digital cellular operators,
and one personal communications network operator.
But the Commission has not been instrumental in the deregulation of the
mobile communications sector. By the time its green paper was published in
May this year - 2 1/2 years later than originally planned - most governments
had already decided in favour of licensing at least one competitor to the
state-owned operator.
'The Commission is confirming trends that have already been established,'
says Mr George Metaxas, a legal expert at the Brussels office of Stanbrook
and Hooper. 'This market has been driven in a legal sense by itself. What
Brussels has done is not exactly an 11th-hour intervention, but they have
certainly left it until the ninth or 10th hour.'
In other respects, however, the Commission is making a bid to lay down its
own agenda, according to Mr Metaxas. 'There are now new issues emerging such
as roaming and restrictions to service providers.'
Roaming is the ability to to use your telephone on a network in another
country. With the new GSM system it is possible to make and receive calls
across the whole of western Europe. But cross-border roaming has aroused
controversy because it makes it possible for someone to take out a
subscription in one country, but use the telephone primarily on a network in
another country.
Telefon und Funk, a German cellular telephone dealer, started selling
subscriptions last year to a Danish GSM network. Telefon und Funk customers
could make calls on both German GSM networks but would be billed by the
Danish operator. The German operators complained and the dealer was forced
to abandon the sale of subscriptions to the Danish network. But the dealer,
backed by the Commission, is now having its case heard at the European Court
of Justice.
Another Brussels proposal which is opposed by a number of cellular operators
is that they should be required to sell their services via wholesalers or
service providers. Service providers would retain a share of around 20 to 30
per cent of subscriber revenues, and would be responsible for billing and
customer management.
The concept of service provision is central to the Commission's green paper
on mobile communications published in May. Another important recommendation
 -one which the cellular operators are firmly behind - is that they should
be allowed to build their own long-distance networks, or use third-party
networks, rather than hand calls over to the state-owned operators. A number
of cellular operators believe that the charges levied by the state-owned
operators for handling calls are too high, and are preventing them from
lowering the price of their cellular services.
After a slow start, continental Europe is now warming to the potential of
mobile communications and the benefits of competitive markets. The total
number of cellular subscribers in Europe is growing by 60 per cent a year
compared to only 30 per cent in the period 1990 to 1992. This coincides with
the impact of competition. In 1990 there were 22 cellular operators in 19
countries offering 22 different services. Today, 33 operators offer 87
different services.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (15): A dash for mobility
all across Asia - The Hong Kong market is to be thrown open to competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telecommunications operators across the world will be eyeing Hong Kong over
the coming months after the recent news that the mobile communications
market is about to be cracked wide open.
The territory's industry regulator, the Office of the Telecommunications
Authority (Ofta), has decided to move ahead with plans that will bring
unprecedented competition, perhaps even as early as April next year. Ofta
aims to license up to 10 new operators across two new technologies, offering
six licences for digital PCN - a high capacity derivative of Europe's
popular GSM, and four using PHP - an almost untried Japanese technology
halfway between conventional cellular and the telepoint (CT-2) phone.
Not surprisingly, the existing four operators - Hongkong Telecom, Pacific
Link, Hutchison Telecommunications and SmarTone - are not overjoyed by the
news.
Few markets measure up to Hong Kong's almost feverish appetite for mobile.
Even CT-2, which proved a disaster in the UK, has been lapped up in Hong
Kong. The arrival of digital technology in the territory has caused so much
demand that by June, one operator, SmarTone, was forced temporarily to halt
accepting new subscribers to clear a backlog of several thousand applicants.
One consequence of mobile telephony's mass market appeal in Hong Kong is
that pricing does not impact as it does in Europe or the US - a situation
upon which industry has not been slow to capitalise.
Ofta's plans to throw open the market has left analysts divided. Some claim
that the market will be swamped, causing prices to plummet, meaning
casualties for some operators. Others say that the operators have long acted
as a cartel maintaining artificially high charges, so increased competition
would be welcome. What is sure is that the tenders for operators will see
international giants queuing up with hopeful bowls extended.
One question which Ofta's move has thrown up is just how high the demand for
mobile telephony can go. Hong Kong already has one of the highest
penetration levels of mobile users in the world at 4.9 per cent, yet Ofta
believes the market is far from saturated. It suggests that demand could
rise to 1.1m users by 1988 - almost a quadrupling of existing users over the
next four years.
While Hong Kong's runaway mobile success now rarely makes headlines, China's
booming cellular market does so regularly. With a fast-growing economy, an
increasing proportion of well-heeled potential customers, and a sorry
shortage of fixed-line connections, cellular phones sales have rocketed,
with subscribers increasing by more than 300 per cent annually over the past
two years.
China's most important economic region, Guangdong, will have spent Dollars
1bn on cellular equipment by the end of the year, by which time its mobile
users could even overtake Hong Kong. This growth has been achieved despite
the high cost of connection and handset fees which at Yuan 20,000 (Dollars
2,300) work out at 12 years' salary for the average worker.
One interesting phenomenon unique to the Chinese market is a preference for
large handsets. The bulkier the model, the greater the attraction, for there
is great prestige in being seen to carry a large handset, however brick-like
it may appear across the cultural divide.
With little alternative in terms of fixed-line connections, over 150
cellular networks covering all major cities and ambitious plans for far
greater capacity coming on stream, China's extraordinary growth levels look
set to continue. By the end of 1994, the number of mobile users is expected
to top 1.2m. There are few markets where cellular telephony can truly claim
to have taken the place of fixed networks, but China is one.
While India too offers this potential, with fixed-line penetration at a mere
eight lines per thousand population, plans have been stalled by lengthy
court battles over licence allocations for Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and
Madras. When mobile finally arrives in the subcontinent, the effect could be
dramatic.
Interest throughout south-east Asia has quickly picked up, with Malaysia and
Thailand clinching growth rates of around 70 per cent in 1993. Not far
behind were Australia, the Philippines and South Korea, all clocking up over
50 per cent growth.
Even the Japanese market - where interest has long been modest given the
size of potential demand - has recently seen a sudden dash for mobility.
Mobile phone users jumped by 488,000 between April and July - more than the
total of new subscribers recorded for the whole of 1993  - and handset sales
are expected to top 1.5m by the end of the year. This sudden spurt of
interest coincides with the opening of digital networks and a change in the
law, allowing Japanese customers to purchase their handsets, rather than
rent them, for the first time.
The latest digital handsets are proving far more popular than analogue
varieties, despite being about 30 per cent more expensive. The result has
seen Japan kick-started onto a higher plane of growth.
Another market rapidly rising up mobile statistics charts is Thailand. Here
the main spur to demand, particularly in Bangkok, has been competition
between handset dealers. A basic analogue model now retails at Bt30,000
(about Pounds 780) and a digital handset goes for Bt33,000 to Bt35,000. In
the capital, a shortage of public phone boxes and relentless traffic jams,
which keep people in their cars for hours at a time, has also helped boost
interest in mobile.
Unlike China, a dearth of fixed lines may not matter so much in Bangkok,
since those who can afford a mobile almost certainly have a fixed-line
phone. This does not hold true for provincial areas where waiting lists for
connection to fixed lines are long. Demand in rural areas is set to rise for
the odd reason that long-distance calls are cheaper on a mobile than on the
fixed-line network.
One spur to growth in Asia's mobile markets is competition. The regulators
have been willing to issue licences to new operators. The Philippines has
five, Malaysia has six, while Hong Kong and Thailand have four. Japan tops
the list with a total of nine competing networks. Yet the country that lays
claim to the highest penetration level of mobile users, Singapore, has
achieved a base of 6.3 per hundred population, through a monopoly-provider,
Singapore Telecom. ST offers attractively-priced tariffs with monthly access
fees at SDollars 50 and airtime charges of 20 cents per minute across the
board.
But the wave of liberalisation sweeping across Asia has not stopped at
Singapore, and ST will be working hard to ensure the greatest returns from
its mobile monopoly before it is joined by a second cellular operator in
three years' time.
While analogue networks still form the lion's share of Asia's mobile
networks, they will soon be overtaken by digital. Almost all new licence
awards in the region stipulate that digital technologies be employed, of
which Europe's GSM has proved the most popular.
According to the London-based communications consultancy, CIT Research,
there could be over 30m digital cellular users in the Asia-Pacific by 2003.
The largest market will be Japan with over 12.8m, followed by China with
around 7.1m. In only nine years' time, says CIT, some 2.1m South Koreans,
1.9m Australians, 1.8m Thais and 1.3m Taiwanese will be carrying digital
cellular phones, at which time the total market for mobile services in the
region will be worth Dollars 20.3bn.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (13): Tariff packages get
more complicated - Mark Newman tries to unravel the cost of a cellular phone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN

<TEXT>
Buying a cellular telephone used to be straightforward. UK operators Cellnet
and Vodafone had only one set of prices and the same telephone could be used
on either network.
But since the two introduced new consumer tariffs two years ago, things are
more complicated. The UK now has four cellular operators, offering a total
of 15 price packages on six different networks. Cellular phones cost from
Pounds 25 to Pounds 300, and there are different telephones for different
types of networks. If you change networks, the chances are that you will
need a new telephone.
Choosing a cellular telephone and network is a confusing business. Market
research company Romtec estimates that only 3 per cent of those who buy
cellular telephones know in advance what network and tariff band they want.
A survey of cellular telephone dealers by Cellnet earlier this year found
that dealers are involved in 88 per cent of all connection decisions. But
they do not always give impartial advice. A dealer is more likely to
recommend a network and telephone which generate a high profit margin than a
low one.
A report this summer by the London-based X25 Partnership shows the total
cost of subscribing to cellular telephone services across Europe over three
years. Mercury One-2-One and Orange, the two newest UK cellular operators,
offer the cheapest services, although their level of network coverage is not
as good as Cellnet or Vodafone.
There are wide fluctuations in the price of cellular telephones and services
in western Europe. Scandinavia is the cheapest region in Europe, and
southern Europe tends to be the most expensive. The cheapest service for a
high user is offered by the Danish operator Sonofon at an average annual
cost of Dollars 708, according to the X25 Partnership. France and Germany
are two of the most expensive countries with annual costs of Dollars 1,874
and Dollars 1,728 respectively. The European average is Dollars 1,302. The
costs assume 140 minutes of peak-rate usage and 10 minutes of off-peak calls
a month.
Several operators in Europe now offer services geared to people who make
only occasional use of their telephones. These have lower monthly charges
but higher call rates than ordinary services.
Sonofon again ranks as the cheapest operator for occasional users. A
customer who makes 50 minutes of calls a month, of which 25 minutes are at
peak times and 25 minutes off-peak, pays Dollars 318 a year over three years
in Denmark. This compares with Dollars 433 in the UK, Dollars 591 in Italy,
Dollars 783 in Germany and Dollars 1,020 in France.
Cellular operators are beginning to offer innovative tariff packages to
differentiate themselves from their competitors. Some include free calls in
the monthly subscription charge. UK operator Orange has five different
monthly subscription packages varying in price from Pounds 15 to Pounds 100.
The cheapest package includes 15 minutes of free calls, and the most
expensive, 540 minutes.
Operators are also starting to offer regional and distance-related tariffs.
When cellular services first appeared in Europe, operators had only one peak
and one off-peak rate. It did not matter whether the call was local or
long-distance.
But operators such as Mercury One-2-One and E-Plus, Germany's third cellular
operator, are introducing a regional element into tariffing. This is partly
because it will take them several years to build nationwide networks. At
first, services will be available only in urban areas.
In response to competition from Mercury One-2-One, Vodafone has launched its
own regional service called MetroDigital. There are five different peak
rates according to whether calls are local or long-distance, and if they are
made from a rural or an urban area. Calls are charged at half-rate if they
are made from the customer's home call - a small area centred around the
subscriber's home or office.
A sharp fall in the price of GSM telephones since 1992 means that in most
countries GSM services are cheaper than those on the original analogue
networks. In Germany, which accounts for more than 50 per cent of Europe's
2.5m to 3m GSM subscribers, the retail price for telephones was DM2,000 to
DM3,000 when services were launched in 1992. But a combination of price cuts
by manufacturers and heavy discounting by German service providers means
that the street price of telephones has now fallen to DMI00.
There is a large discrepancy in the price of GSM telephones in different
countries despite the fact that a telephone sold in one country can be used
in any other. The average price of a GSM handportable telephone in Europe is
Dollars 557, according to the X-25 survey. But in Austria, Ireland and
Italy, telephones cost more than Dollars 1,000. The cheapest markets tend to
be those where GSM sales are highest such as Denmark and Germany, or where
prices have to be low to compete with analogue network services such as the
UK.
The growing maturity of the cellular telephone business in Europe is
evidenced by a more sophisticated approach to tariffing. Most operators now
have a range of packages, aimed at different segments of the market. But
potential subscribers should beware. Cellular telephone services are still
several times more expensive than fixed network services, and subscribing to
a service which does not correspond to your needs could prove an expensive
mistake.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (12): Scramble for licences
 -Louise Kehoe looks at the US market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T's Dollars 12.6bn acquisition of McCaw Cellular Communications, which
was approved by US regulators this summer, has set the stage for the
reshaping of the US mobile communications industry as regional cellular
telephone companies and new entrants race to create nationwide mobile
communications services.
The union of the long-distance telephone giant with the leading US cellular
carrier creates an industry behemoth. AT&amp;T invented cellular telephone
technology more than 30 years ago and is a big manufacturer of cellular
equipment, but until now it has been unable to offer mobile phone services.
The megadeal is driving regional phone companies and cellular carriers into
each others' arms as they scramble to get ready to compete with the new
industry force.
Since early July, two regional 'Baby Bell' phone companies, Bell Atlantic,
which serves the mid-Atlantic region, and Nynex, which serves New York and
New England, have decided to unite their cellular operations to create a
giant east coast network, stretching from Maine to Virginia and serving 1.8m
customers.
US West, which serves 14 mid-western states, has agreed to merge its
cellular interests with Airtouch, a recent spin-off from Pacific Telesis,
the west coast regional telephone company. Together they will have 1.7m
customers. Ameritech, the Chicago-based Baby Bell, is reported to be seeking
a similar alliance.
The US cellular market has been fragmented since it began in the early 1980s
when the US government gave out just two operating licences in each region,
one for each of the established local telephone companies and one for a new,
independent rival.
McCaw, which build up a national presence by taking over many of these
independents, is already a tough rival to local phone companies and the
injection of AT&amp;T's long distance resources promises to make it even
tougher.
Although regional telephone companies have bought up cellular licences
outside their regions, this has created a jumble of networks of differing
standards. As a result, cellular telephones purchased in one part of the
country do not always work in other places and charges for accessing
different networks can be prohibitive.
Nonetheless, the US cellular market has grown from virtually nothing in the
early 1980s to more than 16m subscribers at the end of 1993 with some 14,000
new customers signing up every day, according to EMCI, a Washington-based
communications consultancy. The total number of US cellular telephone
subscribers will reach 20m by the end of this year, the researchers predict,
with growth continuing at a rate of 25 per cent a year for the next two
years.
In addition, more than 18m people in the US subscribe to paging services,
which have become very popular as a low cost form of mobile messaging
services among teenagers as well as by business people.
New technology is driving change in the US wireless communications industry.
In December, the Federal Communications Commission will put up for auction
licences to operate new 'personal communications services' - using low
powered, high frequency, digital micro-cell transmitters that promise to
make wireless telephone services price-competitive with conventional
'wire-line' networks.
If the recent auction of licences for advanced two-way paging services is
any indication, demand for the broadband PCS licences will be strong. The
paging licences were sold for Dollars 617m, well above the anticipated
amount.
Killen &amp; Associates, a California market research group, estimates that the
sale of PCS licences will raise Dollars 25bn to Dollars 30bn, well above
government and industry estimates of Dollars 10bn to Dollars 12bn.
'The FCC's recent auction of advanced paging and interactive video data
service licences surprised many economists and financial analysts, who
thought the government would collect only Dollars 50m or so,' says Mr
Michael Killen, the group's president.
'A winning bid at the broadband spectrum auction may be the regional
telephone companies' last chance to maintain some control of their core
businesses,' he adds.
More than 2000 PCS licences will be put up for sale. Some will be for single
metropolitan markets, others for large regions. Companies hoping to put
together enough licences around the US to create a nationwide PCS network
will probably have to bid hundreds of millions of dollars.
Both local and long-distance companies are preparing to bid for PCS
licences, some of them in teams. The looming PCS auctions are another factor
driving industry alliances as companies join forces and figure out where
they need PCS licences to complete nationwide mobile communications
networks.
By the year 2003 nearly one in 10 US residents will be subscribing to PCS
according to Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, a Wall Street brokerage firm. The
analysts predict that PCS will not make a significant impact until 1997, but
will then grow rapidly to account for 25.4m users out of a total market for
cellular-type users that will have grown to 103.6m subscribers by the end of
2003.
Yet another challenge to established cellular telephone service providers is
posed by Nextel, a dispatch radio service company with ambitious plans to
create a nationwide mobile communications network combining voice, data,
paging and dispatch radio services.
Nextel has amassed 'special mobile radio' licences, traditionally used for
vehicle dispatch services, from coast to coast through a series of
acquisitions and licence purchases.
But it suffered a setback last month when MCI , the US long distance
carrier, withdrew from plans to acquire a 17 per cent stake in Nextel for
Dollars 1.3bn. MCI was to have been Nextel's marketing partner. The
companies are still exploring the possibility of a strategic alliance, but
on different terms.
Whatever happens, Nextel claims that it will be the first company to offer
advanced wireless voice and data communications services nationwide.
Analysts predict that Nextel will win 15 per cent of mobile communications
subscribers by the end of the decade, by which time PCS systems are expected
to account for about 35 per cent of the total.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (11): New breed of
satellites into orbit - Paul Taylor looks forward to the global mobile
systems of the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By the end of the decade, a new generation of telecommunications satellites
will provide global mobile telephone services, using lightweight
pocket-sized handsets for voice as well as data communications.
Plans for multi-billion dollar global satellite mobile communications
systems such as Iridium, Globalstar and Inmarsat-P are already well advanced
and on target to launch services beginning in 1998. Others, including
American Mobile Satellite, plan to launch satellite-based telecommunications
services in the North American market next year.
Satellites are not new to the telecommunications industry. Geo-stationary
satellites, which operate at an altitude of 22,300 miles, have played a key
role in fixed and mobile telecommunications networks since the early 1960s,
providing voice, data and video links over continents and oceans, maritime
and aeronautical communications where land-based systems are ruled out and
global positioning and tracking services for military and commercial
customers.
They also provide telecommunications facilities to geologists, journalists,
aid workers and others in remote regions of the world using briefcase-size
portable terminals, such as those supplied by Inmarsat, the London-based
74-member International Maritime Satellite Organisation. Inmarsat uses five
operational satellites to provide services to 40,000 customers, most of them
in its specialist maritime and aeronautical markets.
However, projects like Iridium and Globalstar are based on a new breed of
low-earth orbit (Leo) satellites which operate at altitudes of 400 to 1,000
miles. Because they are closer to earth than Geo-stationary satellites,
Leo-based systems will work with less powerful, smaller, lighter and cheaper
equipment.
But there are disadvantages. Leo satellite technology - much of it based on
Reagan-era 'Star Wars' research - is costly and largely untested. In order
to provide reliable global coverage, many more Leos are needed than would be
the case with their higher-flying counterparts which also means a large
number of launches, and an extended roll-out period. In addition, the
satellites themselves will have a relatively short life-span of five to
eight years for Iridium satellites compared with 10 years or more for
conventional Geos.
Undaunted, high-powered international consortia have unveiled proposals for
about half a dozen Leo-based mobile systems over the past few years while
other groups have announced proposals to build new wireless networks based
on conventional satellite technology. As a result, satellite communications
has become one of the hottest subjects in the global communications
industry.
Nevertheless, as KPMG Peat Marwick concluded in a recent study for the
European Commission, 'limits on finance and radio spectrum probably mean
that only two or three of the systems will ever reach the launch stage.'
Among the front-runners are the Dollars 3.4bn Iridium project, conceived by
Motorola, the US-based electronics group, and the Dollars 1.8bn Globalstar
project developed by Loral, the US defence group, and Qualcomm. Both Iridium
and Globalstar have crossed an important financing threshold by raising
initial finance from investors.
Iridium will be based on a 'constellation' of 66 small Leo satellites
weighing 1,500 lb ringing the earth at a height of 420 nautical miles.
Handsets for use of the system will be dual-mode, also allowing calls to be
made on the local cellular network where available.
When a call cannot be routed via the terrestrial cellular network, it will
be relayed to the nearest satellite, transferring between satellites if
necessary, before being beamed down through one of 15 to 20 terrestrial
gateways connected to the public telephone network or direct to its
destination.
A year ago, Motorola raised Dollars 800m from an international consortium,
including Raytheon, Lockheed and Sprint of the US, Bell Canada and 18
Japanese companies including Sony, Mitsubishi and Kyocera as a first stage
towards financing the Iridium project. More recently, a group of Indian
financial institutions agreed to invest Dollars 32m in Iridium and Comsat,
the US satellite operator, is understood to be discussing investing Dollars
70m to acquire a small stake in the project.
As prime contractor for Iridium, Motorola will be responsible for designing
and building the entire network and has a Dollars 2.8bn contract to maintain
and operate the system for five years after its commercial debut in 1998. By
then, Motorola's stake in the project is expected to have fallen from 34 per
cent to 15 per cent.
But Iridium is likely to face fierce competition from Globalstar which has
secured Dollars 275m of equity funding from another international
consortium. Globalstar's list of strategic partners now includes France
Telecom and Alcatel of France, Airtouch Communications of the US, Deutsche
Aerospace, Dacom and Hyundai Electronics of South Korea and Vodafone, the
UK-based cellular network operator.
The company is now in talks with satellite launchers including China's Great
Wall Industries. Two or three are expected to be chosen by the end of the
year. Globalstar will use 48 Leo satellites orbiting at 750 nautical miles.
It has been designed by Loral as a low-cost global access satellite-based
mobile telephone system. Globalstar telephones will be similar in size and
cost to digital cellular telephones and will be able to make and receive
calls anywhere in the world.
A key feature of the proposed Globalstar system is that all calls will be
set up and processed on the ground by a distributed gateway system. Loral
claims the ground processing not only permits a more efficient, less complex
and cheaper satellite network; it also uses, rather than bypasses, existing
communications carriers making it more attractive to them.
For example Vodafone, which has acquired a 10 per cent share in Globalstar
under a Dollars 51m agreement, will have exclusive use of the Globalstar
satellite service in the UK, Hong Kong, Greece, Denmark, Malta and
Australia. In Australia, Vodafone plans to use the satellite based service
to supplement its ground-based cellular networks - when a mobile phone
customer on the Vodafone network goes into an area that is out of range of a
ground base station, the phone can switch to satellite reception, ensuring
total coverage and reliability.
Inmarsat, which had originally planned to build its own Leo system, has
opted instead for a system based on a new intermediate circular orbit
satellites orbiting at 10,000km which it believes will overcome some of the
technical and other problems associated with Leos and meet the concerns of
some its members
The Inmarsat-P system will cost Dollars 2.4bn and be developed by an
affiliate company, at least 70 per cent owned by Inmarsat and its
signatories, which will also invite outside investment. It will use 12 to 15
satellites and be operational by 1999 or 2000.
To supplement revenues from voice traffic, most of these new satellite
systems also plan to provide facsimile, paging, computer data and position
determination services. This will bring them into direct competition with
another group of network operators that plan to use 'little' Leos to provide
non-voice telecommunications services and with Teledesic, a Dollars 9bn
satellite communications project backed by Mr Bill Gates, chairman of
Microsoft, and Mr Craig McCaw, of McCaw Cellular Communications, the largest
US cellular telephone company which was recently acquired by AT&amp;T.
Teledesics envisages 840 little Leos put into orbit 435 miles above the
earth. The system, due to come into operation by 2001, is designed to
deliver high capacity data, video and voice services worldwide using
receivers and small antennas installed in homes and businesses.
Just how large a market there will be for these voice and other mobile
satellite-based services by the end of the century is a moot point. The KPMG
study suggested that the value of satellite delivered mobile phone services
will reach Ecu10-20bn a year within the next decade.
Among the prospective network operators, Iridium expects to have 1.5m
subscribers by 2002 while Globalstar, which promises to be the 'low cost
service supplier', aims to have signed up 2.7m subscribers by the same date,
the bulk of which will be in rural areas and developing nations where wired
systems are not cost-effective.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (10): A force to be reckoned
with - Profile / Ericsson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications equipment supplier, is without
question the dominant force in the international cellular infrastructure
market. It has a significant foothold in every major market, and its sights
are firmly focused on new opportunities - notably new digital systems,
mobile data and fixed cellular systems.
Ericsson owes its success to the classic Machiavellian combination of
fortune and exertion. The company's cellular division grew out of SRA, a
well-established military radio joint venture between Ericsson and Marconi.
Marconi chose to sell its 30 per cent stake in 1981, the year SRA entered
the cellular mobile market; whereupon the venture became an integral part of
Ericsson.
The radio division's rapid expansion thereafter owed much to Ericsson's
existing marketing and distribution networks worldwide. It built on the
success of its public telecommunications products - notably the AXE switch,
which is now installed in 105 countries.
Furthermore, Scandinavia has been the world's most dynamic cellular market
since the launch of the mobile phone. Sweden tops even the Nordic league
with 10 mobile phones per 100 inhabitants. Cultural factors are partly
responsible; but early agreement on a common Nordic cellular standard - NMT
 -provided a significant boost, as did the mid-1980s decision to liberalise
the supply of cellular handsets, a step taken in Japan as recently as this
year. The extent to which Ericsson acted as a catalyst for these
developments is debatable, but the benefit it has derived from them is
unmistakable.
The bald figures tell all. In revenue, Ericsson's radio communications
division last year overtook public telecommunications as the company's
largest division, accounting for 41 per cent of sales. The division's sales
amounted to Dollars 3.1bn - a 73 per cent increase on 1992. The first half
of this year saw a still more dramatic surge of 78 per cent in pretax
profits, powered by a 60 per cent rise in radio communications sales. Sales
of mobile telephone systems and terminals were up 80 per cent.
'Everyone in the mobile industry has been successful with the massive
cellular growth of recent years,' says Mr Kurt Hellstrom, president of
Ericsson radio systems, with a modesty befitting the division's plain and
functional headquarters at Kista, a northern suburb of Stockholm.
Nonetheless, he is quick to identify the 'strong suits' which have made
Ericsson outstanding. 'We realised early on the potential for cellular
mobile technology, and we were fortunate in having strong in-house divisions
in all the main areas needed to develop a portfolio.'
Ericsson's radio division has never rested on its inherited laurels: it has
been quick to exploit new market opportunities and has not stinted on the
large R&amp;D outlays critical to innovation in the sector. R&amp;D spending in the
radio division is running at about 20 per cent of sales. Ericsson is the
only supplier to have developed widely-used digital systems based on the
world's three standard digital systems - GSM (in Europe and beyond), D-Amps
(in the US), and PDC (in Japan). In January, more than half of the world's
1.3m GSM subscribers were linked to Ericsson systems.
Last year, it responded to the acute shortage of digital GSM handsets by
rapidly increasing its own supply - output rose by 150 per cent last year -
although it had previously treated the handset business as marginal.
Motorola of the US remains the largest handset manufacturer, but Ericsson
claims now to be the world's leading supplier of digital pocket telephones.
Ericsson is the international company par excellence: its Swedish sales
amount to only about 10 per cent of the total. It is important, however, to
get behind the slogan and to understand the meaning of 'international' in
the Ericsson context.
Although the radio division has indigenous marketing, R&amp;D and technical
support staff in all its principal markets, Ericsson's senior management is
almost exclusively Swedish and most of its manufacturing is carried out in
Sweden. Some companies go international by recruiting foreigners, others by
inducing an international mind-set into home-grown managers. Ericsson, like
most of Swedish industry, is emphatically in the second camp, and has long
fostered close links with all the country's technical universities.
About two-thirds of the radio division's blue-collar workforce is located in
Sweden, mainly at plants at Kumla, west of Stockholm (for handsets) and
Gavle, 160km north of Stockholm (for infrastructure). Another plant in
Visby, on the Swedish island of Gotland, is being expanded for
infrastructure. The only large plants abroad are at Lynchburg, Virginia,
which manufactures equipment for the AMPS system, and is the main centre for
land mobile radio, and at Nanjing and Guangzhou in China, where local
content is in effect a condition of entry.
Increased production is unlikely to lead to a significant increase either in
blue-collar staff or in plants abroad. Five years ago it took three hours to
assemble a cellular handset; now it takes about 15 minutes. It is the same
story with radio base stations.
As for overseas production, Ericsson recently designed, built and installed
a cellular network for the Digital Phone Group, a new competitor to NTT in
Japan, in 18 months from the placing of the order. It was a record, and the
entire production took place in Sweden. 'It is speed of production most
customers want, not local content,' says Mr Bjorn Bostrom, production
director. 'The closeness between design and production is the key. Today,
when you design a product, it has to be manufactured instantly and in high
volumes: production lines are becoming more complex, so the need to have
your development and production staff in close contact is increasing.' More
than a quarter of Ericsson Radio's Swedish workforce have degrees, many of
them higher degrees.
More important than production abroad is the dedicated teams working with
customers to design and install their networks. 'This raises tricky
questions of confidentiality and intellectual property,' says Mr Hellstrom.
'Certain operators still think that to have a vendor and to have a monopoly
over them is an advantage. We, on the other hand, want to put our R&amp;D people
to use with as many customers as possible - and it is to their advantage,
too.'
Ericsson sees three new large cellular markets on the horizon: mobile data;
fixed cellular systems to replace copper or even fibre in the local loop;
and a mass consumer market for cellular phones and cordless communications.
It is difficult to predict their growth rates, but safe to assume that
Ericsson will play a key role in all three.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (8): Battle on standards -
Paul Taylor on cordless prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR

<TEXT>
The launch of telepoint services in Britain in the late 1980s was, by
general agreement, little short of a debacle which culminated in Hutchison
Telecom's decision to pull the plug on its Rabbit cordless public telephone
service last November.
Rabbit was the last of four telepoint services in the UK to fold because of
lack of customer interest but, in spite of this inauspicious start,
telepoint, the UK-developed public cordless telephone service, is proving a
success in some overseas markets including south-east Asia, where there are
more than 300,000 subscribers.
Unfortunately, the UK systems were incompatible with each other, overpriced
and poorly marketed in competition with cellular services.
Elsewhere in Europe, Deutsche Telekom abandoned plans two years ago for a
telepoint service and Telecom Finland recently announced it would close its
Pointer telepoint service because of the low level of take-up of the
service.
This leaves France and the Netherlands as the only European countries still
offering telepoint services. There are over 50,000 subscribers to France
Telecom's Bi-Bop service, which recently cut its prices, and 35,000
subscribers to the Dutch Greenpoint service but the prospects for telepoint
elsewhere in Europe look bleak.
In contrast in Hong Kong, three operators Hutchison, Chevalier Telepoint and
Pacific Telelink, which is backed by Vodafone, the UK cellular telephone
network operator, have all launched successful services and now have more
than 170,000 subscribers between them out of a population of 3m.
Their success has been ascribed to the density of the population and the
relatively few base stations required to provide coverage in the colony. All
three telepoint operators in Hong Kong have overcome one of telepoint's main
limitations - its one-way only operation by basing services on telephone and
pager packages facilitating pseudo two- way operation. Calls to a telepoint
telephone activate a pager and if subscribers are in range of a base station
they can connect with the caller by pressing one button on the phone.
In order to further increase competition in Hong Kong, the government said
in July it would award four additional telepoint licences to build networks
based on the Japanese personal handyphone standard. DDI, one of Japan's
three domestic telephone companies, announced plans in July to invest Pounds
2bn on a telepoint network covering about half the Japanese population.
Telepoint has also proved popular elsewhere in Asia. Services have been
launched in half a dozen countries, including Singapore, Malaysia and
Thailand. However China, where the first telepoint services were recently
launched, represents by far the largest potential market for CT2 equipment
suppliers.
Meanwhile, the technology behind telepoint has found other applications  -
by the end of the decade market analysts predict that up to a fifth of new
office telecommunications equipment installed will be cordless.
'Wireless office equipment will grow from virtually nothing in 1993 to
nearly 20 of the market by the year 2000 while wireline-based PBXs (private
branch exchanges) and key systems dip correspondingly,' said Frost &amp;
Sullivan, the US-based market research firm in a recent report.
The uptake of cordless business communications systems is expected to be
driven by falling hardware prices and the perceived benefits of the
technology in terms of mobility, flexibility and productivity. The Frost &amp;
Sullivan report predicted: 'The wireless office will gain popularity as the
prices of systems decline. Prime target end-users include salespeople, top
management, employees in distribution and manufacturing firms and healthcare
personnel.
'The popularity of cellular phones and the emergence of personal
communications systems will stimulate use of wireless handsets for
in-building use as users increasingly seek the same convenience they are
used to outside the office inside buildings.'
Ericsson, the European telecommunications equipment manufacturer, claims
that cordless business systems can save customers up to 30 per cent of their
bills as a result of reducing the need for returned calls. Cordless systems
can also save on the costs of rewiring and other configuration operations,
which can be around 10 per cent of the capital cost of the system for
organisations running medium-sized or large PBX systems.
In addition, as Multitone, the UK-based pager and cordless telephone system
supplier, points out, cordless systems are extremely cost-effective to run
once installed since there are no airtime charges, internal calls are free
and external calls cost the same as from an ordinary desk telephone.
Like most other cordless systems, Multitone's CS500 product connects
directly to a PBX, so no expensive changes are required to an existing
hard-wired system and the same desk telephones and extension numbers can
continue to be used.
However, if cordless business systems are to flourish, there are several
obstacles to overcome. In particular, in Europe there are two rival cordless
business system technology standards: CT2, which has been adopted as an
interim European standard and the more recent Dect (Digital European
Cordless telecommunications) standard.
GPT Communications Systems, a joint venture between Germany's Siemens group
and Britain's GEC, and Canada's Northern Telecom have been supplying
cordless office systems based upon CT2 digital technology since early last
year. Northern Telecom, which is also developing a Dect system for up to
1,000 users in conjunction with Olivetti, launched its Companion CT2
cordless business systems in Europe last March and has sold over 1,000
systems in Europe and the Middle East since then and over 2,000 systems
worldwide.
CT2's supporters claim it is a proven and cost-effective technology ideally
suited to small and medium-sized offices. CT2 handsets cost around a third
of the price of their Dect rivals and are likely to retain a price advantage
because of the adoption of telepoint outside Europe.
However CT2 cordless business systems face a serious challenge from systems
based on the Dect standard which is backed by ETSI (the European Telecoms
Standards Institute) and was designed to solve the problem of providing
cordless telecommunications in high-density business environments such as
offices.
Five of Europe's largest telecommunications equipment suppliers - Alcatel,
Ericsson, Nokia, Philips and Siemens - which between them represent nearly
70 per cent of the European PBX adopted the Dect standard in March 1993 and
the first Dect systems began to appear shortly afterwards.
Dect's supporters claim their systems have key advantages over those based
on CT2, particularly in large office buildings where traffic is high, or for
mixed voice and high speed data - and they are trying to block moves which
would upgrade CT2 from an interim to a full European standard.
Ultimately, however, it will be the end users who decide which of these two
cordless digital technologies succeeds. The battle between them has only
just begun.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (9): Perfection may be
within reach - Joia Shillingford looks at trends in mobile handsets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So small and perfectly formed are today's mobile phone handsets that many
question whether they will get much smaller. In fact, the perfect mobile
phone handset - small, light and cheap - may not be far away.
Ms Diana Jones, marketing manager of service provider Mercury Communications
Mobile Services, says: 'I don't believe handsets will get much smaller than
the smallest models produced by Sony and Ericsson because of the
mouth-to-ear ratio.' She believes that 'handsets could even move in the
other direction like calculators. Calculators got smaller and smaller, but
then people found them fiddly to use. And larger calculators with
easy-to-press buttons started to be sold as well.'
So on traditional analogue networks (like those operated by Vodafone and
Cellnet), she expects most business people to stay with middle-sized phones
about the size and design of NEC's P4.
However, there is still scope for phones designed for the newer digital
services to get smaller and lighter. Mr Byan Van Dussen, a senior analyst at
Yankee Group Europe, says: 'Improvements in battery technology are the key
for weight to reduce, profiles to become slimmer and talk time to increase.'
Restricted battery life is a problem for both analogue and digital phones.
The current generation of batteries typically give two hours of continuous
talk time and lasts 22 hours if left on and not used. This means that heavy
mobile phone users often have to carry spare batteries and charge them up at
night. The problem is worse with GSM, which can drain battery life more
quickly.
But battery technology is changing. Nicad batteries have been replaced by
Nickel metal hydride on the latest phones - some give a choice of Nicad or
Nickel metal hydride. The next step will be metal ion batteries. Phones
using metal ion could be more expensive initially but will have more power.
Improvements in battery technology are likely to benefit service providers
and manufacturers. Airtime distributors such as Securicor Cellular Services
and Mercury Mobile Services should gain if users can spend more time talking
on the phone.
Manufacturers should benefit because, as the weight and profile of handsets
falls, they will become more pocketable and therefore more appealing to the
mass market.
Price is also critical. Mr Terry Barwick, director of corporate affairs for
Vodafone, says: 'Customers always ask three questions: How much will the
equipment cost? How much is the monthly charge? and How much are the calls?
The lower the cost of entry, the faster the market will grow.'
At present, analogue phones can cost as little as Pounds 49 and are
sometimes given away free. Those aimed at business users will usually cost
Pounds 99 to Pounds 299.
GSM phones cost about Pounds 100 more for the same type of handset, and
range from Pounds 200 to Pounds 500. They are more expensive than their
analogue counterparts because they are not yet sold in the same volumes. But
because the GSM standard has been adopted across Europe, manufacturers will
be able to make large quantities and lower prices.
This has not yet happened and in fact component shortages have restricted
the supply of GSM phones. However, because any GSM phone should work with
any GSM network, it is possible to buy a phone in one country for use in
another, where it may be dearer. It pays to shop around. But before long,
prices for GSM phones should fall to the same level as more expensive
analogue phones. Ms Sandra Richards, cellular phones marketing manager at
NEC of Japan's UK subsidiary, expects this to happen by the end of the year.
Call charges and monthly charges for UK analogue business services have
fallen in real terms, according to Mr Barwick. He says the monthly charge
has stayed at around Pounds 25 and peak call charges at 25p a minute since
1985. Charges for GSM services offered by Vodafone and Cellnet are similar
(though their GSM services are completely separate from their analogue
services and require different handsets).
Though service providers and network operators argue otherwise, there will
be continued pressure on charges with the entry into the market of
Hutchison's Orange and Mercury's One-2-One services - both based on PCN
digital technology - a variant of GSM.
But there are still areas where charges will be high for some time. One of
these is pan-European roaming, which allows a GSM user in one country to
send and receive calls in other countries with GSM networks. Roaming works
through reciprocal agreements, with each operator adding a premium.
Handset manufacturers will be able to charge more for handsets that do more
than just connect to GSM. For example, Nokia of Finland sells a phone that
can be integrated easily into mobile data applications - such as sending and
receiving text on the move.
In the longer term, dual handsets may start to appear, which can connect to
more than one network. The drive for these is mainly coming from the US,
where there is more than one digital standard. But in Europe, dual handsets
could be used to connect to both GSM and Dect - a European standard starting
to be used to provide wireless office switchboards.
The idea is that when customers phone a business, they could be put through
to the person they want (without redialing) whether that person is in the
office or on the move. Mr Van Dussen believes that in three or four years'
time, this area could be 'a terrific bonanza' for the few leading handset
manufacturers who are looking into it.
This is because though dual-purpose phones may be small and light, they are
unlikely to be cheap.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Reinsurance (6): Unlimited cover is on the way out
 -Claire Wilkinson discusses the forthcoming changes in reinsurance of UK
employers' liability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE WILKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From the beginning of next year reinsurers plan to introduce limits on all
employers' liability contracts, restricting cover to between Pounds 5m and
Pounds 10m per policy. For UK employers, by law required to purchase a
minimum of Pounds 2m indemnity, these restrictions spell the end of
unlimited cover.
Increasing exposures to catastrophic liability claims, combined with a rise
in occupational disease claims, have led reinsurers to make the break from
tradition. The Association of British Insurers (ABI), estimates that
employers' liability insurers, excluding Lloyd's, paid out claims of Pounds
541m in 1992, compared with Pounds 430m in 1988.
'Over the last few years the market generally for reinsurers has been hit by
all sorts of losses so we have been trying to make our business more
controllable. We certainly have not been making enough profits to justify
continuing to offer unlimited cover,' says Stephen Riley, deputy general
manager (non-life) at Swiss Re (UK).
The 1988 disaster on the North Sea's Piper Alpha oil rig cost the market an
estimated Pounds 120m and induced reinsurers to reconsider the issue of
unlimited cover.
Stephen Riley explains: 'the Piper Alpha loss gave force to the worries that
there was potential for a large industrial accident to occur affecting large
numbers of people and for there to be a mega claim. Frankly, the premium
basis we were operating on was not sufficient to cover that claims
exposure.' In the wake of Piper Alpha, the reinsurance industry imposed
treaty restrictions, leading most insurers to exclude offshore exposures, or
limit their liability to Pounds 2m per occurrence.
Accidents apart, the growth of occupational diseases such as deafness and
asbestosis has placed further pressure on the employers' liability market.
Emerging diseases such as repetitive strain injury (RSI) have also
contributed to the rise in claims.
According to ABI estimates, industrial diseases now account for about 50 per
cent of total employers' liability claims, compared to under 20 per cent
some 10 years ago. While individual disease claims tend to be relatively
low, liability is spread over many years, making it difficult for insurers
to predict future claims. 'The problem is that you've got large numbers of
people involved and the time lag between first exposure, manifestation and
settlement of the claim can be 25-40 years,' says Stephen Riley.
Reinsurers are not so exposed to the occupational disease problem, however.
'We don't have a major back-year problem on UK employers' liability, but it
has to be said that employers' liability is not a profitable class of
business,' he says. According to David Thomas, executive director, Willis
Corroon London, the typical employer liability claims experience can take up
to nine years to run off. 'For a risk insured in 1994, for example, it may
be 2003 before all claims are paid and outstandings reduced to zero,' he
says.
Lack of profits and high exposure to long-tail risks has driven both
insurers and reinsurers from the market in recent years. In 1993, two major
players in the unlimited liability reinsurance market, Nederlandse
Reassurantie Groep (NRG), and NW Reinsurance Corp, ceased underwriting.
According to Stephen Riley, their withdrawal increased the likelihood that
there would be no further cover available or that many companies would have
difficulty in placing unlimited reinsurance.
At the same time insurers have been questioning their commitment to provide
employers' liability insurance. 'It now appears that 80 per cent of
employers insurance measured in premium terms is written by only eight
insurers. Of these eight, three control something like 40 per cent of the
market,' says David Thomas.
Contraction in cover and impending limits on exposures will undoubtedly lead
employers to seek protection outside the conventions of the commercial
reinsurance market. Increasing levels of self-insurance and formation of
captives are likely alternatives. But are reinsurers concerned about the
potential competition posed by insureds? 'No captive or mutual is going to
be able to retain all that risk unless it is very well capitalised. From our
point of view, I don't see it as a major threat,' says Stephen Riley.
Others view the competition as more of a challenge, as Ian Sinclair,
managing director, underwriting, at Unionamerica Insurance Co, says:
'obviously we make our living by writing insurance and reinsurance. If our
own insureds are trying to compete with us, that is not a very easy pill for
us to swallow.'
According to employers' liability reinsurers, the introduction of limits
will enable them to gauge their future liabilities more accurately and
ultimately to offer more capacity in the market.
As Stephen Riley says: 'placing limits on it will certainly lead to more
accurate assessment of the price that ought to be charged. In the long term
if we all feel more comfortable about it, we will be able to offer more
capacity to our clients.'
It is also hoped the restrictions on cover may coax employers to take more
preventive measures to limit their own exposures, in turn reducing the level
of claims. 'Employers must recognise that the only way to control the cost
of employer liability insurance is to control the cost of claims. Risk
management is the key issue both for insurers and the insured,' says David
Thomas.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (6): The hothouse of
competition - Andrew Adonis looks at trends and new entrants to the UK
cellular market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK is Europe's foremost laboratory for testing the impact of competition
on telecommunications. Everyone knows that the privatisation of British
Telecommunications a decade ago went hand-in-hand with the licensing of a
competitor, Mercury Communications. And most of Britain's urban dwellers,
whose streets are being dug up by cable companies constructing combined
cable TV and telephone networks, are alive to the presence of more
competitors. As other west European countries, with a few exceptions still
state monopolies, struggle to privatise and liberalise, it is to Britain
that they look for inspiration.
Less celebrated, but equally developed, is competition in the UK's cellular
industry. When cellular telephony started seriously in the mid-1980s, most
European governments simply extended the existing monopoly in the provision
of telecoms services to the cellular sector. Not the UK, which at the outset
licensed two cellular operators, and allowed BT to take only a 60 per cent
stake in one of them.
Since then, competition has been the hallmark of UK government policy for
mobile communications. At every opportunity it has offered competing
licences. The policy has not invariably succeeded: initial failures among
Personal Communications Networks (PCN) operators might be entered on the
debit side. But most analysts agree that the UK's cellular strategy has been
more effective than monopoly at stimulating subscriber growth and effective
price competition.
The case is not beyond dispute. Scandinavia has achieved cellular
penetration rates more than twice as high as the UK's, yet cellular
competition is still in its infancy across the region. Cultural and business
factors may explain the divergence: all forms of telecoms are more heavily
employed in Scandinavia than across the rest of Europe, and the region's
operators have long been conditioned to behave in an entrepreneurial
fashion.
At any rate, the whole of western Europe - including Scandinavia - is
proceeding fast down the UK road. Almost every EU state has now licensed
competing GSM operators. The larger countries have either licensed a PCN
operator or are about to do so.
The UK has four operators: Vodafone, launched as a subsidiary of Racal
Electronics but demerged as a free-standing company in 1991; Cellnet, a
joint venture between BT and Securicor; Mercury One-2-One, a joint venture
between Mercury, BT's main fixed-line competitor, and US West, a US regional
Bell operator; and Orange, in which the largest shareholder is Hutchison
Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate.
Vodafone and Cellnet, the original competitors, both have analogue and GSM
networks, the latter compatible with overseas built to the same standard.
Most of their 2.5m subscribers are signed up to analogue networks: analogue
handset prices are cheaper than GSM, and service quality is better. However,
tariffs are comparable: as GSM service improves, the greater functionality
of GSM handsets becomes apparent, and the virtues of overseas 'roaming' come
to be appreciated, GSM will catch on. Mr Gerry Whent, Vodafone's chief
executive, predicts that Vodafone will be attracting GSM subscribers at the
same rate as analogue by the end of the year.
Mercury One-2-One and Orange, the new operators, have launched PCN networks
in the last year. Both lack national coverage: One-2-One is currently
limited to London and the south-east, Orange to main population centres and
travel routes. However, both are building out fast, and so rapid is
subscriber growth in the industry that last year's warnings that four
networks were at least one too many have proved misplaced so far.
Mobile phones are enjoying such a boom in the UK that new cellular phone
connections are racing ahead of links to traditional fixed phone networks.
Net new connections to mobile networks overtook fixed network connections to
BT and the cable TV companies last December, on a surge of pre-Christmas
mobile phone buying. Analysts expected the mobile phone tide would ebb after
Christmas, but cellular has stayed ahead every month this year except
January.
The larger operators have proved adept at expanding the market without
imperilling their margins. Vodafone, the most adept of all, believes it can
sustain last year's revenue per subscriber figure of Pounds 665, despite
pressure on prices. 'There is plenty of room for four of us,' says Mr Whent.
'We trade on our quality, national coverage, and the potential of GSM.'
To gain market share, the new entrants have adopted strategies aimed at
expanding the market. Both launched with an advertising blitz - which,
predictably, did as much or more to boost their larger rivals as themselves.
They have also sought to expand the market through careful positioning.
One-2-One has been the bolder by far, with its residential offering of free
local calls in the evenings and at weekends. Orange's strategy has been more
subtle, linking its tariffs to blocks of 'free' calling time, geared
particularly to more heavy-usage business customers. Both operators have
introduced serious price competition into the industry for the first time.
Branding is also becoming important, as independent service providers
decline and operators seek to carve out a distinct identity based on price
and network functionality. 'Nobody has yet invented a brand in this
business,' claims Mr Hans Snook, Orange's managing director. 'We intend to
do so by marketing our brand benefits - lower prices, and the services
available on our handsets such as multiple lines.'
All four operators are anxiously positioning themselves for the rise of the
mass consumer market. The dread is a repeat of the 1980s experience of the
consumer electronics industry, where margins collapsed and price wars
reigned supreme. Vodafone and Cellnet insist they will not be dragged down
that road, and so far they have managed the market successfully. But with
two competitors who both need large volumes, fast, to repay their
investments, the future is anything but predictable.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (7): Customers are confused
 -Paul Taylor looks at the mobile data market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mobile data market has failed to live up to early expectations. Set
against the growth of cellular radio voice communications in particular,
customer demand for mobile data has been distinctly disappointing.
As a result, most market analysts have downgraded their predictions for
mobile data market growth in the 1990s while network operators and others
have reassessed their investment strategies.
In the UK, for example, Hutchison Mobile Data ceased marketing its fledgling
dedicated mobile data service last autumn and will now offer mobile data
services on its recently launched Orange digital Personal Communications
Network (PCN) later this year.
'There has been a lot of 'hype' and industry push over the years,' says Mr
Dean Eyers, a senior industry analyst with Dataquest who has just completed
a report entitled 'Mobile Data Communications in Europe - The Potential for
a Horizontal Market'.
Another market research organisation, Ovum, conceded in a report on mobile
data published last year that, 'despite services being available on cellular
and public data-only networks, the market has been slow to develop'.
Ovum noted that despite the acknowledged benefits of mobile data, 'data-only
networks are facing an uphill struggle to attract subscribers and the number
of data users on the cellular network is in the region of 2-5 per cent of
the user base.' By the end of 1993 Ovum estimated that there were just
325,000 users of mobile data in North America and Europe.
In the UK the three dedicated mobile data networks have a total of about
5,500 customers. There are, however, indications that subscriber interest is
growing. In the first six months of the year subscribers to Ram Mobile
Data's network more than tripled.
Meanwhile, about 15 per cent of the 45,000 subscribers to National Band
Three's two-way public access mobile radio communications network in the UK
now use the service to transmit data.
Mobile data customers fall into two main categories according to Ovum -
vertical markets, particularly the service industries, and early horizontal
markets involving industries with a significant service element in some
aspect of their business.
Typically, these mobile data customers use data services to transfer
engineering, customer or product information to and from portable computers,
or to retrieve information from mobile data terminals used by a mobile
workforce such as meter readers.
But the Ovum report suggested that the market for mobile data had been
constrained by customer concern over competition between mobile data
services and over the availability of networks, the price of equipment and
excessively complex and expensive applications, lack of market understanding
and the belief that perceived risks outweigh cost benefits.
Customer confusion is understandable. In the UK for example, excluding pager
traffic, mobile data services are provided by both analogue and digital
cellular telephone network operators, dedicated mobile data network
operators and private and public access mobile radio networks - all using
incompatible standards and equipment.
It is possible to transmit data over an analogue cellular telephone
networks, but this is generally more difficult and considerably slower than
transmitting data over the fixed public switched telephone network. As a
result, relatively few business customers use cellular telephone systems to
transmit data.
Data transmission over the new generation of digital cellular telephone
systems, such as the GSM and PCN services in Europe should be much simpler,
faster and more reliable. The GSM specification includes a facility which,
once implemented, will allow any terminal - such as a portable facsimile
machine or a notebook computer - to be plugged directly into the handset.
In the US, analogue network operators led by AT&amp;T's recently acquired
subsidiary, Macaw Cellular Communications, are upgrading their networks to
accommodate a new 'open' technology called cellular digital packet-switched
data (CDPD) which enables data to be sent in blocks over existing networks
using the 'spaces' between voice traffic. Because it provides digital
transmission without the need for expanded system capacity, it is a
cost-effective option.
Public access mobile radio services such as NB3, owned by Geotek of the US,
provide another alternative for customers who require both mobile voice and
data communications. NB3 customers buy their own communications equipment
and then pay a fixed monthly subscription. They do not pay call charges.
However Mr Andrew Robb, managing director of NB3, acknowledges that for high
volume data customers who do not require voice communications, the high
speed and low cost wireless data links provided by dedicated packet-switched
data networks make more sense.
In the US the Ardis network, which uses Motorola's DataTac technology,
covers the 400 largest metropolitan areas and has around 35,000 subscribers,
while Ram Broadcasting's network uses Ericsson's rival Mobitex technology.
Similar packet-switched data networks, mostly based on Mobitex, have been
built or are planned throughout Europe.
In the UK three mobile data networks survive: Cognito, Vodafone's Paknet and
Ram Mobile Data - a joint venture involving US-based Ram Broadcasting and
BellSouth, France Telcom, Swedish Telcom and Bouygues.
Elsewhere in Europe their are Mobitex-based networks built or under
construction in France, Sweden (where there are two), Finland, Norway, the
Netherlands, Germany and Belgium which will eventually be linked through
roaming agreements to provide a pan-European network. There are only two
DataTac networks in Europe, one operated by Deutsche Telekom in Germany and
the other Hutchison's mothballed systems in the UK.
Although subscriber growth has been slow, Mr John Jarvis, Ram Mobile Data's
chief executive, says: 'We are starting to see an industry with mass market
characteristics in terms of size and potential.' Ram's customer list
includes local authorities whose parking wardens use handheld computers,
field service engineers working for Coca-Cola's service company and
emergency services in Cleveland and Manchester.
BIS Strategic Decisions recently estimated that the European market for
mobile data will grow 15-fold into a Dollars 1.5bn business by 1998.
Meanwhile Dataquest's Mr Eyers believes the emerging mobile data market will
split into three main segments which he has dubbed 'data heavy', 'data lite'
and 'consumer users' and predicts that the overall market in Europe will
exceed 5m subscribers by the end of the decade.
Dataquest expects data heavy users - frequent mobile data service users such
as traffic wardens, meter readers and organisations which use the services
every day - will gravitate towards dedicated mobile data networks such as
Ram.
Data lite users - infrequent mobile data users, such as travelling salesmen
or executives who want to read their electronic mail or access an office
database - are expected to turn to GSM and other networks which also provide
voice services. However, Dataquest does not expect the consumer market for
mobile data to develop on a large scale until 'towards the back end of this
decade'.
The Dataquest report concludes: 'While paging, public mobile radio and
analogue cellular have all paid lip service to supporting mobile data
communications, strong candidates to support a significant market are only
now emerging in the form of packet mobile radio and digital cellular
technologies. Further support from manufacturers and operators for new
services and applications are required and expected.'
Corporate users had 'a positive attitude towards mobile data communications
but will need to be sold on the value which such solutions can provide if
this sector is to reach its potential.'

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Reinsurance (5): A suspiciously long lull - London
and Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEE COPPACK

<TEXT>
For reinsurers, September brings the Rendezvous in Monte Carlo and the start
of the North American hurricane season. Last year, however, proved
relatively disaster free and against the background of harder reinsurance
rates, much improved results for the 1993 year are already emerging, writes
Lee Coppack.
The UK's largest reinsurance company, Prudential subsidiary Mercantile &amp;
General, transformed a loss of Pounds 143.5m on its general business in
1992, which pushed the whole company into loss in 1992, into a Pounds 6m
profit in 1993 and an overall profit of Pounds 104m.
For the first time since 1989, members of the London companies group, the
London Insurance and Reinsurance Market Association (LIRMA), enjoyed a
positive cash flow during 1993 - this was the Pounds 549m by which members'
premiums processed by LIRMA's processing bureau exceeded claims.
To some extent the current situation mirrors the market conditions of the
mid-1980s when underwriters took measures to improve deteriorating results.
Better rates, together with a year, 1986, which was extraordinarily free of
major losses, resulted in a surge of capital into the market. Lloyd's
capacity doubled from Pounds 5bn in 1984 to Pounds 10bn in 1987. The effect
of the resulting competition on rates and conditions was exacerbated by an
unprecedented series of catastrophes. The results are well known, the
repercussions still being felt.
The spectre of profits slipping has already made its appearance. As Matthew
Harding, the chairman of specialist reinsurance group Benfield, puts it:
'There hasn't been a disaster for five minutes, so people think there won't
be another.'
He believes that for the market to work insurance and reinsurance must
retain a sizeable element of fortuity; premiums can only be a relatively
small proportion of the potential exposures. Therefore, catastrophe risks
which may remain clear for several years before a disaster strikes are
particularly vulnerable to misplaced optimism.
Competition certainly has returned in some classes, according to John Pelly,
group managing director of UK and North American reinsurance at broker
Willis Faber &amp; Dumas. For example, Bermuda companies anxious to avoid an
accumulation of North American catastrophe risks want to write business from
other parts of the world. But reductions have not been sweeping, he says.
However, that does not mean that the spate of natural disasters partly
responsible for the recent losses is necessarily over. Announcing the
company's 1993 results, the chairman of Munich Re, Dr Hans-Jurgen Schinzler,
commented: 'The insurance industry's exposure to large catastrophe losses
was quickly demonstrated again by the Los Angeles earthquake on 17 January
1994 and the windstorm and flood damage in Germany that also occurred at the
beginning of the year.'
He added that there were 'no grounds for relaxing our efforts to determine
and implement risk commensurate prices'.
The problem for reinsurers is to determine and keep to such a price. Because
of the nature of reinsurance, by the time it is clear that the rates charged
were inadequate, competition may well already have depressed them further.
The 10 years of reinsurance statistics published earlier this year by London
Insurance and Reinsurance Market Association (LIRMA) reveal that, while in
property business the claims picture is reasonably clear after two years,
there can still be blips, and even without the complications of asbestos and
environmental pollution, in long tail business the account may continue to
develop over four or five years and the picture in marine may be more
exaggerated.
When rates look profitable, there are few real barriers to entry into the
market. The shortage in capacity produced by insolvencies and withdrawals
brought Dollars 5bn new capital into Bermuda in 1993, and an additional
Pounds 2.1bn capacity into Lloyd's.
However, other factors may help to slow the pace of competition. The
benefits of increased rates and the relatively few insured catastrophe
losses in 1993 are unlikely to last long enough to make up more than a small
proportion of the funds which haemorrhaged from Lloyd's and the London
market companies.
Over four years Lloyd's has lost Pounds 6.9bn, including boosting reserves
for past years. In 1991 and 1992 LIRMA members lost Pounds 1.4bn net on
their reinsurance underwriting, and this does not include now those 13
groups which have become insolvent since 1990.
So institutional investors from outside the industry are cautious. Interest
rates are now significantly lower than they were in the mid 1980s which
should make reinsurance less tempting as a cash flow machine, and economies
recovering from recession are offering other investment prospects.
The stock market performance of the Lloyd's investment trusts, initially
sparkling, has been lacklustre since April and analysts question how much
unsatisfied demand there is for corporate involvement in Lloyd's. 'We do not
think a lot of new capital will be coming into Lloyd's corporate capital,'
says Roman Cizdyn of Smith New Court, an experienced observer of the London
insurance market. 'The launch of the trusts this year was probably unique, a
once only opportunity.'
The Lloyd's market board has just published an estimate of Pounds 10.3bn
maximum for Lloyd's capacity in 1995, down from Pounds 10.9bn this year as
names have to meet cash calls and a study from Smith New Court issued in
August suggests the fall could be larger. Bermuda, now a major competitor,
is estimated to have about Dollars 13.7 bn (Pounds 8.8 bn) in capital,
excluding captives.
A noticeable change in Lloyd's has been a fall in the proportion of its
underwriting classed as reinsurance. According to figures collected by
Lloyd's Planning Department, from a peak of 58.6 per cent of premiums
including brokerage in 1991, reinsurance last year made up 49.6 per cent of
the premiums processed through the market.
One explanation has been that underwriters have seen greater opportunities
in direct business. Between 1990 and last year, total direct business has
risen by 39.3 per cent; reinsurance by only 9.1 per cent which, against the
background of firmer reinsurance rates, suggests that Lloyd's share of the
world reinsurance market is likely to have slipped. The fastest growing
class in Lloyd's has been UK motor, which has more than doubled since 1990.
Investment in Lloyd's will largely be affected by the success of its plans
to create an authorised reinsurance company, NewCo, to take over the US
liability risks, such as asbestos and environmental pollution, dating from
the 1985 year and before. Lloyd's intends that NewCo should be up and
running at December 31, 1995.
This problem continues to plague the London market, particularly Lloyd's,
because it has gone on so long. Half of Lloyd's loss of Pounds 2.048bn for
1991, the most recently closed underwriting year, was made up of increases
in reserves for prior years of account, but its chairman, David Rowland,
argues that Lloyd's is almost certainly better reserved than most of its
competitors.'
The latest estimate by respected rating agency A. M. Best puts the ultimate
cost to the US insurance industry over the next 25 years of environmental
and asbestos damages in the US at around Dollars 132bn, excluding any
meaningful refund of Superfund. This amount is equal to 72 per cent of the
industry's current capital and surplus. Yet US liability rates remain soft.
What now seems a terrible burden to the London market may eventually provide
a significant, competitive advantage, because adequately reserved insurers
will be in a strong position if others are forced to raise prices to pay for
old losses.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Reinsurance (4): A faster profits centre -
Bermuda's success raises hackles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TREVOR PETCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In July, Dr Hans-Jurgen Schinzler, chairman of Munich Re, the largest
reinsurance company in the world, warned that it was already becoming
difficult again for reinsurers to obtain reasonable conditions for
catastrophe business.
He told a German newspaper that it would not emulate some of its competitors
in establishing a subsidiary in Bermuda to specialise in this area, and in
an unusually forthright comment suggested that some of these, attracted by
the high rates currently on offer wanted 'to make a quick dollar'.
Such comments are familiar to the eight property catastrophe specialists
based on the island. One local observer suggests wryly that Bermuda has
suffered 'a slide into critical acclaim'.
Mr Henry Keeling, chief underwriter for Mid Ocean Re, the first of the new
specialist companies established in November 1992, believes any supposed
conflict with 'traditionalists' is illusory. 'Reinsurance is a truly global
business,' he says. 'Bermuda is simply the most efficient place to put our
capital to work.'
According to Mr John Dowling, chief executive of International Property
Catastrophe Re, mainly owned by leading US insurers and reinsurers, the key
issue is the success of the Bermuda market; the problem is that some
observers measure success in a different way.
The new companies are not a threat to the rest of the world market but a
complement to it, Mr Dowling believes, drawing attention to the quality of
both the capital and the personnel which they have recruited. They have also
passed the acid test of securing a customer base among major - and very
discriminating - property insurers, he says.
Mr Michael Butt, chief executive of Mid Ocean, also identifies the 'flight
to quality' as the key feature of the new market, which he suggests requires
investors with a first class reputation, and capital of the order of Dollars
400m to Dollars 500m (Pounds 265m-335m).
Bermuda's initial role was as the main centre for captive insurers owned by
big commercial entities, a position which it still retains. The mid-1980s
saw the establishment of the large, privately-owned high-level liability
insurers ACE and XL and so-called financial or finite risk reinsurers which
needed a tax-efficient location. There are now half a dozen of each, as well
as two companies in formation aimed at coping with the US Oil Pollution Act.
In a sense, therefore, the arrival of the catastrophe specialists marks
Bermuda's coming of age, in providing capacity for part of the core business
of the global reinsurance market rather than speciality requirements.
The importance of this development is demonstrated by the updating of
Bermuda's insurance legislation, an outline of which was expected to be
announced last week. This is aimed primarily at removing any suggestion of
insufficient supervision of companies active in international markets by
introducing four categories of company, from simple captives to those
writing commercial liability.
After struggling for years to obtain some improvement from unwilling
cedants, some European reinsurers might be forgiven for rather resenting any
factor which might reduce the limited length of time for which they could
enjoy better margins.
Mr Dowling points out that while Bermuda may have raised Dollars 4.5bn in
new capital, with perhaps another new Dollars 1.5bn in London, this still
represents less than the Dollars 10bn which is often given as the amount
withdrawn from the reinsurance market since 1987 - and there have been huge
global losses from hurricane Andrew and the Northridge earthquake since the
new companies were formed.
Mr Keeling observes that 'there is still too much demand and not enough
supply, especially in the US'. He points out that the new companies write a
'completely different' business mix than the so-called traditional
reinsurer. By focusing closely upon property catastrophe business, stronger
underwriting discipline can be exercised and aggregation and volatility
controlled. By taking advantage of a low cost base and efficient use of
capital, the maximum benefit of such wider margin business can be enjoyed.
Mr Butt believes that the quality of the security offered will become 'ever
more important' as client concern over uncollectable reinsurance increases.
A variant of the 'margin reduction' criticism runs: unless catastrophes
simply fail to occur, how can the above average returns promised to
investors be generated except by writing other lines where margins are also
temporarily attractive?
In order to protect their asset base, the property catastrophe specialists
must underwrite premium as a fraction of their capital (30 to 50 per cent is
typical). Mr Dowling stresses that Dollars 4.5bn in capital for underwriting
predominantly low frequency/high severity business does not mean the same
volume of premium written as it would for a multi-line reinsurer.
While it is true that most of the property catastrophe companies do write
perhaps 40 per cent of their book in other property reinsurance, marine and
aviation, Partner Re (the largest in terms of share capital), Tempest Re and
Centre Cat are currently exclusively property catastrophe companies.
More significant is the fact that none of the new companies write long-tail
liability business. 'Our capital is transparent, unencumbered by such claims
from the past,' Mr Dowling says.
A third area of concern, hinted at by Dr Schinzler concerns the period and
terms on which capital has been committed to the new ventures. One new
facility which did not receive support from the capital markets was Compass
Re, which was to have had a life span of about five years. The Compass Re
vehicle will be finally wound up on September 23.
If the non-insurance institutional backers of the new ventures are not
long-term investors and are not to be rewarded by high current dividends,
the implication is that they expect to make substantial gains through stock
placements, as the initial investors in finite risk reinsurers were able to
do. They will maximise their return if they can sell at the top of the
market.
Although most if not all of the new ventures emphasise that their return on
capital is to be measured over a long period, and stress their long-term
commitment, observers such as rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's have indicated
reservations about whether the new facilities can prosper in a soft market
as well as in a hard one.
Mr Butt responds that the reputation of the investors is such is that they
cannot afford simply to walk away. 'Over the next 10 years, reinsurers must
offer their clients a greater degree of stability,' he says, adding that
'The concentration of capital into larger units with professional investors
is necessary if that role is to be fulfilled.'

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (5): Mobile phones meet a
consumer barrier - Market penetration is still some way off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a cellular industry platitude that the consumer market is about to
dawn. New connections are booming; in several western countries - including
the UK, Italy and Scandinavia - the number of new cellular connections is
already outstripping fixed-line connections.
The latest figures from the FT's mobile communications newsletter show that
more than 12 per cent of Swedes now have a cellular phone. Finland, Norway
and Denmark are not far behind. The rest of Europe lags, but subscriber
growth across western Europe was 60 per cent in the year to August 1, with
the penetration rate across the region now up at three per 100.
Cellular telephony is also booming in the US and Asia-Pacific. One in three
people in Hong Kong have access to some form of mobile communicator, with
cellular phone penetration running at more than five in 100.
Add to that projections of global growth continuing at 50 to 60 per cent a
year, and the clear beginnings of marketing targeted at mainstream
consumers, not just 'city slickers', and the mobile age seems simply a
matter of waiting and ensuring sufficient capacity. After all, who would not
want a mobile phone at the right price?
In reality, of course, it is not going to be that simple. A look at the UK,
which with 4.6 cellular subscribers per 100 people is at the leading edge of
the developed world's mainstream cellular industry, gives a fair picture of
the market in transition.
From the figures, growth appears unbounded. It took the UK's cellular
operators eight years from their launch in 1985 to attract their first 1.4m
customers. The number of subscribers has almost doubled since the start of
1993, with the increase running at more than 50 per cent a year.
Recent advertising campaigns by mobile operators have been pitched at
mainstream consumers, and one of the four networks - Mercury One-2-One  -
claims to be in direct competition with BT by offering free local mobile
phone calls on its networks in the evenings and at weekends. Analysts
expected that the mobile phone tide would ebb after Christmas, but apart
from January, and a customary lull in the depth of the summer, demand has
remained strong.
It would be misleading, however, to believe that the mass market has dawned.
Visit a mobile phone shop, or talk to a dealer, and it becomes evident that
the mobile phone is not advancing into the consumer market as a whole, but
rather penetrating deep into discrete sections.
The most obvious is the high-earning professionals. Much of the current boom
is caused by the fact that large numbers in this group are buying phones for
their personal use, or for their spouses to use.
Two other discrete growth segments are the self-employed blue-collar workers
and vulnerable social groups - in both cases mostly equipped with cellular
phones at the behest of employers or agencies.
A survey late last year by Joyce Wood, a visiting fellow at Sussex
University, highlighted this trend, citing utilities which now equip their
repair staff with mobiles and police forces providing them for women at
risk.
'The stereotype is being turned upside down. And though the number of
'non-professional' users is still small, the fact that mobile phones are
being seen in the hands of ordinary people is vital to creating a mass
market,' says Ms Wood. However, the key words are 'upside down': there is
still not much of a market between the better-off professionals and their
families, and the blue-collar workers who need the phone as part of the job.
The operators are aware of this. Mr Richard Goswell, managing director of
Mercury One-2-One, frankly admits that PCN handset prices have still to come
down by at least half - the cheapest currently retail for Pounds 199 -
before the 'bulk' of the consumer market can be attracted.
Still more starkly, he says that usage tariffs 'will have to migrate a great
deal further towards BT's tariffs' before the goal can be achieved. With
call tariffs anything up to 50p a minute on low-usage schemes designed to
attract the consumer, that suggests a long trek ahead.
Ironically, One-2-One makes the consumer barrier more obvious, despite its
free evening local calls, because of the high handset prices. By contrast,
established analogue operators Cellnet and Vodafone have experienced serious
problems with 'churn' - the number of subscribers leaving the network as a
proportion of all subscribers - in part because of the cheap high street
handset deals now available.
Mr Hans Snook, managing director of Orange, believes churn could before long
turn into an 'industry crisis', although like all operators he is careful to
exclude his own network from the crisis.
According to BIS Strategic Decisions, an information technology consultancy,
churn is now running at an annual rate equal to about 30 per cent of the
number of mobile subscribers. BIS estimates that about half of all churn is
caused by people moving between mobile phone companies or between different
calling plans offered by the same operator. However, that still leaves half
due to a combination of fraud and the inability of customers to keep up with
their bills.
Ms Gail Kirby, a BIS analyst, says: 'Churn is a serious problem, and it's
getting more serious for the network operators as the number of subscribers
rises so dramatically. The numbers churning are equal to the entire cellular
population of a few years ago.'
The three months to the end of June saw the churn rate rise for the fourth
successive quarter. Vodafone, the largest cellular operator, was worst hit,
with a disconnection rate equal to 34 per cent of its subscribers over a
full year. Mr Terry Barwick, Vodafone's corporate affairs director, says:
'We have had problems with fraud, and are tightening our credit-checking
system to reduce it.'
He said some of the fraud appeared to be organised systematically, with some
dealers stealing bonuses paid for new subscribers by means of fake
subscriber names and personal details. But he conceded that 'part at least'
of the churn was probably caused by customers unable to keep up with their
bills.
As one dealer puts it, neatly summing up what could become a serious
industry predicament: 'Many people who buy mobile phones don't have a clue
how much it actually costs to keep a mobile phone going - particularly if
you use it.'

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (5): Technology for the next
generation - Paul Taylor looks at the spread of GSM networks, in Europe and
elsewhere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past two years the European-developed GSM (global system for mobile
communications) digital cellular standard has won widespread acceptance
around the world as the technology of choice for the next generation of
cellular telephone networks.
Although North America led the first mobile telecommunications revolution in
the early 1980s, it is Europe that has taken the lead in the move towards
digital systems with the GSM standard. 'The big impact of GSM is that it is
a single standard,' says Mr Dean Eyers, an industry analyst with Dataquest's
European telecommunications group, 'and this means enormous economies of
scale for equipment manufacturers.'
The big European equipment suppliers, have also benefited from disarray in
the US where the telecommunications industry is still divided in its support
for two different digital technologies - digital Amps based on time division
multiple access (TDMA) or the newly-developed code division multiple access
(CDMA) technology.
GSM networks are in operation, under construction or planned across Europe,
the Middle East, Africa and the Asia/Pacific region, having brushed aside
the challenge from rival digital standards. Only in the Americas and Japan
have alternative standards been adopted.
By the end of July, the number of GSM subscribers worldwide totalled more
than 3m and is expected to top 4m by the year-end. These customers are in 59
countries with a combined population of more than 2bn and the customer base
is growing by more than 70 per cent a year.
By 1999 EMCI, the Washington-based market research firm, predicts there will
be 45.9m digital cellular subscribers worldwide, with GSM subscribers
representing almost 60 per cent of the total.
'The GSM standard is now accepted worldwide as the basis for new digital
mobile communications and networks,' Mr Bruno Massiet du Biest, the current
chairman of the GSM Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) group, said recently.
The first GSM networks were launched in Germany, France and Denmark in
mid-1992, and similar services are now being rolled out across Europe. Last
year the number of GSM subscribers in Europe jumped from 184,000 to 1.32m ,
according to figures from Mobile Communications, the Financial Times
newsletter.
New GSM subscribers represented over 40 per cent of total western European
subscriber growth and Dataquest is forecasting that the number of GSM
subscribers in Europe will grow to 8.31m by the end of 1996. However, the
bare figures hide substantial variations in GSM uptake in individual
markets. Almost all of the growth in 1993 - and much of the growth this year
 -was attributable to the German market which accounted for 74 per cent of
all European GSM subscriber growth in 1993.
In Germany and other markets where analogue network capacity was restricted,
or had not been developed, GSM subscriber growth has been spectacular over
the past two years. As a result, the two GSM networks, Deutsche Telekom
Mobil's D1 network and Mannesmann Mobilfunk's D2 network, now both have more
than 700,000 subscribers each.
GSM subscriber growth has been spurred by competition. Two or more GSM
network operators have been licensed in all European countries except
Ireland which bowed to Commission pressure and requested bids for a second
GSM operator in July. Aggressive marketing which has resulted in the
elimination of the price premium on GSM equipment, has also helped. In both
Germany and Denmark, another fast-growing GSM market with over 200,000
subscribers to its two GSM networks, Motorola handsets have fallen to under
Pounds 100 in some promotion packages.
But in those countries such as the UK which had well-established analogue
systems which were not capacity constrained, the pace of transition from
analogue to digital cellular systems has been much slower. Ms Diana Jones,
in charge of marketing for Mercury Mobile Services, says there is still
relatively little interest in Britain where GSM handsets are still Pounds
100 more than their analogue counterparts. 'Most business users do not at
this stage feel the need to move over to GSM,' she says.
Vodafone, which offers two GSM tariffs in the UK, has about 45,000
subscribers to its GSM network while its rival Cellnet only officially
opened its GSM digital cellular network in mid-July. Like Vodafone, Cellnet
is mainly targeting the business user. The main selling point will be the
ability to use a GSM handset anywhere in Europe - Cellnet has negotiated
'roaming agreements' with 22 foreign operators.
GSM networks are under construction in eastern Europe, including Russia
where the Russian Telecommunications Development Corporation (RTDC) holds 14
GSM licences. Asia, already the fastest growing cellular market in the
world, has become the biggest market for GSM.
Japan and South Korea, which are developing their own digital standards, are
the only two big Asian countries that have not adopted GSM. At the end of
last year there were 19 licensed GSM operators in 10 countries throughout
Asia, and potentially, 28 operators in 17 countries.
Among them, Hong Kong has emerged as one of the most rapidly growing GSM
digital cellular markets in the world. The colony's two GSM networks, Hong
Kong Telecom and SmarTone, have been averaging more than 10,000 connections
a month between them, and the total number of GSM subscribers is now over
the 100,000 level.
Elsewhere in Asia, GSM networks are in operation in Singapore, China and
Malaysia, and are planned in Indonesia, the Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam,
Taiwan and India where eight city-based GSM digital cellular licences have
been awarded.
China recently placed two further contracts for GSM digital cellular
systems. Nokia will supply a system for the country's capital, Beijing,
while Ericsson of Sweden has won its second Chinese GSM contract for
delivery of a system to Shantou in Guangdong province.
GSM is seen to have two key advantages over the rival US digital Amps system
in Asia. First, GSM frequencies are already available, while digital Amps
frequencies may be already occupied. Second, GSM's roaming capability is
giving it the edge over rival standards. However, the thorny issue of
encryption poses a potential threat to GSM sales in Asia and elsewhere
outside western Europe.
GSM equipment uses an encryption device based on an algorithm called A5(1).
However export rules normally prevent non-European operators from buying
equipment that incorporates the A5(1) encryption system because of concerns
that it could be used for military purposes. Instead, prospective GSM
network operators outside Europe are being offered equipment with the
newly-developed A5(2) encryption system.
Taiwan has already complained about the restrictions which are seen as a
trade barrier and has accused European export authorities of undue
discrimination. This is causing concern at the GSM MoU Group which is
seeking to promote the adoption of GSM worldwide.
Although GSM has been an outstanding success, US and Japanese equipment
manufacturers continue to lobby operators worldwide to adopt their rival
digital standards. The MoU Group fears that non-European operators might
feel that they are being asked to accept an inferior GSM technology and
therefore turn to another system.
Much is at stake. Frost and Sullivan, the market research group, estimates
that the GSM cellular equipment market will peak next year at Dollars 1.6bn
and then decline slowly as volumes and prices fall.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Reinsurance (3): Now it's every firm for itself -
Brokers discover that the good old days of assured profits are gone for ever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NAOMI CAINE

<TEXT>
The world of the reinsurance broker is no longer the cosy, clubby place it
once was.
The same harsh reality that has prodded the retail and wholesale sectors
into action has finally penetrated through to the reinsurance layer,
prompting widespread and large-scale changes.
Some firms will not survive the brush with reality; those that do will
emerge as risk consultants with a much wider brief than their ancestors. The
harsh reality is a shrinking, but more demanding client base. Brokers are
having to prove their worth to their customers by cutting costs and adding
value.
It is a difficult juggling act to perform when the squeeze is on
remuneration and when brokers are still servicing long tail liabilities.
Brokers work within much tighter margins than underwriters and administering
old accounts is expensive and time-consuming. The problems are exacerbated
by the reluctance or inability of some reinsurers to shell out for claims
and by the switch from the standard 10 per cent commission on premium income
to more flexible and creative arrangements.
'The cost to brokers of reinsurance run-off in the London market alone could
be more than Pounds 1.1bn', says Mr David Corben, chairman and chief
executive of Jardine Thompson Graham. 'The general squeeze on the rates of
brokerage will continue and there may well be pressure for fees or
negotiated commission.'
Some brokers are further hampered by past, expensive forays into the
underwriting arena. Alexander &amp; Alexander's ownership of Sphere Drake in the
early 1980s is proving to be a costly mistake.
Willis Corroon has laid its underwriting company, Sovereign, to rest and C E
Heath has disposed of its companies, mainly in Australia. Sedgwick has
recently recapitalised River Thames, but the decision surprised the market
and cost the broker Pounds 25m.
The shakeout in the insurance industry has created a market of fewer, larger
clients. Brokers are therefore desperate to hang on to their existing
clients and to engage in the bitter battle for new ones.
But the sophisticated insurance company client base demands that brokers
prove their worth. There is, after all, always the temptation to deal
direct. 'It is no longer enough for a reinsurance broker simply to place a
client's risk. Nowadays, the successful broker is a fully-fledged consultant
who offers the client a whole range of skills and services,' says Mr John
Pelly, chairman of non-marine reinsurance at Willis Corroon.
Mr Corben agrees: 'The reinsurance broker of the future will provide a far
more technical and knowledgeable service than has been the norm in order to
add value to the process. He must be sufficiently trained to understand
aggregations and be able to do some basic statistical analysis.'
The insurance industry is often accused of living in the technological stone
age, but reinsurance brokers are embracing technology as a means of offering
their clients a bespoke service. Facilities such as CATMAP in the US allow
brokers to analyse risk profiles down to the very last detail, ensuring
clients buy a policy that exactly matches their risk exposure.
This type of risk analysis by computer will come into its own if the trend
away from proportional business towards excess of loss continues. 'An excess
of loss risk or event is more difficult and complicated to analyse and rate
than a proportional programme,' explains Mr Pelly. 'The broker who is up to
speed and who can help the client calculate the extent of his exposure will
steal a march on his competitors.'
Brokers can also sharpen their competitive edges with security analysis.
Client confidence in the reinsurance market has been eroded by a reduction
in market capacity and by the troubles at Lloyd's of London. More and more
clients ask more and more questions, down to the name of the lead
underwriter on a Lloyd's syndicate.
'Clients want to know who is underwriting their risk and need to have the
utmost confidence in the security of that underwriter,' says Mr Alan
Williams, deputy chairman of Alexander Howden reinsurance brokers. 'It is
the broker's job to vet security with an up-to-date system.'
Networks, such as LIMNET and RINET and the Electronic Placing Support, a
London market initiative due to go live on January 1 1996, should speed up
the broking process and lead to a more efficient and cost-effective
business. But brokers have mixed feelings. They have read the mandate to
move with the times, but they look back with longing at the old ways.
'Technology is revolutionising the broking industry. But we should not be
afraid of change if it enhances the service we offer our clients,' says Mr
Williams. 'I do not believe that computers will replace face-to-face
negotiations, certainly not with lead underwriters, they will simply reduce
the amount of time and effort spent trudging round the market from one
underwriter to another.'
By streamlining the business, brokers hope to cut costs and promise to pass
the savings on to their clients. The broker's raison d'etre is to serve the
needs of the client. If there are fewer clients it stands to reason there
will be fewer brokers. Some, particularly the smaller firms with scant
resources, will not keep up with the pace of change. Those that do, should
finish in better shape.
Emphasis is now on the recruitment of high-calibre personnel who can put
their shoulders behind the push for professionalism. But if client numbers
are dwindling, brokers need to forage for new business. Although they refute
the claim that they are creating markets, a number of the larger broking
houses are pioneering developments in the burgeoning economies of eastern
Europe and Latin America.
The government of Kazakhstan, for example, has selected Alexander Howden to
be its insurance consultant. Market conditions and client demand have forced
the reinsurance broker to take a long hard look at the business he conducts
and the way he conducts it. And these ever-flexible middlemen have responded
to the challenge of change. They may take the occasional look back at the
past, but they have always got at least one eye firmly on the future.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Reinsurance (2): Liberalisation is in full swing -
Trevor Petch examines the new growth markets in Europe, Asia and Latin
America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TREVOR PETCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In recent months liberalisation of the insurance industry throughout the
world has reached a speed which only the most optimistic would have
predicted at the beginning of the 1990s.
Steady progress towards the single market in western Europe, finally
completed on July 1 this year, has been paralleled by the creation of the
North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) linking the US, Canada and Mexico,
and in South America by the Mercosur Common Market between Argentina,
Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
The opening of the markets of eastern and central Europe followed naturally
from the collapse of the centrally-planned economy.
Although most states have retained a measure of control over foreign
involvement in insurance and reinsurance, it is anticipated in most cases
that this will disappear by the end of the decade.
With the exception of the Baltic states, these restrictions are generally
tightest in the former USSR. Earlier this year, important progress was made
when both Russia and Ukraine, as part of wide-ranging economic co-operation
agreements with the European Union, agreed to liberalise access for EU
insurers by spring 1999.
In Asia, the impetus for more open markets was the Uruguay Round of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The General Agreement on
Services (GATS) was eventually agreed at the end of last year.
Insurance is one of a number of problematic areas dealt with by complex
annexes agreed in a last minute compromise. One effect of these was to
create a period of two years during which the US in particular will remain
free to try to use bilateral pressure to force access to insurance markets
it considers closed. Insurance is one of the three areas it has chosen to
include in negotiations with Japan.
A number of governments which have traditionally favoured purely national
insurance markets have recognised that, in the medium-term, open markets are
inevitable. This year, Taiwan has permitted investment in insurance by
non-US insurers (US companies were already able to operate), and measures of
demonopolisation and denationalisation are under way or under active
discussion throughout the Indian subcontinent.
Most major international insurers are opening offices in China in
preparation for the expected opportunities there, and a number have also set
up in Vietnam.
The growth potential for primary insurance is perhaps most obviously
apparent in the Communist and former Communist countries in economic
transition. Property and liability risks for which there was no perceived
need for cover are now being insured, and privatisation creates its own
additional requirements, especially in commercial lines.
Last month an important breakthrough was made when American Re announced
that it had successfully placed a Dollars 500m (Pounds 750m) property cover
for Russia's largest truck-maker KamAZ with leading international reinsurers
and Russian insurers. Last year KamAZ lost its western-equipped engine plant
in fire which cost in the region of Dollars 375m and was completely
uninsured.
Another particular area of growth, in which the role of reinsurers has been
central, is motor and health lines related to foreign travel.
Growth in any insurance market will also follow general economic growth, and
this is the major factor in the Indian subcontinent. In some ASEAN member
countries, growth by medium-sized industrial companies is particularly
strong.
International investors are once again turning their attention to Latin
America after the 'lost decade' of the 1980s, and as in the more developed
industrialising markets of Asia, the traditional progression from domination
of insurance market volume by commercial lines to a greater incidence of
personal property and life and savings business is to be expected.
In most of the major markets of Latin America, the pension and private
health sectors are also major areas of expansion as the role of the state
decreases.
In all areas, however, while Munich Re is 'prudently optimistic' about the
potential for growth of insurance and reinsurance business, it is careful to
emphasise that it is much more circumspect in its analysis of the
prospective results.
In the ASEAN countries, for example, the reinsurance market is already very
competitive, and margins are 'quite low, to say the least,' the company
says.
Catastrophes are another worry, especially in areas where there is risk both
from windstorms and earthquake. Last year Cologne Re announced that it
planned to cease providing catastrophe cover in Latin America on a
proportional basis.
Munich Re began to require clients to take more active measures to control
aggregate catastrophe exposure, and expressed particular concern over
adequate pricing of the earthquake element of property covers.
The same concerns apply in much of Asia. For reinsurers rather than primary
insurers, a longer-term concern is that the economic growth which increases
personal wealth and insurance demand brings with it a marked increase in
aggregate exposure in the event of a catastrophe.
Property previously uninsured becomes insured, and the amount available to
be insured increases both in terms of volume and of value. There is also the
danger of 'Florida syndrome' as residential buildings become both more
concentrated and sited in ever more unsuitable locations from a
meteorological point of view.
As one reinsurer points out, a significant proportion of any major
catastrophe loss is a large number of householder claims of relative low
average value, a value which tends to increase the worse the catastrophe is
because of the upward pressure on repair costs.
The lesson of this year's Northridge earthquake in the US was to demonstrate
that a 'number of extremely well-run insurance companies mis-evaluated their
exposure', he says.
Nor does deregulation bring automatic benefits to reinsurers. In countries
such as Chile, Colombia and Mexico, deregulation was at first accompanied by
a sharp increase in competition and a decline in original premium rates.
In markets which have been protected by a domestic reinsurance monopoly and
regulated tariffs, the level of underwriting expertise is often low, while
fear of competition can delay correction in rates even when results
deteriorate.
Nor does the volume of reinsurance premium itself automatically increase
with liberalisation. If there is market concentration or significant local
investment by large multinational insurers, retentions may increase
significantly. In Argentina, for example, in 1989 reinsurance represented
28.7 per cent of total direct premium. The monopoly reinsurer INdeR was
closed in 1991, and premium ceded is now around 13 per cent.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (2): Cordless systems gain
ground - Paul Taylor examines trends among business users
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business users, particularly small businesses, helped fuel the growth of
cellular mobile telecommunications in the early 1980s in the US and then in
Europe.
A decade later although attempts are being made to broaden the market for
mobile telephony, for example through the introductions of Personal
Communications Networks (PCNs) like Mercury One-2-One and Hutchison's Orange
network in the UK, the main focus of cellular network operators remains the
business customer.
Indeed, the introduction of digital cellular networks such as the GSM
networks which are being built across Europe and in many other countries
around the world, and other new services like mobile data, promise to
provide business users with a new set of telecommunications tools which can
increase flexibility and improve productivity.
One advantage of these new digital mobile services is that they are easier
to integrate with corporate fixed telecommunications and data processing
equipment and will enable network operators and others to provide a wide
range of value added customer services such as voice messaging and data
transmission.
'With their intelligent network architecture and nationwide digital
networks, the mobile operators will soon be able to offer all the services
that a (fixed network) telephone operator can, and more,' says Mr Tim
Harrabin, a principal consultant at the Cambridge-based Analysys telecoms,
strategy and economics consultancy, in a report published last year.
Other telecommunications strategists believe that before the end of the
decade, office cordless and mobile digital technologies will be integrated
in dual mode handsets capable of operating at work, while travelling and at
home.
In the office itself most market research organisations predict that
cordless telephony based on either of the two main digital technologies
currently available, CT2 or Dect, will be gradually adopted by corporate
customers over the next decade.
Frost and Sullivan, the market research firm, is predicting that sales of
wireless office equipment will grow from virtually nothing last year to
nearly 20 per cent of the market by the year 2000. Among the benefits
claimed for cordless systems are increased efficiency, reduced outgoing call
costs and savings on running costs.
Already most of the main telecommunications equipment manufacturers are
either supplying or developing cordless systems which can be added onto
existing PBX (Private Branch Exchange) equipment. The next step is likely to
be to integrate these cordless voice systems with the emerging cordless data
networks which are beginning to appear.
Outside the office the cellular telephone is already a vital business tool
for a large number of mobile workers including salesmen, site engineers and
others whose jobs require them to leave the fixed telecommunications
services available in the office, factory or warehouse.
For some mobile workers - including those whose occupations mean they are
often away from their desks or work-benches - pagers can provide a low cost
and effective solution to the problem of 'telephone tag'. Pager networks
have also proved very successful in Asian markets such as Hong Kong where
they are increasingly used along-side 'telepoint' public mobile cordless
systems.
However, pager networks face a growing challenge from the new digital
telecommunications and from GSM in particular. Vodafone, the UK cellular
network operator working with Sema Group's telecom division, was the first
GSM network operators successfully to test the short message service
facility included in the GSM specification. This allows an alphanumeric
message of up to 160 characters - twice as long as the typical maximum
length paging message - to be displayed on the handset.
The messages are sent via the short message service centre and when they
arrive at the mobile they are stored in the user's SIM (smart) card ready
for retrieval.
SMS's unique features include the ability to send or receive messages at the
same time as speaking or sending data, an alert feature for informing a
third party when a mobile re-registers on the network, the ability to store
a message and forward it to the mobile when it is switched on, and
acknowledgement of successful message delivery.
Mr Martin O'Byrne, managing director of Sema's telecom division, believes
that SMS and other features like it will provide network operators with a
way of differentiating service offerings.
Business users who want to send longer data files from their portable
computers while on the move - as well as being able to use the network as a
conventional voice link - will probably also turn to GSM. However those
whose need is for frequent computer-to-computer communications will probably
use one of the dedicated mobile data networks such as Ram Mobile Data in the
UK.
These data networks provide high speed, reliable wireless mobile data
connections which typically enable mobile workers such as parking wardens,
meter readers and others to exchange data or E-mail with a central office
network.
In the meantime, the proliferation of mobile telecommunications equipment is
already causing problems in some large organisations which sometimes do not
even know how many mobile telephones their employees are using and have few,
if any, controls over their usage.
The problem is so pronounced that Mercury Mobile Services inthe UK offers a
'consolidation' service which begins with a 'consolidation audit' to
discover the number and type of phones a customer has and to set up a
database to monitor users and usage trends.
If required, MMS can then arrange for all the equipment to be transferred so
that it is all managed by a single service provider and will then provide
the customer with detailed management reports and monitor whether the mobile
fleet is being used efficiently. Customers have included Digital, Shell, the
AA and UPS.
According to Ms Diana Jones, who handles marketing for MMS, some customers
are now asking Mercury Mobile Services to manage their entire mobile
telecommunications operations - including marketing the services to internal
users.
As Ovum, the market research group, noted in a recent study, 'so far neither
suppliers nor user organisations have paid much attention to how a large
company 'as a whole' can use mobile to best advantage.'
However, Ovum also noted that as the drive towards a mass market for mobile
communications and fierce competition force mobile operators to lower
prices, developing products and services for the corporate sector will
become increasingly important to mobile operators seeking to sustain
margins.
'The more experienced corporate users have identified how mobile
communications can improve their efficiency - they are starting to change
the way they operate in order to take advantage of mobile services,' said
Ovum. 'Changes include cutting down on staff and accommodation - thereby
allowing extra spend on mobile communications - and closer integration of
mobile with private network facilities.'
One worldwide office equipment supplier interviewed for the survey
'Integrating Mobility into the Corporate Network' said that by introducing
voice mail for sales people they had made savings on message desk staffing.
However, Ovum noted that most users do not see the introduction of mobile
communications as a cost-saving measure. But they are aware of how mobile
services can benefit their business in other ways, for example by improving
the productivity of mobile staff, making an organisation more responsive to
customers, improving sales effectiveness and speeding up decision making.
Given that mobile communications products and services are widely regarded
by telecommunications managers as too expensive, suppliers need to find ways
of simulating market growth which do not focus primarily on cost reduction,
says Ovum.
These include adding value to individual products and services such as data
over GSM; moving new applications to mobile communications and educating
corporate users about the benefits of using mobiles; and integrating
services across technologies, adding value for users and providing cost
control for the company.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (3): Europe gets message -
Andrew Adonis looks at the paging market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the US and Asia-Pacific countries public radio paging, although less high
profile than mobile telephony, is nonetheless a respectable and
self-confident sector. In Europe, by contrast, the pager has long been the
mobile communicator that dare not speak its name, with paging operators
seemingly acquiescent in a course which has condemned paging to obscurity.
That appears set to change. Radical reform is sweeping through Europe's
paging industry, stimulated by the success of Sweden's state telecoms
operator in marketing pagers to high street consumers. Meanwhile, paging
continues to race ahead in Asia, and looks set for a further spurt in the US
on the back on two-way paging and other enhanced services.
The next step in what could become a transformation of Europe's paging
sector comes this month with the launch by Mercury Paging, the UK's third
largest operator, of a service tailored for the consumer market.
Instead of the existing paging package - unattractive to personal consumers
 -of monthly rental charges for restricted coverage zones, Mercury paging
customers will be able to buy their pager from high street consumer
electronics retailers with automatic connection and no subscription charge.
Dubbed 'Minicall', Mercury will gain its revenue from the new service by
charging callers premium rates for leaving messages. Each Message will cost
the caller about 20p, which Mercury believes is unlikely to deter would-be
callers.
'Minicall' is a numeric paging service. Numeric pagers, which display the
caller's number on a one-line display, are an advance on 'tone' pagers,
which simply bleep and flash to alert the owner. They are one step down from
alphanumeric pagers, which allow callers to leave a text message on a
multi-line display.
'This is a real breakthrough in the UK paging business,' says Mr Chris
Neary, managing director of Mercury Paging. 'We have carefully studied
Sweden's experience with calling-party-pays paging, and think there is a
real opening for a similar offering in the UK. It is far cheaper to use than
a cellular phone.'
None of the other three UK paging operators offers a pure calling-party-pays
service. BT, the largest operator with more than 400,000 subscribers, offers
no alternative to monthly subscription charges related to zones: its tariff
sheet setting out the options resembles a railway timetable, although
subscribers can now buy their pager. But all three - BT, Vodapage and
Hutchison Paging - are examining calling-party-pays (CPP) options, and may
come up with similar services.
Mercury cites three factors which have combined to make CPP at premium
rates, with no subscription charges, a commercial proposition:
The elimination of handling costs. 'Minicall' is a joint promotion with
Motorola, the US telecoms equipment manufacturer, which will supply pagers
directly to retailers.
A sharp fall in the cost of pagers. Numeric pagers now cost almost as little
to make as simple tone pagers: the Motorola numeric pagers will retail at
between Pounds 79 and Pounds 99.
The elimination of bureau costs, the most expensive part of a paging
operators' overheads. Callers with touch-tone phones leave numeric messages
by tapping in their contact phone number as requested by a voice prompt. The
small minority of callers without touch-tone facility can leave their number
by voice after the prompt.
Mercury is also revamping its business service: subscribers will get a
numeric pager for the existing price of a tone pager, with a monthly
subscription charge of only Pounds 5.49 for national coverage. Mercury is
keen to upgrade both new services to alphanumeric: the problem is the bureau
costs, which are unavoidable until voice recognition technology produces a
reliable service for turning voice messages into text. It is still some way
off.
Motorola has a 20 per cent share in Mercury Paging, but insists that it had
little bearing on Mercury's decision to launch 'Minicall'. Mr Greg Nelson,
Motorola's European paging subscriber president, has spent the last year
trumpeting the virtues of CPP to Europe's paging operators, and claims that
at least 10 more European operators are planning to introduce a similar
service in the next three to six months. 'This idea is catching on fast: our
role has simply been to get the operators to consider it seriously,' he
says.
According to industry sources, paging operators in Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands and Denmark will be among the next to launch CPP services. Some
will be collaborating with Motorola, some with two or three partners, but
the product will be broadly similar. All the operators are going for the
market niche opened up by the continuing high cost of cellular telephony in
an increasingly mobile-minded society - particularly among the young.
The CPP model is Sweden, whose state operator, Telia, launched a successful
service last year despite Sweden's high level (10 per cent) of cellular
phone penetration. 'The crucial thing was to study the telephone market, not
existing mobile markets,' says Mr Jan Holmgren, an ex-Motorola executive who
moved to Telia to build up its paging division. Telia research showed a
potential paging market of 1.9m out of Sweden's 8.5m population.
More than 100,000 pagers have been sold through retail outlets since the
launch of the service. They retail for as little as SKr1,000 (Pounds 87),
with no connection fee. Between 9am and 4pm the calling charge is SKr6
(about 50p) and at other times and all day at weekends, it is SKr1.5 - a
huge price differential with mobile phones. The new regime has had almost as
great an impact on the business market as on the consumer market. Telia's
traditional subscriber network has grown from about 70,000 to well over
100,000 since the CPP launch.
Western Europe currently has about 3.2m paging subscribers. If CPP takes
off, current projections of growth to about 5m over the next decade (from
CIT Research, a London-based consultancy) could prove pessimistic. However,
Europe will still lag far behind the US, which today has about 21m paging
subscribers, and the Asia-Pacific region with 19m. Singapore alone has more
than 600,000 paging subscribers, Hong Kong 1m, Taiwan 1.4m and Japan 7.7m.
CIT projects that paging numbers in Asia will more than double over the next
decade.
Two-way paging is set to be the next innovation in the US. The auction last
month by the Federal Communications Commission of eight blocks of radio
frequency for narrowband Personal Communications Services will allow two-
way paging for the first time.
Five companies are likely to compete in the two-way market, with services
such as 'acknowledgement' paging, allowing the recipient of a message to
choose one of a number of set return messages. Other enhanced services in
the pipeline include a voice-based service allowing subscribers to play back
voice messages stored on a device no larger than an existing pager - 'an
answering machine in your pocket.'

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Reinsurance (1): Price cuts are in the wind again
 -Reinsurers are reviewing their traditional ways of doing business as they
cope with the mounting cost of catastrophe losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price reductions are again on the agenda of international reinsurance
underwriters and brokers, gathering in Monte Carlo this week for their
annual conference. But the increasing scale of catastrophe losses,
graphically underlined by the mounting toll of claims from this January's
Los Angeles earthquake, means rate competition is unlikely to be acute.
Despite the introduction of some Dollars 7bn of fresh capital into
reinsurance ventures in the past two years, growing exposures - the result
of economic, demographic and even climatic change - are putting an
increasing strain on the industry's capital base and forcing reinsurers to
re-examine traditional approaches to their business.
Earlier this year the influx of new capital - much of it raised to support
new ventures based in the offshore Bermuda market - stirred fears in some
quarters that the reinsurance industry was returning to the kind of
competition which proved so disastrous in the late 1980s.
Events this year provide some evidence of softer market conditions. Some
Australian and Japanese insurers - who renew their annual policies in April
and July - did pay less, with rates down by as much as 15 per cent for
Japanese buyers, for example. And a number of brokers expect to be able to
obtain quite substantial cuts in prices when they start negotiating to renew
covers for European and some American buyers over the next few months.
'We can probably obtain a 25 per cent saving in reinsurance costs, taking
into account deductibles and price,' said one leading London broker. 'And
you can certainly budget for a 15 per cent cut.'
However, there are indications that rates will not fall much further.
Reinsurers point out that prices for catastrophe cover are many times higher
than they were five years ago. Mr Richard Keeling, one of the leading
reinsurance underwriters at Lloyd's, says that rates are holding in the US
and that his syndicate has shed exposures rather than follow the market
down. Following the violent fluctuations in international capacity in recent
years, many buyers want to secure long-term relationships with reinsurers,
points out Mr Keeling, adding that concerns about 'longevity' are
outweighing those linked to price.
'Many companies realise they really need reinsurance. They've seen the dark
side of the moon and are not reckless in abandoning long-term
relationships,' explains Mr Keeling. Other Lloyd's underwriters also argue
that the market is likely to remain stable. Another Lloyd's underwriter says
he expects 'the market will renew pretty well as before'.
Every area of the Lloyd's market is under 'gentle pressure' he continues,
but underwriters are still more worried 'about losing their jobs than losing
premium'.
Especially for reinsurers with US exposures the Los Angeles earthquake has
provided a useful reminder about both the scale and uncertainty of
exposures. Loss estimates from the quake were originally estimated at some
Dollars 2bn but have been successively revised upwards, with the current
figure of Dollars 7.2bn, representing the US industry's second most
expensive catastrophe after hurricane Andrew.
'Everybody is kidding themselves over the extent of the exposure,' notes Mr
Jacques Blondeau, chairman and chief executive of SCOR, the rapidly growing
Paris-based reinsurance company.
'People were over optimistic. Computer models were just not accurate enough.
It is striking to see how poorly equipped we are to measure these
catastrophes.'
These perceptions mean that reinsurers are continuing to insist on much
tougher conditions for insurers underwriting business in areas highly
exposed to catastrophe risks, with more selective pricing and higher
deductibles the norm.
And reinsurers are also becoming much more selective about the companies
they choose to reinsure. 'They want to understand what the underwriter is
doing much more than they did before,' says the chief executive of one of
the UK's composite insurance companies.
Outside the catastrophe area reinsurers have questioned the logic of
granting unlimited liability coverage on employers' liability and third
party liability covers. Unlimited cover of this kind looks likely to
disappear from the market almost entirely in 1995.
'It is very hard to argue that any individual or corporate body actually
needs the luxury of unlimited coverage. The loss events covered can be
quantified and as insurers and reinsurers we should not leave the door open
to rampant legal and social inflation,' points out Mr John Engestrom, chief
executive of Mercantile &amp; General Re, the UK's biggest reinsurance company
and a subsidiary of Prudential Corporation.
Caps have been placed on exposures under proportional covers (policies in
which reinsurers take a fixed share of the risk for the same share of the
premium less a ceding commission). 'Uncapped exposures under proportional
covers are impossible to price adequately,' notes Mr Engestrom.
More broadly, Mr Engestrom argues that insurers and reinsurers need to
rethink their roles and redefine the concept of fair sharing of risk. He
adds that there should be 'open and trusting information sharing in the
widest sense'.
The theme is echoed elsewhere in the market, where groups as diverse as
Centre Re, the Bermuda-based subsidiary of Zurich Insurance, and Benfield
Re, the highly successful reinsurance broker, are increasingly keen to
develop multi-year relationships between insurer and reinsurer.
The use of some reinsurance products - such as 'spread loss' contracts  -
has declined following changes in accountancy rules. Nevertheless reinsurers
are continuing the search for policies which reward buyers who agree to
share some of the risk and renew their policies with the same reinsurer.
'All we are really trying to do is provide contractual encouragement for
long-term relationships,' explains one London reinsurance broker.
'Nobody wants to buy or write a risk for just 12 months,' says Mr Matthew
Harding, chairman of Benfield, who insists that cedants take a compulsory
co-insurance on all contracts he brokes. 'The customer base in the industry
wants continuity and certainty. The emphasis should be on continuity rather
than price.'
In other ways, too, reinsurers - both brokers and underwriters - are looking
for longer term responses. For one thing, there has been an increasing
recognition within the industry of the need for financial strength and
security. Many smaller firms have withdrawn, while bigger ones have chosen
to work closely together.
Earlier this year, two of the industry's largest companies - Cologne Re of
Germany and General Re of the US - agreed to form a 'strategic alliance'.
The new holding company, in which the US group will have a majority
interest, has been hailed as a third force in the market to challenge Munich
Re and Swiss Re. 'There has been a sorting out of the industry, with those
companies that offer size, security and capacity coming out on top. The top
seven or eight are playing a different game from the rest,' said an industry
analyst.
There are also signs that reinsurers are developing products which can
attract a broader class of investor. Scepticism in the industry about the
future of reinsurance derivatives is widespread. Nevertheless there are
signs that interest and take-up of the new derivative products is growing,
following the launch in December 1992 of the Chicago Board of Trade's
catastrophe futures and options contract.
Although the volume of business at the exchange is still modest - exposures
on the Chicago contract amount to an estimated Dollars 25m - interest in an
'over the counter' product - a loss warranty product which uses the Chicago
contract's loss index - is much greater. Enthusiasts such as Mr Andrew
Martin, managing director Sedgwick Payne Insurance Strategy, say the dev
elopment of derivative products could eventually bring greater flexibility
and transparency to the reinsurance market. Capital markets could become
more willing to trade reinsurance risks, he suggests.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (1): Lines that point to
cellular growth - It seems set to become a mass consumer market. But could
the bubble burst? Or are the forecasts too pessimistic?  Andrew Adonis looks
at the evidence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mobile communications embraces everything from the simple tone pager to
advanced radio data transfer systems. But the dynamic force in the sector is
the cellular telephone, entering its second decade of commercial service in
the developed world.
The issue is no longer whether the cellular phone will take off, but how
fast it will build a mass consumer market, and whether it is set eventually
to replace the traditional fixed wire.
The Nordic countries already boast about 10 mobile phones per 100 people.
Every other household in Stockholm has some form of mobile communicator, and
the number of new mobile phone connections outstrips new fixed-line
connections across Scandinavia. The same will soon be true of most developed
countries. The UK reached the cross-over point at the turn of the year:
industry estimates for June are of about 115,000 net new cellular
connections, against about 100,000 new fixed-line connections.
Between 1986 and 1993 the number of worldwide cellular phone subscribers
increased to 32m, with annual growth of between 45 and 50 per cent.
Projections vary wildly, but on current trends between 150m and 200m
cellular subscribers is a plausible projection for 2000. To put those
figures in perspective, some 650m telecommunications lines are in service
today.
Unsurprisingly, the cellular industry has become a gold rush, with nothing
but booms and profits apparently on the horizon, and a torrent of
entrepreneurs and companies - many of them with no previous telecoms
experience - muscling in to make their fortune. Witness the extraordinary
sums that operators are prepared to pay for licences: the Hungarian
government last year netted Dollars 100m from the auction of two GSM
licences, and far larger sums are changing hands in richer economies.
It would be rash, however, to suppose that operators will be able to
continue opening their networks and then waiting for the cash to pour in. As
the mass consumer market dawns, margins will fall, competition will hot up
and serious misjudgments are bound to be made. There is already evidence of
overheating in some markets: as operators dash for growth and cut-price
handsets flood highstreets, rates of 'churn' - subscribers leaving the
networks - rise and fraud becomes a problem. Some operators are privately
fearful that the cellular bubble will burst in developed markets, followed
by a period of slower growth similar to that experienced in the early 1990s
recession.
Yet just as convincing an argument can be made for supposing that current
growth projections are pessimistic. For instance, they could be dramatically
upset by the most intriguing departure in the industry - the development of
'fixed cellular' systems for the local loop. Fixed cellular is in its early
infancy, but as reliability improves and costs fall it has clear potential.
In the developed world fixed cellular offers a means for competitors to
former monopoly PTTs to bypass the PTT local network without having to dig
up the streets or erect pylons. It is also attractive to developing
countries ambitious to promote rapid line growth and not immediately
concerned about residential broadband 'superhighway' services.
'For us, fixed cellular is one of the most significant things happening in
the industry,' says Mr Nagarajan Vittal, chairman of India's
telecommunications commission. India has barely eight telephone lines per
1,000 people: the government's target is to double India's number of lines -
from 8m to 16m, compared with 30m in the UK today - over the next four
years. Mr Vittal believes fixed cellular 'could have a crucial role to
play,' pointing to Mexico and Indonesia which have recently licensed
operators.
The integration of fixed and mobile services might have a similarly
far-reaching impact in the developed world. 'People want to call people, not
places, says Mr Torbjorn Nilsson, strategic planning director at Ericsson
radio systems, the Swedish supplier. 'Fixed network operators will introduce
mobility to their networks by means of personal numbers based on
'intelligent networking' solutions.'
The world of mass personal numbers may be some way off, but the telecoms
equipment market is already beginning to feature PABX software which enables
calls to be directed to mobile numbers. Network operators are increasingly
anxious to make their services complement the fixed line, even to compete
with it. In the UK, one of the two new cellular operators to have launched
in the past year is offering free local calls in the evenings (Mercury
One-2-One), while the other (Orange) will give subscribers who want one a
conventional fixed-line local number for their cellular handset, allowing
them to pay the difference in incoming call tariffs.
Fixed/mobile business alignments are also taking shape. AT&amp;T's Dollars 12bn
merger with McCaw Communications, the largest US cellular operator, was
cleared last month. It is likely to be only the first of many such link-ups,
and has already helped to precipitate several proposed mergers between
regional cellular operators in the US.
Three forces are driving growth:
New and competing networks. Across much of the developing world networks
have only recently been opened, or are still to be launched. Much of the
world thus remains virgin territory for the cellular operators. In the
developed world, with its established networks, digital technology and the
introduction of competition between operators are providing the cellular
industry with a fresh wind.
The US entrenched competition from the outset, and it will become fiercer
still with the auction of licences for Personal Communications Systems next
year.
Elsewhere, state-owned PTTs were licensed as monopoly cellular operators in
the mid-1980s. Typically, they treated their cellular divisions as cash
cows, raking in large monopoly profits from growing business demand while
making little or no pretence at marketing the service.
That is all changing. Second network operators are being launched across
Europe and the Asia-Pacific. Under strong pressure from the European
Commission over the past two years, most EU states have licensed more than
one operator to provide a digital service on the pan-European digital GSM
(Global System for Mobile Communications) standard. The UK has gone further
still, licensing an additional two digital operators at a higher frequency,
providing so-called PCN (Personal Communications Network) services. Other
major EU states are following suit with PCN.
Analysts disagree on the importance of competition to subscriber growth, but
beyond Scandinavia it is hard to deny a relationship. The US, which had
competition from the start, has about six subscribers per 100 people. The
UK, with its four competing operators, now has about 2.7m cellular
subscribers - nearly five subscribers per 100 people. Germany, which was a
Deutsche Telekom monopoly until the launch of a GSM network by the
Mannessman consortium two years ago, has nearly trebled its number of
subscribers over the past year but still has fewer than three subscribers
per 100. Japan, which languishes at the foot of the league for large
developed countries with barely two cellular subscribers per 100 people,
only this year liberalised its handset market, having previously required
subscribers to rent handsets at inflated prices.
Reducing costs. Prices of all the telecoms components of cellular networks -
base stations, handsets, and interconnection charges for the use of public
fixed-wire networks - are falling fast. This is a function of technological
advance (base stations have shrunk from hut-size to street cabinets in a few
years), computerised manufacture (it now takes a small fraction of the
labour required even two years to assemble a handset), the enhanced capacity
of digital systems, and lower prices for use of the fixed networks. All of
these trends will continue, aided partly by technical advance, partly by
greater competition, and partly by regulation, although supply shortages -
particularly in digital handsets - may slow the pace.
Cultural changes. As the penetration of cellular phones rises, they come to
be seen as essential by an ever larger social group, further reinforcing
growth. A recent UK survey by Ms Joyce Wood, a visiting fellow at Sussex
University, shows that the image of mobile phone users as 'swanky
businessmen' no longer tells the whole story.
Nor is the cellular telephone the whole story of mobile communications.
Paging, mobile data, and mobile satellite are all notable markets, covered
in this survey. But in size and glamour they are no competition for cellular
telephony.

5 MONDAY
Population conference
More than 15,000 delegates and representatives of non-governmental
organisations gathered in Cairo for the United Nation's International
Conference on Population and Development.
The weeks before the conference have been dominated by a row between the
Vatican, some of its Catholic allies and Islamic conservatives on one hand
and the majority of the other 160 states on the other over the wording of
the proposed final text. Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon are boycotting the
meeting. Religious critics have accused the text of endorsing homosexuality,
abortion and adolescent sex.
The 126th annual meeting of Britain's Trade Union Congress, which opens in
Blackpool today, is expected to present a more than usually unified front
behind the modernising policies of Mr John Monks, general secretary. The
week-long meeting will, however, be overshadowed by the continuing strike by
railway signal workers.
Japanese prime minister Tomiichi Murayama meets Paul Keating, his Australian
counterpart, who is on a two-day visit to Japan. Keating and Thai premier
Chuan Leekpai, who is also in Tokyo this week, are expected to raise trade
issues in the talks.
Banks which bailed out WPP in a Dollars 271.6m (Pounds 176m) debt for equity
swap two years ago are today expected to make more than Pounds 100m profit
through a placing of the 26.5 per cent stake in the international
advertising agency. The placing is being organised by a consortium
comprising Bankers Trust International, JP Morgan Securities and SG Warburg
Securities.
Berlin: The first European Union foreign ministers meeting with the South
Africa Development Community (SADC) states opens today. Finland, Norway,
Austria and Sweden, which will join the EU next year, are also
participating. The main aim of the conference is to increase political
contacts between the EU and SADC.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science annual festival gets
under way in Loughborough. This year's theme is Science In The World Around
Us (to Sept 9).
The Booker Prize shortlist is announced in London. The prestigious literary
award, which has 130 novels competing for the Pounds 20,000 prize, will be
presented on October 11.
Farnborough Air Show, the biennial showcase for the world aerospace
industry, is expecting around 220,000 visitors. This year's event includes
an aerobatic world cup with 24 pilots from 15 nations (to Sept 11).
Surveys: Reinsurance, Mobile Communications.
Holidays: Canada, US (Labor Day), Israel (Eve of Rosh Hashanah), Luxembourg
(local holiday).
6 TUESDAY
Slovakian sell-off
The government of prime minister Mr Jozef Moravcik (left) launches a mass
privatisation programme in Slovakia involving state companies worth up to
Sk250bn (Pounds 5.2bn). About a quarter of the total is to be sold through a
voucher privatisation system, the remainder via tenders and direct sales. It
is one of the biggest mass sell-off programmes of any post-Communist country
outside the Czech Republic.
William Perry, US defence secretary, takes his second trip to Russia this
year for talks with his counterpart Pavel Grachev. Tomorrow he goes to
Totskoye for the first joint peacekeeping exercise between American and
Russian troops.
The Bank of Japan releases its 'Tankan' quarterly survey of business
conditions, which should shed some light on the current state of the
country's economy.
Germany's unemployment figures for August are due to be announced. Recent
trends have pointed towards a gradual fall in the number of unemployed. The
figures will be watched closely as Germany prepares for federal elections on
October 16.
The Tokyo District Court delivers its ruling in the trial of executives at
Kajima - one of Japan's leading construction company's - accused of bribing
Toru Ishii, the former mayor of the northern town of Sendai, to win
construction contracts.
Japan Telecom is listed on the second sections of the Tokyo and Osaka stock
exchanges. The issue's high public offering price of Y4.7m (Pounds 30,616)
per share is causing some investor anxiety.
Cricket: the Holder's Hill cricket team, captained by Desmond Haynes, will
become the first overseas village side to play at Lord's when they meet an
MCC side captained by David Gower. Holder's Hill, a tiny community in St
James, Barbados, has nine men who have played for the West Indies.
Rugby in Paris:
The Barbarians are playing their French counterparts in Paris. The match is
to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Normandy landings and the
liberation of Paris.
Holidays: Israel (Rosh Hashanah).
7 WEDNESDAY
EU on plutonium security
EU interior and justice ministers meet in Berlin to discuss a common
response to trafficking in potentially weapons-grade plutonium from Russia.
Ministers from neighbouring central European countries are to join the
meeting tomorrow. The current German presidency of the EU also wants a
formula on 'burden-sharing' on refugees from the former Yugoslavia.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George,
governor of the Bank of England, face a policy dilemma in today's monthly
monetary meeting. Interest rates have started to rise in Italy, Sweden and
France, and Britain is further ahead in the economic cycle than most
continental countries. Yet official inflation figures continue to come in
below expectations, making it hard to sell a base rate rise to the public.
Analysts expect no rise until after November's meeting.
Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's minister of international trade and industry,
meets US trade representative Mickey Kantor in Washington. Foreign minister
Yohei Kono meets Mr Kantor in Los Angeles the following day. Tokyo's two
powerful ministries show signs of being at odds on how to resolve trade
issues with Washington, which is threatening sanctions.
The troubled Benetton team answer charges that they illegally interfered
with their refuelling rigs, thereby causing the pit-lane fire at the German
Grand Prix. Their case is being considered in Paris by the FIA, the sport's
governing body.
Campaigning begins for Slovakia's general election on September 30 and
October 1, its first since splitting from the Czech Republic at the end of
1992. Opinion polls show the nationalist Movement for a Democratic Slovakia,
led by former prime minister Vladimir Meciar, will emerge as the biggest
party.
The World Competitiveness Report will be published by the Institute for
Management Development in Lausanne, Switzerland. Japan has finished top of
the poll for the past eight years.
Football: England play the US in a friendly match at Wembley Stadium,
London.
Survey: Enterprise in Wales.
Holidays: Brazil (Independence Day), Israel (Rosh Hashanah).
8 THURSDAY
The Pope in Sarajevo
The Pope plans to visit Sarajevo ' if security can be guaranteed ' amid
warnings from Bosnian Serb leaders. The visit is intended as a gesture of
solidarity with the city's inhabitants. The Pontiff's trip to the former
Yugoslavia ends at the weekend with his first visit to Zagreb in Croatia.
Germany's first-half gross domestic product data are published by the
federal statistics office. Informal estimates suggest that the economy grew
at an unsustainable rate of 3 per cent during the period. Some slowing is
expected in the current quarter, but most economists expect more than 2 per
cent for the whole year.
Jiang Zemin, China's president, visits France until Sept 12 as part of a
European swing that has also taken him to Russia and Ukraine. The French
part of his tour is at the invitation of President Mitterrand.
The Rio Group, which brings together presidents from 11 Latin American
countries and representatives from Central America and the Caribbean each
year, is to meet in Rio de Janeiro. (to Sept 10).
Troops from the US, Britain and France leave Berlin today after a presence
of nearly 50 years. Chancellor Helmut Kohl will bid the troops farewell.
Christie's auctions Charlie Parker's white plastic alto saxophone in London.
9 FRIDAY
Quad meets on trade
Trade ministers from the US, Canada, Japan and the EU will meet in Los
Angeles (to Sept 11). The 'Quad' meeting is expected to focus on
multilateral co-operation to open markets and the speedy implementation of
Uruguay Round talks on lifting trade barriers.
EU finance ministers meet in Lindau near Lake Constance for two days of
informal talks. The meeting, chaired by the rotating German presidency of
the EU, will cover the latest macroeconomic developments in Europe and steps
towards European monetary union.
The Japanese government's Economic Planning Agency releases its monthly
report on the domestic outlook. It has so far avoided declaring that
recovery is under way, noting only that there are bright spots.
Berlin: The Conference of German and American Business Leaders is expected
to focus on German-US political and economic relations. Al Gore, US
vice-president, will address the conference by satellite and Chancellor
Helmut Kohl will open the event.
The design team of Swan Hunter, the UK shipbuilder in receivership since May
1993, will be made redundant unless receivers Price Waterhouse have made a
deal by today to sell the company. The loss of the team would end prospects
of a going concern sale.
10-11 WEEKEND
US and N Korea resume talksThe US and North Korea begin negotiations in
Pyongyang to implement last month's framework agreement to end the dispute
over North Korea's nuclear programme. Talks aim to establish low-level
diplomatic relations, and a later Berlin meeting will negotiate terms for
the supply of safe light-water reactors to North Korea. In return North
Korea has agreed to full nuclear inspections.
A by-election in Aichi prefecture, near Nagoya, for the Japanese upper house
will be the first electoral test for the two-month-old government.
EU foreign ministers meet in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, east Germany, for two
days. Talks are expected to address the Bosnian crisis, Rwanda, relations
with central and eastern Europe and progress towards the development of a
common foreign and security policy.

Monday: The UK's narrow measure of money supply, M0, has consistently been
growing outside its 0-4 per cent target range, a matter which has caused
concern to the governor of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George. Analysts
are hoping that figures today will show that the annual rate edged down from
July's 6.5 per cent. Consumer credit figures, also out today, will shed
further light on the effect of the tax increases on consumer confidence.
Tuesday: UK industrial production and manufacturing output figures will show
whether economic growth is showing any signs of slowing down. Month-on-month
figures can be erratic but both figures are expected to show 0.4 per cent
monthly growth.
Wednesday: The UK's trade performance has held up quite well this year.
Figures for June's whole world trade are expected to show a monthly deficit
of Pounds 800m, down from Pounds 1.03bn in May.
Thursday: The Confederation of British Industry's quarterly distributive
trades survey, out today, will give a further indication of the strength of
retail sales and the health of consumer spending.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Share prices focused on higher ground -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The stock market has turned highly volatile as the summer holidays -
extended perhaps by the prolonged British Rail dispute - draw to a close.
Although profit-taking in the wake of the latest upsurge has been modest and
underlying retail business strong, there are signs this week could see a
more penetrating review of market prospects.
The interest rate outlook has hardened in Europe as the latest indications
of strength in the German economy have suggested the trough of the rate
cycle has been reached. In the UK, Wednesday's monthly meeting between Mr
Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor
of the Bank of England, has already triggered alarm bells among market
analysts.
Some believe there is already a party in the City prepared to urge that base
rates should be raised now, as a pre-emptive strike against an accelerating
economy and hints of inflation. It was these concerns that kept the stock
market hopping from one foot to another last week.
Mr Richard Jeffrey at Charterhouse Tilney Securities points out that, while
the chancellor will be politically wary of raising base rates, he has
committed himself to having inflation below 2 1/2 per cent at the end of
this parliament.
'If he fails, it will be seized upon . . . as a broken commitment,' says Mr
Jeffrey. Since the City still believes that interest rate policy has been
the key to keeping domestic inflation subdued, it is not surprising that
market antennae are on the alert.
However, there is still the question of whether a modest and controlled rise
in base rates would stop a market now focused on the recovery in company
profits and dividends. It seems clear that the equity market wants to go
higher.
Recent support has come from wholesale upgradings of bank and insurance
companies, and also the 12 dividend reviews among electricity companies
prompted by the favourable pricing review. NatWest Securities points out
that, with the impetus from gilts now missing, maintained corporate earnings
momentum is even more important for equities.
Kleinwort Benson's Edmond Warner, agreeing that the interim reporting season
has started in good form and is 'unlikely to shake prospects for this year',
warns that 1995 expectations appear overblown.
He says the strong list of profits upgrades in August, a reversal of the
July trend, does not change his view that earnings will grow by only 10 per
cent next year, which would be a disappointment for a consensus forecast of
13.6 per cent, according to a review by Legal &amp; General, but these medium
term views will be swept aside if the conviction that some large takeover
moves are in the offing prove true.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Wall St likely to take a more positive line
 -New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<TEXT>
Wall Street usually makes known its assessment of the government's monthly
employment report within hours of its release. This time, market observers
must wait four days to get a true reading on investor sentiment.
Analysts say Friday's limp reaction to news that non-farm payrolls had risen
by only 179,000 last month was mostly a reflection of the thin trading
conditions prevailing that day, with the approach of the long Labor Day
weekend. The data, which revealed much weaker jobs growth than expected,
should bring a more positive tone to the market when investors return to
work tomorrow.
Surely, the dispirited bond market played some role in Friday's lacklustre
response in equities. Fixed-income fund managers, ever wary of inflation,
focused on details of the jobs report that suggested growing constraints in
manufacturing capacity, which could translate into higher prices.
Economists expect evidence of such upward pressure in August producer price
data due at the end of this week. Excluding the volatile food and energy
sector, a rise of 0.3 per cent is forecast, after a 0.1 per cent increase in
July.
Still, cautious optimism prevails in stocks. Mr John Moore, director of
asset management at Value Line, the New York research firm, predicts the
broad market will climb slowly and steadily.
As he points out, there is a growing belief on Wall Street that earnings,
not interest rates, are gradually taking over as the controlling force in
the stock market. Consequently, he says, 'equity investors can afford to be
forgiving right now, as long as they can assume rates are going to level
off'.
The jobs data did nothing to undermine such an assumption, according to most
economists. 'This at least buys (the Federal Reserve) some time,' says Mr
Ray Stone, managing director of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research in Princeton, New
Jersey. At the earliest, he says, the Fed will wait until November before
lifting rates again.
In the meantime, the autumn may bring new vigour to growth stocks -
especially larger capitalisation Nasdaq issues such as Microsoft and
Cabletron - which have mostly languished over the past two years.
That may seem surprising in view of the broad pullback in computer stocks
last week. The selling came on the heels of a profits warning issued by AST
Research. An extra push down came from bellwether Compaq, which was thought
to be trimming its supply orders.
However, Mr Moore attributes last week's setback to profit-taking and a
fleeting bout of the jitters. Technology concerns have turned in impressive
performances for the most part, he points out. 'These stocks tend to have
two, three or four good quarters, then they stumble. That makes everyone
nervous for a day or two.'

Investors will be keeping a close watch on whether the benchmark Hang Seng
index can remain above the 10,000 level, writes Louise Lucas.
The psychological barrier was briefly pierced last Thursday in spite of
China passing into law its decision to scrap the colony's democratic reforms
on resuming control.
However, there are few focal points to stimulate a renewed attack on the
10,000 level: corporate reporting this week comes mainly from second and
third liners, although Hopewell Holdings, the property and infrastructure
company, posts its finals today.
Investors will start to focus on the Jardine companies, whose interim
results kick off next week. It is expected that an announcement will be made
then on the fate of the remaining companies in the group following the
delisting of parent Jardine Matheson and Jardine Strategic Holdings.
Many analysts expect directors will announce that Dairy Farm, Hongkong Land,
Mandarin Oriental and Jardine International Motor will follow suit, leaving
a substantial hole in the 33-company Hang Seng index.

Stock sales by corporate investors realising profits to boost earnings ahead
of the September book closing are expected to peak this week, writes Emiko
Tarazono.
While public pension and insurance funds are likely to support prices around
20,000, large capital stocks and banks will face selling pressure.
Investors are expected to focus on releases by think-tanks on corporate
earnings for the current business year to next March but Friday's futures
and options settlements will introduce a note of caution.

The busy first-half reporting season continues this week. The market was in
good form in the early part of last week before news of an unexpected
downturn at Bols Wessanen, the drinks group, on Wednesday, led prices lower.
That news put a check on a rise in shares in Heineken, which reports its own
first-half results on Friday. Elsewhere in the brewing sector, Grolsch
unveils interim figures on Wednesday.
Ahold is due to report tomorrow and Fortis Amev first-half figures come on
Thursday.

After the excitement generated last week by UBS's news of improved trading
income in July and August, and the better than expected six-month figures
from Roche, the health products group, on Friday, the Swiss market starts
the week in confident mood.
All three of the big Swiss banks were out of favour in the aftermath of
their first-half results, although there have been signs of renewed interest
in recent sessions.
Mr Bryan Crossley at Hoare Govett said that while it may not be realistic to
expect the Swiss banks to recover the relative standing in the market that
they enjoyed back in the mid-1980s, it is much more debatable whether they
really deserve to be as much as 30 per cent below their early-1987 peak
relative rating.
'In the short term, continuing doubts about trading prospects are likely to
remain a drag on share prices,' he said.
'However, we are more optimistic about the earnings outlook for 1995 and it
should be borne in mind that 1994 profits will probably end up not too far
short of the record levels of 1993, which were widely considered as quite
exceptional.'
There was still some scope for further easing of loan provisioning
requirements as the economic upturn continued, he said, which would have the
effect of encouraging a renewed growth of business volumes.
Mr Crossley also argued that in a longer-term prospective, the growth in the
relative importance of trading income, because of the link with interest
rates, has actually reduced the overall volatility of earnings.
In the meantime, Ascom, the troubled telecommunications equipment maker, is
due to outline the group's new strategy and prospects at a press conference
on its first-half results on Thursday.
Results for the first quarter gave rise to some encouragement when the
company announced that it had avoided an operating loss in the first quarter
and that it continued to expect to break even in 1994 and expected to return
to profit in 1995.

Another firm week is in store. UBS said that while polls are suggesting that
a re-election of the CDU/CSU-FDP coalition might have helped sentiment, its
key reason for being positive was the likely surprises in earnings due to
higher volumes and prices.
KHD is expected to report interim results early in the week. UBS forecast a
loss of DM100m after a of DM98.3m deficit last time.
However, he said the full-year result should be somewhere around break-even
as the industrial plant division is likely to book most of its profits in
the second half.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Israel takes a global approach to
privatisation - International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   BY JULIAN OZANNE and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After decades of being overlooked by international investors, Israel is
preparing to emerge from obscurity with a series of international equity
offerings.
Progress towards peace in the region and the easing of the Arab boycott have
greatly reduced the political risks which have been associated with the
country for so long. At the same time, the favour-able economic outlook has
made Israeli stocks an attractive alternative to other fast-growing
economies in southern Europe, Asia and Latin America.
However, apart from a dedicated following in New York, where some 50 mainly
hi-tech Israeli companies are listed, foreign holdings of Israeli equities
are low.
At present only 2 per cent of the Israeli stock market is estimated to be
owned by foreigners, a significant proportion of which is made up of BZW
Investment Management's Israel Fund.
In the past, the Israeli government has not sought international capital
when it sold off stakes in state-owned companies because of the strong
demand from domestic investors.
However, the poor performance of the stock market this year and a diversion
of savings into a buoyant property market have encouraged it to pursue a
more global strategy.
Last week, the Government Companies Authority, the official body charged
with selling state-owned companies, said it had chosen Wertheim Schroder,
part of the UK merchant bank and fund management group Schroders, to act as
financial adviser to the sale of shares in Israel Chemicals (ICL), the
country's leading chemical and fertiliser company.
The government plans to sell 32 per cent of ICL, which is currently valued
at around Dollars 850m, through an international public offering and 15 per
cent to a single or a group of private investors.
Bankers believe that the offering, which would leave the government with a
28 per cent stake, will take place during the first quarter of next year.
In the meantime, Morgan Stanley has been selected to advise on the
international offering of shares in Bezek, the telecommunications company.
The government wishes to sell 25 per cent of the company, which would lower
its stake to 51 per cent. The sale, which is likely to go ahead by May next
year, could raise between Dollars 600m and Dollars 700m.
Observers say that at present, Bezek is less prepared for privatisation than
ICL, largely due to the uncertainty about the government's intention to
break Bezek's monopoly on international phone calls.
Another candidate for privatisation is El Al, the state-owned airline, The
government, which intends to sell 51 per cent of the company through the Tel
Aviv stock exchange and through an international offering, has appointed BZW
to conduct a valuation of the airline.
Three problems obstruct El Al's privatisation. First, the government wants
to keep a golden stake to protect state interests and the exact scope of
this has yet to be defined.
Second, it must also determine what to do about the airline's Dollars 55m
annual security costs, 80 per cent of which are currently met by the
government.
Third, the government must decide whether to remove legislation which bans
El Al from Sabbath flights. The ban on flying between dusk on Friday and
dusk on Saturday cost the company an estimated Dollars 30m to Dollars 40m in
profit last year. Officials say these issues should be resolved in time for
El Al to be floated by mid-1995.

FT  05 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: Emerging markets regain lost ground -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors are slowly returning to the secondary market for emerging country
debt - one of the most volatile of all fixed income markets.
Earlier this year, amid turmoil in international bond markets, investors
dumped so-called 'Brady bonds' - paper issued to restructure medium-term
public sector debt to foreign commercial banks - and other emerging market
debt instruments.
The market remained in the doldrums for much of the spring and summer but
last month, following the stabilisation of US long bond rates and positive
political news in both Mexico and Brazil, prices began to recover. Analysts
and traders say the market could now regain more lost ground.
'The worst appears to be over. One big proviso is that US long-term interest
rates remain stable,' says Peter West, economic adviser to West Merchant
Bank in London.
West Merchant's secondary debt market index - based on the prices of 13
emerging countries' debt - shows a decline of some 25 per cent between the
end of last year and late April. More recently though, the index has
recovered, rising by nearly 9 per cent between July 25 and August 22.
Two factors in particular have helped. First, US Treasury bonds have
stabilised. Investors measure the yields of Brady and other traded debt
against that of the US long bond and the sharp decline in prices following
the rise in US short-term interest rates triggered this year's decline.
The more recent flat trend in long-term US rates - with yields around 7.5
per cent for some weeks - has helped confidence and has allowed investors to
focus more on a number of positive political developments in Latin America.
Second, the apparently 'clean' victory last month of Ernesto Zedillo, the
candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in Mexico's
presidential election, has reassured foreign investors in a country which
has issued a quarter of all Latin Brady bonds.
At the same time improving prospects for Brazil - which accounts for 37 per
cent of all Latin American Brady bonds issued - has had a big impact. The
fall in inflation following the introduction in July of the 'real' plan, has
helped Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the plan's architect and former finance
minister, surge ahead in the opinion polls, ahead of October's elections.
Mr West is particularly impressed by the commitment of Mr Cardoso to
thorough-going fiscal reform, which he believes could help consolidate the
country's recovery.
The rise in Brazilian 'Bradys' has led the rally, with the price of par
bonds rising by 10.9 per cent and C Bonds up by 22.3 per cent in the month
between July 25 and August 22.
There are some indications that the rally in prices has eased in the last
two weeks. In particular, Venezuelan debt prices have fallen sharply in the
last few days. Some analysts suggest that the good news on the Brazilian and
Mexican political scene has now been fully discounted in prices.
'We think that in the near term Mexican and Brazilian Brady bonds are
technically unlikely to rally from here,' says Mr Paul Luke, head of
emerging markets research at Morgan Grenfell. However in general there are
grounds for optimism about future prospects, Mr Luke and others point out.
Following this year's fall in prices, there is now a much greater difference
between the yields of different Brady bonds. The gap in 'spreads' between
the cheapest bonds, those issued by Nigeria, and the most expensive paper,
from Mexico, is now more than three times greater than it was eight months
ago.
'You don't have the spread compression,' says Mr Luke. 'Investors are being
paid more for taking the big risks.' In addition some Brady bonds, those
issued at a discount to face value and paying variable rates should benefit
from the rise in interest rates. Also despite the fall in prices, liquidity
has improved following growth in trading volume.
Trading volume in emerging market debt reached almost Dollars 2,000bn in
1993, more than twice the volume recorded in the previous year, according to
a survey by the Emerging Markets Traders Association.
The completion this year of Brady deals for both Brazil and Bulgaria and the
imminent prospect of an agreement for Poland has increased the supply of
paper. 'The market is basically broadening,' says Mr Rodzianko of Chemical
Bank in New York, who is chairman of the association.
Buyers have been coming back to the market, with some recovery of interest
among US institutional investors and mutual funds.
Mr Rodzianko says there has been growth in local interest, especially in
Brazil, where investment banks and other institutions have been active
recently. 'Brazil is going to be unstoppable. There is a high upside
potential,' he says.
Mr Luke is optimistic on prospects for Bulgaria and Poland and also says
Peru and Panama could be close to Brady deals. 'You need good fundamentals
or low prices or a combination of both. In many cases here you have good
fundamental stories where assets are cheap. You can't keep a good market
down.'

FT  05 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: Waiting for a rise in European rates -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The impact of higher European economic growth on inflation and interest
rates will be crucial to the performance of European government bond markets
this autumn.
So far this year, the markets have had a terrible time. German government
bond yields have risen by 1.7 percentage points to more than 7 per cent from
a low point of 5.5 per cent at the beginning of the year. In the UK, the
increase has been even greater, with yields rising by 2.5 percentage points
to more than 8.5 per cent.
This turnround from last year's bull market was sparked by the US Federal
Reserve's decision in February to raise short-term interest rates, which
many investors took as the turning point in world interest rates. Seven
months later, however, investors are still waiting for European rates to
turn upwards. Europe has left recession far behind, yet strong economic
growth is showing few signs of feeding through into higher inflation.
The economic data is impressive. German industrial production grew at an
annual rate of 2.2 per cent in July, while inflation remains around 3 per
cent. 'Against that background, the Bundesbank is likely to trim interest
rates further,' said Mr Ken Wattret, international economist at Midland
Global Markets.
In the UK, gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3.7 per cent in
the second quarter but underlying inflation, at 2.2 per cent, is at its
lowest level for 27 years.
Despite the continued good economic news, financial markets remain
unconvinced that European governments will be able, or willing, to stop
inflation from rising again as growth continues.
'The current high bond yields show that investors' inflation expectations
are still high and that they expect interest rates to rise soon,' said Mr
Ceris Williams, director of fixed interest at Rothschild Asset Management.
However, many analysts are confident that yields will fall back as investors
become convinced by continued good economic data that inflation will be
subdued for a while yet.
'We may well see a recovery in bond prices once markets are reassured, but
it is a gradual process and market sentiment is fragile,' said Mr Wattret.
It is in Europe's 'peripheral' bond markets, such as Sweden, where the scope
for a reduction in yields is perhaps the greatest, in the medium-term at
least. Sweden, plagued by concern over its ballooning public debt, has seen
bond yields rise this year from around 7 per cent to as high as 12.5 per
cent last month.
'Despite the volatility, Swedish bonds offer good value with yields this
high,' said Mr Williams. In fact, current high yields make most European
government bond markets attractive.
'Investors are being paid a substantial premium for holding bonds as
opposed, for example, to cash,' he added.
German 12-month cash deposits currently provide returns of about 5.2 per
cent, whereas 10-year bonds yield 7.2 per cent. In the UK, 12-month cash
deposits yield 6.8 per cent and 10-year bonds 8.5 per cent.
However, it is not just worries about inflation that are weighing on
investors' minds. Many European countries are running large government
deficits, and the fear of a greater supply of bonds to fund those deficits
has been a drag on European bond markets throughout 1994. As the end of the
year comes closer, with many countries' borrowing programmes far from
complete, those fears are intensifying.
'There are still a lot of deficits out there which need to be funded, and
concern about supply is beginning to rear its head more and more,' said Mr
Wattret.
Daiwa, the Japanese investment bank, estimates that Germany has raised
slightly less than half of its funding needs for the year, with only four
months remaining.
The UK, on the other hand, is more advanced. Just five months into its
fiscal year, it has raised Pounds 10bn out of a total requirement of Pounds
30bn.
Germany is lagging mainly because it has been reluctant to borrow at the
prevailing yields, preferring to wait for them to fall. Similarly, Spain has
been forced by high long-term yields to shift its funding from the long end
of the market to relatively cheaper shorter-dated debt.
Concern about increased supply, with the possibility of a more expansionist
president being elected next year, will probably be one of the main negative
influences on the French government bond market for the rest of this year.
In August, both Sweden and Italy raised their official short-term interest
rates for the first time in this economic cycle, to the consternation of
European bond markets.
On Wednesday, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the
governor of the Bank of England, hold their regular monthly meeting to
discuss UK monetary policy. A decision at that meeting to raise UK interest
rates would perhaps be a greater test of current bond market sentiment than
the moves by Italy and Sweden. It would be a sign that the turning point in
European interest rates is really here at last.

Since last week's Bundesbank meeting provided no new clues as to future
German rates developments - the repo rate was again fixed at 4.85 per cent
for the next two securities repurchase offerings - the mood in the domestic
bond markets depends as usual this week on external influences.
For domestic investors, the DAX stock market index, driven entirely by hopes
of profits improvements, remains the focus of attention. Thursday's release
of first-half west German gross domestic product data has already been
widely forecast and discounted.
According to some dealers, the bond market is at present characterised by an
underlying negative sentiment, possibly exacerbated by post-holiday sloth
among dealers.
Last week's surprise rises in French banks' base rates prompted a flurry of
selling, sharpened by Germany's higher than expected industrial production
figures.
US labour market data for August, released on Friday, stirred a brief bout
of buying on the grounds that unchanged unemployment figures and lower than
expected new job signings signalled less buoyant economic activity. But bund
futures suffered later when US analysts claimed to have detected new grounds
for fearing inflation in a slight increase in hourly wages.
Today's US holiday will give German dealers a chance to make up their own
minds.

US markets are closed today for the Labor Day holiday, but when investors
return to work tomorrow they are likely to still be digesting the
implications of last Friday's August employment news.
Although headline numbers were reassuring, the 30-year Treasury bond yield
rose to almost 7.5 per cent as investors were worried that the rise in the
manufacturing working week last month indicated a strengthening in the
industrial sector of the economy.
Friday's movement, however, seems overreaction to the data, and some rebound
in the market is likely tomorrow morning, particularly as there will be no
significant new statistics for several days.
The calendar is relatively quiet until Friday, with data on July wholesale
trade and consumer credit, second-quarter productivity and weekly money
supply growth unlikely to have any impact on prices.
Trading will be dominated by manoeuvring ahead of Friday's publication of
the August producer prices index. Broking house Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
forecasts a 0.4 per cent increase in the August PPI, following July's 0.5
per cent rise, and a 0.2 per cent increase in the 'core' PPI, which excludes
food and energy. If the forecasts prove correct, the annual rate of producer
price inflation will be steady at 2.2 per cent.

While the government's view on the domestic economy will be released later
this week by the Economic Planning Agency's monthly report, bond prices seem
to have discounted a large part of the recovery.
The No 164 10-year benchmark bond closed up 5 basis points at 4.735 per cent
last week in spite of positive news over the government's financing.
Requests from ministries for the next business year have averaged increases
of 4.8 per cent, while the ministry of finance indicated only a 1.25 per
cent increase.
Moreover, the three-party coalition government announced that there will no
supplementary budget.
The steepening of the yield curve only seems to confirm that many market
participants expect a sharp jump in the economy, and a rise in inflation
rather than a modest recovery and subdued inflation figures predicted by
most analysts.
'The market is discounting recovery pretty far in advance,' says Mr Dick
Beason, economist at James Capel in Tokyo.
Meanwhile, news from the bilateral framework talks on trade with the US this
week may affect movements of the yen, which usually has a short-term impact
on bond yields. A stronger yen will support bonds, which are likely to face
profit-taking by institutional investors.

Despite a busy week for economic statistics, the gilts market is likely to
focus on Wednesday's monthly meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor
of the exchequer and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England.
After hints that the Bank wants to see an interest rate rise over the next
few months, speculation will arise over whether the two men will immediately
move to push up rates from their current level of 5.25 per cent.
Ms Katy Peters, senior economist at Daiwa Europe, says most indicators have
shown little sign of inflationary pressure since the two last met. The rate
of narrow money growth is expected to slow, when announced on Monday; house
prices are weak; and annual growth of average earnings has stayed at 3.75
per cent. Ms Peters thinks rates will be left unchanged.
To help them decide on the strength of the recovery, industrial production
and manufacturing output figures for July will be released on Tuesday.
Analysts expect each of these to rise by 0.4 per cent month-on-month.
Whatever the economic and interest rate news, gilts may find it difficult to
make progress without the help of the international market. The yield spread
to 10-year German bunds fell below 140 basis points on Friday, having been
180 points a few weeks ago.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Emerging Markets: US-Japan talks move to centre stage -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A series of high-level trade talks this week between US and Japanese
officials could provide fresh direction for the dollar.
The trade dispute between the two countries has been a key factor in the
dollar's weakness this year. There are widely differing views, though, as to
what progress can be expected, and hence what the likely outlook for the
dollar is.
Elsewhere, sterling will be a focus of attention as markets watch the
monthly monetary meeting in the UK for any signs of a decision to raise
interest rates.
In general, currency market activity is likely to be subdued by the labour
day holiday in the US today, and the Jewish new year later in the week.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, is scheduled to hold talks
with Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Japanese international trade and industry
ministry, and Mr Yohei Kono, the foreign minister.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS in London, argues
that a breakthrough in the talks is increasingly likely. On this basis he
predicts that the dollar could rise to Y107 to Y110 by the end of the year.
Economists at Swiss Bank take a different view. 'We expect that the market
will become disenchanted with the persistent trade talks between the US and
Japan,' they say, predicting that the dollar will test new lows against the
yen.
Over the next three months, however, they see the dollar rising to Y105
through central bank intervention, and dollar buying on the back of hopes
that the Japanese trade and current account surpluses will shrink.
Tomorrow's release of the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business
activity should provide some firm evidence of the strength - or not - of
economic recovery.
Opinion in the UK is mixed about whether any upward move in interest rates
can be expected. Good inflation figures, however, coupled with indications
of a slowdown in consumer spending, appear to have shifted the odds in
favour of rates staying unchanged, possibly for the rest of the year.
This may cause sterling to weaken, but the dollar probably remains a more
important determinant of its fate than the level of UK interest rates.
Market concerns about Italy's fiscal position have recently contributed to
lira volatility. For this reason tomorrow's meeting of the Italian cabinet,
to discuss the 1995 budget, will be closely watched.

The Amman share market was depressed last week by plans for a capital gains
tax on the share dealing of finan- cial institutions. On Tuesday, most
shares plunged to the 5 per cent daily price limit imposed to stabilise
fluctuations. On Wednesday, however, the general price index ended weekly
trading only 0.55 down on the day at 147.12.
A feared steep fall in volume and prices was averted after investors decided
the proposals were unenforceable at any time in the near future, and that
they still had to be debated before becoming law.

Beirut's defunct stock exchange will reopen within two months, the president
of the newly-appointed stock exchange committee said in a newspaper
interview.
The exchange, which operated last in 1984 at the height of Lebanon's 1975-90
civil war, would trade in shares of those companies listed on the exchange
before it closed, he said. These are currently being dealt in the unofficial
grey market.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Emerging Markets: Bulls ride roughshod over doubters - The
Emerging Investor

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'If making money is a sin . . . welcome to hell,' reads an advertising sign
in Bombay proclaiming the virtues of stock market investment.
All over the city there are people taking the message to heart - from the
crowds milling in the narrow streets around the Bombay Stock Exchange, to
the foreign investment bankers who have taken up residence in the luxury
hotels.
Bombay is in the midst of its biggest stock market investment boom in over
two years. The Bombay Stock Exchange's index of leading shares has risen by
about 35 per cent since early May to reach a new all-time high last
Wednesday of 4,588.18.
The previous record of 4,546 was set in April 1992, at the peak of a rally
which collapsed when it emerged that the market was being fuelled by
suspected illegal share-financing operations organised by Mr Harshad Mehta,
a leading stockbroker. The ensuing Rs40bn (Dollars 12.75bn) scandal cast a
cloud over Bombay's financial markets that is only now beginning to lift.
The most bullish stockbrokers are certain that the index is now in sight of
5,000. The more cautious point out that the market has already risen by more
than 70 per cent since its low of 2,633 in the middle of last year, and is
riding for a fall. But those who think a correction is overdue are in the
minority.
The bulls' case is built on a strong revival in the economy. Three years
after the start of economic reform in 1991 plunged much of Indian industry
into a prolonged recession, there are signs that many companies are
recovering. In the year to March 1994, exports grew 22 per cent. The first
few months of 1994-95 have seen a pick-up in domestic demand, particularly
for consumer goods, and this should be sustained, given that the monsoon
seems to have distributed ample rains.
Moreover, the bulls expect interest rates to fall by about 1 percentage
point when the Reserve Bank of India sets monetary policy later this month
for the October-March half-year. This would bring minimum commercial lending
rates to 14 per cent, compared with a high of 19 per cent in 1991-92.
All this, say the bulls, is feeding growth in corporate profits, which rose
75 per cent at the net level in 1993-94 and are forecast by stockbrokers to
increase a further 40 to 50 per cent in the current year. According to the
bulls, these increases justify current price/earnings multiples for leading
shares, which trade at about 53 times their net earnings for 1993-94, and 35
times likely earnings for 1994-95.
The bears do not deny that the economic outlook is better than at any time
in the past three years. But they believe that in their rush to buy,
investors have pushed share prices far beyond levels justified by economic
logic. 'Prices are simply outrageous,' says Mr Pradip Shah, managing
director of Crisil, a credit rating agency. 'The economy is good but it's
not that good.'
Mr R Balakrishnan, senior vice president at DSP Financial Consultants, a
securities company, argues that the rate of profits growth has been
exaggerated by one-off technical changes, including the liberalisation of
foreign exchange rules and in accountancy regulations covering depreciation.
'Underlying profits growth is moderate,' he says.
He and other bears warn that shares are being driven up mainly by the flood
of money entering a market which is too small to cope. Domestic investors'
appetites have been whetted by the sight of foreign fund managers, who were
allowed into India only in late 1992, chasing Indian stocks.
Even although the total market capitalisation of the Bombay market is now
nearly Dollars 150bn, daily turnover is quite low - below Dollars 100m -
because so little stock is freely traded. The families that control most
listed companies typically hold 25 to 75 per cent of the issued capital.
Other long-term holders such as development banks are also infrequent
sellers. Very little is left for foreign fund managers and other new
investors to buy.
The difficulties in acquiring shares are accentuated by the cumbersome
trading, settlement and transfer procedures, which mean it can take six
weeks for sellers to receive payment and three months for buyers to secure
full ownership of their stock. Although stockbrokers and bankers are trying
to improve the process, they only expect dramatic changes after the Bombay
Stock Exchange and the newly-formed National Stock Exchange launch
computerised on-screen trading, and a computerised share depositary is
established to handle share transfers smoothly. On-screen trading on the NSE
could start this year for top stocks and on the BSE next summer, but a
fully-fledged depositary is two or three years away.
These difficulties have already persuaded some foreign fund managers to slow
their purchases of Indian stock or to switch to the Euroequity issues of
Indian companies. After averaging Dollars 251m a month in the first half of
1994, net foreign buying of Indian equity fell to Dollars 89m in July and
Dollars 80m in August. Given that many investment funds dedicated to India
have yet to invest, this slowdown is likely to be temporary, but it shows
that fund managers are paying heed to price levels.
They are also diversifying their purchases from the large capitalisation
stocks, which tend to trade on the highest multiples, to smaller issues,
where price/earnings ratios are as low as 10. Mr Shah believes that this is
where the best value is now to be found in the market - but it is also where
the problems of acquiring stock are the greatest.

FT  05 SEP 94 / The Markets: Overdoing the caution - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As analysts speculate feverishly over the outcome of Wednesday's chat
between the UK chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England it is
worth casting an eye over the recent behaviour of sterling futures. In
effect the market has been anticipating an increase in short-term rates of
more than a full percentage point by December - in other words, at least two
separate half point increases.
Notwithstanding the strong probability of some pre-emptive tightening before
Christmas, the implicitly draconian forecast looks manic in the light of
recent economic data.
It certainly appears a backhanded compliment to the credibility of UK
monetary policy, as, incidentally, does the behaviour of long-term rates
(see chart), where the yield differential in the UK has moved very
unfavourably this year against German bunds. The question is whether the
markets are overdoing the caution, leaving a big arbitrage opportunity for
cooler heads.
Some, such as CS First Boston in its September fixed income research
bulletin, have unhesitatingly recommended buying the December short sterling
futures contract outright. My inclination is on their side of the argument.
But it is still worth playing devil's advocate to see what could justify the
market's pessimism.
The prize candidate for this role is a sterling crisis. The obvious scenario
would probably involve market worries about high rates of growth leading to
a rapid disappearance of the gap between actual and potential output,
quickly followed by inflationary bottlenecks. Against a background of no
early increase in base rates and a November budget which is perceived to be
excessively political and over-generous, this could easily do the trick.
The snag with the argument is that we have already seen some pre-emptive
tightening by the bond markets, which have imposed constraints on
consumption via the rise in the cost of fixed-rate mortgages. This has
coincided with the chancellor's tougher fiscal policy starting to make its
mark.
The worry about capacity utilisation thus looks premature in relation to a
December futures contract. As for the concern about Kenneth Clarke's fiscal
and monetary intentions, it presupposes that the man is wholly devoid of
judgment.
A more interesting case for pessimism is that advanced by Mr Brian Reading
of Lombard Street Research. This hinges on Britain's role as a global
financial intermediary in a world where the pattern of capital flows looks
increasingly perverse. If life were rational, countries with ageing
populations in the developed world might be expected to run current account
surpluses on their balance of payments and to export capital to developing
countries where the risk-adjusted returns are much higher. Yet within the
Group of Seven industrialised countries, only Japan comes close to matching
that description.
Even then, the Japanese last year recycled only half their current account
surplus in the form of long-term direct and portfolio outflows. But the most
remarkable statistic in the accompanying table is the one that shows
Britain, despite being in substantial current account deficit, becoming the
biggest net exporter of long-term portfolio capital in the G7 in 1993.
The US, too, has recently turned generous with its outflows, especially if
direct outward investment of a further net Dollars 37bn is included.
Meanwhile, Germany and Italy both received huge portfolio inflows.
Part of the reason why the English-speaking economies have been exporting
capital despite running current account deficits is that their financial
systems are so highly developed. Traditionally, ageing Britons are big
savers. But much of their saving has been recycled to younger Britons who
borrow more than their counterparts elsewhere. When the inter-generational
transfer is netted out, the savings rate proves unduly low and contributes
to a large current account deficit.
Yet the deployment of the gross savings of the ageing populations of the US
and Britain is conducted mainly by fund managers without regard to
macro-economic considerations such as the overall level of national savings.
This leads to a big financing requirement. Both countries have, in effect,
ended up borrowing short and lending long on a huge scale.
This leads to an unstable situation, which is more worrying for Britain than
the US where external factors are less important for the conduct of monetary
policy. Given that the UK economic recovery is more advanced than
continental Europe's, Britain will need to cut interest rates again before
Germany. That could cut off the short-term inflows, causing sterling to
crash.
Mr Reading concludes from this that the way to deal with the new external
constraint on monetary policy is to allow currencies to take the strain,
while the consequences of easier money are offset by tighter fiscal policy.
An equally striking feature of the table is the reversal of the biggest net
flows, those of Britain and Japan, in the first quarter of this year. Yet in
practise they do not represent conventional repatriation since they were
largely offset by a return to repayments of borrowing. Because of the
historic losses sustained through the appreciation of the yen, Japanese
institutions finance much of their international capital excursions in the
euromarkets. London, meanwhile, plays host to many leveraged investors in
its capacity as an international financial centre.
The big swings in the table help explain the extent of the bond market
fall-out earlier this year. And, indeed, why burnt investors are leaving
such large arbitrage opportunities in the futures markets.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
If a rise in the sale of apples relative to oranges had negative wider
consequences, observers might call for market reform. Few, however, would
accuse apples of harbouring anti-social ambitions. The trouble with the
labour market is that people are not like fruit. Discern a trend, and you
could find your politics being examined more vigorously than the finding
itself.
Analysing developments in the UK over the past 20 years is especially
hazardous. Overall, employment trends have favoured women; but an article
published today in the centre-left journal, New Economy*, argues that
economists' research has gone the other way.
The author, Rosemary Quiney, claims that in describing the decline of
full-time work for men, and the accompanying growth of the female, largely
part-time, labour force, researchers may be encouraging a backlash against
women.
Female employment in the UK has risen by 23 per cent since 1971, while the
number of employed men has fallen by almost the same amount. Most
researchers trying to understand this change claim to welcome the fact that
female job opportunities have grown. Women have clearly benefited from the
shifting character of jobs created, a rising proportion of which are
part-time, and concentrated in the service sector.
The same authors have understandably - if, according to Ms Quiney,
incautiously - drawn attention to the down-side of recent developments, both
for male employment prospects and the distribution of income across
households.
Male unemployment, currently 12.6 per cent, is more than double the 5.1 per
cent rate suffered by women.
In addition, since more than three-quarters of female part-time work is
taken by married women with employed husbands, there might be a damaging
side-effect for the overall distribution of income. 'Work-rich' households,
in which both partners have jobs, boost their relative standing, while the
homes of the unemployed slip even further down.
Too often, Ms Quiney argues, these facts are implicitly drawn together into
an accusation against women. Not only are women suffering less unemployment
than men, but since they are already 'comfortably off', female part-timers
are effectively branded as 'stealing jobs from needy men because of a
selfish desire to buy pins'.
This is not merely politically incorrect; it is factually questionable as
well. For one thing, headline unemployment rates are notorious for
understating the number of jobless women. Statistics calculated by the OECD
tend to put UK female unemployment a good deal higher than the official
rate.
Even the adjusted figures miss out those women who drop out of the labour
force to work at home, when their job prospects are low. In fact, a smaller
proportion of single mothers are finding work: 22 per cent were employed in
1990-2, compared to 26 per cent in 1977-9.
It is equally misleading to characterise married women's employment as a bid
for extra pocket money. As Ms Quiney notes, most working women contribute
more than a third of their household's earned income.
Research by Mr Stephen Machin and Ms Jane Waldfogel, at the London School of
Economics, has found that a disproportionate number of the women going out
to work were from poorer households. This means that, far from adding to the
recent trend towards greater income inequality among working households, the
'emancipation' of such women counteracted it. Many families might be in
poverty, were it not for the woman's efforts.
The distributive effects of the rise in the number of dual- earner
households could be less favourable if one includes families in which no-one
has a job. But the chart (left) shows that this is where women have not
avoided their partners' fate.
The top line of the graph confirms the steady rise in the number of working
wives. The percentage of married couples of working age in which the woman
is 'non-employed' (either on the dole or out of the labour force altogether)
has fallen from 45 per cent, in 1973, to 35 per cent in 1991.
However, this disguises the fact that only the wives of working husbands
have been finding jobs. The middle line charts their progress: a mere 25 per
cent of them are now non-employed, compared to 42 per cent 20 years ago.
This is steeper than the line above, because a growing proportion of women
in the same type of household have been 'sharing' non-employment with their
husbands: nearly a tenth, in 1991, compared to 3 per cent in 1973.
If one combines these results for married couples with the relative labour
market failure of single mothers, it is clear that the problem is not rising
sexual equality, per se. In a growing number of 'work-poor' homes, neither
men nor women are being offered the full-time, permanent jobs which were the
norm when the benefit system was created. Instead, firms are opting to
employ workers on rather different terms. Accepting them can leave these
families worse off, and less economically secure, than remaining on the
dole.
Finding a 'correct' way to describe these disturbing labour market trends
ought not to distract from deciding how they might be reversed. Rather than
'shoot the messenger', find ways to reform the system which produced the
message.

FT  05 SEP 94 / The Markets: Cocoa pact talks to resume - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cocoa Producers and consumers will on Thursday begin a fresh attempt to
agree rules covering a production management deal that was implemented in
February.
Members of the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) failed to reach
agreement in June, when consumers complained that their views were not
adequately represented on the organisation's production committee.
The International Cocoa Agreement, which is operated by the ICCO, has
adopted production management and consumption promotion in place of its
buffer stock price stabilisation scheme, which has been moribund for some
years.
This month's session, which is to continue until September 20, will comprise
meetings of the full ICCO council, as well as the production, consumption
and executive committees.
Some of the urgency was taken out of the revival of the cocoa pact by last
autumn's price rally, with expectations of more to come as reduced
production in West Africa and other areas (a legacy of historic low prices)
promised a drawdown from world stocks.
Prices have become stuck in something of a rut this summer, but remain some
35 per cent above the level of the summer of 1993.
Nevertheless, producing members of the ICCO are keen to have some working
machinery in place to counter any later market setbacks. Some have suggested
that if some satisfactory arrangement cannot be reached under the auspices
of the ICCO, then producers might do worse than to emulate the coffee
producers' successful export retention scheme, which had helped to lift
prices even before June/July frosts in Brazil drove them to 8 1/2-year
highs.
Other events this week include a three-day Indian planters' meeting in
Coonoor to assess crop prospects for tea, coffee, rubber and spices, and a
four-day international oils and fats conference in Kuala Lumpur. On
Wednesday Statistics Canada is due to release its grain stocks report.

FT  05 SEP 94 / International Company News: Mexican airlines' chairman
resigns
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman of Mexico's two largest airlines, Mexicana and Aeromexico, has
stepped down under pressure from creditor banks seeking a Dollars 200m
injection of new capital from shareholders.
The resignation of Mr Gerardo de Prevoisin, who in February 1993 brought the
two former competitors together, threatens to unravel the alliance that
controls more than 70 per cent of Mexico's domestic airline market.
Both airlines are in financial trouble. Aeromexico lost Dollars 136m in the
first half of 1994, while Mexicana followed 1993 losses of Dollars 100m with
a first-half 1994 loss of Dollars 115m. Together they have total debts of
more than Dollars 1bn.
Creditor banks gave Mr de Prevoisin until September 1 to find Dollars 150m
of fresh capital for Mexicana and about Dollars 50m for Aeromexico. Advisers
to Mr de Prevoisin say his first priority has been to find new money for
Aeromexico, which has been the stronger of the two companies, both of which
were privatised by the Mexican government in the 1980s.
Mr de Prevoisin's plan of rationalising routes and uniting workforces among
the two carriers has yet to prove its worth. Only baggage handling and other
ground services have been successfully combined.
Management has faced competition from a plethora of new, small airlines
which have taken advantage of the Mexican government's open skies policy and
flooded the most popular routes with cut-price flights.
Average revenue for the airlines is between 15 and 20 cents per km
travelled. The company believes it needs to increase that figure to about 30
cent per km in order to break even.
Mr Jose Luis Llamosas was named new chairman of Aeromexico, while Claudio
Terrein will take over the post at Mexicana. Both were already board members
of both airlines.

FT  05 SEP 94 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley bullish on
Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, has stolen a march on its
competitors with the publication of a bullish report on the Irish economy
and stock market only days after the IRA announced its ceasefire.
With the exception of Luxembourg, the Irish economy is the smallest in the
European Union and is only equivalent to one-thirtieth of the size of the
west German economy and one-twentieth of the size of the UK's.
Nevertheless, its dynamism has prompted Morgan Stanley to nickname it the
'Celtic Tiger', a variation of the label given to the fast-growing economies
in south-east Asia.
It notes that Ireland has the most rapidly-growing economy in the European
Union, with Gross Domestic Product growth averaging 5 per cent over the five
years to 1993.
This growth rate may be exceeded in both 1994 and 1995, the broker
forecasts. At the same time, inflation risks are muted by strong
productivity trends, a large balance of payments surplus and a firm exchange
rate.
Mr Richard Davidson, Morgan Stanley's European equity strategist, said that
the IRA's ceasefire further improved the country's prospects because of the
likely easing of border restrictions and the freer movement of goods. 'There
will be more investment in either part of Ireland which have positive
benefits for both economies,' he said.
Ireland's entry into the widely-used MSCI Europe index has prompted
institutional investors to include Irish stocks in their portfolios. The
country has a benchmark weighting of 0.6 per cent in the index but Morgan
Stanley recommends a portfolio allocation of 1.3 per cent.
'We expect that the market can rise by 15 per cent over the next 12 months,'
said Mr Davidson. He noted that while international investor interest has
increased over the last decade, the market remains undervalued, particularly
the banking sector.
However, like the economy, the Irish stock market is also one of the
smallest in Europe with a total market capitalisation of Dollars 17bn.
Average daily volume in Dublin in July was IPounds 26m (Dollars 17m), of
which the top 10 stocks made up 83 per cent.
The low level of liquidity outside the top 10 stocks poses considerable
problems for institutions wanting to deal in large amounts. 'Investors still
view the market as illiquid and dominated by locals but there is good profit
growth and valuations are cheap,' said Mr Davidson.
The Irish government's intention to sell off its remaining 15 per cent stake
in Irish Life and the potential privatisations of Telecom Eireann and the
Aer Lingus group should greatly improve market liquidity.
In addition, the flotation next month of the building society Irish
Permanent should raise between IPounds 30m and IPounds 50m.

FT  05 SEP 94 / International Company News: Offer for Texaco Canada rejected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Texaco, the big US oil group, has rejected an offer worth CDollars 200m
(USDollars 146m) for its Canadian subsidiary, Texaco Canada Petroleum.
The US company says Texaco Canada is an important part of group strategy for
North America. Texaco holds 78 per cent of Texaco Canada, an Alberta oil and
gas producer and developer.
The bid is from Canadian 88 Energy, a small western Canada oil and gas
company, which is offering CDollars 1.60 a share for Texaco Canada's 124m
shares after Texaco itself offered to buy the minority-held shares at
CDollars 1.40 a share.
Dissident Texaco Canada shareholders had complained that Texaco's offer
grossly undervalued Texaco Canada's assets. Canadian 88 insisted its bid was
'very serious' and not aimed at forcing Texaco to raise its offer for the
minority shares. It owns almost 10 per cent of Texaco Canada.

FT  05 SEP 94 / International Company News: Atlanta group tops Western Union
bids
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
First Financial Management, an Atlanta-based information services company,
has offered Dollars 800m in cash to acquire Western Union Financial
Services, the big US money-transfer business.
First Financial has also offered to assume about Dollars 265m of Western
Union unfinanced pension liabilities. This lifts the total value of the bid
to above Dollars 1bn.
The offer tops two previous bids for Western Union: Dollars 970m offered
last week by Forstman Little, the New York buy-out firm, and Dollars 660m
offered by First Data Corporation. First Data, however, has also agreed to
assume the Dollars 265m in pension liabilities.
Western Union is currently owned by New Valley, a New Jersey-based financial
services company which has been operating under bankruptcy court protection
for the past year and a half. New Valley hopes eventually to sell the unit
for enough to pay off its creditors.
The deadline for the auction ends on September 16, but analysts believe that
it is unlikely First Financial's bid will be topped.
Founded in 1851, Western Union controls 90 per cent of the US domestic money
transfer market. Last year it completed 40m transfers of funds worth more
than Dollars 7.8bn. Revenues this year are expected to top Dollars 550m.
Western Union last changed hands in 1987 in a junk bond-financed leveraged
buy-out. However, the company, subsequently renamed New Valley, struggled to
meet the high interest on its debt, and eventually filed for bankruptcy in
March 1993.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Sydney Futures Exchange said that futures and options trading rose by 51
per cent in the first eight months of 1994, compared with the same period a
year ago, thanks partly to a surge in interest from overseas, Reuter reports
from Sydney.
The chief executive of the exchange, Mr Les Hosking, said that a total of
21.3m contracts were traded in the period to August 31. Of the total, 8 per
cent was sourced from overnight trading on SFE's after-hours screen-based
market.
Mr Hosking said that SFE equity derivatives have been the fastest growing
products. Interest rate contracts also saw solid growth, with volumes rising
by 38 per cent for the three-year bond contract, by 45 per cent for the
90-day bank bill contract and by 46 per cent for the 10-year bond contract.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is to consolidate its two largest divisions
into a single membership class. The exchange proposes payouts to
agricultural sector traders of Dollars 60,000 to Dollars Dollars 70,000 in a
deal totalling Dollars 45m.

in New York

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISS International Service Systems, the Danish industrial cleaning group, is
to issue 3m B shares on the New York Stock Exchange this autumn.
Plans to seek a New York listing were initially announced last year, when
ISS paid Dollars 93.5m for National Cleaning Group of the US to become the
largest cleaning business in North America with sales of about Dollars 950m.
The share issue was postponed this spring when the ISS share price, which
peaked at DKr276 early in the year, began to weaken. The shares took a
further beating in August following the group half-year results, falling
some 20 per cent to DKr177.
But Mr Poul Andreassen, chief executive, said the group's investment bankers
had advised it to go ahead with the issue, which will raise about DKr530m
(Dollars 86m) at the current market price.
'The issue will strengthen our equity capital and enable us to go ahead with
our strategy of expanding our core cleaning business, including by new
acquisitions,' he said.
Group equity capital at the end of June was about DKr1.47bn and assets about
DKr6.15bn, an equity ratio of 23.9 per cent.
ISS is the world leader in industrial cleaning with a labour force in excess
of 120,000. For the first half of 1994 sales rose 22 per cent to DKr7.24bn
and pre-tax profits climbed 33 per cent to DKr193m.

FT  05 SEP 94 / International Company News: Sime Darby lifts profits by 7.5%
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sime Darby, the Malaysian conglomerate that boasts of being southeast Asia's
biggest multinational, has reported a 7.5 per cent improvement to MDollars
904m (USDollars 354m) in pre-tax profits for the year to June.
The result was below most analysts' expectations but was viewed as
satisfactory for one of the region's most conservatively run and cash-rich
companies.
A final dividend of 17.5 Malaysian cents was recommended, compared with 16.5
Malaysian cents in the previous year. Group turnover rose to MDollars 8.21bn
from MDollars 7.04bn.
Sime Darby, once largely plantation-based, has diversified into a wide range
of activities including the oil and gas industry, property, motor and heavy
equipment franchises and the manufacture of various rubber products.
The main money-earning base was once again Hong Kong. Pre-tax profits in
Sime's division in Hong Kong, where it acts as the main automotive and heavy
equipment distributor, were MDollars 227m compared with MDollars 195m last
year.
Analysts say Sime benefited from buoyant demand in its motor distribution in
Hong Kong, particularly for European-sourced cars, but its overall
performance in the territory was not as impressive as in previous years.
Sime's operations in Malaysia, the Philippines and Australia reported lower
profits while Singapore registered improved results. Profit from the
plantations division fell by nearly MDollars 20m due to lower average prices
for palm oil products. Depressed rubber prices also hurt profit margins.
However, with palm oil prices now recording 10-year highs and rubber prices
strengthening, it is likely that plantations will have a far better year.
Sime should also benefit from its involvement in various infrastructure
projects, including its share in an independent power producer scheme in
Malaysia.
'The board believes the group will have another year of record profitability
in 1994-1995,' it said.

Lend Lease, the Sydney-based financial services group, has announced an
operating profit before tax of ADollars 264.7m (USDollars 196m) for the year
to end-June, up from ADollars 248m in the previous 12 months. The after-tax
figure increased by 12.6 per cent to ADollars 232.1m, and fully-diluted
earnings per share rose 12.3 per cent, to 109.7 cents.
The company said there were gains in all its main divisions, which comprise
property, corporate services and retail financial services, including the
MLC and Australian Eagle life businesses.
Funds under management, which take in those of the recently-acquired
Yarmouth group in the US, now total ADollars 29.2bn, an increase of 57 per
cent.
The company said that it is budgeting for further improvements in profit and
earnings per share in the current year.
It noted that its 12 per cent stake in Westpac, the large Australian banking
group, was held at cost, or ADollars 619m, while the market value of the
investment was now ADollars 785m.

FT  05 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Celsis names chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Celsis International, the biotechnology company, has ended six months of
management uncertainty by appointing a new chief executive to replace Mr
Tony Martin, who was dismissed in April on the grounds that he was
'ineffectual'.
The Cambridge-based company, which specialises in contamination detection
equipment, has recruited Mr Arthur Holden from Baxter International, the US
medical supplies group, where he was global marketing vice-president in the
renal division.
Mr Holden signed a two-year rolling contract on Friday, some four months
after he was first approached by Celsis.
The company, however, declined to disclose the value of his package or
whether his annual salary would exceed the Pounds 85,000 paid to Mr Martin.
It has yet to reach a settlement with its former chief executive, who still
holds shares worth more than Pounds 1.53m after leaving with almost two and
a half years of his three-year contract to run.
Mr Mark Clements, finance director, said Mr Holden would help to build
shareholder value in the company, which earlier this year announced
increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.58m (Pounds 460,000) following a sharp
rise in research and development spending from Pounds 156,000 to Pounds
984,000 in the year to March 31.
That spending - using funds from last year's Pounds 12.4m flotation and
income from collaborative ventures with companies such as Wellcome and Merck
 -has been used to develop a range of hygiene monitoring products.
Mr Holden, who joins the company on October 10, said he was determined to
exploit commercial applications of Celsis' technology.
'I will be conducting a review of the overall strategy and will see if this
side of the business can be developed more rapidly,' he added.
In the latest commercial agreement, Celsis said it had signed a deal with
Colgate-Palmolive to use its bioluminescence kits to monitor personal care
products such as shampoos and body lotions.
The company declined to reveal how much the deal was worth, but predicted
that similar manufacturers would follow Colgate's lead.

FT  05 SEP 94 / UK Company News: TR City of London net assets advance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TR City of London Trust reported net assets up from 133.64p to 135.33p over
the year to the end of June.
Net revenue for the year improved from Pounds 9.02m to Pounds 10.7m for
earnings per share of 5.25p (4.59p).
A fourth interim dividend of 1.31p has already been paid for a total of 5p
(4.8p). For the current year the board is forecasting a total dividend of
5.24p.
The result was helped by a decision to charge half management expenses to
reserves. If the same allocation had applied in the previous year revenue
would have been Pounds 9.3m for earnings per share of 4.81p.

FT  05 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Zeneca drug strengthens place in cancer
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zeneca has submitted for approval a new drug that is likely to affect
profits growth within two or three years.
Casodex is a treatment for prostate cancer that is estimated by Lehman
Brothers, the stockbrokers, to have potential sales of between Dollars 250m
and Dollars 500m (Pounds 323m) a year. That would make it Zeneca's
third-biggest seller.
The drug is an oral anti-androgen. About 300,000 new prostate cancer cases
are reported each year worldwide, making it the second most common cancer in
men.
Approval for the drug is being sought first in the UK. Submissions to
regulatory authorities in the rest of the European Union and in the US will
follow by the end of the year, and it is likely to reach the market in 1995.
Other companies making or developing anti-androgens include Schering Plough
and Johnson &amp; Johnson of the US.
Casodex's approval would place Zeneca more firmly in the cancer market. It
already has Nolvadex and Zoladex in the area, but both are outsold by heart
treatments Zestril and Tenormin.

FT  05 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hambros to launch Asian trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hambros Bank is to launch an investment trust specialising in Asian
companies with a market capitalisation of less than Dollars 500m (Pounds
322.5m).
The Hambros Smaller Asian Companies Trust is based on the manager's belief
that smaller Asian companies are under-researched, and should benefit
disproportionately from fast economic growth in the region.
It will be managed by Hong Kong-based Hambro Pacific Fund Management, which
already runs the Hambros EQUUS South East Asia fund, covering a similar
geographic area, and ranked 13th of 32 offshore funds in the same sector
over three years.
The new trust's initial portfolio will be concentrated in the markets of
Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, but the managers will also be
free to invest throughout the rest of Asia, from South Korea to India.
The fund will be dollar denominated, but London-listed, and will have an
initial life of about seven years. Shares will be issued at Dollars 1, and
warrants will be attached on a one-for-five basis. Capital will be raised by
means of an institutional placing by NatWest Securities, with a minimum
subscription of Dollars 30,000.
A similar trust, Edinburgh New Tiger, was launched in March this year to
invest in Asian smaller companies, but its shares are still trading at below
the issue price after the corrections in world stock markets earlier this
year.

FT  05 SEP 94 / UK Company News: S Western Electricity buys back 2.5m shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Western Electricity has become the third of the cash-rich regional
electricity companies to buy back some of its shares.
The Bristol-based company on Friday purchased 2.5m of its ordinary shares in
the market at 820.5p per share, representing 2 per cent of the issued
ordinary shares.
Mr John Sellers, finance director, said the company had taken advantage of a
downturn in its share price on Thursday to enter the market.
In common with most other regional companies, South Western has powers to
buy back up to 10 per cent of its equity.
Mr Sellers said the company wants to assess the market's reaction to
Friday's purchase before deciding whether to buy back more shares.
Analysts expect other electricity companies will soon join South Western,
Seeboard and Eastern in buying back shares.
Each either has the cash in hand or low borrowings. Buying back shares
boosts earnings per share and enhances the potential to raise dividend
payments, even if the current upsurge in the sector's share prices
continues.
Brokers Hoare Govett estimate that share prices in the sector have risen
between 40 and 45 per cent on average in the two months to the end of
August.

FT  05 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Fantasy war games maker for market with
Pounds 40m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renegade goblins, space orks and blood angels will be fighting for
investors' attention next month when Games Workshop, a fantasy war games
manufacturer, comes to the market in a flotation expected to value it at
over Pounds 40m.
'We are not a toy maker, or satisfying some fad,' says chief executive Mr
Tom Kirby. 'This is a business which has been serving a hobby enjoyed by
thousands of young people for 16 years. I think our record speaks for
itself.'
The Nottingham-based group was the subject of a Pounds 10m management
buy-out three years ago, and in that time has doubled turnover to Pounds
24.5m. Operating profits have increased nearly threefold in the same period
to Pounds 4.6m.
Games Workshop designs, manufactures and markets all its own products. The
customers are predominantly male and between the ages of 10 and 17.
The company invents futuristic war games complete with figures and rules,
which it then controls and supplements with developments. Customers are
encouraged to keep up with the latest changes through the company's own
magazine, 'White Dwarf', which sells some 60,000 copies a month.
About 10 per cent of the UK business is done through mail order, the rest
through the company's network of 75 outlets. Like the magazine, the shops
sell only Games Workshop material and staff advise on the hobby. Games
Workshop also has branches in France, Germany, Australia, Spain and the US.
Last year, 45 per cent of sales came from abroad.
Mr Kirby is dismissive of changing tastes affecting the company's future.
'We have created several generations of customers already and are adding new
ones all the time. War games have been played for centuries, nothing's going
to change that.'
The flotation will seek to raise some Pounds 20m through a placing of half
the shares, with management share sales accounting for about 10 per cent of
this. The remaining 50 per cent of the shares will be subject to a free
float. Credit Lyonnais Laing is acting as stockbroker, and Samual Montagu as
financial adviser.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Govett &amp; Company, the fund management and insurance group, has announced a
significant expansion of its US operations.
It has signed a distribution agreement with American Capital Marketing, a US
mutual fund group, which it estimates will more than treble its US sales to
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m).
Mr Ian Whitehead, chief financial officer, added that the move would save
Govett some Dollars 3m a year in costs. 'These are obviously welcome, but
the most exciting aspect of the deal is the growth potential for our US
mutual funds,' he said. Govett currently manages seven such funds.
Govett will continue to act as investment manager of the funds, while
American Capital will take control of distribution, which Govett says will
substantially increase the number of wholesalers selling the products.
The US mutual fund market has Dollars 2,100bn of assets under management.
International funds, which have been one of the fastest growing segments,
represent 8.5 per cent of the assets. American Capital currently manages
more than Dollars 16bn-worth of assets through 44 mutual funds.

</HEADLINE>

Manders, the coatings and ink manufacturer, is expanding in New Zealand
through a NZDollars 35.5m (Pounds 14m) deal.
It is buying Morrison-PIM Holdings, which makes printing inks, for NZDollars
27.5m and the assumption of NZDollars 8m of borrowings.
In the year to June 30 1994 Morrison made an operating profit of NZDollars
3.9m (NZDollars 3.2m) on unchanged turnover of NZDollars 45.8m.
Manders said that the purchase would complement its existing New Zealand
business, which was acquired from Croda in January this year.

FT  05 SEP 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;G first-half profits likely to exceed
Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, the UK's sixth-largest, is on
Thursday likely to announce pre-tax profits exceeding Pounds 100m for the
first half of this year, after a sharp drop in provisions for bad and
doubtful debts.
It recorded pre-tax profits of Pounds 75.3m for the first six months of last
year. An increase of more than one third would be broadly in line with some
other large mortgage lenders, and a significant difference could re-open the
debate about the Pounds 1.8bn cash bid for the society by Lloyds Bank.
One of the questions raised by some members of the C&amp;G Alternatives Group is
whether C&amp;G could have attracted - or could still attract - a higher bid. At
the time of the announcement in April, one analyst suggested that a third
party could afford to offer up to Pounds 2.5bn.
Originally the deal was due to be concluded in the second quarter of next
year. In June, however, the scheme suffered a setback in the High Court
which said that the society's plans for distributing the Pounds 1.8bn among
its members and others was unlawful.
Revised proposals, issued in mid-August, envisaged that completion of the
deal would be delayed by about three months.

FT  05 SEP 94 / The small-screen dinosaurs now everyone's pets: Patrick
Harverson finds potential buyers eyeing once-lumbering US TV networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A few years ago the three national US broadcast television networks
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ABC, CBS and NBC - seemed like lumbering dinosaurs facing a slow decline.
Under pressure from nimbler, more innovative competitors such as cable TV
companies, independent programme-makers and newcomers such as Fox
Television, the networks' share of the national television audience was
falling - from 98 per cent in the 1970s to about 60 per cent by the start of
the 1990s - and their advertising revenues and profits were sliding.
Yet today the dinosaurs have roared back to life and powerful entertainment
companies such as Walt Disney, Turner Broadcasting, Time Warner, Paramount
and Tele-Communications (TCI), the country's largest cable television
operator, now appear eager to own a network. Time Warner and Paramount are
even planning to launch their own networks next year. Time Warner is also
said to have been negotiating to buy NBC from General Electric; Disney is
rumoured to be interested in CBS; while the chairmen of Turner and TCI have
stated they would like to own one of the big three networks. Only ABC,
deemed too large to swallow whole, is immune from bid speculation.
The sudden burst of interest in the networks is driven by several factors.
For a start, the economics of the business are improving. The long decline
in networks' share of national ratings has been halted, advertising sales
are forecast to grow and profits are recovering. There is also a growing
realisation that as the number of available television channels increases,
so does the value of the network.
Mr Scott Siegler, former head of Columbia Pictures Television and an
ex-network executive, says: 'I think that the advertising community has
become aware of the fact that the more fragmented the market becomes, the
more important the big three networks become. They are the only people who,
on any given night, can guarantee you 60 per cent of millions of
households.'
Yet there is another reason why the networks have become attractive to
potential buyers: a changing regulatory environment. Since 1971, financial
interest-syndication regulations, or 'fin-syn', have barred networks from
producing much of their own programming and from participating in the
lucrative syndication business - selling re-runs of shows to local stations.
The fin-syn rules, however, are due to be eliminated in November 1995, after
which networks will be allowed to produce their own shows and reap the
profits of syndication.
'With those restrictions lifted, suddenly a network becomes a far more
profitable business than it was a few years ago,' says Mr Michael Theodore,
media specialist at management consultants Arthur D Little. Programme makers
such as Time Warner and Disney want a network because it would help them
realise profitable synergies not previously allowed under fin-syn and
protect revenues from their existing programming businesses.
If the big programme makers do not move into networks soon, they could find
themselves when fin-syn expires owning a product for which they cannot find
a national outlet.
Programme suppliers could try to build a network from scratch. This is what
Time Warner is attempting, primarily by persuading independent local
television stations to sign up as affiliates for its new WB network, due to
start early next year.
Time Warner's reported interest in NBC may be motivated by the uncertain
future that cable television faces. Earlier this year the government imposed
price controls on cable operators and the industry fears further regulation.
A bid for NBC would be a good defensive move for Time Warner, whose cable
operations include the successful Home Box Office channel.
Mr John Reidy, media analyst with securities house Smith Barney Shearson,
says Time Warner's interest in NBC 'shows you that Time Warner is very
nervous about what's going to happen to its TV production business. It also
raises the question of whether they have some doubts about the rapidity of
the growth of the cable business'.
There are many analysts who doubt whether Time Warner will be able to buy
NBC outright, at least not just yet. Until limits on cross-ownership of
cable and television stations are eased, Time Warner's options are limited.
Mr Richard Grand-Jean, head of the entertainment industry investment banking
boutique Global Film Equity, adds: 'They (Time Warner) already have a ton of
debt. The world is not really ready to see them take on another Dollars 4bn
to Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) of it.' Even Disney may not be in the best
shape to do a deal with CBS after the accidental death in April of its
president, Mr Frank Wells, and the imminent departure of its studio chief,
Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg. Analysts estimate Disney would need to offer at least
Dollars 5bn for CBS.
Ultimately, Wall Street believes that CBS or NBC (and possibly both) will
change hands within the next year, mainly because they have the wrong owners
who, moreover, appear to want to get out of the business.
As Mr Theodore puts it: 'People always felt that GE and NBC was a poor
match.
'As for CBS, Larry Tisch is not a broadcaster, and he does not have much of
an idea about the direction the industry is heading. At this point, I think
he wants to take the money and run.'

FT  05 SEP 94 / Savoy censures director over leak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The controversy over the control of Savoy Group took another twist yesterday
when the luxury hotel company publicly censured one of its directors over a
leak of confidential information.
Savoy was angered by weekend press reports citing a study by Mr Giles
Shepard, its managing director, which had been circulated to certain
directors, restating the company's need to fight off the attentions of
Forte, its rival and largest shareholder, and to remain independent.
A Savoy statement yesterday said: 'The board of the Savoy Group is dismayed
that one non-executive director, for his own reasons, has decided to discuss
confidential papers with the press. This is unsettling for employees and
does nobody any good.' A company source said the story had been leaked by
Sir Michael Richardson, who announced on Friday his plan to retire as
chairman of Smith New Court, the securities house. 'There will be pressure
on him to resign (from Savoy) after this,' said the source.
Sir Michael yesterday admitted the story emerged from his office, but denied
it was a deliberate leak. 'I did not show the report to anyone, it did not
happen like that at all.' He said the report had been spotted on his desk by
a journalist who was interviewing him about his retirement. When questioned,
he had given a brief outline of its contents. 'That is not a leak,' he said.
He described the question of his resignation as 'ridiculous'.
Mr Shepard said yesterday: 'Nothing has been discussed by the other
directors in relation to anyone resigning.'
The policy document at the centre of the row, written by Mr Shepard, was
circulated to Sir Michael and three other non-executive directors. It
outlined Savoy's trading and corporate strategy after the company's interim
results due on September 13. It also restated the company's intention to
remain independent and questioned Forte's performance and strategy.
Sir Michael and Mr Shepard admitted the row reflected tensions on the board
over Savoy's future. Forte, which has fought a 13-year battle for control,
holds 42 per cent of voting shares. It has discussed with other shareholders
the creation of a joint venture which would pool the two groups' luxury
hotels. Savoy also owns Claridge's and the Connaught.
Forte agreed in November 1989 not to increase its stake in Savoy for five
years and to give 12 months' notice if it wanted to do so. The latter
requirement remains even after the five-year standstill ends.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): Soft drink sales set to produce
sweet results - Cadbury Schweppes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cadbury Schweppes is expected to report on Thursday some of the best interim
results among UK food manufacturers with pre-tax profits up by about Pounds
40m to about Pounds 200m. Its soft drinks will show the biggest improvement
at home and abroad while confectionery will be patchier.
The results will also lay to rest any residual fears that J. Sainsbury's
aggressive own-label cola strategy will have hurt Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes
Beverages, Cadbury's 51 per cent owned UK joint venture.
After the supermarket chain launched its Classic Cola line earlier this year
in packaging resembling Coca-Cola's, Coke fought back with heavy promotions.
In Sainsbury stores, Coke is now outselling Classic Cola in cans but not
large bottles. But the cans carry a higher profit margin and Sainsbury
accounts for less than 5 per cent of CCSB's sales. Overall, CCSB's operating
profits should be up by about Pounds 5m to more than Pounds 50m.
Cadbury's beverage profits will also be enhanced by a first-time
contribution from A&amp;W, the US bottler. No news is expected on Cadbury's
attempts to get board representation at Dr Pepper, the US bottler in which
it has a 25 per cent stake. In contrast to growth in the US and UK,
Cadbury's continental European beverage operations remain problematic and
may require further restructuring charges.
The picture is mixed in confectionery. In the UK, chocolate volumes are
virtually static and Cadbury is trying to recoup rising cocoa costs. Sugar
sweets, via the group's Trebor Bassett brand, look more promising in volume
and price terms.
Shareholders can expect a dividend increase of at least 0.3p to 3.9p but the
group may act on a hint at its AGM about weighting the dividend more in line
with sales during the year. This would require a rise to more than 5p.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Bermuda link for new fund at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Indemnity Insurance Services, a London-based insurance broker, is combining
forces with one of Bermuda's largest reinsurance companies in an effort to
form a new Lloyd's investment company. Indemnity wants to raise some Pounds
20m through a stock market flotation of the new vehicle - Euclidean
Investment Company - later this year.
Centre Re, now owned by Switzerland's Zurich Insurance, will underwrite an
innovative long-term reinsurance contract for the company, which should
allow Euclidean to accept up to Pounds 80m in premium income, twice as much
as it would otherwise be able to underwrite, increasing potential
profitability.
Corporate Names can accept annual premiums equal to twice the amount of
their funds held at Lloyd's, according to rules introduced last year by the
market.
Euclidean will spend several million pounds annually on a multi-year
reinsurance policy from Centre Re. The Bermuda company will make available a
letter of credit for some Pounds 28m, which it is thought Lloyd's regulators
will regard as an acceptable asset for solvency purposes.
In this way Euclidean will increase its deposits with Lloyd's to some Pounds
40m. The reinsurance policy will also cushion investors against large
losses.
Indemnity specialises in stop-loss insurance - a kind of personal
reinsurance for Lloyd's Names, the individuals whose assets have
traditionally backed the market. This activity has allowed it to obtain
unusually comprehensive information about the market. By backing no more
than 86 of the most profitable syndicates and by closely monitoring future
activity it hopes to be able to obtain above-average underwriting results.
Mr James Stuart, Indemnity's joint managing director, says he expects the
increased gearing will allow Euclidean to make a return on capital of some
25 per cent. Net dividends are to be limited to 20 per cent of capital.
Lloyd's raised some Pounds 800m in corporate capital last year and expects
to raise between Pounds 125m and Pounds 250m in extra funds for 1995. Most
is expected to come from private sources. Venton, another Lloyd's agency,
has linked up with Butterfield Securities of Bermuda to raise money for a
corporate capital vehicle.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): Investors worry over high price of
issue - Japan Telecom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's third largest telecommunications operator will be listed tomorrow on
the second sections of the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges.
The issue's high public offering price of Y4.7m (Pounds 30,616) per share is
causing some anxiety among investors. Along with the other telecom
operators, the company's earnings have been squeezed by rising price
competition.
Aggressive price-cutting in long distance rates has hurt JT's earnings as
well as its competitors, DDI, listed last year, and Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, the former monopoly.
Although sales were up last business year, pre-tax profits fell 18 per cent
from a year earlier to Y16.2bn. Earnings before taxes for the current year
are projected at Y16bn.
DDI's listing last September attracted a large number of investors, boosting
the stock price, but some analysts fear that may not be the case for JT.
Unlike DDI, the company lacks money-making subsidiaries, and Tokyo Digital
Phone, its affiliated cellular phone company, only began its operations
earlier this year.
The troubled Swiss telecoms equipment maker Ascom appears to be making a
rapid recovery towards profitability after two years of hefty losses. A new
management team will set out the group's prospects on Thursday.

FT  05 SEP 94 / EU delegates battle to head off abortion row: Dispute looms
at Cairo population conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union delegates launched a late effort yesterday to prevent bitter
differences about abortion overshadowing the International Conference on
Population and Development, which opens today in Cairo.
The EU wants to soften the language on abortion used in the draft statement
which has become the focus of angry opposition from religious conservatives.
The dispute over abortion has threatened to open up a new divide in
international politics, with Roman Catholic and Islamic states joining
forces to oppose more liberal proposals primarily from the US and some north
European states.
The talks to avert an open dispute came as more than 15,000 national
delegates, representatives of hundreds of non-governmental organisations and
about 2,000 journalists arrived in Cairo amid unprecedented security for the
week-long gathering.
The European initiative follows an EU agreement yesterday to a compromise on
abortion that could form the basis for a consensus among the 170 countries
at the conference.
The EU agreement bridged the conservative stance on abortion taken by
Ireland with more liberal proposals favoured by Denmark and the Netherlands.
Amendments to the draft document were being circulated in the corridors of
the conference last night by EU delegates. The central proposal was to state
in the document that 'in no case should abortion be promoted as a method of
family planning'.
However, the concerns of the more liberal western states are addressed by
the proposal to urge in the document that governments 'deal with abortion as
a major health concern'. The UN population fund estimates that 50m-60m
abortions are performed worldwide each year and that as many as 250,000
women die each year from poorly performed operations.
The compromise appeared to have won the backing of the powerful US
delegation, which has been the primary focus of criticism from the Vatican
and Islamic conservatives, who have accused Washington of endorsing
abortion.
Mr Timothy Wirth, US under-secretary for global affairs, said: 'The European
Union has come up with a draft language which we think is very promising as
a compromise.' He emphasised that the participants in the conference had
reached agreement on '92 per cent' of the proposed text during three years
of preparatory discussion.
Formal talks open in closed session tomorrow.

FT  05 SEP 94 / BAe cries foul over refinancing package for Fokker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace is challenging a Fl 1bn (Pounds 367m) refinancing for
Fokker, the loss-making Dutch regional aircraft manufacturer controlled by
Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa).
The UK company, which like Fokker is a leading manufacturer of regional
turboprop and jet aircraft, is expected to ask the European Commission to
block the refinancing on the ground that it constitutes an unfair subsidy.
The move is likely to complicate the long drawn-out efforts of BAe and Dasa
to merge their respective regional aircraft operations as part of a broad
restructuring of the European sector.
Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, said on Friday ahead of this week's
Farnborough Air Show that the European regional aircraft industry needed to
be consolidated around one group of manufacturers similar to the successful
European Airbus consortium in the large airliner market. To that end, BAe
has held extensive talks with Dasa and Aerospatiale of France.
Although BAe remains in contact with Taiwan Aerospace, with which it failed
last year to forge a joint venture, the UK company has made clear that it
now favours a European solution to its regional aircraft problems.
Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz, which owns Dasa, also said last
week that he hoped to reach an agreement with BAe on combining the two
companies' regional jet activities.
But the Fl 1bn refinancing package for Fokker, announced in July, is now
seen as a significant obstacle to progress towards an eventual merger of
BAe's and Fokker's regional jet activities.
BAe argues that the refinancing constitutes an unfair subsidy that shores up
Fokker's position in any eventual merger negotiation and further distorts
competition in a market already plagued by manufacturing overcapacity and
too many competing products.
The refinancing of Fokker includes a Fl 600m capital injection from Dasa,
which bought a 51 per cent stake in the Dutch company last year, and an
additional Fl 400m of indirect support from the Dutch government, a minority
shareholder.
Under the package, the Dutch government has approved a sale-and-leaseback
arrangement involving the sale of Fokker's aircraft building technology to
Rabobank, the big Dutch co-operative bank.
The deal required government approval because the purchase and subsequent
leaseback of the Fokker technology patents by Rabobank is designed to reduce
the bank's tax bill, depriving the government of around Fl 400m in revenues.

After a summer lull, base metals prices have continued their upward path.
Aluminium has already broken through its early summer peak to reach its
highest level for three years. Copper is not far behind, which is good news
for RTZ ahead of its interim results on Thursday. Summer weakness in base
metals is usual, since the holiday season takes the edge off industrial
demand. The rally may simply reflect the end of the doldrums.
If it is to develop into another leg of the base metals bull market, though,
the overhang of stocks will have to be reduced. While aluminium stocks have
fallen modestly during the summer - thanks to production cuts agreed in
January - copper stocks have risen over the past few weeks. The question is
whether the seasonal increase in industrial demand during the autumn is
enough to make inroads into stocks. Prices will fall back if there is no
appreciable reduction in the overhang.
Doubts about metal prices may explain the relatively poor performance of
mining shares during the first half of the year. RTZ has outperformed a
falling equity market by 13 per cent this year, for example, while the
copper price has risen by a third. Since the average copper price in the
first half of this year was not much different from last, the company's
interim figures will not show much benefit. But if falling copper stocks
underpin another rise in the metals price this autumn, the shares will have
room to rise.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After all the hype, the August car sales figures have been disappointing,
and puzzling. Thanks to massaging by the trade the full month's numbers due
out tomorrow may well be better than the flat out-turn earlier figures
suggested. Even so, underlying sales appear to have gone off the boil. They
could hardly have continued for ever at the pace set in the first half. But
given the encouraging signs elsewhere in the economy, including a pick-up in
new house sales in August, a sharp slowdown is hard to explain.
One possibility is that the problem lies not with demand but supply.
Anecdotal evidence suggests supply shortages of certain models, in some
cases caused by a lack of key components. There are long waiting lists for
some German cars due to the unexpectedly strong recovery in the domestic
market earlier in the year.
But supply shortages do not explain why dealers are complaining about the
disappearance of the private buyer. This is especially odd since private new
car buyers tend to sell-on after five years and 1989 was the peak of the
last cycle. Perhaps car buyers are showing the same bargain-hunting
mentality evident in other consumer markets and holding out for better deals
at the end of the month. Or maybe they have finally tired of the August
registration scramble. Whatever the explanation, the odds must favour poor
August figures being a temporary blip rather than a change in the trend, in
which case the sharp fall in car dealer share prices over the last few weeks
could soon be reversed.

FT  05 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sceptics must be disappointed by the recent performance of emerging equity
markets. After a strong rally in July and August, the IFC emerging markets
index now stands 7 per cent above the level at the start of the year. As the
chart shows, emerging markets have again been outpacing their counterparts
in the developed world. For true believers this will not come as a surprise.
The sharp correction of the first quarter was caused by the withdrawal of
footloose international funds rather than setbacks in the emerging economies
themselves. The attractive combination of high growth rates and economic
liberalisation remains.
Besides, falling share prices and rapidly rising earnings quickly
transformed the valuation of many markets. The Asian markets which suffered
most during the correction - Thailand and Malaysia fell by 25 per cent in
the first three months of the year - have started to attract investors in
search of value. But there are signs that the rally of the last two months
has been more discriminating than the liquidity-fuelled bull run of 1993.
While last year it was unusual for neighbouring emerging markets to move in
opposite directions, this year performance has been wider spread. For
example, Brazil has gained more than 70 per cent this year on hopes that the
latest attempt to curb inflation will prove successful. Yet Argentina is
still lower than at the start of the year. If long-term investors rather
than high-rollers are now driving emerging markets, so much the better.

FT  05 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: The Giordano dividend
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Giordano may not be popular with Sid if, as feared, he freezes or
even cuts British Gas's dividend this week. But shareholders should take
comfort from the fact that their new chairman is engineering a change in
strategy which should, in time, more than compensate for any disappointment
on dividends.
The biggest change is that Mr Giordano is determined to embrace competition
and make it work to Gas's advantage rather than fight it at every turn.
Gas's previous tactic was to run scare stories about how millions of
consumers would see their gas bills double if competition was introduced for
domestic customers. That won it few friends.
Mr Giordano appreciates that competition can be used to change the group's
bureaucratic culture. The company has also come to the view that the real
added value in its UK business is transporting gas, which will remain a
monopoly, not trading it. Since its trading monopoly carries a host of
social obligations, Gas believes it may be in its interest to demerge the
business completely. It remains to be seen whether Gas can persuade the
government to move ahead with its planned legislation. Gas's earlier scare
tactics have given ministers cold feet about dismantling the monopoly. But
Gas's more constructive approach is certainly in shareholders' interests.
Mr Giordano is also refocusing Gas's overseas strategy. In the past, Gas
spent hundreds of millions of pounds on foreign acquisitions without a clear
idea of where it could add value. Again, the new strategy has yet to be
fully articulated, let alone produce tangible benefits. But the shares,
which have underperformed the market by 15 per cent this year, look due for
a turn.

Busy chap Andrew Neil. As if the ex-editor of the Sunday Times did not have
enough to do launching his new US current affairs show, he is about to start
writing the memoirs of his ten action-packed years at the Sunday Times.
Contrary to rumours, Neil says he has had no difficulty finding a publisher.
Harper Collins was ruled out because it is owned by Rupert Murdoch, but four
others put in bids and MacMillan won with a hefty advance.
Neil has even thought up a title - 'Making Waves' - which refers to an
unfavourable article by Hugo Young, a former political editor of the Sunday
Times, who said that under Neil the paper would 'make money but not waves'.
Neil intends to set the record straight.
But why the hurry? Could it be a precautionary move in case his US TV show
flops and he is not invited back to edit the ST?

If the Preston-to-Blackpool branch line is shut it should boost attendance

The only worry is the possible strain on union finances if delegates insist

Ben Cohen, 43, co-founder of the Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream chain, is getting a
reputation for quitting.
First, he announces that he wants to step down as chief executive of his
socially responsible US business, which gives free back massages to its
employees and 7.5 per cent of its profits to charity, now he has resigned
from the advisory board of Business Ethics, the US magazine just because it
has been criticising Anita Roddick's Body Shop.
Although Ben &amp; Jerry's environmental credentials have not come in for the
same sort of flak as Body Shop's, Cohen's wacky image is starting to look a
bit suspect. Since the firm launched its 'Yo] I'm your CEO' essay contest to
find Cohen's successor it has been flooded with applicants explaining in 100
words or less why they wanted to head the firm.
Over 200 animals - including monkeys, horses, dogs and cats - sent in an
application as well as hundreds of children, the youngest just 11 weeks'
old. Most applicants said their first decision would be to give everyone a
pay rise.
No wonder the firm has quietly hired Russell Reynolds, one of the world's
biggest head-hunters, to find the right person.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Observer: Passing the OECD parcel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Still no word on the top job at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development. Jean-Claude Paye, the current incumbent, has to step down
at the end of the month and the 25 rich countries who own the Paris-based
economic think tank are still no nearer finding a successor.
The delay is starting to be embarrassing. It is normal for a new OECD
secretary-general to be chosen several months before the handover and with
the annual IMF meeting little more than a month away it is far from clear
who will be holding the OECD torch.
Don Johnstone, former head of Canada's liberal party, is still the
frontrunner and the fact that last week Canada finally appointed a new High
Commissioner in London ends speculation that the job was being held open for
him in case he didn't get the OECD job.
However, an informal poll of OECD ambassadors suggests that Johnstone's lead
is narrowing despite being supported by the US. Paye is running a close
second with the UK's Lord Lawson and Germany's Lorenz Schomerus trailing a
long way behind.
Paye, like his predecessor Emile Van Lennep, could stay on for another term
because OECD members cannot agree on a successor. But if this was going to
happen Paye should have had the nod long before now.
One intriguing rumour is that if the Americans drop their support for
Johnstone, the French would back the US choice for the Nato
secretary-general's job.
Indeed, Douglas Hurd's name is even being mentioned although it is hard to
believe that John Major could afford to lose his foreign secretary at the
moment.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Eurofighter hits bad weather: Bernard Gray examines the
conflicts surrounding Europe's biggest industrial project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Farnborough air show opens today with all the glitz that an
international aerospace bazaar can muster. Centrepiece of the show will be
the four-nation, Pounds 32bn Eurofighter 2000, with a stand which includes a
simulator demonstrating the thrills combat pilots can expect. Unfortunately
for the assembled buyers, sellers, observers and enthusiasts, the real
Eurofighter will not fly. Preparing an aircraft to perform at Farnborough
would take too much time out of a development schedule already two years
adrift.
Another of the problems which have dogged the project will surface tomorrow
when Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, gives evidence to a
parliamentary defence committee in Bonn. Up for discussion is a report from
the German national audit office which heavily criticises the cost of
Eurofighter, and suggests buying Russian Mig-29 fighters instead.
These are just two examples of the turbulent ride the Eurofighter is likely
to get in the next few months as several of the conflicts surrounding
Europe's largest industrial project reignite. Those taking part are the UK
(primarily British Aerospace and GEC), Germany (DASA), Italy (Alenia) and
Spain (Casa).
The German report on Eurofighter's costs, widely dismissed as inaccurate, is
bound to produce rhetoric from the project's opponents who object that the
Eurofighter is over-engineered and over-priced. While a change of government
in Germany is not expected, the run-up to next month's federal elections has
created some uncertainty and could conceivably produce a new administration
which is not as committed to the project as Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democrats.
The opposition Social Democrats are opposed in principle, though the party
is split with one faction supporting the project because it will secure a
large number of engineering jobs. An alliance government of the Greens and
the SPD, while unlikely, might pull Germany out of the production phase of
the aircraft.
Then there is the thorny issue of how many aircraft each country is going to
buy. That number, to be decided next year, determines the amount of work
each country gets in the Eurofighter manufacturing run. Germany has
suggested that it may reduce its order from 250 to 140. Britain, meanwhile,
is thinking of increasing its order from 250 to more than 300 Eurofighters
in order to replace some of its Tornado strike aircraft. With disparity
arising between the British and German orders, arguments are likely to
become more intense over which work should go where.
Assuming, as most observers do, that Germany remains with the Eurofighter,
strong political and industrial turf wars will be fought over the Pounds
20bn of production work. Resentment of what some German opponents call 'the
English aeroplane' is likely to be exacerbated if the change in size of both
countries' orders mean that Britain's manufacturers take work from Germany.
Of the problems, the cost over-runs discussed in the German auditors' report
have attracted the most publicity. One UK expert estimates Britain's share
of development costs has now overshot by Pounds 1bn since 1988. The total
development bill is likely to be around Pounds 10bn, up from the Pounds
6.5bn estimate when the project first started.
In part, that reflects the uncertainty inherent in such leading-edge
technology. Many of the elements needed for Eurofighter had to be developed
from scratch and their cost could only be guesstimated. But as one insider
said: 'These open-ended remits have also meant cosy risk-free development
deals to fund them. With regular cheques arriving every month, companies
have had little incentive to keep costs down.'
Nevertheless, the main reason for collaboration is to spread the one-off
development costs among several partners. But as the programme is analysed
it is becoming increasingly clear that much of the potential gains have been
lost because of duplicated overheads and poor co-ordination. Officials will
not say how much of the Pounds 10bn development cost has been frittered
away, but one expert says 'estimates are very difficult, but I would think
between 30 and 50 per cent of the money has been wasted'.
That money has probably gone for good, but some of the errors are steadily
being corrected. More of the development risks will be carried by the
manufacturers rather than defence ministries, and work is being put on to a
fixed-price footing. Confused management structures are being rationalised.
The cost arguments, however embarrassing, are unlikely to kill the project
unless another serious hiccup occurs, and that is getting less likely as the
project becomes better defined. Nor would a German exit from the programme
ground the Eurofighter. Indeed, in some ways a German exit would suit the
other partners, since Germany may, in any case, be obliged to pay its share
of development costs, and the other countries would then be able to put the
aircraft into production themselves.
With much of the development money spent, and strong British backing for the
Eurofighter, outright cancellation of the project is hard to envisage.
Besides, the military case for replacing European fighter fleets remains
strong. The last generation of aircraft developed in Europe, the Tornado,
was manufactured during the 1980s. It is essentially a bomber and
air-to-ground strike aircraft, not a fighter. In the Gulf war, Britain's
Tornados often had to be escorted by US aircraft because the UK had no
fighters equal to the task. There is little desire in the Royal Air Force to
repeat the humiliating experience.
Even the sceptical Germans recognise the need for new aircraft, and the view
that Germany only needs a light fighter to defend its own airspace may lose
ground following Germany's decision to lift its ban on military deployment
outside the Nato area.
While they are primarily interested in the high-technology skills and jobs
which will flow from Eurofighter, Italy and Spain will also need new
fighters in the next decade, and are not overly concerned with the exact
specification of the project, provided costs are contained.
The need for new fighters could be easily met by buying off-the-shelf US
F/A-18s of F-15s, but these would not guarantee air superiority into the
next century. In more advanced designs the alternatives to Eurofighter are
thin on the ground. Russian Mig-29 or SU-27 planes are theoretically a cheap
possibility. However, becoming dependent on Russia for spares would raise
eyebrows in west European defence ministries.
Since the ructions look unlikely to kill Eurofighter, and other alternatives
are unattractive, the challenge now is for companies and governments to
organise the production phase of the Eurofighter to keep costs at a bare
minimum.
If the workshare arguments produce a shake-up of what manufacturing goes
where, production may be put on a more rational basis. Though Spain and
Italy will want to keep their full quota of work, there is no economic need
for the two countries to have final assembly lines, as currently planned.
Completing the last stages of the aircraft's construction at the two
established lines at Warton in Lancashire and Manching in Bavaria would cut
costs. Greater specialisation would also help. Currently one wing is being
made in Italy, with the other split between the UK and Spain.
'The companies probably now have a firm enough grip on the project that
provided they tender sensible prices the Eurofighter's future is secure,'
said one aerospace expert, 'and those governments moaning about prices could
do a lot to help cut costs themselves if they weren't so nationalistic about
workshares.'

FT  05 SEP 94 / Mutual destruction: Alison Smith on institutions that have
outgrown their ownership structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems cruel to propose that the principle of 'mutual ownership', where
ordinary customers can own the organisation, should go. The term suggests a
degree of cosiness in an otherwise cut-throat world where individuals have
to deal with large, faceless financial institutions.
Take building societies, the mutual organisations which dominate the UK
mortgage market. My savings help to fund your mortgage. My mortgage is
funded by other people's savings. By becoming borrowers - or opening
investment accounts - we become part-owners of the organisation and, so, are
entitled to good treatment. Or take mutual life insurance companies, which
account for a significant share of the sector. As policyholders and
part-owners, we do not have to hand out a separate portion of profits to
shareholders.
The reality, however, is somewhat different. If customers are treated well
by a society or life company it is generally because of fierce competition
in retail financial services for new customers, not because they have a
one-in-a-million say in the organisation's strategy.
Mutual organisations have come a long way - and diversified substantially -
since their origins in the 18th century. Many are now financial
conglomerates controlling billions of pounds in assets and funds. Control of
these organisations by those who own them is so fragmented that it scarcely
exists. In short, most of them have outgrown their ownership structure.
Mutuals counter that their system of one-member-one-vote is fairer than
companies where the size of a shareholder's vote is decided by the size of
the shareholding. But their argument is weak: the scattered nature of mutual
ownership means that no one has enough of a stake to challenge how the board
behaves.
Except in extreme circumstances, most members do not bother to play an
active part in overseeing the management of a mutual organisation.
Meanwhile, the increasing complexity of financial services, and the obscure
accounting practices of life companies, discourage members from questioning
board decisions, even if they do vote.
For example, the Halifax, the UK's largest building society, has 5.5m
members. But fewer than 150,000 took part, either in person or by proxy, in
decisions at this year's annual general meeting. Similarly, at Standard
Life, the UK's largest mutual life insurer with more than 2.2m policyholders
who are members, only 53 attended its annual general meeting in April.
In response to this, the mutuals would argue that their managers' strategies
are held to account in other ways: they must attract new customers and
satisfy credit ratings agencies. Even the media are not afraid to criticise.
Their argument, however, misses two points. First, none of these checks
necessarily replicates the interests of those who own the business. Second,
public limited companies are subject to similar disciplines - and attract
more attention and provide more information because their share prices are
quoted on the stock exchange.
The mutuals' argument falls apart completely, however, when they try to
defend the protection they have against hostile takeovers. Under UK
legislation, neither building society nor mutual life company boards are
obliged to consult their members about takeover offers they oppose.
While the position of shareholders in PLCs is not a financial equivalent of
the golden age of Athenian democracy, the model does offer features lacking
in mutuals. First, the concentration of votes held by powerful shareholders
increases pressure on the board to take account of the interests of the
owners, particularly in areas such as efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
Second, PLC status frees individuals to decide whether to retain or sell
their stake in the organisation. Those who disagree with a PLC's strategy
can simply sell and cease to be owners. They do not have to change their
life insurance or mortgage in order to do so.
Later this month, the government is due to publish a consultation paper on
the future of building societies, which will include suggestions on how to
make them more accountable to members.
Generally, members are not seeking greater accountability - most would be
happy if their savings or mortgage organisation were answerable to experts
at big institutions. Their primary relationship is as customers, not owners.
The Treasury should widen discussion by proposing the conversion of mutual
financial organisations to PLCs, except, perhaps, for the smallest. Making
members of mutuals effective owners is a lost cause.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Outsiders in Whitehall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government is rightly proud of its record in bringing business
executives and other outsiders into top jobs in Whitehall. The newcomers
have brought fresh insights to the business of government and helped shake
up civil service management. They have also contributed to improvements in
the efficiency and effectiveness of public services. But the debate over the
wisdom of bringing outsiders into top Whitehall jobs has been rekindled by
events at two high-profile agencies.
On Friday, Ms Ros Hepplewhite resigned as chief executive of the Child
Support Agency amid continuing criticism of the agency's role in pursuing
absent fathers to pay maintenance for their children. Ms Hepplewhite was
previously director of Mind, the mental health charity, and had spent most
of her working life as a health service manager. During its first year of
operation, the agency failed to hit almost all its performance targets - in
some cases by a wide margin. Ms Hepplewhite also seemed to lack the
political skills needed to deal with critics, particularly on appearances
before parliamentary select committees. She has been replaced by a career
civil servant who is regarded as a safe pair of hands.
Fears stirred
Mr Derek Lewis, chief executive of the Prison Service agency, also found
himself in the news last week, over the transfer of four convicted
terrorists from Britain to prisons in Northern Ireland. Mr Lewis, former
chief executive of Granada, the leisure group, was accused of insensitivity
and incompetence in going ahead with the moves within days of the IRA
ceasefire. The transfers stirred fears among unionists of secret concessions
to the IRA in return for the ceasefire. The prime minister was said to be
'livid', and demanded a speedy inquiry.
Mr Lewis apologised, and seems likely to remain in post. He weathered
previous storms such as the loss of seven prisoners by Group 4, the private
security group, during the first two weeks of operating a privatised prison
escort service. And he has successfully implemented the government's
controversial prison privatisation programme, despite criticism of
conditions at the first privatised prison. But last week's furore over the
transfer of prisoners is the sort of political problem that a career civil
servant would have spotted instantly. It demonstrates the need to ensure
that those coming from outside the civil service get the advice they need
for working in what Mr Lewis has himself described as 'a goldfish bowl'.
More accountable
However, these events clearly demonstrate one strength of the government's
civil service reforms. The creation of agencies headed by a
publicly-identifiable chief executive was intended to make public services
more accountable. Ms Hepplewhite and Mr Lewis have both experienced the
consequences of that accountability in their separate ways.
Indeed, it can be argued that Ms Hepplewhite has taken the rap for others
who should share responsibility for the problems of the Child Support
Agency. These include the Treasury officials who imposed unrealistically
high targets for savings that forced the agency to pursue fathers already
paying some maintenance. The policymakers who ignored advice that would have
made the maintenance formula more acceptable also have a case to answer.
Anonymous civil servants inside Whitehall departments are much less
accountable than agency chief executives, as the events surrounding the arms
to Iraq scandal and the debacle over the pit closures illustrated.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Leading Article: The chance for a Euro-debate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's proposals from France and Germany for building a 'hard core' of
states at the centre of Europe launch an essential debate on the future of
the European Union. They mark an end to the uneasy truce over the pace and
scope of integration that had prevailed since ratification of the Maastricht
treaty.
The suggestions from Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, and
Germany's governing Christian Democrats address the question at the heart of
the EU's intergovernmental conference in 1996: how can the Union remain an
integrated structure while embracing an ever-increasing number of member
states?
The challenge is to build a Union that will be more numerous in its
membership, more effective in its decision-making, more open in its
relations with the rest of the world, more competitive in its economic
structures, and more capable of winning loyalty from its citizens.
These are goals to which not just France and Germany but Britain too must
pledge support. Since an expanded Europe will be more diverse, it will have
to be flexible enough to embrace varying patterns of integration.
Unpalatable though it may be for some countries, Europe must accept the
inevitability of a multi-speed future - without in the process allowing its
decision-making machinery to become hopelessly cumbersome.
The desire to open the EU to the east is a top priority for several member
states including Germany and Britain, and rightly so. Reinforcing
parliamentary democracy and market capitalism in central and eastern Europe
is vital to the entire continent's stability. But unless EU governments find
the right formula for enlargement, the process could well aggravate the
existing strains in the Union. Widening and deepening - enlargement and
integration - will not prove easily compatible.
Huge strains
For a start, enlargement will impose huge strains on the EU budget, both in
agriculture and in relation to the structural funds. The German document
says a fresh round of reforms in the Common Agricultural Policy will be
needed to enable the central and eastern European states to join the Union
around the year 2000. This is a welcome shift in thinking since, up to now,
Bonn has shrunk from publicly accepting the need for such painful
adjustments. The message needs to be brought home with brutal clarity, not
only in France but also in the Mediterranean states that remain major net
beneficiaries from agricultural and structural funds.
Still more potential for discord lies in the German admission that Italy,
Britain and Spain are unlikely to be in the group that first accomplishes
economic and monetary union. This assertion, although controversial, is
little more than a statement of the obvious. In monetary affairs, as well as
in immigration and justice matters and foreign and defence policy, different
EU groupings are already co-operating with varying degrees of intensity, as
Mr John Major pointed out three months ago in espousing a 'multi-speed,
multi-track Europe'.
Hard core
However, the existence of a 'hard core' for the third stage of Emu does not
inevitably mean the same group constituting the core for all other forms of
co-operation. And it does not mean that countries outside Emu should not
play a leading part in other fields. Italy, Spain and indeed Britain are
strongly committed to development of a common foreign and security policy.
Other constellations would be keener, say, on a joint immigration policy.
The key to making such 'variable geometry' work is twofold. First,
co-operation between groups of states should be inclusive and open to
extension, rather than exclusive. Second, to avoid undermining the existing
level of integration, it is important that members and future members of the
EU agree on certain minimum essential requirements.
Above all, economic liberalisation, through the single market, must remain
the central component of efforts to improve the Union's productive capacity
and its citizens' prosperity. Enforcement of the rules of the single market,
and its extension to areas like energy and telecommunications, are essential
goals from which there can be no opt-outs.
By launching debate on these issues now, the French and German leaderships
have taken a calculated risk. Their prescriptions will certainly offend
public opinion - not only in existing 'peripheral' member states but also
quite possibly in the Nordic countries which face more or less
finely-balanced referendums on membership in the autumn.
But the truth is that all member states, present and future, have some
extremely difficult questions to answer if they are to make the expanding
Union work. It is vital that these issues are aired thoroughly and publicly
over the next two years. Only then can the Union's tasks of widening and
deepening be successfully reconciled.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mitigating cost of contract
termination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN WINTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Those concerned about large payments to directors on termination
('Insurers join outcry against large pay-offs', August 20) of contract
should always refer company boards to the Companies Act 1985, sections 312
and 316(3). Any payment will require shareholder approval unless it is a
bona fide payment by way of damages for breach of contract or pension for
past service.
English contract law requires that any party suing for breach of contract
must mitigate his loss. To the extent loss is mitigated the damages claim is
reduced. The claim will similarly be reduced if the party could, but failed,
to mitigate his loss.
If the terminated director is able to obtain another job at the same salary
on the day after leaving (and he is obliged to make efforts to find fresh
employment as soon as possible) his entitlement to damages will be
extinguished. While there will always be a judgment on the extent to which
mitigation is possible, it may be a relatively rare case where none is
possible over, say, an unexpired three-year period of a contract - it
requires the judgment that the person concerned will not work at all during
that period. If the view can so readily be taken that the services of the
terminated director are so little in demand, perhaps shareholders are
entitled to wonder whether the executive should have been taken on in the
first place.
While welcoming the focus on length of existing service agreements,
shareholders may rightly want to assure themselves that mitigation
principles are properly applied on any termination. After all, any payment
made by boards without appropriate consideration of what mitigation is
possible, without proper reference to shareholders, will, in the words of
section 312, 'be unlawful . . .'
Perhaps a board might even consider continuing to pay the director concerned
over the unexpired period of his contract or until he finds a new job -
whichever is the sooner. This threat can inject realism into negotiations
with a departing executive.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Aim at the climate, not the weather
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A book which made a lasting impression on me in my last year at high school
was Peter Drucker's The End of Economic Man, published in 1939. Although the
author had already long been resident in the US, it was in the best
tradition of central European speculative thought. His thesis (speaking from
memory) was that Nazism was neither a form of capitalism nor of socialism,
but a revolt against the whole utilitarian, nicely calculated 'lore of less
or more', in favour of more primitive collective urges.
In subsequent years Drucker has become best known as an American management
guru; and, as someone who would not be allowed to manage the proverbial
whelk-stall, I lost track of him. But I could not believe that he had lost
his wider interests; and sure enough, his list of public works shows that he
has continued to reflect on society, ideas and politics. His latest venture,
published last year when he was 84, is a kind of summa.
Although entitled Post-Capitalist Society (published by
Butterworth-Heinemann), it is free both of Spenglerian gloom and of the
posturings of futurologists. Instead, he focuses on trends already visible.
He is now sure that market values are here to stay and regards longing for
an imaginary medieval past as mainly a reflection of ignorance of what the
Middle Ages were really like.
The emerging society is post-capitalist in the sense that the Marxist vision
of a few private owners versus an army of propertyless workers is dead.
Indeed, workers own the enterprises through their pension funds. Moreover,
physical capital is no longer dominant and is now subordinate to what
mainstream economists call human capital and Drucker prefers to call
'knowledge'. Mainstream economists may say that he is unduly preoccupied
with Marxism and the reaction to it, and they no longer think of variables
such as Land, Labour and Capital in upper-case letters, but of innumerable
products and factors of production designated by algebraic letter. For this
very reason, much of their work is cold and uninformative.
As it is based on current realities, Drucker's vision of the knowledge
society cannot be entirely surprising. But the all-important details are
more perceptively highlighted than elsewhere. For instance, the emerging
society is individualistic - it is full of specialists who cannot be bossed
about by their superiors who lack the knowledge to do so - but it is still
highly dependent on organisations.
Drucker has spotted that 'contracting out' is the Big Idea common to
advanced corporate practice, privatisation schemes and voucher proposals for
schools and universities. The key is that people should concentrate on what
they are trained to do and do best. When cleaning is done by
directly-employed Mrs Mops, it will usually be a low-grade activity hardly
worth the attention of the deputy chief executive. Contracted out to a
specialist company, it becomes a principal activity in which employees can
take a pride - as I have seen when staying late at the office.
On the larger question of the nation state, Drucker points out that it has
lost its dominance, but it is still the only fully developed political
institution. Indeed, the effect of money and information becoming
transnational is that states can be of almost any size. When his native
Austria was forcibly separated from the Hapsburg empire after the first
world war, it was universally condemned (even by its own inhabitants) as too
small to survive. Yet it has recently prospered, along with even smaller
states like Slovenia.
One of Drucker's most eloquent asides is on the futility of military aid to
friendly regimes. 'To the threat: if you do not give us these arms we'll get
them elsewhere, the proper answer is: go ahead.' In no instance has such aid
stabilised a region; too often the recipients became 'international
terrorists who use the military aid they receive to turn their country into
a land-based pirate ship to terrorise the international community', as
Saddam Hussein did.
Drucker is also always interesting on Japan, which he treats as a
traditional nation-state. Like many European countries before the first
world war, Japanese governments have been certainly prepared to give their
local industries a helping hand, but stayed clear of social engineering or
massive expenditure programmes.
In the end, the reason why I decided to write about Post-Capitalist Society
is that, in a couple of paragraphs, he makes more sense of macro-economic
policy than most lifetime specialists. 'Every government promises to cure
recessions. But this is pure quackery. No government has been able to
deliver.' Political leaders, he argues, should instead try to regain the
ability to avert major depressions.
This means balancing budgets, not only in normal times but even in modest
recessions, so that governments can afford to borrow to invest in the
infrastructure, which is always in bad repair, when a real slump threatens.
How to do so without encouraging the mega-state on which Drucker is as
scathing as anyone is, of course, a problem. But he has a good point when he
argues that recent Japanese attempts to encourage consumption instead
sparked off a property boom from whose residue the country is still
recovering.
Drucker's central economic point, however, is that governments should
concentrate on influencing the climate instead of on futile attempts to
change the weather - a fruitful analogy, which it is astonishing has not
been used more often.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Legislation has clearly proved to be
solution to cutting credit periods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BO GORANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You contend that countries with extensive legislation on late payment
typically have longer credit periods than in the UK ('Venturing capital',
August 25). You are right in one case - France has credit periods averaging
around 56 days compared with 31 in the UK. However, France has only recently
introduced statutory interest and other measures and long credit times are
more a factor of French culture than anything else. In all other cases, you
are wrong. Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and Finland, all of
which have had extensive legislation against late payment for some years,
have shorter credit periods than in the UK, with the lowest being 20 days in
Germany. This has been confirmed by research from the Commission itself and
many other organisations, including Intrum Justitia.
You say payment periods in these countries have lengthened recently. True,
they lengthened by a few days due to the European recession, but in several
countries they are now improving again. Also, these few days one way or
another do not change the fact that all these countries have much lower late
payment periods than in UK, in some cases one third the length - payments in
Sweden are on average seven days late compared with 23 days late in UK.
Voluntary measures encouraging companies to pay on time are what you suggest
to deal with the serious problem of late payment. You neglect to mention,
however, that such voluntary measures have been tried in several different
forms by the Confederation of British Industry and the government for the
last seven or eight years with absolutely zero effect.
It appears very clear to me and obviously the European Commission, along
with almost every other western European government, that legislation is the
only solution. All the facts prove that where legislation has been
implemented it has improved the situation over the medium to long term. It
is therefore beyond me and many others why the British government should
insist on continuing with purely voluntary schemes. It seems strange that
the Financial Times should take the same view.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Truly, deeply and profitably: Oil companies are successfully
tapping previously inaccessible reservoirs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For much of this year US-registered exploration rigs have been flocking to
the Gulf of Mexico to take part in what promises to be one of the most
remarkable changes in the fortunes of an oil-producing area.
After nearly 45 years of production, one of the world's most extensively
drilled pieces of oil and gas-bearing seabed is attracting renewed interest
from oil companies - in spite of relatively low world oil prices.
The reason is that new technology has given oil companies the ability to
explore large, geologically-complex areas, which were previously not thought
to contain oil, or which defied conventional exploration methods. Industry
observers say the new reserves in the Gulf of Mexico that can now be tapped
could be large enough to slow the steady decline in overall US domestic
production.
The new techniques could also extend the productive life of other mature
areas, including the UK and Norway's reserves in the North Sea.
The resurgence of interest in the Gulf of Mexico results from two
innovations. One is the growing technical ability to operate oil production
platforms in deep water. The other is the extensive use of a new seismic
technique which, combined with advances in computing power, is pinpointing
oil and gas reserves where previously they could not be seen.
The first of these innovations is the most visually dramatic. Until
recently, most of the world's offshore oil platforms sat above a lattice
work of steel, firmly fixed to the ocean floor. But the volume of steel
needed to fix a deep-water platform to the seabed would make them
uneconomic.
To overcome this problem, oil companies working in the Gulf of Mexico are
using the first of a new generation of floating structures known as 'tension
leg platforms'. These are held in place by 12 steel pipes, each more than
half a mile long, that run from the floating hull to the ocean floor. The
design eliminates most unwanted vertical movement while allowing the
structures to move with the waves.
The first of these new structures came into operation in April when
production commenced at Shell Oil's Auger platform in the Gulf of Mexico. It
lies in 2,860 feet of water, a US record and one of the deepest oil
platforms in the world. A new US depth record will be set in 1996 when Shell
and its partner, British Petroleum, install a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 770m)
platform in 2,933 feet of water over the Mars field, found in 1989 and the
largest discovered in the gulf in 20 years.
Lessons learnt in the Gulf of Mexico are being applied elsewhere. Shell and
BP are partners in two UK deep-water projects west of the Shetland Islands
that are currently being assessed for production.
Mr Bob Howard, vice-president of domestic operations for Shell Oil, says the
new drilling technology could help exploit an additional 8bn-15bn barrels of
oil in the Gulf of Mexico. In contrast to the small reservoirs common in the
shallow water of the gulf, the new deep-water fields have much larger
reserves. In the early 1980s, most geologists thought that these off-shore
deep-water fields contained few oil-bearing sands, says Mr Howard.
If these estimates are confirmed, it would place the Gulf of Mexico
deep-water reservoirs in the same league as Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, the
biggest single oil field in the US, which accounts for a quarter of the
country's daily output of 6.6m barrels.
The change in exploration outlook was largely brought about by the second
innovation that is opening up more of the world's oil reserves - the use of
a three-dimensional seismic technique. This has allowed geologists to 'peek
around corners', says Mr Howard.
The new technique uses the same principle as conventional two-dimensional
seismic surveys. Air guns towed by boats generate sound waves. The
reflections from rocks under the seabed are picked up by lines of underwater
sound receivers, known as hydrophones, towed by the boats.
But three-dimensional surveys use many more air guns and hydrophone lines
placed in parallel. That allows seismic 'snapshots' to be taken every 25
metres, compared with typically every 2km-3km in the past. The large amount
of data generated would be useless, however, without rapid advances in
computer processing. Mr David Work, group vice-president for exploration at
US oil company Amoco in Houston, says increased computer power has cut the
cost and the time it takes to interpret the data. 'It now costs Dollars
50,000 to process the same information that five years ago cost Dollars
250,000,' he says.
BP officials say such technical advances have cut the time between the first
seismic shot being fired and an exploration well being drilled to as little
as six months. A couple of years ago the process would have taken two years.
The Dollars 1bn or more that it takes to build a new generation deep-water
platform has restricted interest to big oil companies. But smaller ones are
among those leading the way in using three dimensional seismic surveys to
explore beneath the seabed, where sheets of salt until recently formed a
impenetrable blanket over as much as 60 per cent of the Gulf of Mexico.
'Five years ago if you hit salt you would stop drilling,' says Mr Clive
Fowler, vice-president of Amoco's offshore business unit in New Orleans. The
two-dimensional seismic technique then in use gave geologists insufficient
detail to determine where the salt ended and any oil-bearing rocks began.
But three-dimensional seismic combined with computer power have helped
geologists to 'see' below the salt sheets, which can be about 5,000ft thick.
The race to discover new fields in the Gulf of Mexico began last year when a
consortium comprising Philips Petroleum, Amoco and Anadarko, a US
independent explorer, announced a big commercial sub-salt discovery in the
gulf. That set off competition to secure new government leases in areas
covered by the salt.
Experts are divided over whether the sub-salt reserves will rival those in
deeper water. But 'if the sub-salt play is for real, it could be like
rolling the clock back 30 years in the Gulf of Mexico', says Howard, Weil,
Labouisse, Friedrichs, the New Orleans broker specialising in the energy
industry.
Unlike the deep-water finds, many of the most interesting sub-salt areas are
in shallow water close to existing platforms and pipelines. That should keep
development costs low. But even with the advantage of existing
infrastructure and new seismic techniques, Mr Work does not expect the
commercial success rate in developing sub-salt fields to lead to big
improvements from the 10-12 per cent success rate in traditional areas.
There are many technical problems, including the difficulty of drilling
through the plastic-like salt without causing the well walls to collapse.
Some industry observers predict that there will be 'many disappointments'.
Earlier this summer, Philips and Anadarko announced the abandonment of a
sub-salt exploration well due to problems with the well, even though it had
hit large amounts of oil and gas.
Some oil executives believe the full potential of the gulf will not be
realised without government help. They say the high risk associated with
deep-water development means that as much as half of the potential reserves
might not be exploited unless the government provides royalty relief or a
production tax credit.
Both proposals are being considered in Washington. But Ms Hazel O'Leary,
energy secretary, says any relief would have to be 'revenue neutral', and
not add to the federal budget deficit. The industry says any financial aid
would pay for itself, with up to 100,000 jobs created by full-scale,
deep-water development.
But even if the full potential of the Gulf of Mexico is realised, it is
unlikely to be enough to reverse the decline in US domestic production,
caused mainly by the depletion of mature onshore fields.
The government says large reservoirs of oil remain to be discovered in US
coastal waters apart from the Gulf of Mexico. But most of these areas are
covered by Congressionally-imposed environmental bans on drilling.
The impact of the technical innovations on the reserve base and cost
structure on the US oil industry will be substantial, however, even if their
application is mainly confined to the Gulf of Mexico and other existing oil
regions.
In addition to pinpointing new reserves, three-dimensional seismic surveys
of existing fields have uncovered nearby deposits missed in earlier studies.
The technique has also given companies a better idea of how more oil and gas
can be extracted from an existing reservoir, while the increase in
information available to geologists has reduced the number of expensive,
exploratory wells that need to be drilled in prospective fields.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Better mechanism needed so legal aid
system not abused
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DRYDEN GILLING-SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Mason ('Cheap ride on trial', August 30) rightly draws attention
to the scandal of legal aid payments to tycoons facing criminal charges,
while help for the genuinely poor is being more tightly rationed. In many
cases the apparently easy availability of legal aid to the astute fraudster
has resulted in an unwelcome burden on industry.
The burden is borne by employers (and falls disproportionately on smaller
employers) who take ex-employees to court following their discovery of
in-house fraud, usually at senior level. The cost of making an example of
such persons can be prohibitive if the offenders can fight a long war of
attrition funded by state legal aid.
The state should be encouraging and not discouraging public-spirited
employers from bringing fraudsters to book. Without this deterrent industry
would risk even larger losses through fraudulent misappropriation of funds.
It is also a fact of life that the fraudster, who has been able to outwit
his company's security checks, is best equipped to out-smart the legal aid
system.
Frustration knows no bounds for a company spending vast sums in legal fees
in the task of bringing a crooked former director to book, not only when he
miraculously 'divests' himself of substantial assets in order to qualify for
legal aid, but when he also qualifies for income support so that the state
pays his mortgage interest and council tax on the grounds that his own
company is only paying him a pittance for working eight hours a week,
because he needs the rest of his time to prepare his defence.
Sadly, this pattern of experience has been the lot of too many UK companies.
A more effective mechanism for preventing such abuse of the legal aid system
would not only benefit the tax payer but also the large number of UK
companies for whom the costs of their continuing war against fraud has been
grossly inflated by the apparent ease with which wealthy fraudsters have
been able to qualify for legal aid.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Arts: Barricades up at the Bastille - A time-bomb has
exploded at the Paris Opera with the sacking of its music director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Paris Opera Orchestra meets today for the first time since the
summer holidays, it is unlikely to make music. The players are almost
certain to vote for a strike in support of their sacked music director,
Myung-Whun Chung. Without an orchestra, the Opera will be unable to open its
season in two weeks' time.
A strike at the Opera is nothing new. It has been a financial,
administrative and artistic mess for the past 15 years. Its huge, high-tech
Bastille headquarters - inaugurated in 1989 as one of President Francois
Mitterrand's grands travaux - has only made matters worse, lurching from one
catastrophe to the next.
But this dispute is different. It is the first major upset to the French
government's plan to restructure the Opera, restore its artistic credibility
and reduce its deficit. That plan places complete executive power in the
hands of one man - Hugues Gall, an internationally-respected opera
administrator who currently runs Geneva's Grand Theatre. He is due to take
up his post in Paris next summer.
Gall, assisted by the Opera's interim management, opened talks with Chung in
March, aimed at renegotiating the Korean conductor's lucrative long-term
contract. As it stood, the contract invested Chung with artistic powers
which Gall himself expected to assume. Gall wanted to reduce Chung's
responsibilities, to shorten the contract and limit his pay. At the end of
June, Chung received an ultimatum saying that unless he accepted the terms
offered, the contract would be annulled. On August 12, he was dismissed.
Since then, the conflict has descended into a legal tussle, with Chung
waging a vociferous public campaign to portray himself as the wronged party.
He appeared to win an important victory last week when a Paris court ordered
his reinstatement - at least until the grounds for his dismissal were
clarified (which might take months). But the ruling could not be enforced:
by a quirk of French law, no one can forcibly enter a public establishment
against the wishes of its management. On arriving at the Bastille, Chung and
his lawyer found their way to the rehearsal room barred by the interim
director, Jean-Paul Cluzel, and a posse of security men. The locks to his
office had been changed. His furniture was impounded.
Until now, Chung has had the biggest voice in the Opera's artistic
decision-making. He had a free hand in choosing repertoire, guest
conductors, production teams and singers. His contract guaranteed him a
minimum of 30 performances a year, rising to 50 over an eight-year period.
His fee for each performance would have increased from FFr80,000 (Pounds
10,000) in 1992 to FFr177,000 (Pounds 20,000) by 2000. He was also paid a
salary as music director. The package was worth FFr3.5m a year at the time
of his dismissal - or FFr8m (Pounds 1m) by the end of the decade. It was a
time-bomb planted by Pierre Berge, Chung's patron and friend of President
Mitterrand, in the dying months of the last Socialist government. Berge knew
it would blow up in the face of an incoming centre-right administration with
its own ideas about how to run the Opera.
Chung's pay made good headlines, but the crux of his conflict with Gall was
artistic power. 'Gall made it clear he had to take all the decisions,' says
Chung. 'Of course you need a strong man at the top, but not a dictator. I
have never taken decisions alone on casts and production teams. In any
normal situation, the management discusses these with the conductor, and a
decision is taken by mutual agreement. Under the terms I was offered, they
could have told me to conduct 40 ballet performances and I would have had no
choice.'
Chung was appointed shortly before the Bastille opened in 1989, a
little-known 36-year old who did not even speak French. The Opera orchestra
had been decimated by months of inactivity. In the five intervening years,
Chung has been the only stable element in the Opera's administration. While
a string of managers came and went, Chung filled the vacuum and accumulated
power. He made the orchestra his priority - defending its rights, improving
standards and bringing in lucrative recording work. He enjoyed his job at
the Bastille, and wanted to continue.
Chung's dedication and skill earned him the respect of a notoriously
fractious group of musicians. 'It was anarchy when he came,' recalls the
cellist Marc Latarjet. 'He did a good job, he raised our profile. We had
concerts, recordings and tours, so we weren't always stuck in the pit.
Nobody will do this for us in future. We need a music director to keep
discipline and resolve our problems. Now someone wants to destroy the only
thing that was good in this troubled house.'
Gall had always made clear that Chung would not figure strongly in his
plans. He did not need a music director; at most, he wanted someone to keep
the orchestra in shape. While acknowledging Chung's achievements, Gall says
the conductor's advisers exaggerated his experience and ability. 'Chung
makes himself out to be on the level of the top ten conductors in the world.
The gap between his performance and theirs is important. If you look at
Haitink at Covent Garden, he has none of the powers in Chung's contract, and
not half the money.'
Gall's brief is to put the Opera in order. To do that he must run it the way
Rudolf Bing ran the Met for 22 years, the way Gall's mentor Rolf Liebermann
ran the Opera in the 1970s - with absolute power gathered in his hands
alone. Those were the conditions on which he accepted the job. He had no
intention of sharing responsibilities with Chung.
Gall set out his plans in a report last autumn. He would stick to agreed
spending limits. He would close both theatres (the Palais Garnier and the
Bastille) at different times, to carry out the repairs and investment
necessary to their efficient running. He would transfer the grand classical
ballets to the Bastille, and return a select slab of the opera repertory to
the Garnier. He would provide a quick injection of what the Opera has been
missing - mainstream repertory in non-weird productions, capable of being
frequently revived. On the basis of these reforms, he hoped to lure back the
top-rank conductors who have shunned the Opera since the Liebermann era.
Gall is viewed by most observers as the one person capable of sorting out
the Opera's problems. His only mistake so far is to have expected Chung to
go quietly.

We must be heading for Christmas: BBC2's autumn season starts today. Between
5.30 and 8.50 the network offers four new series and the first episode in a
complete re-run of The World At War, made at a cost of Pounds 1m by Thames
TV and first shown by ITV in 1973. It is a pity that Laurence Olivier, at
the best of times a bit of a ham, was so frustrated at not being seen that
he turned his reading of the commentary into a sequence of rococo sound
bites. Instead of being unnoticeable the narration is often horribly
intrusive. Otherwise these are exemplary programmes: 26 one-hour episodes
telling the story of the second world war (7.00). Italy Means Business is
the first of five programmes about how they do things in the land of Bugatti
and Gabrielli, starting at the odd time of 5.30. Murphy Brown is the pilot
episode of a hugely successful American comedy starring Candice Bergen as
the anchor woman of a television news programme (6.00). Fresh Prince Of Bel
Air is the fourth series of another American comedy (6.25). And White Heat
is the first in a series charting man's relationship with technology (8.00).

FT  05 SEP 94 / Arts: Jeff Buckley moves out of the shadows - Pop concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is Jeff Buckley's misfortune that this, his first major European tour,
will be the one in which his work is repeatedly compared with that of his
late father, Tim. He had better just get used to it and move on. As his
debut album, Grace, shows, he has the talent and confidence to move out of
the shadow of one of the brightest stars in the fragile firmament of 1960s
singer-songwriters.
Where Buckley pere tended towards jazz-tinged melancholy and introspection,
Jeff prefers a more muscular approach, happy to blast away at his guitar
when the occasion demands, but using his similarly soaring voice to ride
over the crashing chords as he demonstrated on Friday night in the dark,
dingy atmosphere of The Garage in Highbury.
More successful are the songs which portray a keen intelligence and
willingness to experiment of which his father would have been proud: 'Mojo
Pin', all angles, floating vocals and unexpected key changes; the
rhythmically buoyant and exuberant 'Grace'; the rockier, slide guitar-led
'Last Goodbye'. The trouble with both album and live performance is that
these stand-out tracks come rather too early; they establish a standard of
excellence which proves difficult to maintain.
While one can understand Buckley's desire to slow things right down and show
off the range and rich tone of his voice, his cover versions of 'Lilac Wine'
and Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' are a wasted self-indulgence, especially
when his own material is so strong.
It took the Jim Morrison-like 'Dream Brother' and the heavy metal 'Eternal
Life' to zap some energy back into the proceedings, although by this time
the level of chatter among the audience was getting disturbingly loud.
What remains unequivocally true is that Buckley is a star in the making,
from his self-deprecating way with his good looks (pointing out to the
audience a 'pimple which Sony couldn't pop') and his hip put-downs to the
startling ambition of his song-writing. By the end of this tour, Tim will
begin to be respectfully forgotten, and Jeff will pick up a privileged
mantle indeed.
Jeff Buckley's European tour ends in Paris on September 22.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Media Futures: European push for caller-pays pagers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the US and Asia-Pacific, pagers are an integral part of the mobile
communications sector. The US has 21m paging subscribers, Asia-Pacific 19m,
and in some Asian cities pagers are as much a teenage fashion accessories as
means of communication.
Western Europe, by contrast, has only 3.2m paging subscribers. Beyond
Sweden, few attempts have been made to take the pager into the high street.
It remains largely the preserve of the business sector - generally used by
companies or organisations that do not want to equip their employees with
mobile phones but need them to have some form of mobile communicator.
Almost all European paging operators earn their revenue on the basis of
fixed rental charges, often linked to restricted geographical zones. The
package is unattractive to personal consumers, who want low up-front prices
and a simple usage package.
That may be about to change. Sweden is pioneering calling-party pays paging.
Pagers are available on the high street for less than Dollars 150, with
immediate connection.
In the UK, several initiatives are under way. One of the most adventurous is
a pilot scheme to make alphanumeric paging available on a straight
calling-party-pays basis. Alphanumeric pagers are the most advanced of the
range, allowing callers to leave long text and numerical messages displayed
on a large screen on the pager. Student Pager, the private company
undertaking the pilot, is launching the service with 8,000 students at the
two universities in Nottingham at the start of the coming academic year. The
students can hire the pager for a flat fee of Pounds 99 to cover their
course duration. They can then tap into four channels of information about
lectures and student or local events. They can also receive messages, which
callers leave by phoning a Mercury Paging bureau at premium rate. The
premium rates are 39p off-peak and 49p daytime, so messages will cost
between about 20p and 50p each to leave. The total charge is a fraction of
the cost of running a mobile phone.
Student Pager plans to go nationwide next year. Paging operators will
monitor its progress carefully: conventional wisdom holds that an
alpha-numeric service is too expensive to provide on a calling-party-pays
basis unless the charge is higher than standard premium-rate. The problem is
bureau costs, which are high - and cannot be avoided given the state of
voice-recognition technology.

FT  05 SEP 94 / DK launches five new titles: Big batch of CD-Roms represents
a several million pound investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dorling Kindersley, the UK publisher which has assembled one of the largest
multimedia teams in the world, is about to introduce its first big batch of
CD-Rom titles.
The company which won awards for its first title, Musical Instruments, is
publishing five titles on September 29. These include The Ultimate Human
Body, The Eyewitness Encyclopedia of Science and My First Incredible,
Amazing Dictionary. The launch of so many ambitious 'edutainment' titles
simultaneously, combining words, pictures, sound, animation and video on a
compact disc, represents the fruit of a several million pound investment by
DK.
The company, which has built up a 130-strong multimedia team, plans to
launch another six CD-Rom titles in the spring and a further six next
autumn.
'We are certainly the largest (of this type of company) in Europe,' says
Alan Buckingham, managing director of DK Multimedia, set up in 1991 to
address the emerging market.
Buckingham concedes that this was, to some extent, an act of faith. But he
says he never doubted the importance of multimedia - only the timing of its
commercial success.
The Musical Instruments CD-Rom has already sold between 60,000 and 70,000
copies, with special editions being created for the French and German
markets.
One of the new titles takes David Macaulay's best-selling book, The Way
Things Work, which has sold more than 2.5m copies, and crams on a single
disc more than 1,000 illustrations and 300 animations to explain more than
150 inventions.
At the click of a mouse, everything from lightbulbs to lasers come alive on
screen. The program has a suggested retail price of Pounds 79, although
CD-Roms are often discounted. A user simply clicks on any words in the text
in red to open more than 1,500 screens and pop-ups, and move instantly from
an explanation of a machine to a biography of its inventor. CD-Roms can
actually show the inside of a four-stroke engine working.
The Encyclopedia of Science (recommended retail price Pounds 99) has more
than 170 main subjects organised into four major categories - chemistry,
mathematics, physics and life sciences - with a Who's Who of science and how
they made their discoveries. Forthcoming topics will range from nature and
world history to electronic atlases and travel guides. Buckingham, who used
to be a DK book editor, set out in 1991 with a team of five 'to teach
ourselves how to make this stuff'.
He believes books have to be 'reconceived' for multimedia, rather than
simply turned into electronic form. The big question for DK, a quoted
company capitalised at around Pounds 200m and in which US software giant
Microsoft has a 20 per cent stake, is how quickly the consumer market for
CD-Roms will grow.
The company estimates there are about 80,000 to 100,000 CD-Rom machines in
domestic use in the UK but that number could quickly double or even triple.
The market is much larger in the US, and Buckingham believes that, by the
end of this year, 10m homes could have a personal computer which can play
CD-Roms.
There are even strong signs that from next year most personal computers in
the US may be shipped with CD-Rom capacity as standard. If so that could
provide a growing market for titles such as The Way Things Work,
Encyclopedia of Science or Stephen Biesty's Incredible Cross Sections
Stowaway - 'an amazing quest through an authentic 18th century warship]'

FT  05 SEP 94 / Media Futures: National security tap dance - Motoko Rich
reports on the battle over Internet-based encryption codes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Officials in most countries would agree that the recent spate of plutonium
smuggling poses a serious threat to international weapons security, and want
to prevent the build-up of nuclear material in the storage banks of would-be
nuclear states or international terrorist groups.
In some countries, governments are not just worried about nuclear weapons.
They fear that encryption codes - programs for scrambling private messages -
can be deadly in the hands of potential enemies.
During World War II the Enigma code, the German encrypting machine, which
the Allies cracked and used to eavesdrop on Nazi communications, was a vital
key in the Allied victory.
But today, just as plutonium is frighteningly simple to transport in a
suitcase, encryption codes are easily transmitted via the Internet, the
global computer network, where there are no national borders and no customs
agents to stop smugglers.
These codes consist primarily of complicated computer software which
scrambles electronic messages and requires 'keys' - extended versions of the
familiar ATM pin number - to decode them. With the explosive use of the
Internet for both personal and commercial reasons, security has become a
major issue and such codes offer comfort to users worried about their
privacy.
Businesses want such codes to protect their sensitive data. Civil rights
advocates argue that encryption codes are essential to guard against
unwanted surveillance. Human rights organisations in the former Soviet
Union, South America and Burma are said to be using computer cryptography to
protect their Internet messages from the eyes of the police.
On the other hand, some governments argue that if encryption codes are
widely available on the Internet, any individual or group - including
potential terrorists or enemy states - will also be able to protect their
messages from national security organisations.
In the US, the government demonstrated this argument in its proposals for
the Clipper Chip, an encryption code developed by the National Security
Agency which would have allowed computer users to scramble their messages
but would also have allowed law enforcement or intelligence agencies to tap
in.
But many software authors have developed sophisticated programs which
incorporate encryption technology that is virtually uncrackable. It is this
technology that governments fear.
In the US, it is against federal law to export strong encryption codes. For
the past 18 months, a US federal grand jury in San Jose, California has been
investigating whether Philip Zimmermann, author of the computer software PGP
 -for Pretty Good Privacy - had a role in putting his cryptographic software
on the Internet and thus allowed it to be exported.
Zimmermann denies having loaded PGP on the Internet, though he is pleased
that the software has circumnavigated the globe and claimed he invented the
code in part for political reasons.
'If we allow the government to have the technological power to monitor every
movement of the political opposition, then the normal mechanisms we have to
change our government may be neutralised,' he said
PGP is available commercially in the US from Viacrypt, an Arizona-based
software company, for Dollars 100. Leonard Mikus, president of Viacrypt,
believes the government's efforts to ban the export of PGP, or any similar
technology, is futile because anyone could have put it on the Internet. 'The
information is now available and there is no way to bottle it up,' he said.
'Anything you do to try to stop it is artificial.' He said the US's export
ban merely stymied multinational companies which wanted to use US technology
to protect their data. Other US firms complain the US law just creates
unfair competition because other countries, including the UK, are not as
strict in enforcing export laws on cryptography.
Phil Dubois, Zimmermann's lawyer, said he could face a prison sentence of up
to four years if he were convicted by the grand jury. But he said he wasn't
sure why the government was singling out his client. 'The fact is that this
sort of software is out on the street in every country,' he said. 'And it's
not just because someone here has broke the law but because everyone else is
as smart as us and they have created their own cryptography.'

FT  05 SEP 94 / Media Futures: Interactive child's play - Victoria Griffith
assesses the boom in learning programs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The advent of CD-Rom and sharply falling prices for powerful multimedia
computers have triggered a boom in children's learning programs.
Parents are investing in software and CD-Rom programs that teach their
children reading, mathematics, geography, foreign languages and other
skills. The programs often include dazzling animation, sound, and motion
picture clips to capture the attention of their young users.
The US market for children's educational software and CD-Roms grew an
estimated 25 to 30 per cent last year, according to the consumer research
group Packaged Facts, and has now reached about Dollars 1bn in annual sales.
The number of companies in the market is also increasing strongly, with
start-ups like San Francisco-based Big Top Productions now putting out
titles and giants like IBM and Microsoft moving in. Microsoft launched a new
line of home educational software last year, and IBM, already active in the
schools market, hopes to launch products for the home shortly.
Better and cheaper technologies have paved the way for this boom in
business. Multimedia computers, powerful enough to store the large amounts
of information necessary for capabilities like animation and digitised
speech, can now be bought for as little as Dollars 1,200.
CD-Rom may be even more important to growth. 'CD-Rom is a vital enabling
technology,' says Harry Wilker, senior vice president of Broderbund, a major
learning program producer. 'It allows us to deliver inexpensively a lot of
stuff - video, sound, and so on - to the consumer.'
CD-Rom is prompting especially rapid growth in the pre-school market. 'Very
young children don't have the text and motor skills required to use the
older, less sophisticated programs,' says Robert Davidson, president of
Davidson &amp; Associates, which excels at mathematics programs.
Frustration over increasingly violent video and computer games has also
fueled the educational program surge. 'There is a backlash against violent
games and parents are searching for alternatives,' says Hope Neiman, vice
president of marketing for Knowledge Adventure, an educational program
maker. 'The philosophy is that if children are going to play with games
anyway, they might as well play with something they can learn from.'
The most successful learning programs are convincingly disguised as games.
In Reader Rabbit 1 by the Learning Company, for instance, the animated
Reader Rabbit pronounces three-letter words children choose with their mouse
on the screen. The popular geography program Where in the USA is Carmen
Sandiego, by Broderbund, encourages children to locate places in
detective-like fashion.
With technologies improving rapidly, the market is set for change over the
next few years.
The next step will probably be programs that allow users to connect to other
players or databases. Davidson, for example, plans to launch an adult
program, War Craft, this autumn which can connect two players via a modem.
Although the game's title sounds violent, the company says it resembles a
game of chess. The company hopes to launch similar products for the
children's market soon.
'There is a deeply felt need to socialise through these programs,' says
Wilker of Broderbund. 'The expansion of this to more than one computer - so
children in two different households can play with each other - is
inevitable.' Manufacturers also foresee an onslaught of educational programs
that allow users to access databases through on-line services.
Digitised voice and voice recognition technology will play a role in the
industry's development. 'Voice recognition technology is important for our
language programs,' says William Dinsmore, president and chief executive of
the Learning Company. 'In one or two years, we believe it will be a big part
of our mix.'
While growth has been strong, most people in the industry believe it has a
long way to go before it reaches maturity.
With technology improving rapidly, the children's educational sector will
probably ride the boom for some time to come.

FT  05 SEP 94 / People: Business heart of west Belfast - Mackie
International is to be floated in London. Owner Pat Dougan talks to William
Lewis about his hopes for a post-ceasefire Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pat Dougan sees himself as a man on a mission - to bring his children home
to Ulster. As owner and chief executive of Mackie International, the
precision engineering firm, the head office of which lies between the
Catholic Falls Road and Protestant Shankill Road, Dougan believes he and his
company are living proof that Belfast's religious divide can be beaten.
By overcoming sectarianism at Mackie - where 380 Catholics and Protestants
are working side by side to build a prospering business - Dougan believes it
may help tempt home his, and other children, to build a new peaceful Ulster.
'My children all left this country and that is a sad situation,' he says.
'They were all educated here and then cleared off.'
'I have a son in California, a son in the south of England, I have a
daughter living in South Africa, a daughter living in the Republic of
Ireland and one at university in Dublin,' he says. 'And mine is probably a
good example of families in Northern Ireland.'
Dougan was persuaded by Richard Needham, his friend and the then Northern
Ireland minister, to come out of retirement and take over Mackie.
Last Friday Mackie announced that it is to be quoted on the UK's Unlisted
Securities Market via a placing, a move which will be followed by a full
listing for the company on the London Stock Exchange. The company, which
specialises in the design, manufacture and installation of textile machinery
for a worldwide market, will be capitalised at around Pounds 20m. Dougan
last week spoke of his excitement at the company's flotation plans and his
personal commitment to the peace process in Northern Ireland.
The share placing follows a sharp recovery in the company's fortunes. In
1991 sales dipped to just Pounds 6.1m and Dougan says bluntly that the
company was 'dying'. However, this year the company is expected to make
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2m on turnover of around Pounds 19m.
Flotation will enable Mackie to eliminate debts of Pounds 14.3m and help
finance a capital spending programme.
The significance of the flotation announcement is clear from the private
reaction of many of Ulster's business leaders. One said that he 'would pray
for Mackie's success and anything which shows the world' that after the IRA
ceasefire the region has once again become investment friendly.
Dougan agrees that the company's health is crucial to the well being and
future of west Belfast: 'This company could become the flagship of west
Belfast. If we can demonstrate to US and overseas investors that there is a
work ethic here, this will allow us to develop the skills of the community.'
Improvements in training facilities for local people are already under way
with the building of a new university site and training centre close to the
Mackie factory.
For Dougan, success at Mackie is his way of 'doing his bit'. Because of its
location in west Belfast, the company has a significance quite out of
proportion to the size of its business activities.
'The excitement is of this whole thing going forward. If we can create lots
more industry, then the opportunity will be for other families, just the
same as my family, to return to Northern Ireland,' he says. 'I feel I have a
contribution to make and I am trying to make it through this.'
It is certainly not money which keeps the 61-year-old Catholic happily
running a company which has a predominantly Protestant workforce and is
situated in one of the most volatile regions of western Europe. Due to the
success of Powerscreen International, another Northern Ireland company which
was floated and which Dougan chaired until 1990, he now owns about Pounds
2m-worth of property and 140 acres of farmland. His current 66 per cent
share holding in Mackie will fall to just under 21 per cent after flotation.
Dougan insists he will stay on to 'finish the job' at Mackie. 'I am very
excited by the whole prospect, I do not want to miss the success, and I do
not mean in a monetary sense. I want to be here when this thing is a total
success.'
His declared motives are confirmed by a former colleague. 'This man is one
of the old-fashioned good guys,' he says. 'By keeping that company alive, he
has done more than any politician to help end the problems in west Belfast.'
An adviser to Dougan says he is a 'truly dynamic individual who would think
nothing of getting on an aeroplane to Africa to clinch a deal. I find him
exhausting, he never stops'.
Dougan says that 'the World has always been the place I have sold my wares
in'. He sleeps four hours each night and works a 12-hour day, arriving at
the office each morning in time for a 7am start. Such high energy levels
will undoubtedly be needed to persuade City investors to put money into a
company situated in an area which many of them would not even dare visit.
And not without good reason. On Wednesday night, less than a mile from
Mackie's factory in Springfield Road, Republicans welcomed in the IRA's
cease- fire by virtually laying siege to the local RUC police station.
Eventually the crowd dispersed but it was a clear reminder of how tense and
volatile the mood of the local community still is.
Fortunately for Mackie, Dougan's enthusiasm extends to all parts of Northern
Ireland. He makes great play of the 'work ethic' in Ulster, especially among
Protestants, and shrugs off the idea that violence and intimidation have
ever affected him or his business. He claims never to have been threatened,
and says that 'industry has not been really been affected by the troubles'.
However, 'it has to be in the best interests of Northern Ireland to have a
cessation of violence'.
Thirty per cent of Mackie's workforce is Catholic but he says there have
been only a small number of sectarian incidents at the company in recent
years. For this he singles out the trade union movement for praise. 'It
helped keep things calm. The trade unions have worked tirelessly to keep the
peace on the shop floor,' he says.
And if enthusiasm does not do the trick Dougan raises the issue of duty. He
describes Mackie's flotation as 'the first opportunity the City of London
has had, post the cessation of violence, to show its confidence in Ulster'.
As for the politicians in Ulster, he believes they are 'generally an honest
lot but community leaders should be busy building bridges'.
And what if the peace in Ulster does hold? For Dougan the sky is then the
limit. 'We have the potential to do sales three times what we do now,' he
says.

FT  05 SEP 94 / People (Names in the News): Dynastic moves at Danone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heads of French companies are often criticised for being too monarchic - and
perhaps too dynastic, in the case of Antoine Riboud, the 75-year-old head of
the Danone food group, whose son, Franck, 38, has been just made his number
two, writes David Buchan.
Antoine Riboud, whose management style is described by one Paris analyst as
increasingly authoritarian and peremptory, has never made any secret of his
desire to see his son rise to the top of Danone, which he has built up under
the name of BSN, recently dropped in favour of the more identifiable
best-selling brand of Danone yoghurt.
But the announcement of Franck Riboud's elevation to 'vice chairman and
president' under his father who is 'chairman and chief executive' was
careful to mention that the move was made at the initiative of Michel
David-Weill, the board's non-executive vice chairman and head of Lazards,
which owns 5.9 per cent of the group.
Franck Riboud, who replaces the retiring Georges Lecallier, has worked at
Danone since he graduated from the Lausanne Polytechnique in 1981. He has
had a taste of responsibilty at most branches of the group's multifarious
food businesses and since 1992 he has been reponsible for corporate
development.
Danone officials claim that any idea of Franck being groomed to take over
from his father is premature; the latter can go on until he is 80, according
to the group's statutes.
At the board meeting which elevated Franck, it was also announced that
Jacques Vincent and Christian Laubie would join Philippe Lenain in the inner
circle as senior vice-presidents.

FT  05 SEP 94 / People (Names in the News): Treasury moves in Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian Treasury has completed the reshuffle of its council of expert
advisers, naming successors to Francesco Giavazzi and Alberto Giovannini,
well-known in the world of international finance for their work on
privatisation and debt policy over the last two years, writes Andrew Hill.
The council of experts was set up in 1992 by then treasury minister Guido
Carli to advise on economic policy. Members were drawn from top
international financial and economic positions.
Professors Giavazzi and Giovannini - nicknamed the G2 in academic circles
for their joint publications - are both returning to academic positions, at
Milan's Bocconi University and Columbia University in New York respectively.
Their successors are from the same high-flying economic background.
Vittorio Grilli, a member of the Treasury's council of experts since last
year, succeeded Giavazzi last week. Grilli, 37, was educated first at
Bocconi and then gained a Masters and a PhD in economics from the University
of Rochester in the US. He is currently deputy director of the Program for
International Economic Studies at Georgetown University in Washington DC,
and the Woolwich Professor of Financial Economics at the University of
London's Birkbeck College.
Vincenzo La Via has joined the council of experts from Akros, the Italian
investment group, where he was partner and senior fund manager. La Via, who
has also held positions at the World Bank, has a doctorate from UCLA.
It has yet to be decided who will take on Alberto Giovannini's role as
coordinator of the council of experts. Giovannini himself, now Jerome Chazen
Professor of International Business at Columbia, will continue to advise the
Treasury on the privatisation of Italy's state electricity company, Enel,
likely to take place late this year or in early 1995.

FT  05 SEP 94 / People (Names in the News): The aphoristic Norman Augustine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Few captains of industry, it is safe to say, go dog-sledding in the Arctic
or travel the Oregon Trail in a covered wagon, and still find the time to
pen a book of business aphorisms.
But then Norman Augustine, the 59-year-old chairman and chief executive of
Martin Marietta, the US defence group, has never been altogether the average
boss, writes Richard Tomkins.
Last week he was in the news when Martin Marietta and Lockheed, two of the
three biggest US defence contractors, announced that they were merging.
Characteristically, where other industry executives would have rambled on
about the synergistic benefits flowing from a merger of complementary
corporate cultures, Augustine chose a different approach. 'The arithmetic is
simple,' he said. 'Three full factories are better than six half-full
factories.'
A Princeton graduate who joined Martin Marietta in 1977 after two years at
the Pentagon, Augustine signalled his loathing of cant - and simultaneously
gained wider public consciousness - by publishing a Murphy's Law type of
book, called Augustine's Laws, in 1983. One example: 'If a sufficient number
of management layers are superimposed on top of each other, it can be
assumed that disaster is not left to chance.'
More recently, he has been credited with leading the badly-needed
consolidation of the US defence industry through takeovers of General
Electric's aerospace operations and General Dynamics' space systems
business.
Yet he will be neither chairman nor chief executive of the newly-formed
Lockheed Martin: both jobs are going to Daniel Tellep, 62-year-old chairman
and chief of the larger Lockheed group, while Augustine will have to make do
with the lesser title of president.
Still, Tellep insists that the two of them will work together as a team. And
if this looks suspiciously like superimposing an extra management layer, it
has been agreed that when Tellep retires - in, say, a couple of years' time
 -Augustine will become chairman and chief executive.

Football
September 7, International Match, England v USA, Wembley, London
Two years ago, the Americans beat Graham Taylor's England 2-0 in Boston.
They have been offered a Dollars 25,000 bonus if they repeat that victory at
Wembley, where current England manager Terry Venables begins his build-up to
the 1996 European championship finals. As hosts, England do not have to
qualify for that competition. But the other home countries are playing in
qualifying rounds. Scotland go to Finland, Wales host Albania and Northern
Ireland take on Portugal. Jack Charlton's Republic of Ireland are in Latvia
Athletics
September 9-11, World Cup, Crystal Palace, London
Sally Gunnell, the 400 metre hurdler, will lead Britain's women into the
event, following the British Athletic Federation's refusal to withdraw the
team over the Diane Modahl drug taking affair. The International Amateur
Athletic Federation wanted Britain to withdraw but has no power to order the
team out. It has warned, however, that any success achieved could be wiped
out if a ban on the 800m runner was confirmed. The British mens team is well
placed for a title challenge, with Linford Christie (100m), Du'aine Ladejo
(400m) and Colin Jackson (110m hurdles) leading the line-up.
Motor Racing
September 11, Italian Grand Prix, Monza
This season has had more than its fair share of drama - both on and off the
track. Every week brings fresh controversy. In the last race in Belgium,
runaway title leader Michael Schumacher was disqualified on a technicality
after finishing in first place. As Schumacher is suspended for two-races for
ignoring a black flag at the British Grand Prix, Damon Hill will get a
chance to close the 21-point gap by which he trails Schumacher in the
championship. If Hill wins in Italy and again in Portugal, on September 25,
he will have only a one-point deficit with three races left. Not that that
will be uppermost in the minds of the passionate Italian fans who will be
hoping for a Ferrari victory and just glad that the event is being held at
all. The sport's governing body, the FIA, had threatened to cancel the event
because Italian authorities refused to cut down about 100 ancient trees to
widen a run-off area and meet new safety specifications. Heavy lobbying by
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusoni's government was needed for the meeting to
be reinstate. Remaining grands prix after Monza are: Portuguese, September
25, Estoril; European, October 16, Jerez, Spain; Japanese, November 6,
Suzuka; Australian, November 13, Adelaide.

'She probably cried rape because the geezer didn't please her'. That's the
opinion of one juror in a rape trial. How do we know? Because Network First
(Tuesday, 10.40-11.40pm ITV) has come up with a hybrid documentary format
which allows the camera to be a fly on the jury room wall for the first
time. A group of actors devise characters for themselves and with the help
of police and the courts let us see what happens from the moment a rape
victim rings the police to the point where the lights are turned off in the
court. The police, barristers, judge and jury behave exactly as if they were
dealing with a real case and the entire proceedings are filmed with two
hand-held cameras and available light. This illuminates the process, without
the artificiality of reconstruction, in which one feels sorry for nervous
policemen stumbling over their lines. To what extent what we see is
artificial and how the presence of the cameras affect behaviour is debatable
but it is undoubtedly engrossing. The trial will be shown in three parts
(Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, 2.20pm, ITV) and an edited omnibus version,
next Tuesday evening.
Paranoia thrillers which play with power politics are very much the fashion
since the BBC's enormous success with the two Michael Dobbs serialisations -
House Of Cards and To Play the King. Faith (Wednesday and Thursday
9.00-10.00 and 10.40-11.40, ITV) a four - hour original screenplay is the
latest to come to the hustings and looks set for a landslide. Michael Gambon
is P J Moreton, a former minister about to return to office. But first he
must pay the political price by committing perjury. Customs and Excise is
after the DTI which had secretly sanctioned the sale of arms to African
guerrillas who are using them to shoot British aid workers. The scapegoat is
a small-time arms dealer who is waiting to be slaughtered at the Old Bailey.
Moreton also happens to be sleeping with his male researcher and there's
even a press baron with strangely antipodean vowels who has satellite TV
interests. The roman a clef element gives the piece its initial appeal but
the drama takes on its momentum, helped no end by a superb cast, including:
Susannah Harker, John Hannah, Keith Allen and Connie Booth.  The highlight
of the week.
The proms season comes to an end this week with the annual brouhaha which
may seem a modern aberration but in fact began in 1895 when Sir Henry Wood
ended the first Proms season with Koenig's Post Horn Gallop. The Last Night
Of The Proms (Saturday 7.45-9.00pm BBC2) has Wood's arrangement of Bach's
Toccata and Fugue in D Minor. Wood, who had been castigated for his other
arrangements, did not claim authorship of the Bach until it had been played
a few times and been well received. The fixtures of the last night, though,
are Land Of Hope and Glory and the Hornpipe. The latter was introduced to
mark the centenary of the Battle of Trafalgar and the promenaders tried to
outdo the orchestra by tapping their feet faster and faster. That
boisterousness has now become the distinguishing factor of the evening. So
much so that Sir Malcolm Sargent once had to appeal to the audience not to
throw 'streamers of excessive width'. He meant toilet rolls.

There is little doubt that the cult sound of the autumn will be Jan
Garbarek's collaboration with The Hilliard Ensemble, Officium (ECM New
Series), released today. Garbarek, the Norwegian saxophonist, has added his
instrumental skills to a collection of ancient chants, some of which date
back to the 12th century. The result is a curiously compatible blend, which
certainly meets the current demand for spirituality in music - expect the
Gregorians to be knocked off the top of the classical charts.
After a seven-year break, Bryan Ferry (below) has brought out Mamouna
(Virgin), a new album of original songs, with the unlikely aid of some old
friends - Phil Manzanera, Andy Mackay and even Brian Eno, who co-wrote
'Wildcat Days'. Plus ca change. The narcissistic Ferry, as ever surrounding
himself with glamour, still pays too much attention to slick production
values at the expense of his song-writing. The album marks the beginning of
a world tour, with four British dates in October.
The Three Tenors are not the only ones cashing in on post-World Cup fever;
the first in what is bound to be a rush of compilations of Brazilian music
is Brazilica], Talkin' Loud's collection of samba and bossa nova, featuring
seminal names such as Sergio Mendes, Milton Nascimento and Gilberto Gil.
Best to play on a wet February evening while practising one-touch back-heels
in the sitting room.
In brief: Nicholas McGegan conducts the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra and
the choir of Clare College, Cambridge for a bright, crisp performance of
Purcell's Dido and Aeneas (harmonia mundi). Riccardo Muti and the Orchestra
Filarmonica della Scala combine Elgar's In the South (Alassio) overture with
Brahms's youthful Serenade No. 1 in D major (Sony). The Ensemble Musique
Oblique with Rachel Yakar and Isabelle Veyrier tackle a selection of works
by the Belgian composer Guillaume Lekeu, who died in 1894 just one day after
his 24th birthday (harmonia mundi).

Every so often the cinema has a nostalgia spree. Spurred by all those fans
who say 'They don't make them like they used to', it rolls up its sleeves
and tries to do so. Last week we had The Hudsucker Proxy: a sort of
self-assembly Frank Capra comedy from the makers of Barton Fink. This week
Wyatt Earp sprawls across the land, three hours of Kevin Costner trying to
rebuild the Western (even though hostile American critics tried to gun him
down).
And in the better-received but still backward-looking When A Man Loves A
Woman, Andy Garcia and Meg (Sleepless In Seattle) Ryan try to put the angst
back into the romantic weepie.
Like the song lyricists, Hollywood knows that September rhymes with
remember. But if you want to skip the repro Golden Age, you could always go
for the real thing. A sparkling print of Michael Powell's 1940s
here-and-beyond fantasy A Matter Of Life And Death - David Niven and Deborah
Kerr reaching out to each other across the heavens - is on at London's
Barbican. And the Riverside Studios have a marvellous Jean Renoir double
bill. The lyrical Partie De Campagne - like an Auguste Renoir landscape come
to life - makes a high-contrast pairing with the black comedy Le Crime De
Monsieur Lange.
For once, the new video releases seem more up-to-date than the new movies.
Check your stockist now or soon for Robert Altman's unmissable epic of
inter-tangling lives, Short Cuts: the strong cast of which (Lemmon, Robbins,
Tomlin, McDowell ..) draws Chekhovian patterns across Los Angeles. Robert De
Niro's directing debut A Bronx Tale is a lively if sermon-prone tale of
Italian-American growing up. And for a foolish treat try El Mariachi, a
Mexican comedy-Western which conquered the world's festival circuit earlier
this year and had Hollywood scrambling to sign its director for an
English-language remake.

FT  05 SEP 94 / FT Guide To The Haiti Crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Haiti is an impoverished Caribbean backwater of 5.5m people. What has it
done to deserve such international attention?
A military coup in September 1991 ousted Haiti's first democratically
elected president, Rev Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who had swept the polls with
67 per cent of the vote only ten months earlier. Aristide, whose short reign
was dogged by intrigue and conflict, fled to the US and was replaced by a
repressive, violent junta headed by Gen Raoul Cedras. The coup coincided
with a revision of US foreign policy. Although the US had supported the
autocratic regime of Francois 'Papa Doc' Duvalier (1957-71) and then his son
Jean-Claude 'Baby Doc' Duvalier (1971-86) during the Cold War, in the 1990s
an anti-democratic coup in America's backyard was a serious affront.
Thousands of Haitian refugees fleeing to Florida provided President George
Bush and then President Bill Clinton with another compelling reason to seek
a solution to Haiti's troubles.
Have economic sanctions been tried?
The Organization of American States (OAS) declared an embargo immediately
after the coup in 1991. It had little impact initially but in recent months
the Haitian economy has all but collapsed. The United Nations estimates the
unemployment rate is about 80 per cent. Food prices have rocketed; a sack of
flour cost 450 gourdes on August 22, up from 120 gourdes two weeks earlier.
Haiti's poor have borne the brunt of the embargo and the military leadership
is thought to be cushioned from its effects.
What efforts were made to solve the problem diplomatically?
In early 1992, the OAS negotiated the Washington Protocol which proposed
establishing a new government and, after a few months, Aristide's return to
the presidency. Haiti's Congress dismissed it. Then, the UN brokered an
agreement, signed in July 1993 by Cedras and Aristide to restore the
president by October 30 of last year. Haitian toughs on the Port-au-Prince
quayside, apparently backed by Cedras, humiliatingly rebuffed a US troop
ship on a mission to assist Aristide's return. Last week, the UN declared
the latest peace mission had failed because the military leadership refused
to talk to its representative.
So the UN decided to take action?
Yes, on July 31, the security council voted for the US-conceived Resolution
940, which sanctioned a multinational force to 'use all necessary means'
(for which read, an invasion) to remove the military leadership.
What kind of military intervention is envisaged ?
Pentagon officials estimate an invasion force of less than 15,000 soldiers
(mostly from US, but also from Argentina, Britain, and four countries of the
Caribbean) could defeat the 7,500 ill-trained Haitian army in less than a
week. Cedras' military is understood to be equipped with only six
lightly-armoured vehicles less than five 105-millimetre artillery guns, two
Italian training aircraft and a navy of four patrol boats. 'On a good day,
two work,' according to a Pentagon official.
Is the invasion imminent?
After Resolution 940 was passed, the flood of Cuban refugees diverted US
State Department attention. Yet tough talk last week from John Deutch, US
deputy defense secretary, reopened speculation that the invasion may come
soon.
Other dates to bear in mind are:
October 12 - the end of Cedras' three-year term as commander-in-chief and an
opportunity for him to leave with full military honours.
November 8, congressional and gubernatorial elections in the US could weigh
in the political calculations for the Clinton Administration.
December 1995 - Aristide's term as elected president runs out.
Once Aristide was restored, what then?
The UN security council expects a 6,000-strong peace-keeping mission to
remain until February 1996. The World Bank has calculated that Aristide's
government would need Dollars 555m in its first year just to return Haiti
back to pre-1991 levels of poverty.
What does President Clinton stand to gain from an invasion?
It would help to shore up the his relations with black critics in Congress.
A swift and successful operation abroad would help the Administration's
foreign policy reputation and Clinton's image before a tough couple of
months pursuing his domestic agenda on Capitol Hill. The Administration will
also be glad to be rid of the turbulent priest, Father Aristide. He has been
a tough client. pleading for action but then not endorsing an invasion.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Sport: Actions speak louder . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month the finest sprint filly in Britain, Lochsong, finished last at
York, in a race she was odds-on favourite to win. Her distraught connections
blamed her performance on the fact that, before the race, she had been
obliged to take part in a parade, at which her febrile temperament had
protested. She had twisted and yearned away from her jockey, and nearly
injured herself in the process. She had galloped to the stalls with
terrified ferocity and, all in all, she had exhausted herself before the
race had even begun.
This had happened to Lochsong before, and exemption from the parade had
therefore been requested for the York race. Afterwards, the authorities
conceded that in future such a request would be considered more favourably.
They did, however, make at the same time a defence of the parade, which was
that it allows the whole of the race-going public full view of the horses
and, as such, plays a part in race procedure.
More precisely, what it does is to create a spectacle, by presenting the
competitors to their audience. It gives them to us, the watching world,
rather than leaving them within their own sphere - that of the sport in
which they are competing.
I thought of Lochsong and her reluctance to parade for us when I read, last
week, that Ellery Hanley had been appointed the new coach of the Great
Britain rugby league team. Hanley has been the greatest player of his
generation but he has, throughout the years of his supremacy, refused any
dealings with the media. He has captained Wigan and Great Britain to several
notable successes and then, at the end of the match, as the reporters began
to cluster for their quotes, he has mysteriously evaporated.
Apparently this is not the thing to do. The consensus within the media - and
possibly outside of it - is that a captain's duties do not end when the
match is over. He has thereafter to explain, to sell the game, to give it to
its audience, despite the fact that they have just had it; in refusing to do
all this, Hanley was dodging his responsibilities.
Yes, he could rouse his team to glorious heights, but that was not good
enough if he would not tell us how he had done it, if he would not share it
with us.
This demand that sportsmen be talkers, as well as players, is inspired by
the same principle that expects horses to be show animals as well as racers.
One can understand this principle, but it isn't, ultimately, all that
sensible. For example, it demands that Lochsong take part in a parade,
despite the fact that, if she does so she will no longer be the great horse
that the public wants to see on parade.
Surely it would be better to see her simply run to her full abilities?
Therein lies her true self, just as Ellery Hanley's lies on the pitch and
not behind a microphone.
Yet the notion persists that sporting personalities must, come what may,
give themselves to their public, off, as well as on, their fields of combat.
No matter that Lochsong's nerves cannot cope with it, nor that Hanley had
experiences with the press that made him not want to cope with it. Their
sporting excellence is not enough. We must have the whole of them - or what
passes for the whole of them.
It has even been suggested that Lochsong - Lochsong, with her magical turn
of foot] - is a flawed horse because of her delicate temperament. Certainly
it was suggested that Hanley's extreme taciturnity would preclude his
appointment as Great Britain team coach.
With regard to this, it might be easier to understand the demand that
sportsmen speak to us, give to us, if they were saying or giving anything of
value; but the way in which most interviews are conducted makes that
unlikely. Some 99 per cent of them have no point. The truth is that
interviewing sportsmen is ridiculously hard. What they do is supremely
defiant of analysis; their genius is instinctive, surprising and momentary,
and they themselves are scarcely in a position to understand it. It would
take an interviewer as persistent and sensitive as John Freeman to unearth
their emotions and motivations with any degree of success. But no such luck
 -we must have instead 'how did you feel after scoring that goal?'
(terrible); 'how disappointed are you about losing that race?' (not at all,
I'm delighted); and 'did you enjoy performing in front of your home crowd?'
(no, I'd rather be in Papua New Guinea). Are we really losing something so
precious if a sportsman refuses to answer such questions?
I know that the media helps to create a celebrity and that, in return, the
celebrity should help to create the media. But the fact is that some of them
do it better than others, and it is hard to see why sporting personalities
who prefer to let their actions speak, or parade, for them should be forced
to do otherwise.

Last Thursday, British Airways cabin crews at Manchester and Birmingham
backed strike action in a ballot by the Transport and General Workers'
Union.
Meetings are now to be held to try to resolve the dispute, which is over
holidays and allowances affecting air hostesses and stewards.
Three-quarters of the 565 cabin crew union members at the airports returned
their papers in the ballot.
A total of 88 per cent backed a strike, while an even bigger proportion, 93
per cent, supported other forms of industrial action short of a walkout,
said the union.

Scandinavian Airlines and a US-based investment firm presented plans on
Friday for a new international carrier based in Latvia.
The plan, which was requested by Latvia and seems assured of approval, calls
for replacing two current Lativan airlines with one system based in Riga.
The new carrier, which has not yet been given a name, would use the Latvian
capital as a hub and initially would fly within the Baltics and neighboring
countries.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Beirut strike
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 2,000 travelers bound for Europe, North Africa and Gulf states
were straded at Beirut international airport on Friday when flight crews of
Middle East Airlines, Lebanon's national carrier, went on strike Friday
demanding a pay increase.
The open-ended strike by 300 pilots and flight engineers grounded at least
10 MEA aircraft.
The strike was launched at the height of Lebanon's annual summer travel
season.
Aviation officials said negotiations were under way between the strikers and
management of the state-owned airline.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On Friday, the Federal Aviation Administration said airlines in nine third
world countries failed to meet international safety standards and have been
banned from flying to the US. It also gave conditional approval for
continued flights from four other countries and said their safety standards
would be kept under close scrutiny.
The nine countries which did not meet minimum standards were: Dominican
Republic, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Uruguay, Gambia, Ghana and
Zaire. The four put under continued close review were: Bolivia, Netherlands
Antilles, El Salvador and Guatemala.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Business Travel: 'Stunning' Kansai opens its doors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kansai International Airport opened yesterday. 'Take-offs and landings went
very smoothly,' said Tsuneharu Hattori, airport president. But 19 flights
were delayed for up to 65 minutes - owing to the malfunction of an air
traffic-control computer - and he acknowledged that the opening, after seven
and a half years of construction, did not give cause for 'unalloyed joy'.
'We are still learning from problems, and if two more runways are to be
built soon we will need more support from the Kansai region.' he said.
Kansai, is built on a man-made island off Osaka and is Japan's first major
airport to operate round the clock. It has a daily capacity of 454 arrivals
and departures. But, partly because of high landing fees and passenger
service charges, only 339 international and 469 domestic weekly flights were
scheduled by the time of the opening.
For harried business travellers who do use the airport, Kansai is likely to
offer plenty of visual appeal with a stunning terminal building designed by
Italian architect Renzo Piano.
Transit passengers to other cities in Japan will also find the airport
designed to meet their needs, with flights taking off to 24 domestic
destinations from the same terminal building. Passengers are only required
to move either up or down a floor by escalator or elevator.
A shuttle that runs along the length of the terminal building at frequent
intervals ensures that moving from one end of the long building is a smooth
and easy process.
For passengers travelling on to one of the major cities around Kansai
International, such as Osaka, Kobe or Kyoto, or to other parts of Japan by
train, the airport offers the convenience of direct access to the railway
station through the terminal building.
If taxis or personal cars are the preferred method of transport, the airport
is linked to two major expressways that run to major cities, with an
estimated driving time of one hour to Osaka and 70-minutes to Kobe.
Kansai also offers a boat service into Osaka. This takes about half an hour.
But whatever route is taken, the high costs of public transport from the
airport are guaranteed to shock the first-time visitor. The 3.75-km bridge
linking the airport to the main island costs cars Y1,700 (Dollars 17) to
cross, the JR train ride to Shin-Osaka station is nearly Y3,000, and the
35-minute boat ride to Kobe, to which there is not direct train link, is
Y2,490.
At around 6am yesterday, The Crystal Wing was the first ferry to make the
30-minute journey from Kobe air terminal to the airport island. But, due to
engine trouble, another boat, the Pearl Wing, had to return to Kobe at
around 7am. The 173 passengers were transferred to another boat.
In a related development, an accident involving a hydrofoil carrying
passengers from the port of Kobe to the airport forced more than 100
passengers to miss their flights.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Architecture: View of Wardour's hidden treasures - Colin
Amery on the castle's restoration appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wardour Castle, in Wiltshire, feels like the setting for Brideshead
Revisited. It is one of the great 18th century houses of England. It was
built for Lord Arundell in the 1770s, with both a house and chapel designed
by James Paine. Outside they are severe and uncompromising. Inside, they
both contain brilliant surprises. In the house, there is a staircase that is
an architectural tour de force and the whole interior of the chapel is a
decorative triumph.
The recent history of Wardour has not been entirely happy. In 1960 the great
house became Cranborne Chase School. Inevitably new buildings were added,
and alterations were made that changed the character of the place. The
school closed a few years ago and the house has been sold to be divided into
apartments.
The chapel had an independent existence run by the Jesuits who have cared
for its treasures, and in 1992 a programme of structural repair was
undertaken. An appeal was launched and funds are needed to complete the
work.
As part of this appeal an exhibition and sale of paintings has been mounted
at Christie's in London. One hundred artists were commissioned to paint
their impressions of Wardour and the results are on view at Christie's in
Ryder Street, St. James's, London, SW1, until September 9.
During this week it is not just the paintings that are on view but also a
display of some of Wardour's hidden treasures. There are historic vestments
of extraordinary quality as well as silver and gold - a reflection of the
panoply of worship from the 18th century.
Short of visiting the chapel itself (Wardour is near Tisbury, in Wiltshire)
it would be difficult to think of a more imaginative evocation of a great
building than this exhibition.
Although technically a private chapel, it is the size of a major parish
church. James Paine finished it in 1776 and then Sir John Soane added to it
in 1790. Its visual climax is the sumptuous altar which was commissioned
from that master of the Roman Baroque, Giacomo Quarenghi.
Great and splendid rituals must have been conducted around this altar and
they were enhanced by the vestments and precious vessels.
It is important not to miss the vestments which are some of the finest
examples of ecclesiastical needlework to be seen anywhere. The
three-dimensional quality of the work on the famous Westminster chasuble is
staggering. Tudor roses, portcullises, flueurs-de-lis and pomegranates are
scattered across red velvet with a liberality that is gloriously
extravagant. We are in the arcane world of the orphrey and dalmatic, the
cope and the chasuble - theatrical yet sacred garments that are a far cry
from the hessian cross stitch garments that pass as vestments in the modern
catholic and Anglican church.
There are several paintings that evoke the chapel well - work by Alan Dodd,
Edmund Fairfax-Lucy, Jane Dowling and Riccardo Cinalli is some of the best.
There is enormous variety and work in all media - even a set of painted
porcelain; teapot, cups and bowl - inspired by Wardour and made by Melinda
Patton.
The idea of encouraging contemporary artists to contribute their work to
help save an older work of art is an inspired one. Wardour Chapel of All
Saints is celebrated by this exhibition and shown to be one of the great
18th century churches of Europe that deserves to be perfectly restored.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Airlines keep their guard up - Charles
Jennings looks at the security implications of declining terrorism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES JENNINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carlos the Jackal may be behind bars, Israel may be entering into peace
agreements with its neighbours and the IRA may have declared a ceasefire;
but there is to be no slackening of airline security procedures.
As a spokeswoman for United Airlines puts it: 'Security won't change. We'll
keep operations absolutely 100 per cent as they are.' This is a theme echoed
by El Al, which delares itself 'probably more on our guard than before.
We're certainly not relaxing, with peace in the air. Indeed, there may be
more splinter groups forming as a result of the peace process, so we have to
redouble our efforts.'
The big dates in the world of airline security, are September 12 1970 - when
Palestinian terrorists blew up three airliners in Jordan, and simultaneously
attempted to hijack an El Al jet at Heathrow; and December 21 1988 - the
date of the Lockerbie bombing. The first prompted the worldwide introduction
of X-ray scanners and metal detectors; while the second led to the present
mish-mash of regulations, concerning inter alia the carrying of electrical
items and the problem of identifying which passengers are responsible for
which pieces of luggage.
Events like these also imprinted the notion of airline security on
travellers' minds. Other aspects of aviation safety (such as airworthiness)
are easier to forget about; but airlines now work on the basis that security
must not only be done, it must be seen to be done. That it is, in fact, a
matter of customer comfort to make them go through the security checks
involved in an international flight. El Al's famous lengthy
cross-questioning of passengers before they get on a flight, for instance,
manages to be both irksome (it takes ages) and at the same time profoundly
comforting (at least a Leila Khaled is less likely to be on board).
Some airlines are so uneasy at the prospect of even discussing security  -
in conditions of reduced global tension or otherwise - that they can barely
allow the word to cross their lips. As Air France (which has recently
re-introduced scheduled flights into Beirut) says: 'There's one subject that
airlines won't talk about, and that is security.'
A British Airways spokesman did break ranks, and promptly tied himself in
knots trying to say something without actually revealing anything: 'The only
answer I can give is that a large part is intelligence. We liaise with all
the intelligence authorities around the world and adjust our measures to
suit.' Meaning? 'You've got a very high level of security measures at all
times anyway and we can go up two or three notches from that and then go
down a notch or two. But it remains at a very high level.'
For the airport authorities, as well as the airlines, the fact is that to
talk about security is to some extent, to breach security. And no one in
their right mind is going to advertise, say, a slimming-down of baggage
checks, even if such a thing were on the cards. According the British
Airport Authority: 'The thing about security is that we review it constantly
and we certainly wouldn't be making any reductions. The process of review
never stops, it's an ongoing situation.'
In fact, much of Britain's airline and airport security is mandated directly
by the Department of Transport. There is a bottom line imposed by the DoT,
below which carriers may not go; although they can add further procedures as
they choose. Some of the more recent DoT regulations include checks on
baggage going into the holds of aircraft (in addition to the hand luggage
searches introduced some years ago); tougher security arrangements for
airport staff; and making it an offence to give false information about the
contents of one's baggage.
Having raised the stakes to their current height, there is clearly no easy
way to lower them again. In Japan and the US, where the IRA, the Red Brigade
and the PFLP have not been so active, flight security can sometimes seem
extremely relaxed. But elsewhere air travellers will continue to face the
same hours of tedium that they have come to know so well over the last two
decades.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Management: Tired of the sweet smell of success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why is it, asked the great and the good of the green movement in a letter to
the FT last week, that the media spends more time attacking Body Shop than
it does all those thousands of companies that could not care less about the
environment?
The question makes me feel a little uncomfortable. Over the past two weeks I
have been reading the knocking copy about the company that brought us
peppermint foot lotion. I have to admit it: I long for holier-than-thou
Anita Roddick and her touchy husband Gordon to be taken down a peg or two.
I can neither fully justify my aversion, nor can I lay it to rest. Many of
the things Body Shop does - giving employees time off to do voluntary work,
offering civilised childcare, buying products from the third world - are
admirable.
What gets up my nose is not the sickly smell of the perfumes but the
sanctimoniousness of the company's style. Doubtless, I am suffering from the
British disease of hating success, yet there is more to it than that. The
Body Shop has put itself on a pedestal so high (it is even thinking of
establishing a business school, of all self-regarding things) that it is
only natural to want to topple it.
In the last 10 years many other companies have taken big leaps
environmentally, but their bosses do not tell us about how well they've done
as they stride though the jungle waving American Express cards. Neither
would they have the brass neck to claim simultaneously that their company
never does anything as filthy as advertise.
As for the specific allegations made during the last few weeks, I would not
be surprised to discover that they do not amount to much. Body Shop may be a
little stingy in the information it provides about its do-gooding, but it is
still way ahead of the pack.
The Roddicks are suffering as a result of their own PR. Anyone who shouts so
loud about being perfect is bound to be attacked when the slightest thing
goes wrong. And when Body Shop comes in for a bit of stick, it would be
better advised to be more relaxed in its response. By publishing 32-page
rebuttals of allegations before the latter have even been made, and decrying
the 'zealots of cynicism' that dare to be critical, the company is asking
for it. And when it gets it, can we really be blamed for laughing up our
sleeves?
Last week was the traditional time for telling colleagues how well they look
after their holidays, and for sifting though overflowing in-trays. In mine
there seemed to be fewer than usual of the glossy invitations to business
conferences. The big organisers gloomily explain that they went into
recession a year after everyone else, and it will be at least another year
before they start emerging from it.
I wonder if they are being optimistic. It has always been a mystery why
companies are prepared to spend Pounds 1,000 or so for the privilege of
having their managers out of the office for two days. It was all very well
in the times when every company had several extra layers of managers that it
did not need. But now that everyone is overstretched and under pressure to
produce concrete results it is particularly hard to justify two days sitting
at a green baize table in the ballroom of a big hotel listening to things
about your industry you should have known already.
Most conferences are an inefficient way of disseminating information - the
chances of picking up any secrets are nil with the competition sitting
listening, too. Regular attendees say that the value is in the networking -
but in that case conferences for the mid-1990s should be organised
differently, with the formal sessions cut out, and the whole thing
abbreviated to a few hours of hobnobbing time. Whether anyone would pay
Pounds 1,000 for that is another matter.
The same disillusionment does not seem to extend to training conferences and
seminars, where there is no limit to the sorts of things people feel the
need to learn. The London Personal Development Centre is due to open later
this month offering 'inspiration, holistic healing and down-to-earth
practical skills for individuals and businesses alike'. There is a course on
Astral Sex and Zen Tea Bags, and another on how to make a drum and use it to
get in touch with yourself and your tribe or company. A third, The Power of
Dynamic Womanhood, shows women how to win, and invites men along at half
price.
The peppermint foot lotion brigade may enjoy some of those seminars; the one
that interests me is called 'I Love My Job]' It includes a 'laughter clinic'
and teaches you how to treat work as akin to play. Satisfied customers from
this seminar apparently include British Telecom and the BBC - two
organisations where morale is so low as to be off the map. Next time your
telephone engineer starts humming cheerfully under his breath, or you meet
someone from the BBC who is not moaning, you'll know why.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Management: Desert island manager - Sir Richard Sykes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshireman Sir Richard Sykes prefers to relax on mountain walking holidays
rather than by the beach. Nevertheless, the chief executive of Glaxo, the
world's second biggest drugs company, relishes the prospect of being
marooned on a desert island. He is one of the few scientists who have fought
their way to the very top of the drugs industry.
Could you carry on your business from the island?
I might even have a clearer idea of the business than from here in Berkeley
Square. I would need telephones, fax and a notebook computer, then could
comment on and make decisions from the island. With the extra time I had, it
could add up to even better decision-making.
Who would you take with you?
An astronomer. I've always been fascinated by the stars. With those long
evenings and clear skies, what a perfect opportunity to study the stars.
What would you take for sustenance?
As a variation from the plentiful fish, I would like to take dried pasta and
porcini. They are preserved and should last a while. And to drink, a few
crates of Brunello. It would be too difficult to cool any white wines.
Any entertainment to accompany the food and wine?
For music, I would like to take Brahms' four symphonies conducted by
Toscanini. He is incomparable. There was a wonderful television series
called Search for the Nile narrated by James Mason. That series would help
me associate with explorers and pioneers. And for a book I would take
Scott's Last Expedition.
Would you become a beach bum?
I'm not the sort of person who would lie around on the beach. I need
discipline and would exercise for at least an hour a day. I need to keep in
top condition both physically and mentally. I'd need to build that
astronomical observatory after all.
How would you keep mentally fit?
Apart from the work running the business, I understand there are some very
good bridge and chess programs for computers.
Would you try to escape?
Initially it would be quite nice on the island. But a time would come when I
would have to consider alternatives. I'm quite practical and I'm sure I
could build what was necessary to leave.
What would you most like about the island?
Solitude. I'd miss my family, but I don't have a problem being on my own.
And I would not miss driving down the A40 every day.
What would you dislike about being there?
After a time, it would be that there is no access to culture or to my
family.
Are there any conditions you want to impose on your island? None. It should
be a natural island, unspoiled.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Management: When the office is the dining room -
Teleworking, although popular in the US, has been slow to catch on in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the UK rail strike moves into its 13th week, it is taking an increasingly
heavy toll on British businesses. Like January's Californian earthquake and
past bomb explosions in the City of London, the strike is encouraging
companies to consider promoting telework in order to reduce their dependence
on commuters.
Teleworking, the practice of using computers and telephone links to work
away from the office, inspires grand claims from its advocates. In a recent
newspaper advertisement exhorting companies to introduce teleworking to
overcome the rail strike, one British consultancy claimed that the practice
'not only overcomes the immediate transport problem . . . it will increase
productivity by around 45 per cent'.
The supposed ability of teleworking to increase productivity, along with
other benefits such as reducing road traffic and creating a more flexible
workforce, has won it influential support. The European Commission, which is
promoting it as part of its measures on growth, competitiveness and
employment, believes that Europe could potentially have 10m teleworkers.
Optimistic forecasts about teleworking's potential have been made for 20
years, since before the technology actually existed to make it possible
reliably and economically.
Yet, even now, the uptake of teleworking is patchy. Although the
technological obstacles have been overcome, it is seen by employers as being
difficult to manage, while employees worry that their career prospects will
suffer if they are not seen in the office.
In the US, where the Clean Air Act has forced employers to reduce commuters'
car emissions, an increasing number of employees are being encouraged to
spend some or all of their week working at home. The Institute for the Study
of Distributed Work, based in California, estimates that between 4m-5m
people, or 3-5 per cent of the US workforce, are teleworkers.
In Europe, however, the introduction of teleworking has been relatively
slow. In the UK, a recent Department of Employment report cast doubt on the
notion that it was 'slowly but inexorably growing'. Although one in 20
organisations employs at least one teleworker, fewer than one employee in
200 is a genuine teleworker, it said.
This figure excludes self-employed homeworkers and people who spend less
than half their time working from home. Nor does it include staff who spend
most of their time with clients while using telecommunications to keep in
touch with the office. This approach, used by companies such as IBM and
Arthur Andersen, allows employees to use a limited pool of desks when in the
office - a practice known as 'hot-desking'.
A Department of Trade and Industry study published early this year argued
that the slow speed at which teleworking has been adopted meant that 'the UK
and the rest of Europe as a whole are net losers of jobs and trade both to
the USA and to developing countries'.
The uneven take-up of teleworking can partly be ascribed to the recession.
Interest in teleworking increased in the late 1980s, when it was viewed as a
way of retaining scarce skilled workers. This became less of a factor during
the recession, leaving much of the expansion of home working to the ranks of
the self-employed and those who work from home on an informal, occasional
basis.
Indeed, many companies that pioneered teleworking have stopped their schemes
completely. The Department of Employment's report said that 'we were
surprised by how many (organisations that used teleworking in the past) had
since given up the practice'. The reasons given by these companies included
job cuts, the departure of the manager who initiated the scheme, the lack of
success of the scheme and changes in the circumstances of employees or the
company.
For example, FI Group, the computer services company which pioneered British
home-working in the 1960s, has stopped the practice completely.
This change was precipitated by FI taking on larger projects, which required
greater teamwork. 'Because of the complexity of the projects we are working
on, we need large, closely knit teams which can work around the clock,' says
Rosie Symons, one of FI's managers.
Rank Xerox also once associated itself closely with teleworking - to much
public relations acclaim - but has now dropped the practice. Its
'networking' experiment in the early 1980s involved employees leaving the
staff and working on a self-employed basis, with guaranteed work from the
company for a period of time. The networkers kept in touch with Rank Xerox
via computers and a telecommunications link. But although the experiment
suited the company's particular needs at the time, it was not extended to
its regular staff.
The fear that teleworking is a back-door route to redundancy has slowed its
take-up during the recession. But over the past year, the subject has been
re-established on the agenda of large companies, according to Noel Hodson,
director of SW2000, a teleworking consultancy.
He attributes this resurgence in interest to the growing burden of
commuting, the sharp drop in the cost of equipment, and the economic
benefits of teleworking that stem from the retention of trained workers,
increased productivity and reduced office overheads.
In Britain, Digital Equipment, the US computer company, saves Pounds 20m a
year in office costs as a result of introducing flexible working practices
for 2,500 of its 4,000 employees over the last eight years.
This summer it opened a telecentre in Newmarket, the headquarters of its
East Anglian operation, which occupies a tenth as much space as its former
offices in the town. The telecentre will house just nine staff, working in
secretarial or administrative roles. The sales, consulting and customer
service staff work from home, their cars, or occasionally from other Digital
offices.
But Digital believes that the weak state of the property market may prevent
it from disposing of unwanted buildings and so fully realising its planned
cost savings.
After property savings, productivity gains are usually cited as the most
powerful benefit from teleworking. As well as taking less time travelling
and gossiping, staff who work at home are usually found to take less sick
leave. When the City of Los Angeles set up a teleworking project after
January's earthquake, it found that the staff involved were 12.5 per cent
more productive than they had been previously.
But productivity claims should be treated with caution. Ursula Huws, the
author of the Department of Employment's report on teleworking, points out
that teleworkers are selected because they are trained, responsible and
productive. 'Having selected those people, it is not surprising they are
more productive,' she says.
The financial and productivity gains from teleworking are tempered by
obstacles such as the risk of diluting the company's corporate identity in
the eyes of employees and customers, senior managers' mistrust of
technology, and concern about the security risks arising from the
transmission of confidential files.
But perhaps the greatest problem concerns the management of teleworkers.
This difficulty is most acute for managers who are accustomed to monitoring
their staff closely, rather than setting targets and monitoring results.
This issue was highlighted in a recent report by the Conference Board, a New
York-based business membership organisation, which found that teleworking
had been adopted by only 1 per cent of the employees working for companies
that offered schemes involving it. Some 75 per cent of the companies
surveyed said the greatest hurdle in a teleworking programme was convincing
managers that employees can be productive and properly supervised when they
work from home.
The low take-up of teleworking in companies with teleworking schemes also
points to some ambivalence on the part of staff.
In some instances, teleworking has brought employees considerable benefits.
One case in point is John Ruscoe, a 42-year-old programmer working for ICL,
who now lives on a farm on Orkney, off the north coast of Scotland. The
teleworking option, which has been embraced by 300 of ICL's staff, allowed
him to abandon his 90-minute-long commute from his previous home to
Manchester each day. 'I seem to have the best of both worlds,' he says. 'I
earn a Manchester salary and live in a nice, rural environment.'
Many individuals with young children are also grateful for the opportunity
to work from home, although they are unanimous that it is not a substitute
for child care.
Yet teleworking does not always work out well for the employees. A report by
the Science Policy Research Unit into teleworking last year chronicled
numerous problems, including isolation, family strife and the feeling that
home is no longer a refuge from the office. 'Unless you are physically out
of the house, you haven't left work,' said one interviewee.
The experience of teleworkers depends largely on the way they are treated by
their employers, according to Huws. She believes that middle managers or
professionals who are highly valued by their employers often enjoy
teleworking because they continue to feel integrated into the corporate
culture. Less privileged workers doing relatively low-grade jobs often
suffer from isolation.
Even those employees who embark on teleworking often find it is not for
them. Hodson has found that after a few months of a teleworking experiment,
more than half of those who volunteer for the scheme are likely to want to
return to the office.
A teleworker's potential problems are numerous, including loneliness,
distractions from neighbours and family, fear of missing out on promotion
opportunities and lack of self-discipline.
These difficulties suggest that companies wishing to make teleworking
compulsory will meet resistance from their workforce. Even enthusiasts often
find they want to return to the office at some stage, for instance when
their children have grown up. 'There are stages in peoples' lives when it
suits people to work from home but very few people want to do it all their
lives,' says Huws.
The problems experienced by teleworkers can often be overcome by encouraging
them to come into the office regularly to keep in touch with other staff;
this was one of FI's early discoveries. 'It is a vital part of flexible
working to have a social centre', says Stephen Jupp, a consultant at
Digital.
Teleworking schemes that require staff to work in isolation need
sophisticated management if they are to retain employees and increase the
employer's competitiveness.
'There are virtually no technological barriers, no legal barriers, no cost
barriers to having people working from home,' says Huws. 'The barriers are
human ones.'

FT  05 SEP 94 / Bankers take a hard look at Ucatt account
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the concerns of trade union leaders this week will be Ucatt, the
construction union which has been living beyond its means for years.
Financial observers say that if it had been a private company it would have
gone into liquidation long ago. The union has been struggling all year to
sort out its finances amid persistent but erroneous rumours that it was
bankrupt.
In July the union reported it was spending Pounds 10,000 over its Pounds
1.4m overdraft facility with Unity Trust Bank, which is closely monitoring
its cashflow on a monthly basis. The Pounds 48,000 of monthly union staff
salaries were as much as the size of its bank charges.
An internal report earlier this year by the union's accountants HW Fisher
argued bluntly that Ucatt's structure was large enough to cover a membership
of more than 250,000 while the total was down to 135,000 with only 74,000
paying full subscriptions.
It suggested the union should consider whether it needed any regional
offices at all, and be concerned at the 'low level of paying members' as
well as their recruitment into membership. Ucatt forecast a 10 per cent drop
in membership level this year.
The original rescue plan for Ucatt proposed savings of Pounds 600,000 from
staff redundancies, the sale of Pounds 650,000 of union properties and
increasing membership subscriptions in 1995 generating an extra Pounds
240,000 inflow.
The bank's own accountants, KPMG Peat Marwick, also carried out a study of
Ucatt's finances that suggested the measures proposed in the original rescue
plan would 'not lead to the union generating net positive cashflows until
1995'.
The report warned that Ucatt's business plan would mean its borrowing would
need to exceed its existing financial facilities with the bank by as much as
Pounds 800,000.
It said: 'During this period the security available to the bank diminishes.
If the cash contingencies are included in the forecasts the deficit between
borrowings, facility and available security are exacerbated.'
KPMG concluded that: 'Unity Trust Bank is being asked to significantly
increase its exposure to political loss. Viewed from a purely commercial
perspective there is a very strong argument for the bank declining to
provide any additional facility over and above that currently available. If
such a decision were taken the ability of the union to continue in its
current form is very doubtful.'
The report recommended that a Pounds 200,000 cash contingency would have to
be built into the union's assumptions both this year and next 'in view of
the various uncertainties surrounding the achievement of the surplus'.
A Ucatt spokesman said yesterday that the union was working effectively to
repair its financial position.
Yet the saving of Ucatt may well depend on a rapid takeover of its
engagements by the TGWU, which itself has gone through a radical
restructuring with the help of the bank.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Merseyside profit 'declines 18.1%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The operating profit of Merseyside's top 100 companies, based on accounts
filed in 1993-94, fell 18.1 per cent to Pounds 569m from Pounds 695m as they
fought for business in the recession.
Merseyside plc, an aggregate analysis by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick of
the area's biggest businesses, says the fall in operating profit occurred in
spite of a 3.1 per cent rise in turnover, indicating a significant squeeze
on margins.
This, it says, is likely to be due to companies being unable to pass cost
increases to consumers in full and new business being won at lower margins.
It notes, however, that Pilkington, the glass maker, accounted for 71 per
cent of the operating profits fall.
An increase in non-trading income and reduced interest charges contained the
fall in pre-tax profits - down to Pounds 461m from Pounds 543m - to 15 per
cent. Turnover rose to Pounds 14,779m from Pounds 14,338m.
The businesses on which the analysis is based include plcs and private
companies.
The survey, compiled as a barometer of the area's economic health, says the
pressure on margins has encouraged managements to review productivity,
resulting in enhanced competitiveness and high capital investment.
KPMG says this trend, with Merseyside's recently declared eligibility for
European Union Objective 1 funds, supports the view that the tide is turning
for Merseyside.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Monks speaks out for signal workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's striking signal workers will receive massive support this week
from the Trades Union Congress which opens in Blackpool today. Union leaders
were rallying around the RMT transport union's cause last night.
Mr John Monks, the TUC's general secretary, addressing a thinly-attended
pre-congress meeting, said: 'This is a thoroughly modern strike. It is fully
balloted, fully legal, overwhelmingly supported by signal workers and
strongly supported by the public.
'There are people who are trying to divide congress by saying the RMT's
strike is a throwback to old-fashioned trade unionism and at odds with what
the new TUC aims to do. They are wrong.'
He added: 'People who say that strikes like this should be a thing of the
past are right. But that's a message for the government and Railtrack. It is
only a bad employer - in this case backed by a hostile government - who
can't settle differences with their employees by negotiating fairly and
openly.
'The new TUC does not stand for cosying up to employers,' he said. 'It
stands for confronting employers with ideas and debate. But at the end of
the day where unions have strong muscle we will support them.'
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, told the rally that Mr Robert
Horton, the Railtrack chairman, should stop his 'macho games'. 'Give us a
proper acceptable interim offer. Then we'll discuss the future,' he said.
Mr Knapp added that government ministers should get their 'fingers out of
the pie'. He said: 'Let Railtrack meet us openly and honestly and we'll do a
deal.'
Aslef, the train drivers' union, is to move a motion calling for an
immediate public inquiry by the Health and Safety Commission into the safety
aspects of the dispute. The conflict will be debated by delegates on
Thursday, when the next 24-hour strike by signal workers is to take place.
Mr Horton last night launched a new attack on the RMT for its 'stubborn
resistance' to change, saying the current dispute was not just about a pay
claim but about how a vital industry and its workers tackled change.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Transrail targets smaller loads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The biggest of three British Rail freight companies being prepared for
privatisation launches its operations today with a fresh livery and a new
service to attract smaller loads off the roads.
Transrail, which specialises in the distribution of bulk freight such as
coal, steel and building materials, is creating two 'motorways' to take
loads overnight between London and Scotland and between the north-east of
England and the south-west.
The service, dubbed Enterprise, is expected to be competitive with road
haulage for as little as 50 tonnes. At present the minimum viable load is
about 1,000 tonnes.
Transrail, which is expected to be sold late next year or early in 1996,
expects Enterprise to absorb more than 100,000 lorry journeys in its first
year.
The service will be available between Kent and Aberdeen, guaranteeing the
arrival of overnight loads in Aberdeen by 9am. The second route will run
between Cornwall and Teesside. There will be five hubs where loads can be
delivered or collected.
Each Transrail train carries up to 2,000 tonnes of freight, compared with 25
tonnes on the biggest lorry. The company said it had delivered more than 95
per cent of its loads during the current rail dispute.
Mr Julian Worth, managing director of Transrail, said: 'Enterprise is
carefully targeted at long-distance freight movements within the UK.
'It will exploit the economics of big train operations to provide a
competitive service, offering an attractive alternative to the congested
motorways.'

FT  05 SEP 94 / Unity required in tough financial times: Robert Taylor
reports on the bank described as the International Monetary Fund of trade
unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unity Trust Bank - founded only 10 years ago - has been described as the
International Monetary Fund of the British trade union movement.
A strictly commercial institution, one of its more unenviable tasks has been
to teach some declining and profligate trade unions harsh financial
realities.
The bank has been preparing rescue operations and giving advice to trade
unions in trouble, showing them how to cut their spending programmes and
improve their finances through tighter internal disciplines.
Few unions have shown much expertise at running themselves efficiently as
businesses. Now all of them are being compelled to seek long-term viability.
Mr Gordon Beesley, the bank's managing director, said: 'Trade unions are by
their nature slow to change.'
Like many commercial institutions, Unity Bank ran into serious trouble in
the early 1990s with bad and doubtful debts in the aftermath of the boom
years.
In 1991 it suffered a Pounds 1.4m operating loss. In the following year it
had to write off Pounds 580,000 in bad debts. Last year it had to take even
more drastic action by writing off a further Pounds 5.72m against earlier
provisions and to make an additional provision of Pounds 1.1m.
Mr Beesley said: 'This was a prudent measure against the expected shortfall
between our customers' debts and the value of the assets offered as security
for their loans.'
But he also pointed out that none of those provisions were due to any
difficulties from the bank's loans to any of its trade union customers. 'It
was the impact of the decrease in property values in respect of security
offered by our corporate customers,' he said.
The bank's president is Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT transport union general
secretary. His union is being drastically restructured as it battles to
match its expenditure with its current income.
He believes that all trade unions and the bulk of their local branches will
eventually bank with Unity.
At present 44 trade unions have invested Pounds 3.5m between them in Unity's
capital and loan stock. More than 12,000 union branches and 46 union head
offices have accounts with the bank. Since its formation Unity has seen its
balance sheet climb from Pounds 16m to Pounds 151m.
Mr Beesley believes Unity will become less of a bank and turn itself into 'a
group of financial service companies' in the next five years. It has already
started to diversify.
Unity has a growing balloting service for unions when they hold strike
ballots and leadership elections. Another part of the group is developing
union membership benefits.
For the past six years it has run an investment management service with more
than Pounds 1bn assets in its care for unions' pension, general and
provident funds in an alliance with Co-operative Bank. At the end of last
year it was managing the funds of 12 clients with assets worth Pounds 95m
between them.
Unity also manages occupational pension schemes. In a joint venture with the
Colonial Mutual group it established Jacques Martin Unity last year to
administer industry-wide pension schemes.
It has been expanding its activities to encourage employee ownership and
share ownership schemes, particularly in employee buy-outs and
privatisation. As much as 73 per cent of Unity's customers are still trade
unions and affiliated organisations and last year they made up 62 per cent
of the bank's customer account liabilities of Pounds 132.3m.
But Mr Beesley says that Unity is widening its customer base outside the
trade unions. 'Our strategic objective is to continue increasing the number
of customers and the value of accounts from the charity and voluntary
sectors,' he said. 'This helps us to meet the community aspirations that
underpinned the setting up of Unity Trust 10 years ago.'

FT  05 SEP 94 / 'Flexible' staff win jobs as cuts bite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Full-time core staff are being increasingly displaced by 'flexible'
employees, including contract workers, according to a joint survey published
today by the Institute of Management and the Manpower, the employment
services company.
The authors said that for the third year running respondents believed the
need to cut costs would be the main factor affecting next year's decisions
on employment levels. The other key factors were the related requirements of
increasing productivity and flexibility.
For the majority of employers, flexible working was now essential.
Eighty-one per cent of respondents used temporary workers, 74 per cent used
part - timers and 70 per cent contracted out non-core operations. More
recent forms of flexible working were less well established: only one in
five respondents used teleworkers or home workers.
Few employers predicted a return to traditional patterns of full-time core
employment. The trend to contracting-out continued, with two-thirds of large
employers expecting to contract-out more work in the next year, particularly
in facilities management, driving-distribution and data preparation.
Among remaining core staff, work patterns would also continue to change,
with increases in part-time working and work-sharing.
The only departure from trends noted in previous years was in the use of
older workers. In previous surveys, this was the least-favoured type of
employee.
Three-quarters of the 186 respondents in this year's survey, all of which
are members of the Institute of Management, said that greater use of older
workers and of flexible retirement were top priorities.
The authors said the reasons for the shift were unclear but 'employers may
only now be realising that they have lost valuable experience and skills
through focusing redundancy programmes on older workers'.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Revenue plan on personal files sparks alarm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue plans to merge its five computer systems and allow more
of its staff to gain access to taxpayers' personal records. The moves have
sparked concern among civil liberties campaigners.
The Revenue is also going to give additional details to the Department of
Social Security about employers who are potentially liable for National
Insurance contributions.
The changes to computer systems come as part of the Revenue's 'change
management' programme, which includes ambitious modernisation of its
computer systems and greater responsiveness to taxpayer demands.
Staff at Revenue tax inquiry offices throughout the country - and others who
answer taxpayer telephone inquiries - will for the first time be able to
gain access to all personal tax information.
The move, which the Revenue says comes in response to a desire from the
public for easier access and quicker resolution of queries, will add to the
number of tax officials able to gain access to personal financial
information.
The Revenue stresses that the officials able to view the information will be
those who already hold sufficiently senior positions to be permitted to
inspect taxpayer returns.
It points out that most of the additional staff able to see taxpayer records
will not be able to amend them, and that details of those inspecting the
information will be logged.
Separately, the Revenue has announced that it will provide the Department of
Social Security with the names and addresses of employers likely to be
liable for payment of Class 1A National Insurance contributions on company
cars and fuel.
Sir George Young, the financial secretary to the Treasury, has approved
changes in the Revenue's powers which will allow it to supply the
information without breaching its confidentiality obligations.
Mr John Wadham, legal director of Liberty, formerly the National Council for
Civil Liberties, said yesterday that he was concerned about the plans.
'There is a problem with more people getting access to records,' he said.
He said that taxpayers should be able to have complete access to any
information in their records held by the Revenue, and stressed the
importance of a system that would log the names of officials who inspected
these records.
He questioned whether it was right for information collected by the Revenue
for one purpose to be allowed to be passed on to another department for a
different purpose.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Support for role of unions grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As many as 89 per cent of people surveyed in an NOP poll commissioned by the
Trades Union Congress believe trade unions 'are necessary to protect
people's interests at work'.
This represents a substantial increase on the 79 per cent who agreed with
that statement last year.
Fifty-eight per cent opposed any further government laws 'to restrict the
powers of the trade unions' with 35 per cent backing that suggestion. The
survey was based on 1,004 interviews by telephone between August 19 and 21.
In a second NOP survey of 500 trade unionists, also commissioned by the TUC,
58 per cent said their job had grown less secure in the last two years and
42 per cent said they were being treated worse by their employer than two
years ago.
However, 62 per cent of the trade unionists said their colleagues were
'fairly well' treated by their employer and 12 per cent 'very well' treated.
The trade unionists' poll found considerable support for the TUC's new
campaign agenda.
Ninety-two per cent believed the TUC should invite ministers to debate the
issues and 93 per cent agreed the TUC needed to seek support from employers'
organisations.
Fifty-two per cent thought the trade unions should 'make more effort to
influence government policy than they do now' and 86 per cent wanted the TUC
to lobby MPs of all parties.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Electricity industry pay bias criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unison, the public services union, has found widespread pay discrimination
among workers in the privatised electricity supply industry, it said
yesterday.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, the general secretary, said equal pay cases launched by
the union had won pay rises of up to Pounds 2,000 for 10,500 members, most
of them women.
Unison said that the electricity supply industry was the first sector to be
persuaded to introduce pay equity by a union strategy of legal action and
pay bargaining.
The rises covered clerical and sales staff working for 11 of the 19
electricity supply companies. About 20,000 staff are expected to be
affected.
The union's campaign compared jobs often done by women - such as
telephonist, word-processor operator, accounts clerk and sales - with jobs
often done by men - such as storekeeping and meter-reading. In 1990-91
differences between grades ranged from Pounds 709 to Pounds 2,663 a year.
The union said the mental effort and communication skills in clerical jobs
were comparable with the physical effort and working conditions of manual
jobs.
Electricity supply companies have conceded the union claim in a series of
cases taken to industrial tribunals, producing Pounds 70,000 in back pay for
applicants. In the move from national to company bargaining, the union has
also negotiated new grading structures to give clerical workers equal pay
with manual workers.
'It is disgraceful that women workers continue to be exploited nearly two
decades after the equal pay laws were introduced,' Mr Jinkinson said.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Spending urged to cut crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The enormous financial costs of crime make a convincing case for more
investment in its prevention, says the national crime prevention
organisation Crime Concern in a report today.
It says that although crime is a significant drain on individual, public and
corporate resources, little information is available about its impact in a
number of economic sectors.
The report says the full cost of crime is difficult to quantify since much
of it is not reported to the police.
A CBI/Crime Concern working party estimated the loss to business from crime
to be between Pounds 5bn and Pounds 10bn a year.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Poverty survey finds gap widening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poverty in Britain's cities has become increasingly concentrated in small
pockets of deprivation, two reports published today by the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation say.
The social research organisation says that the gap between the richest and
poorest neighbourhoods in cities widened between 1981 and 1991.
Most cities have areas where low incomes, unemployment and low levels of car
and home ownership are becoming the norm. These are often close to more
prosperous areas where people own their own homes and many households have
two incomes and two cars.
The areas of intense poverty are mostly in the northern cities and inner
London, according to an analysis of data in the 1991 census. But less
localised poverty is spread over most old industrial areas such as the south
Wales valleys, northern England and central Scotland.
Ethnic minorities are especially likely to live in high-poverty
neighbourhoods.
Pockets of wealth are found throughout Britain, with the greatest
concentration of prosperous neighbourhoods in the south-east.
A second report, comparing Oxford and Oldham, says that even prosperous
cities like Oxford have council estates with marked levels of poverty.
A quarter of the population of both towns receive means-tested benefits to
top up their income. The number of low-income families grew rapidly between
1991 and 1993.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Summer hiatus keeps the pressure off wage rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pay pressures remain weak, with the median 2.5 per cent plateau in basic
rises recorded earlier in the year holding steady, according to Industrial
Relations Services, the independent pay analysts.
IRS said the summer months were traditionally quiet for pay negotiations and
it was not surprising that an initial analysis of settlements for the three
months to the end of July showed no movement in the 2.5 per cent median rise
for the June quarter. This was the sixth consecutive month for the figure.
Half of the 95 basic pay awards monitored by IRS between May and July
increased rates by between 2 per cent and 3 per cent, but nearly two-thirds
of bargaining groups secured higher settlements than a year ago. Only a
fifth were lower.
But IRS warns there are tentative signs that this prolonged period of
stability may not continue. Pay awards monitored most recently by IRS - with
a number of influential settlements at 3 per cent, including Vauxhall Motors
in the second stage of a two-year deal - pointed to a gradual drift upwards
in basic rises in the autumn.

FT  05 SEP 94 / IoD warns on interest rate increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A warning that higher interest rates will damage economic growth was sounded
by the Institute of Directors yesterday in advance of Wednesday's monthly
economic meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie
George, governor of the Bank of England.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, the director-general of the institute, said that its
bi-monthly business opinion survey revealed continued uncertainty among
members although the economy was growing quite strongly.
He said: 'With inflation at such low levels, there is no case at present for
a damaging increase in interest rates.'
Summer speculation about an early interest rate rise abated after the
announcement of a fall in the underlying rate of inflation from 2.4 per cent
in June to 2.2 per cent in July.
Although the Bank of England has warned that the government's targets for
reducing underlying inflation would be at risk without a base rate increase
in the next few months, analysts do not expect this week's meeting to lead
to an immediate change.
Mr Melville-Ross said there were few signs of higher inflation in the
pipeline and if exports, rather than consumer spending, continued to provide
the impetus for economic growth 'it could be next year before the situation
warrants a base rate rise'.
The survey found 76 per cent of directors saying that their companies were
doing well or very well. This was down slightly from 79 per cent in June.
There were falls in the proportion reporting improved volume and profit.
These were from 70 per cent in June to 63 per cent in August for volume, and
from 62 per cent to 54 per cent for profit.
The share of respondents feeling more optimistic about the economy nudged up
from 44 per cent to 46 per cent.
Signs of economic growth were given as the main cause of optimism, while
political uncertainty was the biggest inhibiting factor.
The Finance &amp; Leasing Association says heavy discounting in the summer sales
produced a slackening of consumer credit in July.
The association says in its monthly consumer credit and business finance
report that although consumers used credit in the sales, it was to buy
heavily discounted items.
As a result, consumer credit of Pounds 1.276bn in July was 7 per cent down
from June. Although the association's July figure represents a 28 per cent
year-on-year increase it was the lowest annual rise since October.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Record complaints about doctors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Official complaints about doctors are at record levels and the number of
doctors struck off has jumped sharply, the General Medical Council's annual
report shows.
There were 1,615 complaints in 1992-93, a rise of 24 per cent, and 286 were
acted on compared with 216 in the previous year. A total of 162 cases were
referred to the council's professional conduct committee, which rules on the
most serious cases, and 55 doctors appeared before the committee, up from
43. Thirty doctors were struck off compared with four in the previous year.
The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said the rise did
not necessarily mean standards were falling.
It said: 'Since the publication of the Patient's Charter and various
government targets there's no doubt patient expectations have increased
enormously.
'Patient awareness of complaints procedures has also increased.'

FT  05 SEP 94 / Call for action on NHS dentistry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government must act now to prevent National Health Service dentistry
disappearing completely, Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said
yesterday.
'In many parts of the country new patients find it impossible to get an NHS
dentist, and it will be a lot harder to find one in the future,' he said.
His comments followed a survey that found three out of four dentists were
prepared to leave the NHS. The survey - produced jointly by Denplan, which
runs a private dental scheme, and the Observer newspaper  - says 85 per cent
of dentists were unlikely to take on any new adult NHS patients this year.
Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, said the government's figures
showed a growth in the number of registered dental patients.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Growth forecast in airport retailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail sales at UK airports are expected to total Pounds 600m this year  -
50 per cent more than in 1990 - making airports one of the fastest-growing
retailing sectors, says a report by Corporate Intelligence, the retail
research group, Neil Buckley writes.
The report says that airport retailing has grown at three times the rate of
high-street sales. Seven airports owned by BAA, the privatised airport
authority, account for 80 per cent of the total, and BAA makes more from
retailing than from aircraft landing charges.
However, 60 other UK airports have scheduled services, indicating the huge
growth potential for airport retailing. The report says that the large
number of passengers passing through airports, who are 'captive' and often
in holiday mood, means shops at Heathrow and Gatwick enjoy annual average
sales densities of more than Pounds 1,500 per sq ft - three or four times
the average for high-street shops.
Several retailers, including Bally and Laura Ashley, enjoy their highest
sales per square foot of any UK outlets in their airport stores.
The report says that well-known names such as Harrods and Hamleys have
opened airport outlets, while many niche retailers are basing their
expansion strategies around airports.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Call to reform market franchises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Association of British Market Authorities is expected to call
for the government to put forward new plans to reform market franchise
rights at its annual conference in Llandudno, north Wales, today.
The association, a group of 135 local authorities, is proposing a system of
local authority registration or licensing of all commercial markets,
including car boot sales.
It will today debate a resolution recognising the need for market franchise
rights to be reviewed and calling for the Department of the Environment to
start consultations for new legislation. The group spearheaded the
successful campaign to persuade the government to withdraw clauses in its
deregulation bill abolishing the existing market franchise rights. Under
centuries-old laws these allow many local authorities to control street
market trading.
The association joined forces earlier this year with eight other
organisations, including the Association of British Chambers of Commerce,
the Federation of Small Businesses and the National Market Traders'
Federation to form an umbrella group, the Campaign for Quality Markets.
Campaign members say abolishing the ancient rights would lead to an
explosion of car boot sales and unauthorised markets.
The government says the rules are anachronistic and are misused by some
councils to stifle business initiatives.
The association says, however, that the government has failed in its pledge
to bring forward proposals to reform market franchise rights, which the
association admits contain many anomalies and need updating.
It is worried that the government will try to reintroduce clauses abolishing
the rights into the deregulation bill when it continues its passage through
parliament.
Mr Brian Ormshaw, secretary of the association, said it was ready to rally
cross-party support for its campaign in the autumn. 'The present law needs
to be reviewed but market franchise rights are crucial in protecting the
health of town centres and in preventing crime - both objectives which are
supposed to be dear to the government's heart.'

FT  05 SEP 94 / Security issue fraught with dangers: Bruce Clark reports on
the risks of altering the police and army presence in Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In security matters, as in all Northern Irish matters, the British
government is treading a tightrope, with the demons of renewed war gnashing
all too visibly on either side.
As each community looks to see what it has lost or gained at the expense of
the other, people are watching for any changes in the numbers and tactics of
the 30,000 people who serve the British authorities as soldiers and police
officers.
Any hint of over-hasty 'demilitarisation' will be treated by Protestants as
confirmation that last week's IRA ceasefire was either the product of a
deal, or else the harbinger of a deal, from which they have been excluded.
For the Roman Catholic ghettos some scaling down of the police and army
presence could provide a first answer to the question that Sinn Fein leaders
were doggedly asked by their supporters last week: 'What have we got?'
The worriers of each community are haunted by the ghosts of slain comrades,
and the prospect that those deaths could go unvindicated.
In this climate there is such a danger of 'sending the wrong signal' that
the army and police have maintained an unusual public silence.
Sir Hugh Annesley, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, gave
some hints about future tactics in July. Choosing his words carefully he
said his 8,500 men carried out their duties in response to the level of
threat that existed. If the threat in a particular district subsided there
could be a reduction in police patrols and an end to the army's role in
supporting those patrols.
Sir Hugh made clear that if violence ended there would be no need to renew
the Emergency Provisions Act, which gives the security forces extra freedom
to search homes, vehicles and persons.
Other tokens of demilitarisation demanded by nationalists included the
opening of remote border roads, and an end to low-flying helicopters.
The closure of roads reflected evidence that most incidents in border areas
were made possible by the movement of men and weaponry across the frontier,
and low-flying was made necessary by the danger of any other form of
transport.
Apart from the police about 19,000 people from the regular armed forces are
deployed in Northern Ireland. They include six battalions on two-year tours,
another six on gruelling 'emergency tours' lasting half a year, plus about
5,500 members of the Royal Irish Regiment, which is locally recruited but
part of the regular army. If tension eased substantially one of the first
options for the army would be the ending of emergency tours, which have
strained the country's defence capacity.
Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, issued an uncompromising statement
last week to the effect that the 'forces of the Crown' were unacceptable to
his community and should be withdrawn. But it seems unlikely that the IRA
would have agreed to a ceasefire unless it had some faith in the capacity
and willingness of UK forces to restrain the activities of loyalist gunmen.
The real test for British policy could come where locally recruited security
forces, who are overwhelmingly Protestant, found that their efforts were
almost entirely employed against gunmen from their own community.
It is an article of nationalist faith that these local forces - the police
and the RIR - are at best soft on and at worstsympathetic to loyalist
paramilitaries.
Yet RUC men have been prepared in recent years to risk the opprobrium of
their hardline co-religionists. They have incurred loyalist wrath for their
tough policing of Protestant demonstrations against the 'treachery' of
Britain.
In Belfast, in particular, the police have tended to form a community within
a community with their own sports and social clubs and even housing
developments.
That said, nobody would expect the local security forces to react with
equanimity if they felt the province was being dragooned into a united
Ireland, without consent and at an uncontrollable pace.
Northern Ireland would be entering dangerous and unchartered waters if, as a
result of change in the political situation, the authorities abruptly laid
off large numbers of local policemen and soldiers or asked them to serve an
entirely new set of political masters - including, as many servicemen would
see it, the men responsible for killing hundreds of their colleagues.
The security business - including the RIR, the territorial army, the police
and private security - has become an increasingly important source of
employment for a Protestant community whose old workplaces - the shipyards
and engineering works - have shrunk or vanished.
Service to the Crown has been a talisman of Protestant identity for
centuries. If Protestants are dazed and apprehensive now it is because they
cannot understand why Britain does not show gratitude for their forebears'
sacrifice in countless wars.
The RIR, for example, regards itself as a successor to Irish regiments that
fought in the West Indies in 1762, the Cape of Good Hope in 1806, the
Crimean War half a century later and the Boer War at the beginning of this
century.
For other English-speaking countries - Australia, Canada, even southern
Ireland - the appalling casualties of the first world war were part of a
coming of age, a growing away from England.
For tens of thousands of Ulster families who were bereaved by the Battle of
the Somme in 1916 their sacrifice left a debt which Britain can never fully
repay.
When Britain considers what to do with the 15,000 Ulstermen currently in its
service, and the hundreds of thousands who have worn British uniforms in the
past, it will have to tread very softly indeed, for it is treading on the
most cherished of dreams.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Writ names Saunders as marketing adviser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ernest Saunders is back in business as a marketing consultant.
Just over three years after the former Guinness chief executive was released
on parole for his part in the Guinness affair, having told a Court of Appeal
that he was suffering from pre-senile dementia, resembling Alzheimer's
disease, he has been named on a writ as marketing adviser to a troubled
publishing venture.
He is being sued in a legal battle between the two partners in a joint
venture called Retail Revolution, which planned to launch 30 magazines to be
sold exclusively through petrol stations.
Retail Revolution was set up by Mr David Elias, the multi-millionaire owner
of Harpur, a finance group, and Mr Richard Desmond, chairman of Northern and
Shell, which owns a range of magazines including Penthouse.
Mr Saunders is named as one of nine defendants in a writ issued by Mr
Desmond's company, St Alban's Investments. The former Guinness executive was
hired by Mr Elias as a marketing consultant for the venture. The other
defendants include Mr Elias and his company, the Richbell Group.
The writ, issued by St Alban's last month, alleges that it was excluded from
the management of the affairs of the joint venture and that money was spent
on the venture without its authority. The total damages sought are thought
to total about Pounds 1.39m.
Mr Elias responded a few days later by issuing a writ against Mr Desmond and
Northern and Shell claiming breaches of the joint venture agreement.
Retail Revolution had planned to publish 30 magazines this month - the
largest number of titles ever launched by a single publisher in the UK.
The planned titles, to have been produced by Northern and Shell, included
Bodytalk, a health magazine, Megaboobs, an adult magazine and Brainbox, a
puzzle publication.
The venture aimed to sell the magazines through 4,500 petrol stations rather
than traditional newsagents to achieve substantial savings in distribution
costs. Harpur has a relationship with these stations as a supplier of fuel
credit cards.
Retail Revolution is still technically in operation as a company but
Northern and Shell has terminated its involvement in the venture and refused
to resume its supply of magazines.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Computer spending 'grows 15%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK companies have increased their spending on computer systems far beyond
corporate projections of a year ago, says the annual Price Waterhouse
information technology review. The development is a further reflection of
rising business investment confidence.
The review, based on a survey of 1,000 information technology executives,
indicates that IT spending rose 15 per cent last year across the corporate
sector, a sharp increase given the low inflation rate. At the beginning of
1993 executives were predicting a rise of only 0.2 per cent.
Executives projected that their IT spending would fall 2.6 per cent this
year, however. This raises doubts about the sustainability of the investment
recovery, although Price Waterhouse notes that in recent years 'the panel
has consistently underestimated the coming year's growth'.
The mainly privatised utilities led the corporate sector last year,
increasing their IT budgets by 15 per cent. They were followed by retailers
(11 per cent) and financial services (11 per cent). The largest increases
came in central and local government, where IT spending rose 20 per cent.
The survey found IT spending to be closely tied to restructuring. Two-thirds
of organisations claimed to have programmes in place, and 28 per cent of IT
executives said they were themselves the 'main architect' of change in their
organisation.
The survey reflects the marked trend away from mainframe-based systems to
new designs based on networks of personal computers and mid-range machines
called 'servers', with 58 per cent of organisations claiming to have some
form of client-server network.
Other new technologies popular with the executives included document image
processing, which was planned for introduction by half of the organisations,
and new telecommunications services such as wireless or cable, planned by 46
per cent.
The survey found telecoms costs down 9 per cent from 1992 in response to
competition in the business market.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Adams preaches to the unconverted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Northern Ireland megaphone diplomacy has often been blamed for
exacerbating tensions between the two communities. Mr Gerry Adams, president
of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, yesterday took the art one step
further to try to reassure unionists that they have a role to play in the
peace process,
Speaking to a crowd of republican sympathisers at a rally on Belfast's
predominantly Roman Catholic Falls Road, Mr Adams said he was turning up the
loudspeakers so 'our people on the Shankill can hear'.
Of all the groups mulling over the implications of last week's IRA
'cessation of military operations' the reaction of the people of the
Shankill Road and other so-called 'loyalist' strongholds is vital if a
political settlement is to be found.
In Protestant ghettos such as Blackstaff, where unemployment is as high as
80 per cent according to local community leaders, there is deep scepticism.
There is also a resentment that the republicans have not so much seized the
opportunity for peace, but won a public relations victory.
One man said: 'Why do the republicans have to be so cocky, marching in front
of the RUC barracks and writing 'go home' on the wall. This isn't Berlin.'
On the first Sunday after the ceasefire the churchgoing community was
striving for a reconciliation.
Catholics gathering in St Peter's Church near the infamous Divis Flats, one
of the most blighted inner-city areas, heard Monsignor Thomas Toner warn
that peace is 'not just the cessation of military operations. Peace is a
process that only begins with the cessation of military operations'.
Before the service he said: 'It's not going to be the catwalk that some
people think it is. But if the peace brings jobs there can be a real
regeneration. If those hopes are dashed there can be an awful depression.'
Last night, amid renewed speculation that the Ulster Volunteer Force, the
largest of the loyalist paramilitary organisations, may also be preparing
for a ceasefire the mood in the city was one of expectation.
Mr Tom Hartley, Sinn Fein general secretary, said as the rally rounded
Springfield Road, site of numerous killings: 'There's uncertainty for them,
but there's uncertainty for us too.'
One Catholic pointed to people waving the Irish flag in front of a police
station, a sight which a few years ago would have prompted a security
clampdown. He said: 'People sometimes forget what the tricolour actually
means. The green is for the republicans, the orange is the Protestants and
the white is the open ground between us. We're not going to ram anything
down their throats, but we're not going backwards, everything's changed
now.'

FT  05 SEP 94 / Crime prevention investment urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The enormous financial costs of crime make a convincing case for more
investment in its prevention, says the national crime prevention
organisation Crime Concern in a report today.
Crime Concern points out that although crime was a significant drain on
individual, public and corporate resources, little information was available
about its impact in a number of economic sectors.
The report was commissioned by the Thames Valley Partnership, which was set
up last year to achieve a united approach to tackling crime in Berkshire,
Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire.
It says the full cost of crime is difficult to quantify because much of it
is not reported to the police. But running the criminal justice system cost
Pounds 9bn in 1991-92, while a CBI/Crime Concern working party estimated the
loss to business to be between Pounds 5bn and Pounds 10bn a year.
Recorded crime statistics showed that direct losses from burglary exceeded
Pounds 1bn.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Merseyside profit 'declines 18.1%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The operating profit of Merseyside's top 100 companies, based on accounts
filed in 1993-94, fell 18.1 per cent to Pounds 569m from Pounds 695m as they
fought for business in the recession.
Merseyside plc, an aggregate analysis by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick of
the area's biggest businesses, says the fall in operating profit occurred in
spite of a 3.1 per cent rise in turnover, indicating a significant squeeze
on margins.
This, it says, is likely to be due to companies being unable to pass cost
increases to consumers in full and new business being won at lower margins.
It notes, however, that Pilkington, the glass maker, accounted for 71 per
cent of the operating profits fall.
An increase in non-trading income and reduced interest charges contained the
fall in pre-tax profits - down to Pounds 461m from Pounds 543m - to 15 per
cent.
The businesses on which the analysis is based include plcs and private
companies.
The survey, compiled as a barometer of the area's economic health, says the
pressure on margins has encouraged managements to review productivity,
resulting in enhanced competitiveness and high capital investment.
KPMG says this trend, with Merseyside's recently declared eligibility for
European Union Objective 1 funds, supports the view that the tide is turning
for Merseyside.
It expresses concern that long-term investment in fixed assets is being
financed by short-term borrowing. This and the 20 per cent increase in
long-term loans suggest the need for rights issues or business sales in the
current financial year, it says.
After depreciation, net additions to fixed assets totalled Pounds 661m. The
average number of employees fell more than 6 per cent, while pay rose 4 per
cent.
Interest cover fell to 2.9 times from three and return on capital employed
was down to 7 per cent from 8.6 per cent.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Youthful Brazil faces problems of old age: Life expectancy
is rising while the birth rate is continuing to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil looks set to enter the next century with 40m people 'missing'.
According to projections made in the 1970s, its population would reach 212m
by the year 2000. But according to latest predictions, the total will be far
less, probably 172m.
The reasons for the sharp slowdown in population growth are also seen in
other Latin American countries. They include a drastic fall in female
fertility rates, mainly due to increased use of contraceptives and rapid
urbanisation. The consequences, which include an ageing society and serious
strains on social and employment needs, have not yet been addressed.
'It is the population above 65 which will grow the most in the next decades.
Brazil will have to live with this phenomenon, which is well known in
developed countries, without having overcome typical problems related to
under-development,' says demographics professor Jose de Carvalho.
Brazil's population change started in the 1940s. Improved medical and basic
services led to falling mortality rates. Fertility rates remained high until
the end of the 1960s, leading to rapid population growth and a society with
more than half its members under 20 years old.
It also encouraged a belief, still held by many today, that Brazil was
blessed with an eternally young and fast growing population. At the first
international population conference in Bucharest in 1974, Brazil's
population was 100m and expected to double rapidly.
But the female fertility rate - the average number of births per
child-bearing woman - began a startling fall from 5.8 in 1970 to 4.3 in 1975
and 3.6 by 1984. In a recent study of Sao Paulo state, Brazil's richest, the
fertility rate was 2.3, in line with some developed countries.
The fall was partly due to rising education and urbanisation, as families
moved from agricultural to industrial jobs. But the main reason was
increased access to, and demand for, contraception. By 1986, 66 per cent of
women of child-bearing age said they were using some form of contraceptive.
Of these, about 40 per cent had been sterilised and a further 40 per cent
used the pill. By 1990, contraception use had risen to 69 per cent.
These rates are high, considering Brazil is the world's largest Catholic
country with a still conservative church hierachy. Abortion is illegal
unless the woman has been raped or is in medical danger.
Officially, the church promotes the Billings method, which teaches couples
to avoid sex during ovulation. But very few couples obey, suggesting the
church is, unofficially, more liberal than it appears or losing its sway.
Padre Antonio Carlos Frizzo, whose parish is in the poor suburbs of Sao
Paulo, says couples must choose. 'If a couple asked advice on sterilisation,
which is rare, I would take into account their economic situation and number
of children, the love between them and whether another method is possible.
'But the couple must decide, and that's something we should not and cannot
try to stop. And their decision has to be supported, too. This might be
criticised in the Vatican, but we are dealing with people in real
situations,' he says.
The increasing demand for sterilisation has a startling side-effect - it has
helped make Brazil the world leader for caesarian births. These account for
roughly one in three deliveries, about twice the rate for England and Wales.
The reasons are complex. Some women think caesarian section a 'modern' way
to give birth, a view hospitals encourage, while others fear the pain
involved in vaginal deliveries. Another reason is that when giving birth by
caesarian, a woman can request to be sterilised at the same time and the
government pays. Outside pregnancy, women have to pay to be sterilised,
usually at semi-legal clinics.
The declining birth rate will transform Brazil over the coming decades.
Population growth, which in the 1970s was 2.4 per cent, has fallen to 1.9
per cent and is still declining.
Today, 35 per cent of the country's 157m population is under 15 years old.
By 2020, the percentage will have fallen to 24 per cent. By about 2040, with
a rapidly aging society, the population will reach about 220m and stabilise
or even fall.
This prompts the church and other anti-abortion groups to argue that
population control is now obsolete in Brazil, especially given the country's
undeveloped agricultural land. A more stable population will also allow
better government planning. In the past, rapid population growth in cities,
for example, has prevented governments developing long-term urban plans.
But the changes will also provide some sobering challenges. The number of
people of working age is set to grow 2.4 per cent a year for the next
decade, adding to pressures on the economy to create jobs.
The social security system, established when the average age at death was
45, must be reformed to cope with life expectancies of 64 and 69 for men and
women respectively.
The country's under-funded public health system must emphasise preventative
medicine if it is to cope with the increasing demands of an ageing
population. Finally, the growing number of elderly from smaller families
will need extra services.
Unfortunately, Brazil does not seem greatly aware of these challenges.
Because of the government's economic problems, the 1990 census was postponed
to 1991. After further spending cuts, only basic findings are available.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Bhutto defies Islamic protests
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Benazir Bhutto, the Pakistani prime minister, left for Cairo yesterday to
attend the UN population conference, defying intense lobbying by Moslem
activists wanting her to stay at home.
The Pakistani government said Ms Bhutto would play an important role in
presenting Islamic countries' views: 'She will make a very strong statement
in which she will reject proposals that are against Islam and will present
the point of view of the Moslem countries.'
For the past week, Pakistan's well organised Islamic activists have been
worried that international efforts such as the UN conference would impose an
'un-Islamic' agenda around the world. Last week, legislators belonging to
Islamic parties rose in protest during a session of parliament and demanded
that the government boycott the conference.
The protesters believe such issues as sex education, homosexuality, abortion
on demand and pre-marital sex will gain global legitimacy through
recognition in a final conference document.
Some government officials were worried that Islamic groups - many of whom
also oppose Ms Bhutto in the belief that a woman cannot lead an Islamic
country - may try to use the issue to stir opposition against her
government. Last week, a prominent religious scholar was quoted as saying
that if Ms Bhutto went to Cairo, religious parties may support an
anti-government campaign by opposition groups next week.
The debate over Ms Bhutto's Cairo visit has drawn attention to one of the
country's most controversial problems. Many officials believe the 3 per cent
a year population growth has hampered economic growth. High population
growth is also blamed for the government's poor performance in improving
literacy, health and welfare.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Bumper harvest adds to Japan's rice troubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
This summer's hot weather in Japan has brought the best harvest in eight
years. Unlike last year, when the rice harvest index fell to 74 after heavy
summer rains and typhoons, this year's crop is expected to produce an excess
of 1.4m tonnes above projected consumption.
However, this is not entirely good news: the agriculture ministry is
struggling to rid itself of foreign grains left over from this year's
emergency imports. Last year's poor harvest caused a shortage of Japanese
rice in February, triggering panic buying among consumers.
More than 1m tonnes of Thai and Chinese long grain rice, which is unpopular
with consumers, are said to be held in the warehouses of wholesalers and the
government. Some retailers, unable to sell the foreign rice, have been
dumping it in bagfuls in unused fields, and one Buddhist temple in central
Japan has become famous for the many people who come there to feed the
pigeons with long grain rice.
The surplus is expected to remain for several years. In the wake of last
year's poor harvest, the government eased the rice-reduction policy
established in 1971 to prevent an oversupply. As a result, farmers who were
forced to turn their paddies into vegetable and fruit fields have resumed
growing rice.
Another headache for the ministry is the partial opening of the domestic
rice market next year under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade
negotiations. The government will allow imports of up to 4 per cent, or
400,000 tonnes, of the market; this will be raised gradually to 8 per cent
over six years. Moreover, farmers in rice-exporting countries, including the
US and Australia, which supplied the 2.6m tonnes of emergency imports, are
demanding that Japan import the same amount from this year's harvest.
To add to the confusion, the government is trying to revamp the regulated
distribution system by relying more on market forces. Earlier this month, an
advisory council to the ministry proposed that the Staple Food Control Act
be reviewed for the first time in 52 years. While this is expected to
provide consumers with cheaper rice, it could also mean that inefficient
rice farmers and wholesalers will be forced out of business.
The good news for the government stemming from the rice saga may be the
Y155.2bn (Pounds 1.01bn) in profits made by its food agency from selling
foreign rice to distributors at three times the import price. The government
says the profits will be given in subsidies to farmers suffering from last
year's poor harvest.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Nomura chief calls for more open markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's equity markets must be made more open and competitive if the economy
is to recover, Mr Hideo Sakamaki, president of Nomura, Japan's leading
securities company, said at the weekend.
He called on the finance ministry to scrap Japan's 0.3 per cent tax on
securities sales and to admit more banks to the securities business. He also
recommended the dismantling of the cross-shareholdings that bind together
Japan's keiretsu, or corporate families. 'The fewer cross-shareholdings the
better,' he said.
'The Tokyo market must become fully functional as the heart which pumps
blood into the economy,' said Mr Sakamaki.
Japan's equity markets were 'at the development stage' compared to the US
and London, but needed to catch up fast to cope with Japan's transition from
a mixed economy to a free market economy, he argued. 'The Japanese system is
distorted and strained, both in politics and the economy,' said Mr Sakamaki.
Japan's securities industry has been calling for an end to securities sales
tax for years. Demands have intensified recently because of a doubling in
the past year in the value of Japanese shares traded in London, where there
is no such tax.
The finance ministry is unwilling to abolish this source of government
revenue, on the grounds that Japanese share trades are already lightly
taxed. Individual investors, for example, pay no capital gains levy.
Nomura's call for a more open equity market reflects its own confidence in
being able to face increased competition, after a partial recovery from its
dive in profits in the early 1990s.
Smaller brokers do not share this confidence because of their over-reliance
on commission income at a time when the share turnover is low.
The economy was still 'in a tunnel' with no sign of the exit, said Mr
Sakamaki, pessimistic by contrast with the comments on Friday by the
government's Economic Planning Agency that bright signs were gradually
spreading.
Pre-tax profits of Japan's top 400 companies last year were barely above the
level of a decade ago and their return on equity was poor, 2.7 per cent, by
comparison with their US counterparts' 13 per cent, Mr Sakamaki pointed out.
High wage costs were a big factor in this. Japanese costs were so high that
not even a Y100,000bn (Pounds 653bn) increase over their Y191,000bn sales
last year would bring an increase in profits, he predicted.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Nigerian strike crumbling amid union disarray
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The oil workers' strike in Nigeria yesterday appeared to be winding down
further, in the face of the military government's intransigent stand against
it.
One union official said that a decision had been taken at the weekend to
'suspend' the strike, though later another official said a meeting today
would decide the issue.
The strike was launched two months ago by the Pengassan and Nupeng unions to
back a package of demands, including an end to military rule and the release
of Mr Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of last year's annulled election.
But some strikers have already been drifting back to work since General Sani
Abacha, the military ruler, sacked the union leaders last month.
A union spokesman, Mr Arthur Onoviran, said that executives of both unions
met for seven hours on Saturday and decided to suspend the strike. The
decision was made 'in the interest of the suffering masses of Nigeria, the
economy and the oil industry'.
But afterwards Mr Milton Dabibi, secretary-general of the white-collar
Pengassan union said that a meeting would be held today 'to decide whether
or not to suspend the strike'.
In the face of the government's unyielding attitude and the drift back to
work, there appeared to be some disagreement among union leaders over how to
act and how to press their continuing demands.
But with the impact of the strike already waning, it appeared many union
members would be very reluctant to follow any attempt to prolong the
stoppage. Once 'suspended', it will be difficult to resuscitate the strike.
Union officials said they still demanded that the military government
release Mr Abiola from jail and restore democratic institutions that were
swept aside in November. They also want reforms in the state's management of
the oil industry, where under-investment has led to heavy job losses.
During August the strike cut more than a quarter from Nigeria's 2m
barrels-a-day output of crude oil, the country's only major export, and led
to fuel shortages. Most of the lost production was at Shell's onshore
operations, while offshore producers were largely unaffected, with Chevron
raising output 12 per cent, according to industry sources.
The companies said last week production staff were returning to the oil
fields and tanker drivers in Lagos and the south-west had resumed work.
Nigeria's main oil refinery at Port Harcourt was again producing.
The oil workers became isolated in their struggle against Gen Abacha's
regime, which has rejected their demands. Strikes in other sectors of the
economy were shortlived or haphazard, and the movement to end military rule
lacked political leadership, despite strong popular support, especially in
Mr Abiola's native south-west.
The virtual collapse of the strike leaves the government in its strongest
position in several months. Mr Abiola and several of his outspoken
supporters are in jail, a strike in the most important industry appears to
have been broken, the national executive of the oil unions have been
replaced by government nominees and the government has carried the army in
the clampdown against pro-democracy forces.
Without a government in waiting, the oil workers have not been able to
achieve their aims. The strike has shown that an oil industry stoppage is a
powerful weapon but cannot alone bring down a determined regime.
Mr Abiola's future remains in doubt. He has been held since June for
declaring himself president on the anniversary of his unofficial victory in
the 1993 presidential election. He faces charges of treason. Fears about his
health led to repeated demands that he be allowed hospital treatment.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Socialists jettison party dogma: Conference move brings SDP
into line with rightwing coalition partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's two-month-old ruling coalition of left and right was strengthened at
the weekend when Socialist members voted to follow their leader and scrap
their most extreme policies.
The move, agreed at an extraordinary convention of the formerly pacifist
Social Democratic Party on Saturday, is the biggest policy change in the
SDP's history. It bolsters the authority of Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the
pragmatic Socialist prime minister, and removes the biggest risk to the
survival of the originally unstable coalition: a policy split between the
SDP and the conservative Liberal Democratic Party, the largest partner.
The decision angered the SDP's extreme-left minority, which staged
drum-beating demonstrations outside the convention centre and begged Mr
Murayama not to sell out to the LDP. One senior member of the left resigned
and others might follow.
A nearly two-thirds majority of the national convention voted in favour of a
draft policy, accepting the existence of the country's self-defence force -
Japan's military - so long as it was the minimum needed. While a relief to
the government, this is a sign that defence spending could face a further
squeeze in next year's budget.
The party agreed that the US-Japan treaty, under which 24,000 US troops are
based in Japan, must be 'firmly maintained', rather than turned into a mere
friendship treaty, as in its previous policy.
On taking office, Mr Murayama quickly dropped the SDP's traditional
opposition to the US-Japan security treaty and to the existence of Japan's
military. But until Saturday's critical test of his control, it was unclear
whether SDP members would support him or rebel.
Other changes to Socialist dogma included acceptance, for the first time, of
the national flag and national anthem, formerly seen as militarist symbols.
In an important move for energy policy, the SDP dropped its traditional
demand to ban nuclear power and said Japan should continue to use those
nuclear reactors now in operation until new energy sources could be found.
The weekend U-turn means the SDP's official policies are now nearly the same
as those of the LDP, the Socialists' traditional foe for nearly four decades
until last year.
The policy switch is likely to reduce, but not erase, any anxiety in
Washington that the new government will be tempted to downgrade Japan's
strategic links with the US. An element of uncertainty over just how far the
SDP had embraced the US security tie was raised yesterday when Mr Wataru
Kubo, party secretary general, said Japan should reduce and eventually drop
the military aspect of its relations with the US and shift the alliance to a
more internationally-oriented linkage.

China faces a formidable task bringing inflation down to manageable levels
this year and has no chance of achieving its revised target of 13 per cent
for the year, according to western economists in Beijing.
Economists are forecasting retail price rises of 19-20 per cent for the
year, and urban cost of living increases of 22-24 per cent, compared with a
national retail price index rise of 13 per cent in 1993 and cost of living
rise of 19.8 per cent in the major cities.
China's leaders announced last week that fighting inflation would be the
government's main priority for the rest of the year. They also foreshadowed
a slowing of economic reforms such as attempts to rationalise state-owned
enterprises, many of which are virtually bankrupt.
Premier Li Peng, in his work report in March to the National People's
Congress, the Chinese parliament, set 9 per cent as a target for retail
price rises this year, but that figure has since been revised to 13 per
cent.
The government also has little chance of keeping to its economic growth
target of 9 per cent for the year. Economists expect real GDP growth to
average 11.5 per cent this year.
Fears of social unrest fuelled by rising prices and lay-offs from state
factories prompted a high-level review of economic strategy. Thousands of
workers have either lost their jobs or are living on subsistence wages
following the imposition of a credit squeeze last year.
Chinese leaders have been walking a tightrope in their efforts to maintain
high rates of economic growth to absorb the unemployed, while at the same
time seeking to keep inflation in check by restraining growth in money
supply and tightening credit.
Resurgent inflation in June and July pushed the leadership into more
decisive measures, including a freeze on price increases on services such as
transport and electricity for the rest of the year. Local leaderships were
put on notice that they would be held responsible for discouraging price
rises.
'The ability of local governments to control the retail price index and
consumer price index will be used to assess their achievements and will be
made public every month,' said a circular by the State Council, the cabinet,
published by People's Daily, the communist party newspaper.
According to a survey of price movements this year conducted by a western
embassy in Beijing, the monthly inflation rate in June and July picked up to
more than 3 per cent compared with a slowing in the rate of increase in
previous months to 1 per cent.
In July, the national retail price index was 21.4 per cent higher than a
year earlier, while the urban cost of living was 24 per cent higher.
Annualised retail prices in the first seven months of this year rose by 20
per cent. In major cities the rate of inflation exceeded 25 per cent.
Western economists attributed the reversal of inflation trends in June and
July to an easing of credit in the second quarter in response to a clamour
for assistance from failing state enterprises.
Credit and deposit balances of the banks increased in May-June and the money
supply expanded. At the end of June the amount of money in circulation was
19 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year.
Capital spending leapt in July. It was 73 per cent higher than in the same
month last year, and surged by 29 percentage points over June. A binge in
investment in fixed assets last year was one of the main cause of
inflationary pressure that built up through 1993.
Economists doubt that price constraints will be effective over the longer
term. Food price subsidies are regarded as 'short-term palliatives' and ones
that will bring their own problems as they will add to the budget deficit.
Falling producer prices - prices of steel and other raw materials were down
sharply this year - suggest there may be an easing of cost pressures in the
latter part of this year. However, promised wage rises in the second half of
the year will counteract this trend.
Pressures on food prices - the food price index rose by 31.9 in the 12
months to July - are likely to continue. Severe flooding in China's southern
provinces and drought in the north have resulted in major crop losses.
Possible further increases this year in grain prices to improve returns to a
restless peasantry would jeopardise anti-inflation measures.
The government raised the price of grain by more than 50 per cent to
consumers this year, and this was a major cause of the jump in the food
price index.
China's leaders face a testing six months. There are no easy choices as they
seek to balance a commitment to reform with a perceived political need to
check inflation.
Western officials have no doubt that if measures announced this week to
restrain price increases fail, the authorities will resort to more draconian
measures such as a return to rigid price controls on staple commodities.
