FT  05 SEP 94 / Nigerian regime defeats oil workers' strike

The leaders of Nigeria's two oil workers' unions yesterday called off their
two-month-old strike aimed at forcing an end to military rule.
A spokesman for the leaders of the unions Nupeng and Pengassan, who last
month were barred from their posts by military decrees, said they had only
decided to 'suspend' their action 'in the interest of the suffering masses
 .the economy and the oil industry'. However, an attempt to resume the
strike action is almost certainly to fail in the wake of the waning support
among their members, some of whom had already returned to work.
'We have asked all our members to resume work immediately, and from tomorrow
they should all be back to work,' said the spokesman, Mr Arthur Onoviran.
The unions said that they still stood by their demands for the military
government to uphold the undeclared victory of Mr Moshood Abiola in last
year's presidential poll, release him from jail and restore the democratic
institutions that were swept aside in November.
The unions are also demanding reforms in the state's management of the oil
industry, where under-investment has led to heavy job losses.
During August, the strike cut more than a quarter from Nigeria's
2m-barrels-a-day output of crude oil, the country's only major export, and
severely disrupted national fuel distribution. Most of the lost production
was at Shell's onshore operations, while offshore producers were largely
unaffected, with Chevron raising output 12 per cent, according to industry
sources.
The companies said last week that production staff were returning to the oil
fields and that tanker drivers in Lagos and the country's south-west had
resumed work. Nigeria's main oil refinery at Port Harcourt was again
producing, and the fuel depots were open.
The oil workers became isolated in their struggle against General Sani
Abacha's regime, which has rejected demands to hand over to civilian rule
and release Mr Abiola. Strikes in other sectors of the economy were
shortlived or haphazard, and the movement to end military rule lacked
political leadership, despite strong popular support, especially in Mr
Abiola's native south-west.
The end of the strike leaves the government in its strongest position in
several months Mr Abiola and several of his outspoken supporters are in
jail, a strike in the most important industry has been broken, the national
executive of the oil unions has been replaced by government nominees and the
government has carried the army in the clampdown against pro-democracy
forces.
Without a government in waiting - a cohesive political movement to take
control if the government were to fail to rally the strikers during a long
haul - the oil workers could not achieve their aims. The strike has proved
that an oil industry stoppage is a powerful weapon in a long campaign
against a government in Nigeria but alone cannot bring down a determined
regime.
The multinational oil companies successfully replaced strikers at the oil
fields with senior management or expatriates usually employed in other jobs,
and the government was prepared to accept a 25 per cent drop in exports for
the foreseeable future, despite the effect on Nigeria's balance of payments
and the long-term damage to the oil industry's investment and production
capacity caused by the stoppage.
Mr Abiola's future obviously remains in doubt. He has been in detention
since his arrest in June for declaring himself president on the anniversary
of his unofficial victory in the 1993 presidential election. He faces
charges of treason. Fears about Mr Abiola's health led to repeated demands
at the weekend that he be allowed hospital treatment.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Islamic leader offers Algerian truce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contacts between Algeria's military leaders and the outlawed Islamic
Salvation Front appear to have been stepped up following the offer of a
truce by one of the two paramount FIS leaders, Mr Abassi Madani, in a letter
to the head of state, General Liamine Zeroual.
This is the first time an FIS leader has suggested a truce could help create
a climate in which FIS conditions for peace talks could be discussed.
General Zeroual has said he is keen on creating a dialogue among all
Algerian parties which 'reject violence'.
FIS conditions include the release of all members of the its ruling council
held in Algeria and permission for those in exile to return, and the
guarantee that they can meet freely in Algeria with the Islamic Salvation
Army, the FIS armed wing.
According to the Algerian daily newspapers Liberte and El Watan, General
Mohamed Betchine - secretary general of the presidency, former head of
military security and one of General Zeroual's most trusted advisers -
visited Mr Madani in Blida prison a few days ago. There are also persistent
rumours that Mr Jamel Ould Abbas, president of the foreign affairs
commission of the National Transision Council, an body appointed by General
Zeroual earlier this summer, has held meetings with FIS representatives in
Lausanne, Switzerland.
The spokesman for the FIS in exile, Mr Rabah Kebir, recently acknowledged
that a number of their armed supporters in Algeria are moving over to the
much more radical Islamic Armed Group (GIA), which has claimed
responsibility for the killing of most of the 60 foreigners murdered in the
past 12 months. He has warned that the violence in Algeria, which is
claiming an estimated 300 lives every week, is bound, in the absence of a
dialogue, to get worse.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Cuba and US still far apart on ways to halt exodus

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Cuba failed in a third day of talks yesterday to reach an
agreement to halt the exodus of Cuban refugees and the US said 'substantial
gaps' separated the two sides, agencies report from New York.
'The differences are significant,' Mr David Johnson, spokesman for the US
delegation, said after three hours of talks in the office of the US Mission
to the United Nations. Talks will resume today at Cuba's UN mission.
Cuba has been reluctant to agree on measures to stem the exodus of refugees
to Florida unless the talks are widened to include a relaxation of the
32-year-old US economic embargo on the socialist state.
Cuba's chief negotiator at the talks, Mr Ricardo Alarcon, has predicted
little progress until the discussions tackle the economic embargo.
Before yesterday's round of talks began, Mr Alarcon, Cuba's former foreign
minister, insisted that refugees were making the risky crossing of the
Florida Straits in flimsy rafts because of hardship caused by the US
embargo.
The latest flood of Cubans leaving the island began when President Fidel
Castro responded to riots in Havana on August 5 by suggesting that his
government would no longer stop citizens trying to leave. Since then, more
than 28,000 Cubans have tried to reach Florida.
President Bill Clinton has tried to stop the flow of refugees arriving
illegally by barring them from the US and taking them to US naval base at
Guantanamo on the western tip of Cuba. The US has also been seeking other
temporary havens in the region for refugees.
Panama said yesterday it would let the US house up to 10,000 Cuban refugees
in US-controlled territory alongside the Panama Canal.
Panama's Foreign Minister Gabriel Lewis Galindo said the refugees could stay
in four makeshift tent cities being built by the US military.
The US Coast Guard picked up 620 Cubans from rafts at sea by late afternoon
yesterday. Saturday's total was 946, down from nearly 1,300 on Friday.
In the talks in New York, Washington has proposed putting in place an
'expanded, predictable, dependable and legal' migration programme, provided
Cuba takes steps to prevent an illegal, disorganised exodus from the island.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Caracas plan aims to pull inforeign funds

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Venezuelan government moved closer at the weekend to implementing a new
programme designed to stabilise the economy and pull the nation out of its
second year of recession.
President Rafael Caldera and his cabinet approved the programme at a special
cabinet session on Saturday.
However, officials said that details would not be made public until after a
series of meetings to be held with representatives of political parties,
business, organised labour, the Catholic Church and other groups.
The Caldera administration's main goals are to fight inflation by reducing
the fiscal deficit.
A plank of the policy is to attract new foreign investment especially in
petroleum and heavy industry, and to revive the 'strategic role' of the
government in the economy. The government aims to increase workers' real
purchasing power, and provide social welfare benefits to the nation's poor.
The programme is expected to include the following elements:
Fiscal action, such as increasing some direct and indirect taxes, improving
revenue collection at all levels, and reducing allowable deductions for
income taxes.
Staggered increases in retail prices of petrol, which now sells at about the
equivalent of 13 US cents (8p) per US gallon. These price increases will be
accompanied by some type of wage bonus or subsidy to private sector and
government workers.
Replacing zero-coupon bonds, denominated in Venezuelan currency and issued
by the central bank, with US dollar-denominated or dollar-linked instruments
backed by Venezuelan oil. The new instruments, to be purchased only with
Venezuelan currency, will be used to absorb excess liquidity and should cost
the government considerably less than the zero-coupon bonds.
Government financial assistance for small businesses, agriculture and
tourism.
The re-organisation of several ministries.
It was not clear whether the government was planning to include one key
reform, involving changes in the current system of accumulated severance
benefits, in its programme. For years, business in Venezuela has been
seeking changes in the system, which creates heavy liabilities for
employers.
Also, it was not apparent whether the government planned to make any changes
in existing controls on prices and foreign exchange transactions, or whether
it would restore six constitutional rights suspended on June 27.
Under the economic plan, the government hopes to lower inflation from a
projected 60 per cent this year to 25 to 30 per cent in 1995. Inflation last
year was 46 per cent.
For 1995, the administration also hopes to achieve a zero fiscal deficit and
to raise non-oil gross domestic product to a positive 3.9 per cent, compared
to a projected negative 4.3 per cent this year.
President Caldera, who began a five-year term in February, inherited a weak
economy and a financial crisis that forced his government to take over 11
commercial banks and provide financial aid to several others.
The president has repeatedly said that he rejects the free-market economic
policies applied during the previous administration. He has turned to heavy
government intervention to tackle Venezuela's economic and financial
problems.
Despite this position, he is opening the country's oil exploration and
production sectors to major international investment, for the first time
since the petroleum industry was nationalised in 1976.

<TEXT>
Cuba's chief negotiator in the current talks with the US said yesterday that
Washington has taken a rigid stance over possible moves to stop the flight
of Cuban refugees to Florida.
Mr Ricardo Alarcon predicted little progress until the discussions tackle
the US economic embargo of the Caribbean island, agencies report from New
York.
The Cuban former foreign minister insisted that thousands of his
fellow-citizens have recently risked crossing the Florida Straits in flimsy
rafts because of the 30-year embargo by the US against Cuba.
He said on CNN television that Cuba was 'flexible enough' to discuss
attempts to end the exodus when talks resume in New York, which was due to
happen late yesterday.
'But we have to make it very clear,' he went on, 'that, if you want to find
a real resolution to this problem, you cannot ignore the sources' - namely
the economic embargo.
The US negotiators were 'not prepared even to talk about that,' Mr Alarcon
said. 'It's very unfortunate. That means that a real solution cannot be
found.'
The latest flood of Cubans leaving the island began when President Fidel
Castro responded to riots in Havana on August 5 by suggesting that his
government would no longer stop citizens trying to leave.
Since then, more than 28,000 Cubans are believed to have tried to reach
Florida on home-made craft.
The tide of refugees was slowed on Saturday, when 850 people were picked up
by the US Coast Guard. This was down from nearly 1,300 on Friday.
During two days of talks in New York last week, US officials said Washington
had proposed putting in place an 'expanded, predictable, dependable and
legal' migration programme, provided that Havana took steps to prevent an
illegal, dis-organised exodus from the island.
Mr Alarcon was not optimistic about the chances of reaching an agreement
during the talks yesterday, or any time soon. 'I think that there is still a
pretty long road to go before we can finalise a specific agreement. That's
my impression. But it's possible to find one.'
The US state department stated that the US delegation at the talks would
have nothing to say until after the meeting last night.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Colourful recovery in the nation's capital: George Graham
finds Marion Barry running hard to win back the Washington mayoralty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The orange clamp on the rear wheel of Mr Marion Barry's Chrysler New Yorker
car, as he parked outside the offices of the Washington Post last week,
seemed almost the last, desperate effort of the city establishment to stop
his resurrection from drug addiction and prison to become, once again, mayor
of Washington, DC.
With only a week to go before the Democratic party's primary ballot that -
in all likelihood, in this solidly Democratic city - will determine the
winner of the election in November, it will take more than a clamp to stop
Mr Barry.
He was last seen by the world outside Washington in 1990, smoking crack
cocaine on a videotape made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He
served six months in prison for cocaine possession, but returned to win a
seat on the Washington city council and now holds a wafer-thin lead in the
running for the mayoral primary.
A Washington Post poll last week showed him on 34 per cent, against 33 per
cent for Mr John Ray, a dull safe council member, and only 14 per cent for
the incumbent mayor, Mrs Sharon Pratt Kelly, who won the office in 1990,
just after Mr Barry's arrest, with a promise to 'clean house'.
Even six months ago, Mr Barry's comeback seemed unthinkable. But his devoted
supporters have led an unprecedented drive to register new voters in the
city's poorest districts, where the reservoir of sympathy for him is
deepest.
During the last four months, more than 19,000 new voters have registered for
the Democratic primary, half of them east of the Anacostia River in the most
depressed area of Washington.
The national Democratic party is bracing itself for a Barry victory that
seems certain to cause embarrassment.
Six months ago, Mr Tony Coelho, a former congressman who has been drafted as
the party's top strategist, said that, if Mr Barry were to win, 'the
implications are that the comics go wild and the press goes wild.'
Today, Mr Coelho calls the candidate a good role model because of what seems
to be his successful recovery from dependence on drugs and alcohol.
For Mr Barry, a consummate politician, his struggle with addiction is one
more element to be turned to account in his election campaign. His speeches
even echo the 12-step recovery programme of Alcoholics Anonymous.
'I'm in recovery and so is my city,' he said when he announced his
candidacy.
Throughout his long political career, Mr Barry has been adaptable. The son
of a sharecropper in the Mississippi Delta of the far south, he became, in
the 1960s, chairman of the Student Non-violent Co-ordinating Committee, one
of the most potent organisations of the civil rights movement, over the head
of more messianic leaders such as Mr Bob Moses.
In Washington, Mr Barry put on a suit to win a seat on the city school
board. In 1978, he won his first term as mayor with a lot of white votes
from the US capital's opulent north-west.
But, on his return from prison, running in an almost entirely black ward, Mr
Barry adopted the brightly coloured kente cloth and kufi caps which have
become, for many black Americans, an emblem of their African heritage.
Now that he needs votes citywide in his quest for a fourth term as mayor,
the business suits have returned, though flashes of kente still appear. 'I'm
a situationist. I do what is necessary for the situation,' he once said.
Support for Mr Barry in many of the poorer black areas of Washington is
fervent and unquestioning. Many saw his pursuit and eventual arrest by the
FBI as a conspiracy by the white power structure against a powerful black
man.
Many others appear to accept his message of personal redemption, and to be
willing to give him a second chance to recreate the boom years of the 1980s
when he helped to recycle some of the benefits of a thriving local economy
through government jobs and summer work programmes.
Conspiracy theories are not strange in Washington, a 70 per cent black city
which, until it won a limited degree of self-rule 20 years ago, was run by a
congressional committee chaired by such luminaries as Senator Theodore
Bilbo, also from Mississippi but he was a Ku Klux Klansman.
Besides, in a city where, on any given day, sociologists have estimated,
four out of every 10 black men are in prison, on parole, on probation or
wanted by the police, Mr Barry's cocaine conviction may not seem much of a
blemish.
Even so, white voters and many of the wealthier blacks in north-west
Washington are less forgiving. They remember not only the FBI videotape, but
also a Barry administration in which a dozen or more senior officials,
including two of Mr Barry's deputy mayors, were convicted of various degrees
of corruption.
They remember, too, a city government which became an all-purpose jobs
programme, and which, even today, after substantial cuts by Mrs Kelly, has
more people on its payroll than Chicago, a city four times its size.
Whether Mr Barry can win the primary on September 13 depends to a great
extent on the size of the anyone-but-Barry vote.
Mrs Kelly is unlikely to benefit greatly. She spent most of her first two
years as mayor running for some higher national office and started running
the city too late to make much difference. With the city facing a budget
crisis and the corruption-plagued housing department now in the hands of the
courts, anyone-but-Kelly outpolls even anyone-but-Barry.
That leaves Mr Ray - and 58 per cent of his supporters, in the Washington
Post poll, wishing somebody else were running.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Yeltsin seeks to outsmart his nationalist critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The outbreak of fighting in Chechnya appears to mark the start of a new,
violent phase in a Moscow-backed effort to install a non-separatist
government, and to help keep Russia from splintering.
The turbulence comes in Russia's most volatile region, a strip of well-armed
Moslem republics in its south-west Caucasus mountain region. It originated
three years ago, when Mr Dzhokhar Dudayev returned to lead Chechnya after
serving as a general in the Soviet strategic bombing division, and declared
independence from Moscow. He humiliated Mr Yeltsin, who sent in about 500
Russian troops to put down the separatism but quickly had to withdraw when
Mr Dudayev declared war.
The attempt to unseat -Mr Dudayev, however, risks heavy bloodshed in a
republic known for blood feuds and belligerent clans. In oil-rich Chechnya,
high fashion involves variants of 1930s-style gangland pinstripes and
fedoras, and government ministers keep loaded pistols and rifles on their
desks and in concealed holsters.
Mr Yeltsin's open support for Mr Dudayev's opponents is partly a strategy to
pre-empt his own nationalist critics by appearing tough against independence
drives in Russia's restive regions, such as Tatarstan and Bashkiria. He is
also sending a signal that he will no longer tolerate such flagrant
defiance.
Moscow's plans also appear to stand a good chance of backfiring. One of Mr
Yeltsin's greatest political foes, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, has become
Chechnya's most conspicuous opposition leader and may himself take power
there. Mr Khasbulatov was Russia's parliamentary speaker until Mr Yeltsin
ousted him last year in a bloody shootout, and was released from prison in
February. While denying he wants to be Chechnya's president, Mr Khasbulatov
has allied with two of three warlords who have emerged against Mr Dudayev,
and yesterday said he was forming a paramilitary unit to oppose the
republic's president.
The anti-government groups possess enough armour to lend some credibility to
assertions that Moscow has armed the rebels.
Last month Mr Yeltsin sent cash to one of the rebel provinces, Nadterechni,
to make up three years of back pay to pensioners and government employees
that had been withheld by a blockade from Moscow. The windfall significantly
boosted the image of the region's warlord, Mr Umar Avturkhanov, leader of
the rebels' Provisional Council.
This has made Mr Avturkhanov appear to be Moscow's favourite to succeed Mr
Dudayev. But another regional strongman, a 31-year-old former Grozny mayor
named Mr Beslan Gantemirov, is said to control the biggest rebel force,
about 1,000 men in Chechnya's Urusmartanovsky region. Then there is the
third warlord, Mr Ruslan Labazanov, 26, a martial arts specialist who says
he supports Mr Khasbulatov.
Mr Labazanov's political plans are simple: 'If Dudayev does not resign, we
will eliminate him.'

Suzuki Motors of Japan is to add four-wheel-drive cars to the range produced

manufacture deal. The versions of the Suzuki Cultus, currently produced in
two-wheel-drive form, will replace a Subaru Justy model which FHI had
previously shipped from Japan. Sales of the model have already been
discontinued in the domestic market. The two companies agreed in June to
co-operate in developing automatic transmissions, and yesterday's disclosure
prompted speculation that they could move to joint development of cars as

Volkswagen plans to set up a car factory in India, one of the world's
fastest growing vehicle markets. Volkswagen, Europe's biggest and the
world's fourth leading car maker, has selected Indian tractor manufacturing
group Eicher Motors as its partner in conducting a six-month feasibility
study, newspapers reported. The study will help VW decide which models to
launch in India, according to the reports, which quoted VW Asia-Pacific
chairman Martin Posth. Volkswagen's foray into India comes 12 years after it
set up its first Asian joint venture in China. Volkswagen is the latest in a
string of foreign companies to target the Indian car market since the

television advertising campaigns despite the collapse of its share price,
the arrest of its founder and government claims that MMM investment
certificates are little more than 'pretty postcards'. Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, Russia's prime minister, has also instructed state-run media
not to run advertisements by 'organisations attracting investments from
individuals and legal entities in violation of existing laws'. Last week,
the Russian government approved a draft law proposing stiff regulation of
Russia's nascent advertising market. It is not clear whether MMM will be
able to evade government restrictions by limiting its advertising to private
television stations.

<TEXT>
An explosion at a Ukrainian coal mine at the weekend killed 24 miners and
left 15 injured. The mine blast in Slavyavo-Serbskaya, at the heart of
Ukraine's eastern coal belt and just outside the regional capital of
Lugansk, underlined the poor state of the country's coal industry, saddled
with ageing pits and outdated equipment. Investigators have yet to find the
cause, but methane gas was suspected. Accidents are frequent; some four
miners die for every 1m tonnes of coal produced. Last year 212 miners
perished in mine accidents; in 1992, an explosion in the Lugansk region
killed 57 people. Ukraine's mining sector, now propped up by subsidies from
Kiev, needs capital investment and layoffs to prosper in a market economy.
But the Kiev government balks at such moves for fear of upsetting a fragile
stability in the country's mostly Russian-speaking, over-industrialised and
impoverished eastern region.

The leader of a banned Moslem sect in Malaysia has been detained under the
country's tough internal security laws to prevent him 'acting in any manner
prejudicial to the security of Malaysia'. Mr Ashaari Muhammad, head of the
Al Arqam sect, was arrested at the border between Malaysia and Thailand at
the weekend after being deported by Thai authorities. Mr Ashaari, with his
wife, six-month-old daughter and four followers, is being held at an
undisclosed destination under the terms of Malaysia's internal security act,
which allows detention without trial for up to two years. Al Arqam was
banned by the Malaysian authorities last month. The government said the sect
was guilty of deviationist Islamic teachings and described it as the
greatest danger to the country since the communist insurgency. Al Arqam says
it is being victimised because of its growing influence in Malaysia, which
is about 55 per cent Moslem.

The six-year guerrilla war on the Pacific island of Bougainville, controlled
by Papua New Guinea, moved towards peace at the weekend after talks between
Sir Julius Chan, PNG's newly elected prime minister, and Commander General
Sam Kauona, leader of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA). A formal
declaration said PNG troops and BRA rebels would 'maintain static positions'
until a ceasefire was announced this week, when a South Pacific peacekeeping
force would be sent to the island to ensure the truce was honoured.
The Bougainville dispute centres on islanders' demands for self-rule.
Tensions were inflamed in the 1970s and 1980s with the building of the
Panguna copper mine, operated by Australia's CRA. Local landowners claimed
that they did not get enough compensation and that income from the mine was
siphoned back to CRA or the PNG government at the expense of the island's
community.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Support for Sweden's opposition Social Democratic party, favourite to win
the September 18 general election, fell significantly last week according to
an opinion poll published yesterday. But the swing was strongly to the left
and not towards the struggling right-centre government of Prime Minister
Carl Bildt. The poll showed support for the Social Democrats slipping 3.2
percentage points to 47.4 per cent, the first time the party has fallen
below 50 per cent since June. This suggested the Social Democrats would not
win an overall majority.
The shift is likely to unsettle financial markets, which have driven up
long-term interest rates and weakened the Swedish krona because of
uncertainty over the country's budget deficit and fast growing public debt.
Uncertainty over the outcome of referendums in Finland and Sweden on their
applications to join the European Union has also unsettled markets. The left
in Sweden is strongly anti-EU and a poll in Finland on Saturday showed a
strong swing there to the anti-EU camp for the first time in several months.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former
Soviet president, were yesterday locked in a public dispute, the outcome of
which could affect thousands of former property owners in east Germany.
Mr Kohl, who will meet Mr Gorbachev in Bonn on Wednesday, said on German
Radio that Moscow had linked its agreement on the German unification
negotiations to Bonn's acceptance of the legality of the Soviet
administration over eastern Germany between 1945 and 1949. During that time
the Soviet administration expropriated 8.2m acres of land and hundreds of
enterprises. The land was subsequently divided and distributed to ethnic
Germans fleeing eastern Europe.
But last week, Mr Gorbachev, supported yesterday by Mr Eduard Shevardnadze,
former Soviet foreign minister, challenged Mr Kohl, claiming Moscow had
never linked the expropriation issue with Soviet acceptance of unification
talks.
Their reluctance to support Mr Kohl, facing re-election in October for his
fourth term, coincides with claims by former land owners who argue that it
was west and east German politicians, and not Mr Gorbachev, who agreed among
themselves not to give back land to, or compensate, the Prussian
aristocracy.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Chirac appeals for Balladur's loyalty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tension among Gaullist rivals for the French presidency burst into the open
this weekend as Mr Jacques Chirac, the party leader, declared his 'passion'
for the presidential contest due next year and appealed for loyalty from his
former protege, Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, who now far
outstrips him in the opinion polls.
At the annual 'summer university' of young members of the RPR Gaullist
party, at Bordeaux, Mr Chirac's hold on the party machine he has led for 20
years was amply demonstrated by the chants of 'Chi-rac pre-si-dent', and by
the open endorsement he received from Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister,
who is also RPR secretary-general.
But, for the first time, a senior RPR member suggested that the party should
endorse neither Mr Chirac nor fellow-Gaullist Mr Balladur, so as to avoid
being torn apart by their rivalry. In proposing this, Mr Philippe Seguin,
the National Assembly president, who prefers Mr Chirac to the prime
minister, was reported yesterday as having said that such neutrality 'would
not take a single vote away from Chirac'.
In fact, Mr Chirac might gain by not being so tightly wrapped in the RPR
flag as in his past presidential bids, when he failed to win centrist
support. But the more obvious beneficiary of RPR neutrality would be Mr
Balladur, who already has wide appeal for the RPR's coalition partner, the
UDF centre-right federation. This grouping is nominally led by Mr Valery
Giscard d'Estaing, but its biggest component, the Republican Party (PR), now
far prefers the emollient Mr Balladur to the ex-president.
Two PR ministers redoubled their calls over the weekend for a 'unity'
candidate within the majority, by which they mean Mr Balladur. Mr Gerard
Longuet, trade and industry minister, quipped: 'In contrast to the spirit of
the Olympic Games, the important thing is to win, not to participate'. For
his part, Mr Francois Leotard, defence minister, complained of 'snipers
within the (government) majority', perhaps with his foreign ministry
colleague in mind.
Mr Juppe told young Gaullists Mr Chirac 'should lead the way - and he knows
that you will be there, and me with you, to follow him'. He has thus broken
the truce on ministers revealing their presidential preferences. His action
is no surprise, given his RPR post and his feeling of being marginalised
sometimes by Mr Balladur on foreign policy.
Even so, it may bode ill for discipline this autumn in the government and in
parliament, where the RPR leader, Mr Bernard Pons, is urging Mr Chirac to
make his candidacy formal as soon as possible.
Mr Chirac is said not to want to do so before January, knowing Mr Balladur
will make no official move before then. On the other hand, the former
clearly wants to use this autumn to let Mr Balladur know there will be a
fight with his party leader. Mr Chirac is aware the prime minister does not
like open confrontation.
Mr Chirac hinted it was now time for the prime minister to reciprocate past
loyalty. 'For years, I have given Edouard Balladur all my confidence and my
friendship,' he said. After the parliamentary election victory last year,
'to which I ardently contributed, I wanted his nomination to the Matignon
(the premier's office), and I did what was necessary for that.' Concluding
on a note that perhaps stretched his audience's credulity, Mr Chirac said:
'I do not regret it'.

FT  05 SEP 94 / International Press Review: Caution on bridging the divide -
Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY, JOHN BURTON and GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's editorial writers were given a wonderful opportunity to proffer
advice to the British and Irish governments following the IRA's decision to
bring in a ceasefire. After all, Germany actually went through the
experience of unification five years ago. But the commentators opted for
caution.
Perhaps they were reluctant to explain to Dublin how, despite a common
language, German unification has created internal economic, psychological
and social divisions. There was little editorial dissension across the
political spectrum.
The leader writers agreed that the response by the British government to the
ceasefire was crucial for determining the future development of the peace
process. 'The peace prospects now depend on the Unionists and the British
government,' wrote the left-wing Frankfurter Rundschau.
The conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung went further. In its
editorial, the paper blamed the British government for failing to cope with
the IRA, but added that the IRA had failed in its attempts to get London to
stop protecting Northern Ireland. The FAZ returned to the subject a day
later, arguing that 'the IRA has manoeuvred the British government into a
situation of imponderables. London cannot allow the impression to be created
that violence has led to the goal (for peace).'
The liberal Suddeutsche Zeitung settled for scepticism. 'The prospects for a
permanent peace settlement could be illusory,' the paper warned. It was left
up to the small Nordbayerischer Kurier, based in Bayreuth, to use the
ceasefire to reflect on other ethnic and political conflicts throughout the
world.
It speculated that if a solution in Northern Ireland was possible, would it
be too much to expect that one day 'the Kurds and the Turks would sit at the
same table, the Chinese would grant independence to Tibet, and North and
South Korea might be reunited. Nothing is impossible.'
But, in South Korea, the coverage of the breakthrough was particularly
low-key in contrast to the copious coverage that the South Korean media gave
to the civil war in the recently united Yemen earlier this year. This event
was considered a warning about problems that Korea could confront if
unification is achieved between North and South Korea.
The South Korean media's routine coverage of the Irish story may be
explained by the fact that its attention was focused on the diplomatic moves
last week that could determine the fate of the Korean peninsula. The US had
agreed to a meeting in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang to discuss the
establishment of diplomatic relations and China gave its support to a North
Korean proposal for a peace treaty with the US that could eventually lead to
the removal of US troops from South Korea.
Irish-Americans divided between those who foresaw the almost immediate
unification of northern and southern Ireland - in five or perhaps ten years
 -and those who believed the British government would merely seek to exploit
the IRA ceasefire for tactical advantage. Many third and fourth generation
Irish-Americans are shaky on the details of the Irish conflict. A good
proportion believe that Catholics make up the majority in the north, but
they are unwavering in their determination that the British must go.
But one general assumption, expressed by commentators on radio and
television shows last week, is that the British people are tired enough of
haemorrhaging cash and casualties in Northern Ireland that they are only too
eager to withdraw.
And leaders of one Irish-American lobby group after another hurried to give
the credit to President Bill Clinton for encouraging the peace process along
by his decision to grant a visa earlier this year to Mr Gerry Adams, the
Sinn Fein leader.
Newspaper editorialists were more enthusiastic in their response to the news
of the IRA ceasefire, though careful to warn that it was only a first step.
The New York Times, under the headline 'Hope Reborn in Northern Ireland',
hailed the move as 'a breakthrough - and things ought to go very badly for
any faction that shatters this yearned-for ceasefire'. The paper concluded:
'In short, the permafrost seems finally to be heaving.'
The Washington Post, while sharing the view that Mr Clinton deserved much of
the credit, was more cautious on the future prospects. 'The ceasefire, a
culmination of years of effort, is only a beginning. But if it holds it will
be seen as the breakthrough concession that made real peace possible,' the
Post said.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Kohl under fire as SPD tries to close poll gap: German
election battle intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's Social Democratic party opposition leaders yesterday launched a
direct assault on the central pillar of the ruling coalition's election
campaign - Chancellor Helmut Kohl himself.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD leader, and Mr Helmut Schmidt, the party's
elder statesman, denounced Mr Kohl as the chancellor of missed opportunities
and a destroyer of jobs.
Mr Scharping characterised him as an insecure autocrat who listened neither
to the electorate nor to his own party. As a result, there was nothing
behind Mr Kohl but 'a giant black hole', he told an SPD campaign gathering
in Dortmund.
'You can see the insecurity in his eyes,' he said. Mr Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union was 'burnt out' and he was trying in vain to conceal the
fact.
In the four years since unification he had frittered away the opportunities
for economic, social and cultural unity in Germany, Mr Scharping added.
Mr Schmidt, who was displaced as Chancellor by Mr Kohl in 1982, blamed him
directly for the 'unconsidered actions' which had led to the loss of almost
half the jobs in the former East Germany.
This was not a consequence of mismanagement by the former communist
authorities, but a personal failure by Mr Kohl himself and his lack of
economic judgment, Mr Schmidt claimed.
The SPD, which currently lags behind the CDU and its Bavarian sister party,
the Christian Social Union, in the opinion polls, last week started its
campaign to undermine Mr Kohl's personal standing with the unveiling of a
three-man electioneering vanguard.
The tactical intention to persuade voters to weigh the alleged failings of
one man - Mr Kohl is still seen as an unsatisfactory chancellor by half the
population - against the strength in depth of the SPD emerged clearly
yesterday in Mr Scharping's unusually vigorous and confident presentation.
He brushed aside charges, central to the CDU's opening attack, that the SPD
was prepared to govern in an unwritten alliance with the Party of Social
Democracy (PDS) and so allow the former east German communists a say in
running the country.
This was an insult to the intelligence of the people, he said, and he
attempted to turn Mr Kohl's weapon on himself with accusations that the CDU
had former communists in its own ranks.
However, weekend comments by Mr Jens Reich, one of Mr Scharping's advisers
on east Germany, to the effect that he could imagine a minority coalition of
SPD and Greens ruling with alternating support from the CDU and the PDS seem
to ensure further exploitation of the issue by Mr Kohl and his allies.
With promises of economic and social justice and warnings that the
electorate should not be intimidated by the 'German Berlusconis' among
television and newspaper proprietors supporting Mr Kohl, Mr Scharping's
speech concluded the rituals preceding the campaign-proper leading to the
election, on October 16.
All the major parties have now set up their stalls, and as the so-called
'hot phase' of the campaign gets under way, personal attacks and a sharp
focus on almost exclusively internal issues seem certain to dominate the
early stages.
Foreign policy - especially the future of the European Union - has played
little role so far.
Mr Scharping's speech yesterday, for example, contained no direct references
to foreign affairs, where the SPD lacks experience and convincing
ministerial candidates.
However, possible strife within the current coalition's ranks may present
opportunities to be exploited by the SPD. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the Free Democrat
foreign minister, is understood to have been angered by a CDU/CSU discussion
paper published last week, which proposed a Europe of 'variable geometry'
built around a core comprising Germany, France and the Benelux countries.
Mr Kinkel is concerned that the paper could upset the ratification
procedures in countries applying for EU membership, notably Austria.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Moscow denies military presence in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government yesterday denied it had interevened militarily to
destabilise the Caucasian republic of Chechnya despite an outbreak of fierce
fighting over the weekend.
Mr Victor Yerin, Russia's interior minister, told the Interfax news agency
yesterday: 'All that is happening with Chechnya is the business of the
Chechen people alone. No interior troops are involved in the events in that
republic.'
Russian news agencies reported that fighting had erupted on Friday between
supporters of Mr Dzhokhar Dudayev's regime and opposition forces at
Dolinskaya, 30km outside the republican capital of Grozny. The fighting
involved artillery and armoured vehicles, raising suspicions that Russian
forces were involved.
Mr Movladi Uganov, the Chechen information minister, told Reuters on Friday
that two Russian helicopters had fired on the outskirts of Grozny inflicting
casualties.
The Russian defence ministry vigorously denied the charge.
Reports of the fighting have been confused and there have been no details of
casualties. The situation was reported to be calm yesterday.
Moscow has repeatedly made plain that it wants order re-established in the
break-away republic and has called upon Mr Dudayev to step down, warning
that Chechnya faces the risk of 'self-annihilation in the bloody flames of
civil war'. The Russian government has openly supported a Chechen opposition
grouping, led by Mr Umar Avturkhanov, which has been fighting to remove Mr
Dudayev.
On Friday, Chechnya ordered the expulsion of all Russian journalists within
24 hours. The telephone lines between Moscow and Grozny have been cut.

Russian and Chinese leaders signed a series of trade and co-operation
agreements over the weekend, promising a new era of partnership after 40
years of volatile and often bitter relations.
In the first visit to Moscow by a Chinese head of state since 1957, Mr Jiang
Zemin signalled his determination to extend the recent rapprochement with
Russia. 'Autumn is the season of harvest. In Moscow I have gathered a good
harvest,' he said yesterday.
The two presidents signed a political declaration promising neither country
would target nuclear weapons at the other. Both sides pledged not to allow
ideology to obstruct their bilateral relations nor join an international
grouping that would endanger each other's security interests. An agreement
was reached demarcating the western section of Russia's border with China,
which has been in dispute for decades. Russian involvement in five big
Chinese industrial projects was also confirmed in a trade protocol, which
could bring Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m) of orders to Russian companies.
'Both parties reached an understanding of the necessity to build a new type
of constructive partnership, which means neither confrontation nor political
alliance,' Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, said yesterday.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, said that as a force both in the west
and the east, Russia had no alternative but to develop its national
interests 'through partnership and normal co-operation with the outside
world'.
China remains one of Russia's most important trading partners despite a
sharp contraction in trade between the two countries this year because of
the upheavals in Russia's economy.

Mr Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's finance minister, resigned yesterday after
confessing in a private conversation mistakenly broadcast by satellite
television that, when it comes to inflation indices: 'I don't have any
scruples. What is good, we use - what is bad, we hide.'
His resignation comes at an awkward time for Brazil's two- month-old new
currency, the Real, and for Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the government's
candidate in next month's presidential elections.
Mr Ricupero was talking privately to a journalist from TV Globo, Brazil's
main broadcaster, in between taping interviews. About 10 minutes of the
conversation was transmitted live and received by homes with satellite
dishes in Brazil.
During the conversation, Mr Ricupero suggested that the success of the Real
and his personal popularity were winning votes for Mr Cardoso and taking
support from his main rival, Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers
party (PT). 'The greatest vote-getter today for (Mr Cardoso) is me,' he
said.
In a prepared statement yesterday, Mr Ricupero said he was the victim of 'an
electronic failure' and that he was exhausted at the time of the
conversation.
'This is not how I normally behave,' he said. 'But the Real plan is more
important and that is why I handed in my resignation.'
Last week, the PT complained about government support for Mr Cardoso which,
although not surprising in Brazil, is technically illegal. To comply with
Brazilian law, Mr Cardoso resigned as finance minister in April to run for
president. But he is still closely linked with the new currency, which has
cut inflation sharply and won him support among poorer voters.
Mr Ricupero said during the interview that television stations such as Globo
were using favourable comments about the Real to support Mr Cardoso's
campaign, instead of giving him more open support. Among other revealing
comments, he said he was preparing widespread tariff reductions on imports.
Mr Ricupero's resignation, although extremely embarrassing for the
government, will probably not threaten the Real. While currency markets are
expected to open nervously today, the team of economists who designed the
new currency and other anti-inflation measures remains in place.
The new finance minister is to be Mr Ciro Gomes, a former governor of Ceara
state and a close political ally of Mr Cardoso.
Mr Cardoso leads Mr da Silva by 45 per cent to 23 per cent in the latest
opinion polls before the first round of the presidential election on October
3.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Bank draws up plan to rescue union from financial collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers are working on plans to save Ucatt, Britain's biggest construction
union, from financial collapse.
The union, which has a Pounds 1.42m overdraft facility with the Unity Trust
Bank, the trade union bank, is in talks on a drastic cost-cutting package
that would include staff redundancies and the sale of union offices.
Unity Trust Bank, which has been working closely with HW Fisher, Ucatt's
accountants, hopes that an agreement resolving Ucatt's financial
difficulties can be reached by the end of the month.
The union has been finding it increasingly difficult to operate within its
overdraft limit. It has been spending more than it can raise in revenue and
will continue to do so next year.
Ucatt's perilous finances have been causing deep concern throughout the
trade union movement and Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades
Union Congress, has been keeping in close touch with events. Some union
officials fear Ucatt's difficulties could raise doubts about the viability
of other unions that are struggling to bring costs into line with declining
revenues.
Yesterday, a senior Unity Trust Bank official said the rescue programme for
Ucatt would be ready by the end of September. The union said it was
confident it would overcome its financial difficulties. The bank has already
ruled out one rescue plan this year because it was not drastic enough.
At one point bank officials sought a guarantee from the Transport and
General Workers union, which is in merger talks with Ucatt, that it would
pay the wages of the construction union officials if necessary.
Last year Ucatt suffered a net deficit of Pounds 844,000 against a deficit
of Pounds 2.045m in 1992. Its overall spending was Pounds 5.560m but its
revenues totalled just Pounds 4.639m. The union's net asset base dropped
from Pounds 5.29m in 1986 to only Pounds 417,000 last year. Its investments
have fallen from Pounds 3.548m to Pounds 46,000 in the past eight years.
Latest estimates suggest only about 60,000 workers are fully paid-up
members.
Ucatt members are due to vote in a ballot next month on a merger with the
TGWU. If they approve the proposal, Ucatt is expected to become a trade
group inside the TGWU next January. However, TGWU officials are keen to
ensure that Ucatt starts to carry through the rescue plan before then.
Last week the TUC general council agreed to suspend Ucatt's Pounds 180,000
annual affiliation fee to the TUC to enable delegates to attend the congress
that opens in Blackpool this morning. Ucatt officials said the union could
not afford to pay its fee.
The union could not take part in the Labour party leadership ballot earlier
this year because of its financial difficulties. It is talking to Labour
headquarters about a suspension of its affiliation fees for the party.

FT  05 SEP 94 / MoD faces Pounds 500m gap in budget next year: Problems in
housing scheme put spending plans at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence faces a Pounds 500m gap in its budget next year if
it cannot resolve problems which are dogging a scheme to transfer
servicemen's quarters to the private sector.
The ministry will be forced to look for savings elsewhere in its budget,
including scaling back its procurement plans if the scheme fails to take
off. The Department of Trade and Industry is monitoring developments because
it is concerned that UK defence companies could suffer if there are further
cuts in the MoD procurement budget.
Mr David Hart, a businessman who is a friend of Mr Michael Portillo, the
employment secretary, has been brought in to advise on raising the money for
the transfer and on how to modernise the housing stock.
The scheme - unveiled in March and described by Viscount Cranborne, then
defence minister, as 'a sort of finance lease' - involves creating a
non-profit-making housing trust to own and manage the homes.
For the housing project to deliver the savings projected for the defence
budget in 1995 and 1996, it would have to be in operation within the next 12
months. However, it is thought that the ministry has not received any firm
commitments from housing associations or the private sector to get the
scheme started.
Under the plan, 68,000 armed services married quarters would be transferred
to the housing trust under 30-year leases. The trust would be independent of
the MoD, but would contract with it to provide accommodation for married
service personnel and to improve its quality. Capital for the deal would be
raised in the City, secured against the future stream of rental income.
Although there has been a good deal of interest in principle among potential
lenders, aspects of the proposals have provoked concerns which the ministry
is yet to overcome.
Much of the property is in poor condition and located near military bases,
rather than in towns and cities where it could be more easily sold or rented
if it is not needed by the armed forces. Some of it is inside secure areas,
which restricts its use to defence personnel.
Doubts have also been raised in the housing association movement over the
capacity of the markets to raise an additional Pounds 500m a year.
Associations currently raise around Pounds 1bn a year to top up government
grants for building low-cost homes.
With concern over the supply of funds in the future, the Housing
Corporation, the quango that distributes the grant, has been trying to
attract foreign investors.
Potential investors are thought to have been asked to accept a 30-year
estimate of the likely cost of upgrading the accommodation. Some are said to
have regarded this as taking an unacceptable risk.
Mr Hart, a political adviser to Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, is
helping to devise a plan that meets the government's objectives.
Mr Hart is a former aide to Baroness Thatcher and helped set up the Union of
Democratic Mineworkers.
According to the MoD, 'a number of variants' for structuring the deal are
currently under consideration. It will be 'some time' before ministers
decide which one to adopt, the ministry says, but it has 'every expectation'
of meeting 'the original objective set for the whole exercise'.

FT  05 SEP 94 / Major urged to reject Franco-German EU proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, is under mounting pressure from
Conservative backbenchers to reject French and German proposals for a
sweeping reform of the European Union that would exclude the UK from an
inner core of EU states.
Tory MPs on both the pro-European and Euro-sceptic wings of the party
yesterday urged the prime minister to use a keynote speech in the
Netherlands this week to criticise the proposals, which call for the
creation of an inner core of five EU states - France, Germany, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg. They fear the UK, along with Spain and Italy,
would be relegated to the 'slow lane' of Europe.
Euro-sceptic Tory MPs claimed the proposals would mean that Britain paid the
full cost of EU membership without getting the benefits.
The proposed changes emerged in an interview given by Mr Edouard Balladur,
French prime minister, and in a document published by the senior party in
the governing German coalition, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
Under the changes, Britain, Spain and Italy would be in a second tier of
states, which would not be obliged to meet all the criteria of European
monetary union. Other European states with weaker economies would be in a
third tier.
Mr James Cran, a rightwing Tory MP and leading Euro-sceptic, said: 'The
conception laid out in these discussion papers is unacceptable. They will
end up consolidating Franco-German domination of the EU.'
Pro-European Tories MPs on the right of the party were also dismayed by the
proposals.
Mr Peter Temple-Morris, one of the party's leading pro-European MPs, said:
'I am very fearful that we will end up with a two-tier system, with us in
the second tier.'
Mr Major will deliver his speech at the University of Leiden on Wednesday.
It will be virtually impossible for him to ignore the Franco-German
proposals, which threaten to open a period of debate over Europe's
constitutional future that may prove as divisive as the wrangling over the
Maastricht treaty. The Italian and Spanish governments last week attacked
the proposals, which many believe are the opening positions in the argument
leading to the EU intergovernmental conference in 1996.
British officials made clear that the government is unhappy with some
aspects of the proposals. which employ a more rigid demarcation of the core
members of the 'multitrack, multispeed' Europe proposed by Mr Major in the
recent European elections.
Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, have argued that there
should be a series of inner cores tailored to particular areas of policy.
The UK, for example, would be in the core group on defence and single market
legislation, but not on social chapter discussions.

FT  05 SEP 94 / PM demands guarantees of lasting ceasefire from IRA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday insisted he needed a 'copper
bottomed' guarantee from the IRA that its ceasefire was permanent before its
political wing, Sinn Fein, could join talks on the future of Northern
Ireland.
He emphasised the government's cautious approach to the ceasefire declared
last week by announcing that Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, would
continue to be barred from visiting Britain.
The prime minister, speaking on BBC television, said Mr Adams would remain
subject to a three-year exclusion order barring him from visiting the UK
mainland, and that he did not expect this to be revoked 'in the next few
months'.
Mr Major's caution was in sharp contrast to that of his Irish counterpart,
Mr Albert Reynolds, who is expected to meet Mr Adams this week to discuss
Sinn Fein's participation in the Dublin-based Forum for Peace and
Reconciliation, which would bring the Irish nationalist movement into talks
with political parties in the republic.
Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, will today meet Sir Patrick
Mayhew, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary to try to resolve the
differences between the governments' judgments of how to respond to the
ceasefire.
An Irish foreign ministry spokesman said: 'We understand the caution of the
British government, but we hope that it is going to be cleared up shortly
and that the meeting hopefully will contribute to that.'
Sir Patrick said Irish nationalists had not yet made it clear that the
violence had been permanently ended.
Unionist politicians in Northern Ireland yesterday maintained their pressure
on London to respond cautiously to the IRA's declaration. Mr Chris
McGimpsey, honorary secretary of the Ulster Unionist party (UUP), said a
cessation of IRA terrorism was simply a logistical statement whereas a
permanent end to violence was a political statement.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said the
ceasefire terms had 'a get-out clause to renew the violence if they do not
get concessions they are looking for.'

A United Nations General Assembly committee yesterday agreed the Security
Council should be enlarged, but reached no decision on how to do it. As a
result, Germany and Japan, which both want a permanent seat on the 15-member
body, are unlikely to achieve the goal for several years. Japan had hoped
for a preliminary decision before 1995, the 50th anniversary of the UN, but
a spokesman for secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali said he doubted the
controversy could be resolved by next year. A senior German envoy said Bonn
was not worried about the committee's report as long as discussions
continued and the 'momentum was not lost'. He said Germany would like to see
some concrete proposals within the next year, but had always realised that
ratification of any proposal would be a drawn-out process.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Costly dam to be opened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Carlos Menem will today inaugurate what he once called Argentina's
'monument to corruption', the 3,200 MW Yacyreta hydroelectric dam on the
Parana River.
The dam, among the largest in the world, has cost at least six times over
budget and is still not finished, 11 years after construction began.
Mr Menem will only be unveiling the first of Yacyreta's 20 turbines, which
will eventually generate one-third of Argentina's electricity. The final
bill for Yacyreta is not in yet. Estimates vary between Dollars 9bn and
Dollars 12bn.
The Yacyreta project began in 1958 when Argentina and Paraguay, which share
the Parana river, signed a co-operation treaty to build the dam. However,
squabbling between the two countries, Argentina's repeated financial crises
and 17 changes of government over the last 36 years constantly delayed the
project.
Yacyreta's fame as a 'monument to corruption' - a phrase Mr Menem coined in
1990 - was born soon after the first feasibility studies began, with
contracts reputedly being awarded to groups with the strongest lobbying
capability in Buenos Aires and the Paraguayan capital Asuncion. The two
governments own equal shares in the project.
Bidding for the construction contract itself began in 1980 and competition
was fierce. Dumez of France and Italy's Impregilo were the front runners in
the bidding. The then military government of Gen Reynaldo Bignone eventually
told the two to create a joint venture, which it awarded the contract just
10 days before the civilian administration of Mr Raul Alfonsin took over in
1983.
Since then, the two companies have struggled through hyperinflation, a
second change of government with Mr Menem's election in 1989, and his
surprise conversion to free market economics. They have also coped with
three different currencies and three radical shifts in economic policy over
the last 11 years.
Mr Menem now believes he has found a market solution to Yacyreta: he wants
to privatise the dam, turning over its operation to a private company once
the 20th turbine is installed and spinning.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Interview: The wheel turns full circle for Dr Steiner -
Oxford is about to welcome back a thinker it rejected 40 years ago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
George Steiner sips from a glass of white wine in the corner of a
Cambridgeshire pub and confesses that the latest twist in his academic life
reads like the climax of a 'bad novel'.
Forty-two years ago, a precocious graduate from Chicago and Harvard, he
submitted his doctorate to the English faculty at Oxford, and it was turned
down. That doyenne of the academic literary world, Dame Helen Gardner, told
him his work was a worthwhile study in comparative literature, but as that
subject did not exist at Oxford, the examiners were not able to oblige.
'One day,' she added, 'it may well arrive here; but right now it is not in
the rubric.'
Next month, Steiner, first visiting professor of European Comparative
Literature at Oxford, gives his inaugural lecture in the subject which
prompted such a cursory dismissal all those years ago. The ironies of his
appointment will doubtless be given an airing in the university's imposing
Examination Schools building, but his tone will be affectionate: 'Dame Helen
was right; she was always right. It just took 42 years, which, by Oxbridge
standards, is not too bad.'
In the weeks leading up to the lecture, Steiner is feeling remarkably
relaxed about the world. His magnanimous mood enables him to skip over
incidents which have become some of the most enduring tales in that curious,
twilight world of academic mythology. For the Oxford snub was not his last
unhappy encounter with authority; more was to come.
He re-submitted a substantially different thesis to comply with regulations,
and after spells at The Economist and Princeton, was invited to become a
founding fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge. Once there, he began to
lecture with unusual charisma to packed audiences, but he had failed to take
the hint from the Other Place; his first course was on how to read poetry
after Marx, Freud and Levi-Strauss. Traditional English literature it was
not.
One day, the story goes, a senior member of faculty arrived to assess
Steiner's credentials to be appointed to a full lectureship. Steiner was
talking about Theodor Adorno's bleak conclusion that there could be no
poetry after Auschwitz. The faculty member walked out in mid-lecture,
ostentatiously, angrily. 'When I was on the Burma death railway,' he
allegedly told colleagues, 'Steiner was sitting safely in his New York
apartment. I will not be lectured by him on Nazi atrocities.' Not only was
there no lectureship; Steiner was told not to bother applying again.
So began the breach between Steiner, the archetypal Jewish, Mitteleuropean,
polyglot intellectual, and the English academic establishment. Although
appointed to an extraordinary fellowship at Churchill so that he could carry
out his research, he ceased teaching in Cambridge. In 1974 he accepted a
chair in Geneva, in which he has spent half his working time ever since.
Now, at 65, he is back in the fold. The sense of the wheel having turned
full circle in the year of his official retirement from Geneva gives Steiner
an almost happy-go-lucky air which sits uneasily with the brooding intensity
and sharp sense of melancholy of his prose.
Even when conversation turns light, however, it rarely becomes trivial;
describing the simple, quotidian joys of waking up in the morning, Steiner
typically manages to quote Hegel: 'A Jew is a man who, given the choice
between eternal salvation and tomorrow's newspaper, will choose the
newspaper.' He is insistent that any rancour he has carried inside him has
been finally dispersed: 'There were mistakes on both sides; I was not easy
to be with. Bitterness would be folly.'
Many take the Steiner story to be the classic case study of the collision
between English intellectual values - oblique, clenched, bracingly empirical
and fiercely pragmatic - and those of 'continental' Europe - bold,
speculative, swathed in abstraction and rhetoric. It is not a new story, by
any means; but when Steiner moves in his unmistakable lilting tones from
Mallarme to Heidegger, Rilke to Benjamin, Hegel to Derrida, one can hear the
mocking chorus at his shoulder: 'pretentious'; 'charlatan'; most damning,
and English, of all: 'too clever by half]'
Steiner is not unaware of the charges, but these days shrugs them aside. In
fact, his relationship with English intellectual life is complex; he has,
after all, spent a large part of his life in English university towns and
has some sneaking sympathies. He decries the pragmatism which, in his view,
inhibits great works of creative genius ('that cry of 'come-off-it', which
would have prevented Beethoven's 9th symphony or Michelangelo's Sistine
Chapel'), but recognises that 'a Europe in which the spectre of Germany
looms immense needs a British presence more urgently than ever, for its
irony, its tolerance, its genuine respect for the law'.
He will not turn a blind eye to Britain's indigenous flaws, however. When
asked if he had ever been asked to give the Reith lectures, he replies that
an informal approach had failed to bear fruit when it was learned 'at the
highest level' that his proposed subject was 'the tiredness of England'. He
has no regrets: 'I am quite unrepentant on that. If there is too little
nerve, too little pride to accept discussion of such a subject, then we are
in trouble.'
Another important reason for the wariness and occasional outright hostility
shown towards Steiner is the very substance of his work, as well as its
refusal to pay homage to traditional academic categories. His most urgent
anxiety is that the humanities, the beautiful world of high art and culture
created and enjoyed by Europeans over the last 500 years, have not only
failed to humanise but have contributed to the legacy of horror which
reached an unspeakable climax with the Holocaust. The striking examples he
first presented in his Language and Silence have today become cliches: the
concentration camp guard who tortured in the morning and was moved by
Schubert in the evening; the cry of King Lear which carries greater
resonance than the cry in the street.
He asks if the price of all that culture, all that beauty, has been worth
paying. Although he prefaces his tentative conclusions with the hope that he
may be wrong, his tone is one of unmistakable pessimism. Asked in a BBC Face
to Face interview how he thought he would be remembered, he replied, 'with
deliberate self-cruelty', that he would be seen as a rearguard; 'someone who
could still remember the inventory of that great culture, roughly from the
Renaissance to Auschwitz, but who never understood his own time at all
because he was hanging on to something which was in many ways a world of
ash, a dead world.'
Certainly he finds little solace in the democratisation and globalisation of
culture, a chief characteristic of the post-war world. He finds it
depressing that the lowest common denominator of cultural taste 'prefers
football and bingo to Aeschylus', and sees rock music as 'a seismic break in
the history of consciousness, a triumph of death'.
In truth, he has shown little signs of coming to terms with mass culture in
his work, though this may be a relief; there are probably enough cultural
commentators making a living from EastEnders, Ryan Giggs and Nirvana.
But there remains the scholar's sense of curiosity. As we drive out of
college, Steiner slows down to read the slogan on a T-shirt of a man
painting yellow lines on the forecourt. It reads: 'I have entered the vortex
of love.' He drives away with a bemused smile, trying, no doubt, to make
sense.

FT  03 SEP 94 / The pressure of gunboat diplomacy: Britain has offered the
US two warships to help invade Haiti. Dominic Lawson asks what the fee is
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the day that the Irish Republican Army announced a complete cessation of
its 'military activities' - terrorism to you and me - another announcement
gained rather less attention from the British media. It nonetheless also had
consequences for British troops.
In case you missed it in all the euphoria over the IRA's tactical
withdrawal, here are the facts: on Wednesday the Foreign Office revealed
that it had offered the services of two ships and a military training team
to assist in a possible US invasion of Haiti.
I'm sorry, I'll read that again: to assist in a possible United Nations
invasion of Haiti.
The Foreign Office has offered HMS Broadsword which last saw action in the
Falklands War, and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Oakleaf. Broadsword is,
apparently, unsuited to naval gunfire support of an amphibious landing as it
has no gun. However, a spokesman from the Ministry of Defence said
(according to The Independent): 'If the Americans requested it, she might be
replaced by a ship with a gun.'
I should think the Americans jolly well will 'request it'. Guns are useful
in such circumstances. You never know when you might need them.
But what is going on here? What are we British doing offering materials and
men to facilitate a dubiously motivated invasion of a godforsaken Caribbean
island of no conceivable strategic interest to us?
The trite answer is that our man at the UN put up his hand when the Security
Council passed Resolution 940 which authorises member nations to 'use all
necessary means to facilitate the departure from Haiti of the military
leadership and to maintain and establish a secure and stable environment'.
This is the usual post cold war charade, of course, in which the US uses a
tame UN to give international legitimacy to the pursuit of its own very
particular foreign policy objectives. We saw the same thing in Somalia, and
 -though here the international interest was genuinely widespread - Kuwait.
But it is not enough for the Americans to have Britain's signature to the
policy they wish to carry out. They also want us to make the pretence of an
'international task force' even more believable by the actual involvement of
non-American troops. And for some reason the State Department considers
Britain the most useful stooge in such endeavours.
This is not primarily because British troops are the best in the world, but
because - as one former State Department official told me - 'you guys have a
pretty good record'. In other words, direct military involvement by Japan or
Germany, even were it feasible, would raise associations best forgotten.
In Somalia, Britain did the absolute minimum, supplying one addled old
Hercules transporter. The Americans were not at all pleased about that, but
when one recalls what happened to the Pakistani troop contingent - 48 of
them butchered by General Aideed's men - one can only be grateful.
In the case of Haiti, the British response is slightly more accommodating.
What is the reason? The same as always: the Foreign Office wants something
in return from America. Perhaps an absence of criticism by President Clinton
for the Major government's less than effusive reaction to the IRA's
cease-fire?
The precise details are, irrelevant. All we British can hope is that the
trade-off is more in our favour than in the Americans'.
This is simply the stuff of diplomacy, low and embarrassing as it
undoubtedly is. Why, for example, did that arch third world groupy, Harold
Wilson give vocal support to President Lyndon Johnson's military escapade in
Vietnam. It was the quid pro quo for American support for the ailing pound.
A quo pro quid, in other words.
I quote from Ben Pimlott's masterly biography of Wilson: 'In December 1965 .
. . the Foreign Secretary reported that recent British requests for American
financial help had been met by a dry reminder from the White House that the
British had not been very helpful over Cuba, and by an inquiry about when
the first British battalion would be arriving in Vietnam.'
Well, at least we wriggled out of that one.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Rushing towards my last word
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This will be the last of these columns for a while. I am being catapulted
forward in time, to join the Monday FT, so Hawks &amp; Handsaws is going into
storage, together with its best-loved character: Miss Lee, my executive
assistant.
I broke the news to her on Thursday, in a restaurant near Chelsea barracks,
a place so fashionable that the bill for two people is always Pounds 130,
whatever they eat or drink.
During the past four years Miss Lee has established a place of great
affection in readers' hearts. Last Christmas she received more cards than I
did. She has been invited to numerous functions, and to address school
prize-days.
Miss Lee's popularity has been based on the fact that she appeals equally to
men and women. Women like her because she is a Thatcherite Yorkshirewoman of
immense poise and style who speaks her mind plainly, wears stupendously
expensive clothes and exhibits minimal tolerance of male fears and foibles.
Strange to relate, men seem to like her for exactly the same reasons.
But now she is headed for storage. When I told Miss Lee in the restaurant
that she and Hawks &amp; Handsaws were going into the cold store, there was an
instant sprinkling of tears and a dabbing of ivory cheeks. But that was just
the waiters.
Miss Lee remained composed. 'Well, Michael,' she said. 'I suppose there are
elements of the readership that will miss your pensees creuses, but
remember: pietra mossa non fa muschio. A rolling stone gathers no moss, or,
indeed, gravitas. There were signs, just lately, that your Saturday morning
drolleries were acquiring some shape, the first suggestion of weight.
'In particular, you seemed to have dropped your campaign against John Major
and the Conservative party, and to have switched your eyeless gaze towards a
far more deserving target: boy-scout Blair and his new-model Labour party.
When Tony Blair comes to power, if he comes to power, we shall know whom to
blame: whippersnappers like you whiffling in the wind, fomenting unrest,
unable to see that John Major is all that stands between us and the
bottomless pit.'
I said: 'If that is only half true, I reckon we should jump. Why is it, Miss
Lee, that conservative-minded souls nurse the belief that they know what's
best? The only hate-mail Hawks &amp; Handsaws has received has been from
far-right conservatives - anonymous and scurrilous, penned in mauve ink.
What produces this hatred?'
'Dislike of namby-pambiness.'
I said: 'That's not much of a reason. As for John Major, whenever I see his
name I think of what the American writer Wendell Berry said. From our point
of view, said Berry, the difference between the mind of a human being and
that of a mountain goat is wonderful. From the point of view of the infinite
ignorance that surrounds us, the difference is not impressive.'
Miss Lee said: 'Any more pick-of-the-pensees from four years of
column-writing?'
'Well,' I said gamely, relishing her tartness, which is about to go into
storage. 'Not long ago I had lunch with another FT columnist. This was most
unusual. On austere newspapers such fraternising is rare. Columnists eye
each other cagily and pass by on the other side.
'However, I and this person were having lunch, and I said that I often
regretted that in a column of 720 words it was hard to do justice to
complicated subjects like human over-population, which is killing the planet
 -that all you could do was make a few points without really getting round
to formulating solutions.
'And this guy said - he is really extremely bright - that columnists weren't
there to provide reams of analysis or draw up legislation, but to lob a few
well-directed grenades into the seething mess of human affairs and hope for
the best.
'I could see that he was right. But then I thought: as a species, we have
analysed everything that is wrong with us. We know all about our mistakes,
yet we are making more and more of them. The faster we lob grenades, the
faster they come back at us. We are rushing towards our end, Miss Lee, of
that I am quite convinced.'
Miss Lee smiled brilliantly, and signalled to a waiter. 'Michael,' she said
gently. 'You are speaking for yourself.'

FT  03 SEP 94 / Arts: Monumental primitivism - William Packer admires the
wit and strength of Paolozzi's sculptures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Our sculptor knights seem a hale and hearty lot. We celebrated Sir Anthony
Caro's 70th birthday earlier in the year with the show at Kenwood of his
suite of monumental new works, The Trojan War. Now it is the turn of Sir
Eduardo Paolozzi with a small but choice retrospective, most appropriately
the first of the two to appear at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, for he is
its patron.
A much more ambitious project had been mooted, for the Sculpture Park can
happily embrace the largest monumental works and Paolozzi has never been
afraid to work on a monumental scale. (His latest big commission, 'The
Wealth of Nations' for the Royal Bank of Scotland, has recenlty been set up
in Edinburgh.) Small this survey may be, in both actual size as in number,
but while it may seem a pity that the larger scheme should have been
scotched, in the event it proves a blessing.
Huge works are naturally impressive, but they tend to be impressive for
themselves: they hold the attention by their scale and physical presence,
but as single and isolated creatures. Here, set out on the hillside among
the trees, there are enough works of a middling size to represent that
open-air and monumental aspect. Most are welded stainless-steel pieces from
the mid-1960s and early '70s, industrial in their processes, material and
references. I remember them as seeming pretty big at the time.
But with the emphasis on smaller works - the studies and maquettes alongside
the substantive pieces on a human and domestic scale - we find ourselves
considering the unity of the oeuvre as a whole. Plus ca change, plus c'est
la meme chose: and with Paolozzi, as with so many other artists, despite
superficial shifts and changes in interest and practice, the essential
preoccupations seem instinctively, intuitively, to remain the same. The
hand, the eye, the informing sensibility, do not change.
Take the group of heads that fills the Park's Bothy Gallery. Among all
Paolozzi's myriad magpie enthusiasms, that for toys and games and puzzles
stands very high, especially those that come apart, or break, or show their
insides. It has always been the putting back together, twisting and
refitting the elements, mixing them up and getting them purposefully just
wrong and out-of-kilter, that seems to fascinate him most. All the heads,
the recent self-portraits especially, demonstrate this approach, sliced
apart and the bits jammed incongruously together. And here is the earliest
head of all, 'Mr Cruikshank', a portrait head of 1950, cleanly modelled and
entire, yet with its potential for segmentation clearly inferred by the
vertical and horizontal contours that mark its sections. It could have been
made yesterday.
Paolozzi has been a major force and influence in British art for nearly 50
years and yet more recently, while he has been impossible to ignore, he has
been made to seem something of a marginal figure, critically awkward if not
actually incorrect. Fashion has had a lot to do with it. It was bad enough
to remain even remotely figurative in the work, and his, with his towers and
monsters, was always founded in humane experience. And then the literary and
philosophical, technological and scientific reference with which the work is
dense made it so hard to categorise. Acknowledge the quality of his surreal
invention by all means, and his particular role as a pioneer of British Pop
Art, but that was then: safer now, in a tidier age, to push him critically
aside.
This subversive little show quite dismisses those safe and tidy assumptions.
Rather, it restores Paolozzi to the central position which in truth was
always his, from the time when he was in Paris just after the war and
bringing together the formal simplicities of Hepworth and the organic
surrealism of Picasso and Giacometti. The Park's Pavilion Gallery shows it
all in a stimulating, unchronological mix of early, middle and late. How
strong it is, the work of the 1940s and '50s with its gleeful, monumental
primitivism, and how consistent the work has remained, in the vitality of
its invention and its formal strength alike, to this day. We must never
forget the simple truth, that good artists do go on, and what they go on
doing is making good art.

Bretton, Wakefield, West Yorkshire, until October 2; sponsored by the

FT  03 SEP 94 / Arts: Sweet musical bon-bons - Richard Fairman reviews the
Chabrier operas at Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Emmanuel Chabrier died 100 years ago this month, he left a remarkable
early collection of French impressionists: eight Manets, eight Monets, six
Renoirs, two Sisleys and a Cezanne. This was a man who recognised an
enduring work of art when he saw it. It is just a shame that his own music
never lived to enjoy such fame.
As an antidote to Beethoven, this year's other featured composer, Edinburgh
could hardly have chosen a more fizzing tonic than Chabrier. The survey did
not go much beyond his operas, but even that is welcome. Sadly we did not
get anything of Gwendoline - a real hoot the only time when I have seen it.
But the festival did push out the boat with a concert performance of his
unfinished Briseis, which sails off full of ambition across an ocean of
Wagnerian ecstasy, only to lose all sense of direction.
The two stage productions were saved as the highlight of the festival's
final week. A couple of years ago Opera North scored a success with
L'Etoile, a spiffing piece of theatrical nonsense which has proved to be
Chabrier's nearest thing to a lasting success in the opera-house. Emboldened
by this venture, the company decided to follow up with the intractable Le
Roi malgre lui and bring them both to Edinburgh. The King's Theatre is just
the right size for serving these sweet French musical bon-bons.
After all the praise that has been heaped on the show, it pains me to say
that the company's idea of L'Etoile was wrong-headed. My teeth grated at its
cartoon-style stage designs. My stomach sank at its heavy-handed humour.
Following on from Offenbach, Chabrier came up with a new line in French
operetta, exquisitely light-headed, a little zany, more than a little
erotic, its sparkling comic score leaving little doubt how it was meant to
go. Opera North played the music in the right spirit, but turned the stage
action into English pantomime: false and two-dimensional.
Le Roi malgre lui followed on Thursday. This was a new production and the
first time that the opera has been staged in Britain. The problem has always
been its plot. Declaring that the original story is unworkable in the
theatre (a point we have to take on trust, although those who have seen it
overseas remember little that made sense), Opera North commissioned Jeremy
Sams and Michael Wilcox to weave a new libretto around the music - as Sams
remarked, like a crossword which ends with guessing the clues.
The result is inane, but in the most delightful way. As though learning the
lesson of the night before, they have let the music be their guide. When
solo cellos set a tone of heartfelt F minor compassion, the would-be king
sings of his ruined fatherland and starving people. A soprano aria with
yearning strings is matched to a text about a flower that will bloom: 'its
name is change and revolution'. Yes - the opera has acquired a social
conscience it never had before.
Sams and Wilcox have set it in 'semi-imaginary' Moldavia (though no
imagination was needed to identify the city on the backdrop as Prague).
Henri is the true successor to the throne, believed lost or dead, who now
leads a band of revolutionaries. He is opposed to a monarchy, but that does
not stop him keeping his orb and sceptre under the floorboards. When he
finally reaches his coronation, there is some indecision whether he should
be crowned with those, or a hammer and sickle.
The authors' dry sense of humour is the saving grace through all this
nonsense. Among some fine music is a heavenly Venetian barcarolle for
Russell Smythe's straight-faced Henri and Juliet Booth's Alexina, which is
as sensuous as anything Chabrier wrote. The duets seem to have inspired the
composer to give his best, as another between Booth and Rosa Mannion's
stylish Minka is a winner for two sopranos, soaring away limpidly like
Micaela's identical twins.
Somehow the plot manages to push Minka and half-a-dozen 'nymphs' into
suspenders and frilly, black-lace bodices for a cabaret number swinging from
a silver moon. There is also a gay Italian revolutionary, who divides his
time between chasing hairy Hungarians and perfecting the exploding
pineapple, a part taken with flair by Geoffrey Dolton. Justin Lavender
sounded pinched in the tenor role. Nicholas Folwell made his mark as Laski.
Jeremy Sams doubles as a producer always ready to come to the rescue with a
dead-pan sense of humour.
Add in Paul Daniel's lively conducting and the opera seems to have more wit
than L'Etoile, even though that is easily the more original work. The
Opera-Comique burnt down after only two performances of 'Le Roi malgre lui.
Opera North is risking two in Edinburgh and promises to take it to Leeds and
on tour afterwards.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Arts: A theme for success - Alastair Macaulay looks back at
McMaster's third Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you go to the Edinburgh Festival to cover just one art form, you miss the
point. And, in particular, you miss the point of the festival as it has been
directed for three years now by Brian McMaster.
This is particularly clear in the case of this year's theatre. Chances are
if you went only to plays this Edinburgh, you had a mediocre time. And yet
there was excellent drama to be seen in the official Edinburgh festival this
year, though not in the area strictly labelled theatre. Two of the 1994
operatic stagings - Tim Albery's Fidelio and the Jeremy Sams-Michael Wilcox
version of Chabrier's Le Roi malgre lui, both receiving their world
premieres here - were better than any of the official plays: better in
creating coherent stage worlds and in catching all the various moods present
in their respective dramas. And the most potent and imaginative and daring
theatre of all occurred in the Merce Cunningham double bill, Mark Morris's
L'Allegro, Penseroso, Moderato, and four of the Miami City Ballet Balanchine
productions - Emeralds, Rubies, Serenade, The Four Temperaments. If you
wanted to find out that movement in time and space could be profoundly
expressive this summer, Edinburgh was the only place in the world to be.
But everything about McMaster's Edinburgh suggests that for him music is the
holiest of the arts; or, at any rate, everything about his festival confirms
my belief that music is the holiest of the arts. This must be why McMaster
keeps inviting Morris back to give us more each year, and why it now seems
to us that Morris belongs in the Edinburgh Festival.
For dance people, this year's Edinburgh was, of course, a bonanza. Or, to
put it another way, if bombs had dropped on the three main companies
appearing here this year, there would be next to no dance left in the world
worthy of the name. For those of us who love human movement, there were
other places to find it memorably presented: for example, in the Albery
Fidelio. I have never seen the finale so vivified - achieved by revealing
musicality.
But let us try further to read the McMaster mind as it presents itself in
his festival. He likes to have themes, and two of this year's theme artists
 -Goethe and Beethoven - were wonderful choices. Beethoven was covered in
depth - all nine symphonies, all five piano concerti, a Fidelio day, five
programmes of his string quartets, five concerts of piano sonatas - and the
pleasure of this was that one can discover different Beethovens. Goethe was
not shown in anything like his full range, but was shown as a potent
influence on music: in Schumann's Scenes from Goethe's Faust, in the second
half of Mahler's Eighth Symphony, and in songs by Beethoven, Schubert, Wolf
and even Verdi. And  - whether or not you admire it as a play, or admired
the production it received here - everyone can or should agree that his
Tasso is just the kind of play that is ideal for revival in a festival such
as this.
The beauty of the Goethe-Beethoven combination goes further. It ties in with
the concurrent exhibition of The Romantic Spirit in German Art 1790-1990;
and so light is cast on the past two centuries of German culture, and on all
Romantic and post-Romantic art.
McMaster's other musical theme this year was Chabrier. The more honour to
McMaster, for, although this is the centenary of Chabrier's death, no such
celebration is occurring in his native France. But more planning could have
gone into this. Chabrier's considerable and delectable output of songs and
piano music was confined to a mildly gruesome late-night cabaret, narrated
in ponderously mellow tones by Dennis Quilley and sung in pinched English
tones by Linda Kitchen and Philip Salmon. Not until Jeremy Sams's
Gilbert-and-Chabrier revision of Le Roi malgre lui did I encounter Chabrier
as I had hoped; and the degree to which Sams and his co-librettist Michael
Wilcox have let Chabrier's music be their guide was (especially when you
hear this music) a minor miracle.
In these respects, despite this or that, McMaster seems to direct a festival
from a core of belief and interest in the arts. But a different McMaster
emerges when we examine the spoken theatre he has presented this year (and
last year too). The only theme here is Director's Theatre. I would hate to
see Edinburgh in competition with Salzburg or anywhere else to become the
latest smart showcase for next-wave ways of directing theatre. McMaster
began two years ago by having two theme playwrights, and it would surely be
truer to the spirit of Edinburgh - truer, I hope to the spirit of McMaster
too - if he returned to this. If he can give us four different programmes of
dear little Chabrier, he might consider doing the same by (say) Goldoni, or
Pinter, or Lope de Vega, or Marlowe, or Marivaux.
But what 'makes' the Edinburgh festival is its least-buzzed aspect; its
concerts. Even though this festival taught me that there a few famous works
by Beethoven I am in no hurry to hear again, the Beethoven experience - the
continuing discovery of the extraordinary diversity of Beethoven's mind -
kept growing as I went from one concert to the next. No festival could be
more physically exhausting than McMaster's Edinburgh, or more spiritually
invigorating.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Arts: Saving Grace - patience, passion and the baron /
Annalena McAfee meets the collector and benefactor Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNALENA MCAFEE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza is relishing the role of saviour of
British heritage. 'My wife and I love Britain,' he says, nodding indulgently
at his fifth wife, Carmen 'Tita', a former Miss Spain. 'We were married
there - in Moreton-in-Marsh.' They liked Britain so much, in fact, that they
took a little of it with them when they left - Constable's 'The Lock'
(Pounds 10m) and Holbein's portrait of Henry VIII (a snip at Pounds 10,000).
The baron's donation of the final Pounds 800,000 to keep Canova's 'Three
Graces' in Britain is being greeted with whoops of joy in some museum and
gallery circles. But there is, as those used to dealing with the wily
billionaire will have anticipated, a catch to the baron's offer.
'I would like it to come to Madrid, maybe for six months, maybe a year, to
be a centrepiece of an exhibition we are holding at the Villahermosa'. Only
200 yards from the Prado, the Villahermosa palace houses the Pounds 175m
Thyssen collection, said to rival that of Queen Elizabeth II in range, if
not quite in value.
Tim Clifford, director of National Galleries of Scotland, seems undaunted by
the prospect of parting with the prize he has only just secured. 'Obviously,
we would smile on this loan,' says Mr Clifford. 'We're all absolutely
thrilled.'
Others in the UK heritage lobby, still smarting from the baron's rejection
in 1988 of a Pounds 100m government inducement to bring his collection to
Britain, will be more sceptical. Baron Thyssen's passion about art - 'it is
universal, it is impossible to have a disagreeable conversation about it. It
should be shared by everyone' - is matched by the hard-headed pragmatism
that befits the retired head of an industry spanning plastics, car parts,
container leasing and shipping.
He clearly enjoyed giving the run-around to heads of state and royalty as
they queued to woo him and his collection. 'Mmmm,' he says reflectively.
'That was a very nice period.' Prince Charles came to put the case for
Britain and even prime minister Margaret Thatcher got swept along in the
excitement, inviting the baron to Number 10 to press Britain's suit. 'Yes,
she tried her best,' he says. 'We sat on the same sofa and she talked for
ten minutes. Then she suddenly said 'I shouldn't talk so much. You should
talk.' I later heard that she thought I was formidable - that I was the only
one who didn't give in to her, though I don't think I was the only one.'
In the event, Spain won the prize, largely thanks to the loyalties and
powers of persuasion of the baroness, the former wife of Hollywood tarzan
actor Lex Barker. The collection, ranging from Old Masters of the early
fourteenth and fifteenth century to Picasso, Cezanne, Bacon, Hopper and the
German Expressionists, was to be loaned to the Spanish government for 10
years, split between Villahermosa and Pedralbes, a 14th century convent in
Barcelona. Last year, however, the baron signed it over permanently for
Pounds 230m, maintaining a key interest and a core collection which he
distributes between his five homes.
Some of the baron's five children had initially resisted the hand-over of
the collection. 'There were a lot of conditions to get all my sons and
daughters to consent. We had a pre-inheritance discussion and they exchanged
pictures for money and objets d'art. If I die, there will be no discussion
about it. Everything has been divided up.'
The family wrangle has uncomfortable echoes of the fate of his father's
collection, which forms the Old Master nucleus of the 850 paintings on show
in Madrid and Barcelona. This original collection was, against his father's
wishes, dispersed after his death and the present baron spent years trying
to buy it back - pursuing a Fra Angelico Madonna, taken by his sister Margit
in 1948, for 40 years.
Collecting, he says, is like falling in love. 'Only unlike women, the
pictures can't talk back.' He confesses to using an unorthodox method before
pursuing art deals. He plays the solo card game patience 'and if I don't
have to cheat too much to win, I go ahead.'
The future of the collection has been recently uppermost in Baron
Thyssen-Bornemisza's mind. Only two months ago, he was lying near to death
in a Paris hospital after suffering a stroke while undergoing surgery. The
baroness, a vivacious woman who frequently graces the pages of the Spanish
celebrity magazine Hola], attributes his recovery to the intercession of the
Virgin of the Miraculous Medal.
Before long the baron was stirring in his hospital bed, leafing through a
saleroom catalogue and authorising his wife to put in (successful) bids for
a Monet and a Pissarro. His intervention to save the Three Graces is a
further sign of his full recovery. 'And, ' he confides, 'I didn't have to
cheat at patience at all when I played for the Graces. The cards kept coming
up. I kept winning ..'

FT  03 SEP 94 / Arts: Rossini's 'Magpie' revived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Youth Opera, whose eighth season opened at Sadler's Wells this week,
is a Good Cause. In a world where young singers need all the practical
experience they can get, BYO plays a vital role.
With both valuable talent to nurture and a precarious budget to balance the
company's stakes are high, and it can ill afford the errors of judgment that
marred one of its new productions: the contrasting fortunes of The Thieving
Magpie, a heartwarming success, and the lamentable Yevgeny Onegin will, one
hopes, have been instructive. The former was everything it should have been,
and provided Thursday's audience the chance to hear a Rossini masterpiece
not staged in London for over a decade.
The Magpie is a difficult work and perhaps BYO's most ambitious project yet.
Its semiseria genre, balancing humour and pathos, puts pitfalls in the way
of producers, but here Jamie Hayes traces the plot - which hinges on a
sinister miscarriage of justice - from light to darkness and back with a
sure hand. The young cast is given strong direction; the minor characters
illuminated and crowd scenes are effective, especially the march to the
scaffold that fills the raked stage. The show is at once lively - the
eponymous bird being taken by a dancer - and serious. Rauri Murchison's
designs have colourful flair.
The BYO ensemble distinguished itself by getting virtually every word of
Jeremy Sams's excellent translation across. Rosamund Cole stood out for her
brightly sung Ninetta, a performance that seems to promise an exciting
future. Mark Milhofer disclosed a mellifluous high tenor as Giannetto, and
Matthew Hargreaves a well articulated bass as the lecherous Mayor. Stephen
Allen and Joanna Edworthy as Giannetto's parents Fabrizio and Lucia,
Benjamin Bland (Fernando), Heather Shipp (Pippo), and Colin Judson (Isaaco)
all deserve mention. The company's music director, Timothy Dean, conducted
with zest, judging tempos admirably.
The contrast with the previous evening's Tchaikovsky, ruined by sloppy
orchestral playing from the same band and wayward singing from the same
chorus, could not have been greater. Mark Shanahan's conducting was fast and
unfeeling. The production by Wilfred Judd was under-rehearsed and
under-directed. The young singers desperately needed better guidance, but
three in particular survived to emerge with credit: the Swedish soprano
Linda Tuvas was a striking Tatyana, Garry Magee a dark-voiced Onegin, and
Rachel Lambert a strong Filipyevna with a well-focussed mezzo. The show as a
whole, however, is probably best wiped from the BYO annals.
Further performances at Sadler's Wells on Saturday and September 14,15; and
at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre from September 7-10.

At a mere 75 years old, the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra may not have
the venerable status of the Vienna Philharmonic or the Dresden
Staatskapelle, but in its relatively short life it can boast a noble line of
distinguished music directors, including Klemperer, Van Beinum and Giulini.
Moreover, what it lacks in longevity it more than makes up for in the
enthusiasm and expertise with which it delivers up a broad repertoire,
including an enviably healthy proportion of contemporary music. The
technical prowess of the individual players, their unanimity of purpose and
the vivid immediacy of their playing are second to none, and were palpably
evident during the orchestra's two visits to the Proms last Tuesday and
Thursday.
Much of the credit must go to Finland's musical wunderkind, Esa-Pekka
Salonen, who was appointed the orchestra's musical director in 1992. An
outstanding musician, a gifted composer as well as a dynamic conductor, one
can sense the guiding hands of someone who knows music from the inside.
The choice of a work tailor made for them to begin Tuesday's concert,
Lutoslawski's Fourth Symphony, was particularly appropriate - and also
poignant. Lutoslawski, who died last February, himself conducted the British
premiere of this symphony at last year's Proms (it had been premiered in Los
Angeles the February before). The beauty of its many lyrical passages is
self-evident and its powerful climaxes are viscerally exciting; but certain
stiffness characterises its more aggressive material, and the sudden upbeat
ending seems a gratuitous afterthought. Nonetheless, Lutoslawski's fusion of
an uncompromisingly contemporary musical language with genuine accessibility
remains one of the most consistent triumphs of post-war music.
Salonen's involvement with the nuts and bolts of composition is clearly a
potent factor, too, in his attitude to the standard repertoire. His firm
command of overall structure imprints his interpretations with beguiling
logic as well as authority, traits amply demonstrated in a fluent, poised
reading, of Mozart's D-Minor Piano Concerto, K466, with Emanuel Ax an
eloquent and stylish soloist, and a taut, often ecstatic account of
Hindemith's unjustly neglected though sometimes ponderous Symphony Mathis
der Mahler.
Inevitably, the greatest tests for an orchestra and conductor lie in the
major symphonic repertoire. There have certainly been more expansive and
searching readings of Bruckner's Third Symphony. Salonen's relaxed account,
somewhat lacking in the customary Teutonic gravitas and spiritual fervour
was, nonetheless, projected with blazing certainty, as was an immaculately
turned Sibelius Second Symphony. In both cases there was scope for more
subtlety and more expressiveness, though perhaps that may be too much to
expect from an orchestra whose new home, scheduled for completion in 1997,
is to be called The Walt Disney Concert Hall.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Arts: Profitably challenged - The Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brian McMaster has pulled it off. He planned a challenging programme for the
1994 Edinburgh Festival - a seven and a half hour Oresteia in Russian; three
and a half hours of Antony and Cleopatra in German without an interval, and
more - yet is contemplating a 30 per cent increase in ticket sales and
record box-office revenue of Pounds 1.8m.
The good financial result, which means a minimal loss at the worst, owes
little to the foreign drama. It was the well received music and dance which
saw the festival home. The bias towards Beethoven has enabled the Usher Hall
to be 81 per cent full; the Queen's Hall, 84 per cent full. The American
ballet companies were a roaring success, at least critically, and Mark
Morris is already committed to bringing his dancers back in 1995.
In contrast the Oresteia sold 2,000 out of 3,700 seats, but McMaster was
delighted. 'We should programme difficult things, special festival events.
If we are doing our job well, drama will always be controversial. I will be
intellectually rigorous again next year. Only if we had failed would I have
been forced to think about more popular works.'
For a festival with 150 performances, there were remarkably few crises. The
NDR Symphony Orchestra of Hamburg cancelled one performance and Franz Welser
Most and two sopranos belatedly ducked out of Schumann's rarely-played
Faust, which caused a few artistic and financial headaches as substitutes
were rallied. But McMaster can credibly claim: 'I've had the most wonderful
three weeks.'
The major disappointments were a new work by Robert Lepage The Seven Streams
of the River Ota and the static Torquato Tasso, but the rest of the
programme found at least some fanatical supporters. McMaster is happiest at
the way the Festival has nourished artists, most obviously Peter Stein and
Mark Morris but also the pianist Richard Goode, who sold 30 per cent of the
Queen's Hall two years ago; 50 per cent last year, and has queues around the
block this time for his Beethoven programmes.
Next year will bring a major opera company to the Festival Theatre and
probably another visit from Peter Stein. Much still needs to be planned, but
with funding apparently secure, McMaster can concentrate on his next
ambition - finding a proper HQ for the Festival.
On the Fringe it was not quite so simple. Here drama was strong and one
production, Tom Courtney's one-man show Moscow Stations is being fought over
by the Riverside Studios, the West End and New York - but stand-up comedy is
losing its appeal and no comic alternative has yet emerged. Some venues,
especially the smartened-up Pleasance reported ticket sales up by over 20
per cent while the biggest Fringe venue, The Assembly Rooms, was 5 per cent
down. Director Bill Burdett-Coutts blamed the rail strike. Overall the
Fringe office sold around Pounds 1m worth of tickets, about the same as last
year. New director, Hilary Strong, had a quiet initiation, with no scandals.
She plans to grade venues in terms of facilities and to try to open more
ticket offices around town to make customer access to the 1,300-odd fringe
productions easier next year.
There is an Edinburgh stand-off between McMaster and the city's other
cultural heavyweight, Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries
of Scotland. McMaster wants total control of the Festival and refuses to
accept Clifford's ambitiously-planned art exhibitions in the official
programme.
Clifford is carrying on regardless - next year's big one will be devoted to
Scottish art. But as the Festival ends today, Clifford is the happiest man
in Edinburgh. He could confirm that Baron Thyssen was giving the Pounds
800,000 needed to keep the Three Graces in the UK. They will make their
Edinburgh debut in the National Gallery next August.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Arts: Stand-ups lose out - The Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Edinburgh Fringe has sent an unequivocal signal to the funnybone of the
nation - the day of the stand-up comedian is over, writes Antony Thorncroft.
No more will audiences accept that rambling monologues about the contents of
a bathroom cabinet are necessarily hilarious. Resistance is mounting to
comedians who intrusively question the sexual habits of people whose only
crime is that they have paid to see a show.
Of course attractive personalities, competent entertainers and imaginative
jokers will survive. But the era of unsuccessful actors who embraced
stand-up because it enabled them to show off in public has passed.
The death knell came from the Perrier Award for the best comedy act on the
Fringe. Five stand-ups, including the surrealistically original Harry Hill,
were knocked down and the money went to a pair of Australians whose comic
roots streched down to music-hall and beyond.
Lano and Woodley have a little of Morecambe and Wise in their cosy
domesticity; more of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis in John Cane's aggressive
good-looking dominance and Frank Wood's screwball innocent passiveness; and
whole lashings of the silent movies.
But Lano and Woodley won the Perrier because they were not stand-ups. Scott
Capurro was voted Most Promising Newcomer because there were just so many
gay American comedians on the Fringe this year. Cappuro describes himself
precisely as a cross between Karen Carpenter and Barry Manilow. He begins
perched on a stool, all camp confidence - 'Let's get the big question out of
the way - are you Barbara or Judy?'  - but soon wallows in homosexual angst
and gay initiation rites. To a nation that has taken Julian Clary to its
fireside bosom the only reaction to this sob stuff is: 'So what?'
Another American, Will Durst, is a graduate of the 'ain't life odd' school
of comedy, University of California Campus. His material is unashamedly
American, which means, as a good left wing stand-up, he has problems
knocking Bill Clinton. Still with a catchphrase 'Only in America', he is
scarcely bereft of targets.
Of Ross Perott: 'Elect a billionaire for president instead of a politician
and cut out the middle man.' Of politicians generally: 'Voting is like
swimming towards the least hungry shark.' It is depressing stuff: there are
no heroes here. His life view, and act, is summed up in his pay-off.
''Carter, Nixon and Kennedy are in a sinking ship. Women and children
first,' said Carter. 'Screw them', says Nixon. 'I thought we already had,'
said Kennedy. 'The last one to leave can turn out the light.''
It is a relief to turn to English eccentrics. Richard Herring is Fat, which
is the name of the show, but Herring is also funny. His scene is food - his
'chocolate raison d'etre' - and his imagination runs amok as he justifies
putting on a stone or two in research to reveal, almost plausibly, that God
is Mr Kipling: you never see him; and he turns rubbish into beautiful food.
His cleverness just about allows him to get away with a ramshackle format,
reminiscent of the Goons on a good day.
For well-turned wit, pointed social comment and verbal pyrotechnics you
still cannot beat Kit and the Widow. This is their 10th year on the Fringe
and they celebrate by dragging it up in kilt and trews and giving a potted
history of their Edinburgh nights. From 1984 when they shared a flat with
Hugh Grant - Huge Grunts in those days - through to 1987 when the Widow -
'the Holly Hunter of light entertainment' - first spoke, to now when their
annual update on the Royal Family, 'Postcards from the Edge' remains the
definitive history of the Windsors.
The new songs are strong. The Jackson-Presley union is celebrated in 'a
marriage made in Neverland - where little boys disappear without trace' and
Kit gets to camp his socks off as Marlene Dietrich unable to get her tongue
round 'Raspberry Ripple Rouser'. With their own tongues firmly up their
innuendos, Kit and the Widow get away with more bawdy than a busload of
stand-ups.
With almost 200 comedy shows straining for a laugh on the Fringe some smiles
are inevitable. Among the new faces who scored was Julian Dutton, with an
act that has been banished for more than a politically correct decade -
impersonations of famous actors. But his Albert Finney is auditioning for
Thunderbirds: His John Le Mesurier for the role of the Godfather; and Robert
de Niro for Noddy. Well, he got through to me.

LIFE OF THE PARTY: THE BIOGRAPHY OF PAMELA DIGBY CHURCHILL HAYWARD HARRIMAN
by Christopher Ogden Little, Brown Dollars 24.95, 504 pages
It is necessary to start with a confession, at which book reviewers are
often negligent. About two years ago I once had a date with Pamela Harriman.
It was not that sort of assignation. Our first meeting was merely the result
of a typical Washington dinner circumstance - ie my wife was still in
London, my hosts needed an extra man to complement her presence and that was
that. The discussion was mostly politics and Mrs Harriman made a forceful,
articulate case for the merits of one Bill Clinton (she liked Al Gore, too).
I had heard she would be charming company and she certainly was, to the
extent that I recall floating home in the dazzle of her smile.
A year or so later it came as no surprise when Clinton, now president,
nominated her to be ambassador to France. After all, she had been, as much
as anyone, responsible for the financial revitalisation of a demoralised
Democratic Party in the 1980s and had then been the Clintons' entree to the
rarified reaches of Washington power, social and political.
In any case, embassies, big and small, are often offered to political
supporters regardless of nominal qualifications. Over in London, the just
departed Ray Seitz was the first career diplomat ever to represent the US at
the Court of St James. She was confirmed by the Senate without demur and, by
all accounts, is now doing a first class professional job in Paris.
But her road from a stately home in Minterne Magna in Dorset, the daughter
of an unremarkable, reserved conservative peer, to sole possession in her
own right of the grand residence on the Faubourg St Honore is surely one of
the most remarkable ever travelled by a single human of either sex this
century. Christopher Ogden's book, even if written with less verve and style
than its subject has always possessed, has the wonderful virtue of leaving
virtually no stones unturned; and what stones.
This was to have been a collaborative venture between Mrs Harriman and Mr
Ogden. According to the author, she withdrew after a publishing house had
made an advance offer of such magnitude than he told her that to justify it
there could be no dissembling. She baulked, but he had 40 hours of frank
interviews and lots of other material besides under his belt, over which she
had no claim. Her lawyers tried to stop him but he persisted.
The end product may not be kind to Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward Harriman,
once described by her second husband as the 'last great courtesan of the
century.' But it is very hard not to admire what she has accomplished and
even, for those disinclined to make moral judgments, how she did it.
Consider, first, the men in her life. She wed three of them - Randolph
Churchill, only son of Winston; Leland Hayward, the Broadway impresario; and
finally Averell Harriman, 30 years after a first torrid wartime affair with
the US statesman while still nominally married to the lecherous, drunken
Randolph.
Then consider some of the men she bedded in a blitzed London where living
for the moment, not the morrow, was often the rule of the game: Ed Murrow,
the legendary US wartime broadcaster from London, who, in the end, would
never leave his wife; probably Bill Paley of CBS; two flying commanders,
'Peter' Portal of the RAF and Fred Anderson of the US Air Force; and 'Jock'
Whitney, also later to be US ambassador.
For a dozen years after the war, in postwar Paris and on Mediterranean
villas and yachts there was the Aly Kahn, Gianni Agnelli and Elie de
Rothschild and, possibly, Stavros Niarchos. In the US, after Hayward's
death, it looks as though there was, briefly, Frank Sinatra. Though
opportunities presented themselves, there was never John Kennedy.
She lived through and in extraordinary times. Her relationships with
Harriman and Murrow made her, when barely out of her teens, a catalyst in
the ever closer Anglo-American relationship before Pearl Harbour. At least
this is the role that Beaverbrook and Harry Hopkins, FDR's right hand,
encouraged her to play and one to which Churchill himself had no objection,
since it suited his purposes, he was fond of her and knew only too well
Randolph's awful shortcomings. She was in regular attendance at the prime
minister's table. When she left for Paris last year, she read from a letter
sent to her by Charles de Gaulle after one such occasion.
At the other end of the scale of importance, she learned the hard way that
years of skilful, attentive service to the likes of Agnelli's jet set could
bring a luxurious lifestyle and baubles beyond number (and she acquired
superb but expensive taste) but never emotional or financial security. She
was, simply, too independent and, lack of formal education notwithstanding,
too intelligent ever to be the sort of woman they would marry or desert a
wife for. When Rothschild ditched her, she saw the limits of European
glamour - she already had fallen out of love with her native England - and
fled to the US.
There is a lot about the nasty Pamela in this book. Mr Ogden tells in
excruciating detail of her neglect of young Winston (The Child), her
animosity to the Hayward children (already recounted in Brooke Hayward's
1977 memoir, Haywire), her determination to eliminate all evidence of Marie
Harriman's long marriage to Averell, her manipulation of the old statesman
in his dotage. No wonder she withdrew her cooperation.
But her widow's years have been good to her bank account, to her looks and
to her reputation, nothing more than the approval and affection of tough
political cookies like Bob Strauss and, before his fall, Clark Clifford. She
is now free to wheel, deal, think and exercise authority. Few of the great
courtesans of history ever ended in such glory.

THE RAPE OF EUROPA by Lynne H. Nicholas Macmillan Pounds 20, 498 pages
Art and war usually lie at the opposite ends of human experience, although
they meet sometimes in literature. But the fine arts presuppose peace: the
opportunity for the creation of painting and sculpture, and the repose
needed for their enjoyment, are fruits of tranquillity.
What, then, when art and war enter a different relationship, when
destructive, all-embracing modern war threatens to incinerate art galleries,
demolish cathedrals and museums, reduce statues to rubble, annihilate in
seconds the rich distillations of culture which have formed over centuries?
It is a 20th-century phenomenon that when great powers set upon each other,
everything is at risk, our lives and material treasures most of all.
One of the least known facets of the second world war is the fate suffered
by European art. In a book of brilliance Lynne Nicholas relates the period's
history from the novel perspective of what happened to Europe's material
culture under the Nazis. She tells the tale with absorbing narrative skill,
making an extraordinary achievement of scholarship read like a thriller.
Hitler and Goering were fanatical art collectors. Whereas the latter was
fairly catholic in his tastes, the former did not have tastes - he just knew
what he liked and disliked. He liked 19th-century German paintings, and he
disliked 'degenerate art', which meant Impressionism, Expressionism, Cubism
 -and anything that looked distorted or 'unfinished'.
Another difference between Hitler and Goering was that whereas the latter
collected for himself, crowding his vast and vulgar palace, Carinhall, with
every sort of art, Hitler had imperial ambitions. He wished to turn his
Austrian hometown Linz into one of four great cultural centres of the Reich,
and the best art plundered from Jews and conquered neighbouring countries
was destined to hang there in a magnificent public art gallery he planned
for the city. By the end of the war the Linz gallery had accumulated 8,000
pictures, nearly twice the holding built up over a much longer period at
Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum.
But the Linz plan was merely one corner of a vast displacement of art around
Europe during Hitler's 12 years, caused by many factors. The Nazis sold
'degenerate' art abroad to earn foreign currency. They looted art from Jews
and from occupied territories. The experience of the Prado collection during
Spain's Civil War persuaded curators everywhere in Europe, including
Britain, to make plans for safeguarding works of art against air attack; and
as soon as hostilities impended, tens of thousands of paintings, statues,
objets d'art, rare books and manuscripts were transported into the cellars
of castles beyond the Loire, quarries in Wales, and storerooms of
monasteries in remote corners of the Italian countryside.
With their usual thoroughness the German occupying administrations in
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Holland and France - after some resistance, in this
last case, from the military government in occupied Paris - appropriated
vast stores of art. Guises of legitimacy were devised: any German art later
than 1500 AD was 'returned' to the Fatherland on the grounds that it had
been stolen in earlier wars. Jewish-owned art was simply confiscated. Public
art collections were 'safeguarded', an official euphemism for theft.
When the Allies invaded first Italy and then Normandy, they took with them a
desperately understaffed group of men detailed to protect the cultural
treasures that would be encountered in battle areas. This heroic group
managed much with their slender resources. Their greatest triumph, arguably,
was in preventing the US from appropriating works of art from Germany by way
of war reparations. A batch of 200 pictures was shipped from the American
zone in Germany to Washington where it might have formed part of a handsome
covering for the National Gallery's then under-occupied wall spaces. But
there was a vociferous protest from a group of courageous American
'Monuments' officers based in Germany, and in the resulting controversy the
US returned the works after they had been displayed to huge crowds at
galleries in various cities.
For this, and for their work in rescuing art at the close of the war, the
Allies' Monuments men turn out to be the heroes of Nicholas's tale. It is a
tale without an ending, because many works are still missing; and some great
achievements in material culture were destroyed, and can never be replaced.
And that, in the end, is the real danger in what happens when art and war
mix.

<TEXT>
YOU CAN'T DO BOTH by Kingsley Amis Hutchinson Pounds 15.99,306 pages
I have it on good authority that when, some time ago, Sir Kingsley Amis was
approached for his support for the 'Swansea - City of Literature' campaign,
the distinguished man of letters replied, '---- off]' This may seem an
understandable reaction from someone who once spent 12 years as a junior
lecturer in that town, although in his Memoirs he wrote sentimentally of the
place.
It is a reminder that Amis has a thing about South Wales and the Welsh -
nothing so strong as love-hate, more an appalled fascination, an exasperated
affection. Certainly the principality (a word he must surely detest) has
served him well in his fiction, never better than in the Booker-winning The
Old Devils which, with its TV version, brought him less than a welcome west
of the Valleys.
South Wales provides only one of the minor locations in his new novel, You
Can't Do Both, but his main characters are all Welsh at one remove and are
always conscious of it - the 'hero' Robin, the girl friend Nancy, and their
four parents.
The blurb cannot resist telling us that You Can't Do Both will be seen by
some (not this reader) as 'a precursor to Lucky Jim', presumably on the
grounds that Robin Davies, whom we follow from teens to parenthood, is of
the same generation and the same profession as Jim Dixon. Come to think of
it, just like Sir Kingsley] - which must be why the blurb also clumpingly
declares that this novel is 'strongly autobiographical'.
Can that be true, and does it matter? Robin Davies is brought up in South
London, enjoys his grammar school, visits family in Wales, goes up to
Oxford, serves unheroically in the war, becomes a red-brick don, makes his
Nancy pregnant, snatches her back from an abortionist, marries her, and
continues with his selfish ways until . . .
Let's allow that Amis may be drawing more heavily than is usual on his
recollections of adolescence and young manhood: there are plenty of
references which sound echoes from the Memoirs (which was not an
autobiography but a sequence of sketches), and the early chapters are no
doubt based on his childhood in Norbury, never mind the later scenes of
Oxford colleges, Cardiff abortionists and registry office weddings.
What matters is that Amis is on masterly form, with proof on every page that
he can write the most brilliantly accurate dialogue in the trade. And of
course, he can be very funny indeed, though it is often the humour of
embarrassment. There are two magnificently awful fathers.
Robin Davies is another version of the favourite character - the plausible,
intelligent, sex-obsessed, self-aware young man - whom Amis would (and does)
call a shit (yes, in the tradition of Jim Dixon, and he makes funny faces
too). He knows that 'he was almost an ideal non-husband for Nancy, being
selfish, self-indulgent, lazy, arrogant and above all inextinguishably
promiscuous by nature'; about marriage he feels 'apathy relieved with
horror', yet he is caught in an insoluble dilemma and marries the sweet and
not-quite-convincing Nancy. I quote:
'A few minutes later, Nancy said, 'I've remembered something else my Dad
said about you. No, it was my Mum. No, it was my Dad. I know it doesn't
matter which really. Or at all. Anyway, he said you were the kind of man who
thinks only of his own pleasure'.
'This Robin heard with definite indignation. He said, 'I'd like to know how
he makes that out, I must say. If that's all I was interested in, what the
hell does he think I'm doing getting married to you? Jesus Christ.'' Here is
the genuine Amis: colloquial, fast, witty, acid, and conveying character.
But there is a more serious burden to this morality tale, growing out of the
comic routines which Amis uses to reveal the curiously loving relationship
between father and son.
Robin's father turns out to be the shadow-side of the Welsh preachers he has
left behind, just as it is Nancy's father who spots that Robin is 'the kind
of Welshman who gets Welsh people a bad name. Very charming on the surface
and treacherous underneath.'

FT  03 SEP 94 / Books: More words on Woolf - But Anthony Curtis finds that
this overview avoids overkill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
VIRGINIA WOOLF by James King Hamish Hamilton Pounds 25, 699 pages
It may not seem like it to those readers suffering from Bloomsbury bulimia,
but as James King, professor of English at McMaster University, Ontario, is
at pains to point out, this is the first full-scale biography of Virginia
Woolf since the one by Quentin Bell in 1972.
The years that followed Bell's sparely written life of his aunt saw the
publication of the five volumes of her diaries and the six volumes of her
letters. Then Andrew McNeillie began to edit a complete edition of the
essays of Virginia Woolf (including all her scattered book-reviews, many of
which were originally anonymous). With the appearance recently of Volume 4
(The Hogarth Press, Pounds 35.00) this edition has reached the year 1928.
Two more volumes will take it up to Woolf's death in 1941.
Thus the millions of words she wrote both privately and professionally
during her tragically curtailed lifetime are now all in the public domain.
Even the laconic diary she kept at Asheham in Sussex in 1917-18 before the
move to Rodmell, hitherto only partially printed in Volume 1 of the diaries,
is now available in full in the current number of The Charleston Magazine
(Issue 9, available from Charleston Farmhouse, Firle, Lewes, BN8 6LL at
Pounds 2.95).
Faced by such a mass of primary material - not to mention all the secondary
and related sources that have mushroomed - an overview of the writer, the
self-destructive drives that accompanied her endless literary creativity,
her ironical exposure of the injustices perpetrated upon women, is surely
much to be welcomed. King has avoided over-kill and organised his book
judiciously. He uncovers the autobiographical elements in the works while
integrating his subject's development as an artist with the many intense
relations she had with other people.
These relations form a set of concentric circles - first the family ones
including female cousins like Madge Vaughan and older women like Violet
Dickinson, to whom as a girl Virginia was very close. Then the men, her
brother Thoby's Cambridge contemporaries who became Bloomsbury, including
Lytton Strachey and Leonard Woolf. Finally, a wider circle of writers and
artists like Katherine Mansfield, Vita Sackville-West, TS Eliot, Hugh
Walpole who were not part of Bloomsbury but whom she came to know intimately
as her fame spread.
King is a sensitive scholar who leads us patiently through a richly varied
life with fresh insights to offer about episodes familiar from earlier
accounts. The least judgmental of biographers, he cannot avoid presenting
Virginia's half-brothers, George and Gerald Duckworth, as the villains of
this Cinderella-like story. We have her word - in papers she wrote and read
to the Memoir Club, a small private society within Bloomsbury - that she was
abused sexually by both of them: by Gerald when she was six who fondled her
and by George, who tried to rape her in her bedroom after a dance.
The precise extent of the abuse remains obscure. One should remember that
Woolf was capable of fantasising - as in one spectacular instance after
Thoby's death; she pretended to Violet that he was still alive sending her
details of the improvement in his condition. But even without the activities
of the half-brothers Duckworth (Gerald was to become the publisher of her
first novel) she suffered a series of bereavements when she was growing up
that were in themselves more than enough to de-stabilise her finely poised
mind.
Her mother Julia's death in 1895 at the age of 49 was followed two years
later by that of her half-sister Stella, who had assumed the maternal role
in the family. Virginia was 15. Her tyrannical but lovable father Leslie
Stephen died in 1904 when she was 22; her brother Thoby died aged 26 in
1906; and her nephew Julian Bell was killed in the Spanish Civil War.
Her recovery from her breakdowns, to the point where she could write her
novels and reviews and even re-create the process of losing control of
reality in the character of Septimus Warren Smith, was a minor miracle.
Though innately anti-Semitic she found her personal salvation through
marrying Leonard Woolf, a Jew, who gave up a very un-Jewish kind of career
in the Ceylon Civil Service where he was rising meteorically up the
administrative ladder. He became instead a writer and a devoted husband. Her
lesbian tendency was already apparent and marriage did not eliminate it.
Marital sex was another of Leonard's sacrifices.
The marriage survived an endless series of upheavals, including Virginia's
intense sense of rivalry with other women authors, notably Katherine
Mansfield, and with her sister Vanessa with whose husband, Clive Bell, she
flirted outrageously, precipitating Vanessa's lifelong passion for the
homosexual painter Duncan Grant.
When Viriginia was 43 she entered upon her passionate friendship with Vita.
This did not become a long, full-blooded affair, like those Vita had with
Hilda Matheson and Gwen St Aubyn. According to King they only slept together
twice but afterwards remained firm friends. Orlando was as much a requiem as
a celebration.
The composer Ethel Smyth, another attachment, sends a breath of irreverent
fresh air through this hothouse informing Virginia that she hated everything
Bloomsbury stood for. VW's ups-and-downs in her relations with all her
friends were mirrored in her attitude to her work. She see-sawed
bewilderingly between exaltation and utter despair and was over-sensitive to
reviews and verbal criticism.
After King's thorough biography, which inevitably concludes with her suicide
in 1941 as the threat of Nazi invasion loomed, we will not need another life
of Virginia Woolf for some time to come.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Books: Deep into the heart of Greeneland - The chronicler of
20th century man's consciousness is the subject of four new literary
biographies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asked about his chances of winning the Nobel Prize, Graham Greene replied
that he was looking forward to a much bigger prize: death. He thought
himself 'not a bad writer,' but he would have liked 'to be mentioned with
the truly great, who all seem to belong to the 19th century.'
In the years since he died in 1991, it has become clear that Greene does fit
in the company of the truly great. What Dickens was for the 19th, Greene is
for the 20th century: the only serious literary writer to enjoy a mass
audience. Like Dickens, his genius was to take a popular fictional form -
the thriller, and, in books from Brighton Rock and The Power and the Glory
to The Third Man and Monsignor Quixote, to turn that form into a serious
work without losing its widespread appeal. His finger was always on the
popular pulse and, as we now look to Dickens to understand the Victorians,
so Greene's themes speak for our century: angst and neuroses, a fascination
with evil, intellectual and spiritual doubt, cruelty and persecution.
Nothing fixes Greene as a figure for our time better than his new role as
star of that late 20th century blockbuster genre, the literary biography. In
the last six weeks, three rival biographies of Greene have appeared, with a
fourth due this month. The best of them, volume two of Norman Sherry's
authorised Life (Cape Pounds 20), covering the years 1939-55, shows how
biography has become today's equivalent of the Victorian triple-decker
novel: long, leisured, heavyweight; intimate in its discussions of its
hero's most raw emotions. David Copperfield, Jane Eyre, Jude the Obscure are
all fictional biographies or autobiographies. In a post-modern age we have
become too embarrassed and cynical to invent such lives, but reading about
them is deeply satisfying and publishing them lucrative. Literary biography,
therefore, which dovetails fact with fiction by showing how one fed the
other, has taken the place of the Victorian fictional bestseller. And just
as David Copperfield or Jude the Obscure distilled Victorian dilemmas about
faith and morality, so the contemporary biography focuses on subjects, like
Greene, who give voice to our own passions and problems.
The new works on Greene are vastly different. Sherry's is sympathetic and
full of insight, Michael Sheldon's Graham Greene: The Man Within (Heinemann
Pounds 20) is critical and carping, while Anthony Mockler's Graham Greene:
Three Lives ('Novelist] Explorer] Spy]') is ignorant and barely literate.
The three books share, however, some uniquely anglo-saxon obsessions. Class,
sex, sin and the relationship between them flood over almost every page.
Since Greene, born in 1904, spans our century, this offers too a panorama of
a changing England. Greene's experiences illuminate key phases in English
history - the Blitz; the Cold War spy ring centred on Philby; the postwar
waning of aristocratic families and their homes, with which Greene was
intoxicated.
The heart of these matters, for Sherry and Sheldon, is Greene's affair with
Catherine Walston, the beautiful, Catholic, promiscuous wife of an English
lord. She was the model for Sarah in The End of the Affair, and a crucial
influence on work such as The Third Man and The Quiet American in Greene's
rich middle period. Sheldon recounts the affair as if in a school report,
with Greene failing every test - immoral in seducing Catherine, pathetic in
failing to tempt her away from her husband, depressive and dully
middle-class because he cannot chum up with her posh friends. Sherry, by
contrast, describes in bitter-sweet prose a liaison reminiscent of
Brideshead Revisited. Greene is the shy bourgeois artist who finds his
identity through Catherine, struggles between desire and Catholic sacrifice
and revels in the world of private jets and pheasant for breakfast.
As a classic of English class fantasy, this is compelling - when the BBC
made a film on Greene last year, producer Anthony Wall said the programme
was 'a story about British toffs, the like of whom we'll never see again.'
What raises it to the level of contemporary myth is the existential torment
underlying the affair.
Life 'on the dangerous edge of things'; the reluctance to accept love,
faith, political ideologies; the desperate escapism: Sherry's Greene has the
tortured inner life of his heroes, from the haunted, hunted whisky priest in
The Power and the Glory in the 1930s to the suicide Scobie in The Heart of
the Matter to baffled Monsignor Quixote in the 1980s.
'I had to find religion, to measure my evil against,' Greene said. It is the
Manichean vision, grafted onto the thriller, that gives intellectual
excitement and psychological resonance to his novels. Of the great writers,
he is the one for whom content and ideas are all, while form and style
hardly count.
Among famous openings, compare, for example, that of Brighton Rock - 'Hale
knew, before he had been in Brighton three hours, that they meant to murder
him' - with those of the two other modern classics of adolescence, Lolita
('Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-li-ta: the
tip of the tongue, taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at
three, on the teeth.') And Catcher in the Rye: ('If you really want to hear
about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born,
and what my lousy childhood was like . . . and all that David Copperfield
kind of crap.')
Unlike Nabokov and Salinger, Greene is not a consciously literary writer and
his cold, flat drawing of Pinkie and Ida therefore translates easily. 'A
polyglot could read Mr Greene,' wrote Evelyn Waugh, 'lay him aside, retain a
sharp memory of all he said and yet . . . entirely forget what tongue he was
using.'
Greene believed the 'splinter of ice' in his heart gave him the necessary
novelist's detachment. But reading Sherry's biography, it seems as if the
reverse may have been true - that Greene wrote to strip away his own
coldness, to make-believe feelings he could never wholly embrace. His
glacial quality, both in life - Sheldon exults in his unsympathetic
responses during the Blitz, and in his frosty relationships - and in
fiction, puts some readers off. Yet it is a feature, along with the almost
deliberate absence of style, which makes his novels quintessentially of our
post-modern, anything-goes, no-commitment times.
I suspect that Sheldon has raised himself to a pitch of antagonism because
in Greene we all see images of ourselves and our times which we do not care
for, and that Sherry, who has devoted 20 years to retracing Greene's steps,
has identified with Greene in an equally intense, but by contrast a
positive, way. As a minute by minute explanation of William Golding's
tribute, that Greene 'will be read and remembered as the ultimate chronicler
of 20th century man's consciousness and anxiety,' Sherry's book is
unputdownable.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Books: Faith in freedom - David Goodhart on a hymn of praise
to civil society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONDITIONS FOR LIBERTY by Ernest Gellner Hamish Hamilton Pounds 18,99, 225
pages
The existence of a flourishing civil society is what distinguishes the west
from post-Marxist or Islamic societies. It is also responsible for most of
what we hold dear, from economic growth to political liberty. Yet we have
little idea how it came about and even find it difficult to define.
Ernest Gellner's idiosyncratic hymn of praise to civil society reflects his
recent re-immersion in the intellectual life of the Czech Republic, where
the recreation of civil society was one of the slogans of the velvet
revolution. Looking from Prague the civil society that we take for granted
becomes a miracle, and one that is not easy to manufacture in a broken-down
monolith like Russia.
Civil society is not just the social residue left when the state is
subtracted. It is altogether more attractive and subtle, requiring both a
central coercive governing authority and economic pluralism. Thus armed it
can sprout a cluster of institutions strong enough to prevent tyranny but
which are entered and left freely. 'You can join (say) the Labour Party
without slaughtering a sheep . . . and you can leave it without incurring
the death penalty for apostasy'.
It is civil society which has led the march to a prosperous, secular, world,
but its main rival - the theocracy or ideocracy where a society is defined
by its faith - has held on in large parts of the globe. Gellner describes
the complex social chemistry which has produced civil society in one place
but not in another. Much of the argument is wise and original, although the
place of the individual and the 'private' in the Judaeo-Christian tradition
seems underplayed.
But this is not an essay for tidy minds. Gellner is one of the last of the
great central European polymath intellectuals. He writes with staggering
erudition and does not bother with hand-rails as the essay twists and turns
through world history and global politics.
Why is Islam growing ever stronger while Marxism has collapsed? Gellner
finds the answer in the shift from the low (folkish) to the high form of
Islam among the masses in Moslem countries. 'The essence of nationalism in
the west is that a high - literacy-linked - culture becomes the pervasive,
membership-defining culture of the total society; the same has happened in
Islam, but it expresses itself in fundamentalism rather than nationalism,
though the two are sometimes conflated'.
In fundamentalist states like Iran there is little civil society and not
much pressure for more. Yet it is not clear that Islam and civil society are
incompatible; Malaysia, Turkey and pre-civil war Bosnia have all combined
them.
Nor is it clear that the desire of many post-Marxist societies to establish,
or re-establish, civil society is sufficient. 'The bourgeoisie which is
being begged to crawl out from under the stones of the Communist monolith
does not look promising. Where are the Forsytheskis and the
Buddenbrookovs?'. He concludes, reluctantly, that China might have made the
right choice in putting economic reform before political reform.
Conversely he is optimistic about the prospects for world government and
expresses none of the fashionable anxieties about the withering of civil
society and the collapse of community in the west.
The parting note is equivocal. Reviewing East Asia's combination of economic
success and almost feudal hierarchy he concludes: 'Whether we like it or
not, the deadly angel who spells death to economic inefficiency is not
always at the service of liberty. He had once rendered liberty some service,
but does not seem permanently at her command. This may sadden those of us
who are liberals and were pleased at being given such a potent ally - but
facts had better be faced'.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Property: Dutch build to provide more room at the top -
Ronald van de Krol reports on a remarkable switch of emphasis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is inconceivable that cities like New York, with its penthouse Central
Park properties, or London, with its Belgravia or Chelsea neighbourhoods,
would ever complain about the lack of expensive, luxury flats to house
high-earning expatriates. But Amsterdam, and the Netherlands generally, are
different. While there is still a commitment to providing affordable housing
for the lowest paid, there is also growing concern about a shortage of
properties at the upper ends of the market.
Indeed, the Dutch capital, reversing decades of emphasis on social housing,
has increasingly started to approve developers' plans for housing that are
aimed at either wealthy home-buyers or rich renters. This conversion is
remarkable, and also controversial, not least because it is taking place in
a city that remains a bastion of the Labour party in a country that is
self-consciously egalitarian.
One sign of the times is a complex of 40 apartments due to be built in the
outlying neighbourhood of Buitenveldert. The project, financed in part by
the pension fund of the Philips electronic group, is a direct result of the
financial community's drive since the late 1980s to boost Amsterdam's
standing in the international banking world.
The fear was that the city, although having plenty of handsome flats on
picturesque canals, was not really able to attract financial high-flyers to
work at Dutch banks because the housing market did not cater to their needs.
'Business people moving here from big cities like New York will not get
doormen or underground parking garages for their cars,' says Jan
Steinhauser, a former deputy director of the Dutch central bank who ran the
financial community's campaign to promote Amsterdam.
The apartment complex planned for Buitenveldert will fill that need. The
flats will also rent for Fl 5,000 (Pounds 1,550) a month, nearly 10 times
the national average.
The development is an extreme example of a much wider trend towards building
more expensive housing in the Netherlands. Even average earners are
struggling to find the next rung up on the housing ladder.
According to figures compiled by the Netherlands Estate Agents Association
(NVM), the most sought-after houses and flats are those selling for around
Fl 300,000, one or two steps up from the average home which sells for Fl
229,200. In both cases, the homes will, almost inevitably, be terraced
properties, reflecting the constraints on space in a crowded country.
With the trend towards higher housing prices almost inexorable - prices rose
by 11 per cent in the 1994 first half, prompting warnings of 'overheating' -
it might seem attractive for expatriates in the Netherlands to buy rather
than rent. This is especially true because the Dutch tax system allows
owners to deduct all mortgage interest payments from their taxable income,
with no upper limit imposed.
At the same time, property prices are relatively low, especially for
newcomers used to London or Paris. A two-bedroom, canal-side apartment right
in the centre of Amsterdam will sell for Fl 450,000 and higher, with the
price determined in part by the prestige of the canal and, crucially, on the
number of windows overlooking the water.
A two to three-window view is average, while a six-window 'frontage' will
immediately put the property into the luxurious category above Fl 600,000.
Most expatriates in the Netherlands on temporary assignments rent rather
than buy, though. 'The vast majority of people who are going to be here for
less than three or four years rent,' says Rosalind Paterson. She is the
British co-director of Formula Two Relocations in Amsterdam, which
specialises in helping to settle expatriate staff in the Netherlands.
Buying is complicated for someone new to the country, especially for
families with properties overseas, but there are exceptions. 'We had one
family recently who consciously bought for investment purposes because they
liked the Netherlands. A good rental property will always find renters,'
Paterson says.
Expatriate business people without children will often choose to live in an
Amsterdam apartment. Those with families tend to go to the 'Gooi', a wealthy
suburban belt between Amsterdam and Amersfoort; or to Wassenaar, an
exclusive suburb of The Hague which is home to many diplomats as well as to
the American School.
Although the Netherlands sounds like a country waiting for a house price
boom, there are factors weighing against speculative purchases. For one
thing, the Dutch view houses as homes, not investments, and simply will not
put themselves heavily in debt in order to get the homes of their dreams.
The advent of two-salary couples has helped to push up house prices, but
most families can still afford to buy an average home on one salary. This,
perhaps, helps to explain why the percentage of Dutch women in the work
force is nearly as low as that of Portugal and Ireland.
The one time in recent history when Dutch housing prices shot up sharply in
a speculative spiral - the late 1970s - ended badly: the second oil crisis
of 1979, and the recession of 1981, caused a severe housing slump. The burst
bubble left many owners with negative equity, and memories of this have
helped to keep a lid on any surge in prices.
Despite a tax system that is kind to owners, the division between rented and
owner-occupied accommodation is roughly 50:50. This is due partly to the
fact that the average rent is still only Fl 539 per month, although the
government is trying to nudge up rents by allowing landlords in the
controlled sector to raise them by 5 per cent a year - about double the rate
of inflation.
Social housing, provided both by municipal authorities and non-profit
housing associations, is of a high standard and its availability is not
limited to those on low wages. From time to time, calls are heard for means
testing that would encourage the better-off to move out of their rented
flats and buy, making room for others. But Dutch people who are lucky enough
to find themselves in a pleasant, rent-protected flat will not be budged.

Philippa Davenport looks at courses, classes and demonstrations being held
this Michaelmas term
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
September heralds the Michaelmas term. Back to school for the young; time
for the not-so-young to consider new beginnings or, perhaps, refresher
courses.
This autumn the choice for aspirant and accomplished cooks seems wider than
ever and evening classes are on the increase.
Those who want to learn new kitchen tricks and culinary skills might reap
much pleasure and benefit from a two-day intensive hands-on workshop run by
Sonia Stevenson. Although alternative courses are sometimes offered,
sauce-making and fish cookery are Stevenson's specialities.
An amazing amount is packed into each day. Classes are restricted to a
maximum of eight participants and tuition is highly personal to accommodate
can't-boil-an-egg types as well as budding Masterchef contestants.
Stevenson, ex chef-patronne of the Horn of Plenty in Devon, is a travelling
tutor. Dates and venues scheduled for the next couple of months include
September 10-11 and 13-14 near Guildford; September 26-27 and 28-9 in
Clapham; October 1-2 and 4-5 in Warwick; a one day course on October 12 in
Norfolk; October 17-18 near Liskeard; October 29-30 and November 5-6 near
Edinburgh. Two-day courses cost Pounds 158. For further details and
bookings, tel: 0752-851813.
If you prefer to leave your apron at home and be entertained as you pick up
a few culinary ideas, demonstrations might suit you better. In London,
Divertimenti, the well-known cookshop, has created a demonstration theatre
area in the centre of its Fulham Road emporium.
Performing there are cookery writers and chefs, often with new books to
promote. Each demonstration lasts about 2 1/2 hours and costs Pounds 24.
Sessions start at either 10am or 7pm.
Forthcoming attractions include restaurateur Stephen Bull on September 6;
Robin Weir, ice-cream maker, on September 20; Marie-Pierre Moine, the
increasingly popular and highly respected French-born food writer, on
October 18; Lindsey Bareham, author of two of my favourite books, In Praise

Lady Macdonald is a cook rooted in the country house tradition. Her style is
confident and practical. Her food is blessedly unpretentious. She writes and
speaks with bubbling enthusiasm, is a good lateral thinker and has a gift
for vivid description. No slavish follower of passing fads and fashions, she
is not afraid of roux-based sauces and has a sensible old-fashioned respect
for butter and cream used in their proper place. Nor is she extravagant: her
recipes often make use of such ingredients as mussels, kidneys and praline,
none of them noted bank robbers.
Here is a sample taste of her cooking from Suppers (Doubleday Pounds 15.99)
to be published on September 8.
OYSTERS WITH GINGER &amp; SPRING ONIONS (Serves 6)
This is an aromatic and original way to serve oysters instead of slipping
them raw and briny down the throat. Serve with boiled Basmati rice and a
crunchy salad.
Depending on their size, allow 5-6 oysters per person for a main course (or
3 for a first course); about 2 inches fresh root ginger; 18-20 good spring
onions (not weedy grass-thin ones); 3 tablespoons sunflower oil;  1/2 pt
single cream.
Method: Shell the oysters. Peel the ginger and cut the flesh into fine
slivers. Trim the spring onions and cut diagonally into  1/4 -inch slices.
Heat the oil in a wide shallow pan (saute or frying pan) and cook the ginger
and spring onions, stirring continuously, for about 3 minutes. Then add the
oysters and cook for a few seconds before pouring on the cream. Let the
cream bubble for about a minute. Season with salt and pepper, tip into a
warmed dish and serve as soon as possible.
LEEKS IN HAM IN GOAT'S CHEESE SOUFFLE (Serves 6)
This is essentially a variation on the classic dish of chicory wrapped in
ham and cloaked in cheese sauce. A salad dressed with walnut oil is
recommended for serving on the side.
12 medium leeks, trimmed, well washed and steamed till just tender; 12 very
thin slices of ham; 2oz butter; 2oz self-raising flour;  3/4 pt milk; salt,
lots of freshly ground black pepper and a grating of nutmeg;  1/2 lb fresh
creamy goats' cheese; 4 large eggs, separated.
Method: Butter an oval or oblong ovenproof dish. Wrap each just-cooked leek
in a slice of ham and lay them in the dish. Melt the butter in a saucepan
and stir in the flour. Cook for a minute before pouring in the milk,
gradually. Stir continuously till the sauce boils.
Take the pan off the heat, season and stir in the goats' cheese. Beat in the
yolks, one by one, then whisk the whites until they are very stiff. With a
large metal spoon, fold the whisked whites quickly and thoroughly through
the cheese sauce. Pour the mixture over the ham-wrapped leeks. Bake straight
away or set aside, covered, for 2-3 hours before cooking if more convenient.
Bake at 425F (220C) gas mark 7 for 30 minutes. The souffle mixture should be
very slightly runny in the middle when served.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A bottle of Spanish Australian - Wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON

<TEXT>
This is the time of year when ambitious southern hemisphere winemakers are
heading for the vineyards of Europe, there to double their vintage
experience and exchange high-tech expertise for a sniff round the cellars of
the Old World, where they are temporarily employed.
The Australian giant Penfolds, for example, is flying in a team to Val
d'Orbieu, its opposite number in the Languedoc. Ocker meets paysan.
The usual distinguishing features of these winemaking incomers are that they
need gumboots (to satisfy their obsession with water and winery hygiene) and
much less sleep and food than the natives ('the wine doesn't take a lunch
hour or weekends, mate').
They also tend to work at low, low temperatures and add special antioxidants
and yeast nutrients so that the wines taste immediately appealing if more
uniform and vapid than traditional models.
At a giant tasting of wines made mainly last year, Safeway brought some of
us wine writers up short by deciding to group its wines by whether they were
made by itinerant oenologists ('flying winemakers'), or by what they almost
patronisingly called 'local talent'.
It was rather shocking to realise how rapidly it has become a novelty that a
wine should be made by someone who has watched the vines bud, leaf and
flower throughout the growing season, someone whose livelihood is
necessarily linked to the fortunes of that wine region.
I thought of this when I tasted recently, chez Sainsbury, the peripatetic
Hugh Ryman's Santara Chardonnay 1993, Pounds 3.95 at the top 120 stores. It
actually comes from Conca de Barbera in Spanish Catalonia (where the
Chardonnay for Miguel Torres' revered Milmanda is grown) and yet, to my
palate at least, it is pure Australia, effusively fruity and ready-to-gulp,
'with the added complexity of a light oak flavour', according to the back
label. Smell those wood shavings.
Santara is probably a very smart move on Sainsbury's part as the prices of
Australian Chardonnay from Australia continue to rise, but Spanish and
Australian wine producers should feel shivers down their respective spines.
Compare and contrast with, for example, La Porcii Chardonnay 1992, Pounds
5.99 at larger Tesco stores. In this case an Australian winemaker, Yalumba's
Brian Walsh, seems to have relished his winter playtime in the northern
hemisphere by celebrating the differences between his regular diet of South
Australian fruit and this Languedoc Chardonnay, doing his damnedest to
transform it into a Montra-chet.
Served at exactly the right temperature (not too cold) this rather
unappetisingly named wine could be taken for something much smarter than a
Vin de Pays d'Oc, and reflects glory on both Australia and the Languedoc -
although I should point out that neither Conca de Barbera nor the Languedoc
have a long history of Chardonnay production to be used as a stylistic guide
by incoming winemakers.
There are, fortunately, instances of incomer winemakers who take the local
style and smoothly move it up two or three gears so as to provide an
entirely new cruising speed for the region's own winemakers.
Last September the glamorous Gaetane Carron flew in to north-east Italy from
her principal employers Concha y Toro in Chile and leaves us with the
stunning Pinot Grigio Ca'Pradai 1993 Bidoli, Pounds 3.49 from Asda, which is
remarkably similar to her Pinot Grigio 1993, Grave del Friuli, Pounds 3.99
from Safeway.
Quite unlike the tart, anaemic norm that has been Pinot Grigio, her version
is full, soft, and quite dramatically more fruity and long-flavoured.
Bravissima.
Really attentive readers of this column may remember that elsewhere in Italy
last year, the flamboyant Australian winemaker Geoff Merrill was beavering
away on behalf of Sainsbury's wine department.
By far the most appealing result, as far as this warped, varietally
conservationist palate is concerned, is Sainsbury's Teroldego Rotaliano,
Pounds 3.95 which is a deep, inky, red with lots of tang and just as much
lively fruit, but no harsh tannins whatsoever, so that it could be served at
almost any temperature and would be very delicious gently chilled.
Merrill was also responsible for Sainsbury's Grechetto dell'Umbria, Pounds
3.69 which is another admirably distinctive rendition of a local grape
variety - in this case a scented dry white with real backbone, good fruit, a
little bit of bite, and a dire label.
It is a proportion of Grechetto grapes which so usefully distinguish
Antinori's delicious Cervaro - about Pounds 20 from Italian specialists such
as Valvona &amp; Crolla of Edinburgh - from any other barrel fermented
Chardonnay.
I am all for incomer winemakers who show their respect for the native region
by interpreting what it has to offer, and preferably showing the locals how
to make that something even more appealing to the outside world.
Nick Butler's whistle-clean Sainsbury's Moravian Gruner Veltliner 1993
Pounds 2.95, for example, is just the sort of lively, punchy, racy,
unmistakeably central European wine that we all hoped would flow from the
Czech Republic.
Hugh Ryman himself has done wonders for tons of Semillon and Sauvignon
grapes in south-west France. His Ch l'Ortolan 1993 Entre-Deux-Mers, Pounds
3.95 at Sainsbury's, is just one of many current examples, and Thresher/Wine
Rack/Bottoms Up have many more.
But I find it unsettling when 'local talent' and actual location are
blatantly ignored in favour of a commercially expedient reproduction of a
style that belongs on the other side of the world.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Outdoors: Downhiller without a lift - Financial Times
Round-the-World Ski Expeditio / Arnie Wilson becomes a social misfit in
Australia's biggest cross country ski area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker have reached Australia and New Zealand as they
attempt to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition.
Door to door, it took us 28 hours to travel from the Chapa Verde ski area,
high above the world's largest underground Copper Mine in Chile, to
Whakapapa, the biggest ski resort in Australasia, via Easter Island, Tahiti
and Auckland.
For 4,996 miles we flew economy with LanChile, crossing the date line, and
the next 2,544 miles first class with Air New Zealand.
At last, instead of smiling politely while Lucy chatted away in Spanish, I
could speak the language. Hearing the Kiwi twang made me homesick for
London's Earl's Court. It was the first time I had been called 'sir' for
months.
Now, as freezing New Zealand rain washed the Chilean mud from our skisuits,
Ruapehu volcano, was playing hard to get. Or at least hard to see.
We knew it was out there somewhere because Dan Underwood, our ski patrol
companion kept telling us what a wonderful view we would have had of its
lofty, snow encrusted pinnacles - if only we had not been skiing in a wet
and windy white-out.
Occasionally, for a second or two, we glimpsed one of Ruapehu's many frozen
peaks. What had happened to Whakapapa's claims of 'perfect weather'?
Finally, after three days, Ruapehu revealed itself in all its glory,
sparkling from top to bottom in the noonday sun against a cornflower blue
sky. Two other nearby volcanoes - Tongariro and Ngauruhoe - sprang from the
mist too. It was the most glorious sight. You could see why this has been
christened the Magic Mountain.
It is also an active mountain, as are the other volcanoes: notices at the
Grand Chateau Hotel have a 'Lahar' warning (an Indonesian word for the
torrential flow of water-saturated debris and mud channelled from crater
lakes into the valleys during an eruption, which can reach speeds of more
than 30mph).
The last big mud-slide was in June 1969. In the event of another one, guests
are urged to 'proceed calmly to assembly area'. The notice continues: 'Do
not attempt to leave the village. Remain calm and wait for all-clear to be
given by rescue officials.'
North Island is often dismissed by skiers as the poor relation to South
Island. This is a myth. South Island has more ski areas, many more mountains
and often better snow than the north.
But the resorts of Whakapapa and Turoa on either side of Ruapehu (9,175ft)
are each bigger than anything in the south. And when they get good snow - as
they did during our visit - they are simply the best in Australasia.
In 1887, the paramount chief of Ngati Tuwharetoa gifted the top of the
volcanoes to the Crown as a national park and by 1913 there were skiers on
Ruapehu. The first rope tow at Whakapapa was installed in 1936 - but it
broke down after a few hours and never worked again.
Such was the build-up of skiers over the years that Turoa was opened 15
years ago to provide another outlet.
Whakapapa has everything from Happy Valley, a separate area for beginners,
to extreme skiing in the couloirs and chutes off the Pinnacle Traverse on
Front Stage (where everyone can see you) and Back Stage (where your
faceplants are private).
Two towers of rock resembling policemen, called Two Coppers, stand guard at
the limit of sensible recreational skiing.
Just across from the Two Coppers are two runs not on the trail map: 5150
(the police code for an emergency incident) and Not Drowning Only Waving
(inspired by an avalanche which buried four skiers who managed to keep one
hand above the snow enabling rescuers to pull them out). There is also an
extensive back-country area outside the ski boundary called Black Magic.
Turoa's rolling terrain is much more open, with bowls and long, natural
gullies, and a vertical drop of 2,360ft (about 150ft more than Whakapapa and
the biggest vertical drop in Australasia).
The Mangaehuehu Glacier provides challenging off-piste skiing and the really
adventurous can climb even higher to the chutes on Girdlestone or even ski
down from the crater lake (but check conditions first with the ski patrol .
. .).
Turoa and Whakapapa are about an hour's drive apart, although it is possible
to traverse on skis from one to the other with an instructor.
Temperatures were in the high 70s when we arrived in Melbourne, Australia.
And our second day produced a surprise. We were driving through a forest of
Giant Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) which grow up to 300ft and Lucy was
studying the Lake Mountain trail map.
At first sight it looked just like any normal map: Snow Gum Trail was a
green, Woollybutt a blue, and Jubilee Trail a black. 'But there's no sign of
any lifts,' said Lucy.
When we arrived, I asked for two lift tickets. 'Well, if you can find a
lift, feel free to use it,' said the woman at the ticket office.
We had arrived at Australia's biggest cross country ski area. The place was
swarming: 3,000 cross country skiers, 1,000 tobogganers, a few Leadbeater's
Possum, Broad-toothed Rats, Marsupial Mice, the odd Kookaburra, and us. We
had neglected to inform the Victoria tourism department that we were
downhill skiers.
'You're not the first downhill skiers to come here by mistake,' said Gillian
Pannan in administration. 'When they discover their mistake they sometimes
try to ski our cross country trails which infuriates our members, because
their skis are too wide and they wreck the track.'
We began to feel like social outcasts.
'There is a bit of a them-and-us syndrome between Nordic and downhill
skiers,' Pannan admitted. 'Nordic skiers are a bit, you know, greeny . . .'
Indeed, their literature demonstrates their environmental concerns: 'Prior
to construction of any ski trail, a three-year scientific survey is required
to comprehensively cover floral, fauna surveys, water and erosion impact
studies, user impact studies, a complete engineering and topographical
survey and a survey of drainage patterns, soil type and base strata
patterns.'
Having heard all this, we hardly dare ask the next question. 'Can we just
ski a little in the trees?' we said.
'That would cause chaos,' said Pannan. 'It would upset most of our skiers,
and it might encourage the rest of them to join you. But you could go and
ski the toboggan run at Berry Higgs playground.'
Which is what we did. All 90 vertical feet of it.
Arrangements for the visit of Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker to New Zealand
were made by the New Zealand Tourism Board, Haymarket, London SWlY 4TQ, tel:
071-973 0360 and Air New Zealand, Elsinore House, 77 Fulham Palace Road,
London W6 8JA, tel 081-846 9595.
In New Zealand they stayed at the Grand Chateau Hotel at Mt Ruapehu and the
Sunbeam Motor Lodge, Ohakune. In Australia, they stayed at the Cumberland
Hotel, Marysville, Victoria, about 15 miles from Lake Mountain.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Travel: Air-conditioned Outback - Kate Bevan travels to
Ayers Rock by coach and watches sunrise with flash-bulbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE BEVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spectacular beauty of Ayers Rock today holds no reminders of the tragedy
of Azaria Chamberlain, the nine-week-old daughter of Lindy and Michael
Chamberlain who was taken by a dingo at the Rock. Azaria's death and the
ensuing legal actions convulsed Australia, culminating in Lindy
Chamberlain's belated release from jail.
Today the Rock is haunted more by the spectre of mass tourism than by the
ghost of Azaria. The campsite and jumble of motels and buildings at the
eastern base of the Rock where the Chamberlains stayed have been largely
done away with; what is left was turned over to the local Aboriginal
community.
The site might as well not exist: tourist buses rumble along the sealed road
and arrive via the western side of the Rock to disgorge their mainly foreign
passengers. Most Australians, facing outrageously high domestic airfares,
find it too expensive to visit the area.
Visitors now stay at Yulara, the depressingly soulless resort 18km away from
the Rock which was built to contain the growing number of tourists visiting
this inhospitable but breathtakingly beautiful region of central Australia.
And there, perhaps, lies the rub: the region is becoming easier to visit as
Yulara neutralises the brutal climate. No longer do tourists have to brave
campsites and dirt roads to see Ayers Rock - now known by its Aboriginal
name, Uluru - rising starkly from pancake-flat desert. Visitors flocking to
the Rock arrive by air-conditioned coach or by jet to Connellan airport,
minutes away from Yulara.
Visitors are catered to with cool efficiency, from those able to pay the
prices for the five-star Sails in the Desert hotel, complete with Rock
views, to the back-packers staying at the campsite. And organised tours
ferry the tourists out to experience sunrise and sunset en masse.
The problem is that you have to stay at Yulara to get the most out of a
visit. It is the only place to stay for 500km in each direction. And with
the cost of taking a hire car to the area so high, it is almost inevitable
that just about every visitor will end up going out to the Rock in a coach.
This is good news for the coach companies based at Yulara, but bad news for
the tourist hoping to capture some of the magic of the desert.
It is magical. The intense colours of the red earth, green trees and endless
blue skies take the breath away before fading to delicate purples and then
inky black as the day ends. The immense emptiness overwhelms, even in the
company of a full coachload.
But to share the sunrise with five other coachloads is depressing. The
astonishing sight of the dark rock flaming orange and then red as the sun
appears over the horizon is dulled by flash-guns.
There is an uncomfortable sense of being herded through the experience as
coaches draw up to the parking lot, leaving their engines running to
maintain the air-conditioning. Even in low season - the heat of December -
the sheer volume of coachloads of predominantly Japanese tourists deadens
the effect. I dread to think what it is like in the cooler Australian winter
months.
I wanted to be about 10kms further back, too, as the parking area is at the
base of the Rock, making it impossible to appreciate the isolation and
beauty of the monolith.
I took my best photographs from 20kms away, on the road out to the Olgas, or
Kata Tjuta, as the Aboriginals call this formation of red, softly-rounded
domes that rear up out of the desert 32km west of Uluru. Even on a coach it
is possible to capture a sense of the emptiness and intense heat of the
Outback as many visitors, on a two-day package, miss out the Olgas
altogether. That is their loss, but a bonus for those who go.
The Olgas are so completely unexpected that they cannot fail to impress.
Ayers Rock, by contrast, is exactly what you do expect - large and red.
There is a sense of mystery about the Olgas with their winding trails,
undulating humps and startling colours. My group watched the sun go down in
silence, awed by the flamboyant light show played out on the domes.
The 6km walk through the Valley of the Winds is far more rewarding than the
haul up Uluru, and you sidestep the heavy-breathing queue determined to
conquer the Rock. Starting from the car park, the Valley of the Winds trail
winds through a spectacular gorge punctuated by unexpectedly green trees and
vegetation before culminating in a scramble up to the lookout, from where
the rest of the range stretches out to meet the desert.
The evening light is mellow and gold, and takes the startling desert colours
to their most intense before fading delicately. Then all the stars come out.
The skies over central Australia are some of the darkest in the world and
make the northern hemisphere's pallid night sky, bleached by city lights,
sad by comparison.
In the desert you can see shooting stars flaring in the heavens while
satellites appear as falling points of light and the Milky Way winds
overhead like a giant ribbon.
Most people want to climb Ayers Rock, but it is sobering to see the plaques
at the bottom commemorating some of the climbers who have lost their lives.
The practice of placing plaques on the Rock was stopped some time ago, but
the death toll continues to rise.
The only surprise is that the toll is not higher, given the motley crew of
fat and ill-prepared tourists that starts the climb. A sign at the bottom
points out that it is not for the unfit, and that the local aboriginal tribe
would rather you did not climb the Rock, but it is blithely disregarded by
the hordes determined to sign the visitors' book at the top.
In the ultimate sanitisation of the Rock, the Japanese parties are issued
with white gloves to protect their hands from the chain with which you haul
yourself up the steepest part of the climb. It is a real climb, not a steep
walk. There are parts where you dare not stand up straight, while the gentle
breeze that took the edge off the
the bottom swiftly becomes a gale, threatening your balance as well as hats
and lens-caps.
No doubt the view from the top is tremendous - I decided that I was not
there to kill myself and came back down - but you can see it from a light
aircraft. There are several operators who will fly you around both the Rock
and the Olgas at sunset for a few dollars more.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Travel: Flowers in a harsh land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is spring in South Africa, and not just politically. So I ought not to
have been surprised when I ran into one of the country's most notorious
former terrorists, Ronnie Kasrils of the African National Congress (now
deputy minister of defence), wandering among the spring wild flowers in a
nature reserve far up the west coast of Cape Province.
He was only doing what comes naturally to South Africans (and what the ANC
was prevented from doing during 30 years of exile): savouring the beauty of
a harsh and savage landscape that becomes a wild-flower wilderness for a few
short weeks each spring.
It is South Africa's equivalent of New England's annual display of autumn
colour. Every year, during a few weekends in late August and September,
thousands drive the wide straight roads north from Cape Town to visit the
flower fields of the Cape West Coast, and the rugged gorges and arid valleys
of the South West Cape interior.
The local tourist board, Captour, runs a seven-days-a- week 'flower hotline'
to tell tourists where to find the best blooms. The answer is in a number of
'flower reserves', where the displays are perhaps most striking, but also
along a host of anonymous dirt roads, which run for miles between
wild-flower meadows where white Namaqualand daisies dust the fields like
snow, and banks of brilliant orange, pink and yellow blooms line the verges
and adorn the rocky hillsides of this harsh and isolated land.
I ran into Kasrils on a sun-filled Saturday afternoon at the Ramskop flower
reserve outside Clanwilliam, an Afrikaans town which, like so many in the
Cape, bears a deceptively Scottish name. I found him among the rich golden
boterblomme, or butterflowers (no relation to the buttercup, which is far
smaller and more delicate), the deep red gousblomme (a kind of aster), and
shocking pink vygies, or 'little figs' - flowering succulents whose
extravagant large blooms adorn even the most arid soil.
The Latin name of the vygies - mesembryanthemaceae - says it all. They open
only toward mid-day in warm sunny weather. The trick to seeing them is
always to travel with the sun at your back, for the blooms face the sun;
approached from behind they can be almost invisible.
When you tire of flower-spotting from car windows, get out and wander (with
the farmer's permission) in fields of heliophila (sun-lover) or blue flax,
wild arum lilies (known as 'pig lilies' in Afrikaans), tall yellow daisy
bushes and wild Cape honeysuckle and nemesia.
I had a lovely wander up a secluded gorge near the 1831 homestead called
Kapteinskloof, where I stayed. It is a pioneer home with thick white-washed
walls, thatched roofs and a profusion of antiques which make it a stunning
monument to Cape Dutch architecture (the food is a testament to modern Cape
cookery).
Best of all, perhaps, are the wild-flower meadows which run down to the
Atlantic in West Coast national park, less than an hour up the coast from

FT  03 SEP 94 / Sport: The golden oldies - Golf

<TEXT>
It was called the sporting success story of the 1980s, but that was nothing
compared to what senior golf has achieved in the 1990s. In 1994, the US
Senior tour has expanded to the point where there are no longer enough weeks
in the year to cope with all the companies queuing up to endorse
tournaments.
Consequently, while every other tour in the world worries about keeping hold
of what it has, the seniors worry about how long they can keep sponsors on
their waiting list. When it began life on December 16 1980, there were two
tournaments offering total prize money of Pounds 140,000. Today, there are
44 events worth Pounds 25m.
'I always thought the senior tour would do well but it has gone way beyond
my comprehension now,' said Gary Player.
This is the world that Tony Jacklin has joined and already he has touched
gold, winning a tournament within five weeks of reaching 50, the age of
eligibility.
On the regular tour, the players are always complaining about bad backs and
bad wrists or some such ailment. On the senior tour, they are walking models
of fitness, too busy making money to worry about a bad back, too tied up
hitting balls on the practice ground in case the magic suddenly disappears.
The senior tour has predictably made millions for people who were not
exactly short of cash anyway, golfers such as Lee Trevino, Raymond Floyd and
Jack Nicklaus.
But there are some lovely stories too. Bob Murphy gave up playing on the
regular tour in 1987 owing to arthritis. Murphy's hands were so swollen with
the disease that it became too painful to grip a club. Now Murphy is back
playing. His motivation was the senior tour. So far he has won Pounds 1m and
counting.
Then there's Jay Sigel, a name that will be familiar to those who follow
amateur golf. Indeed Sigel was America's greatest amateur since Bobby Jones,
but having done all he could in that branch of the sport, he finally
decided, at the age of 50, to turn professional. Sigel has not yet been a
pro for 12 months but he has already won Pounds 300,000.
Jim Albus may be the most remarkable story of all. He played for a couple of
years on the regular tour in the 1960s and made precisely Pounds 2,000. He
packed up and became a club professional.
There he stayed for 25 years before those old yearnings for tour life and
travel started getting to him once more and in 1991 he packed his belongings
and headed for the senior tour's qualifying school. He got his card, and
enjoyed his new life so much in 1992 that he played in every event. He has
been rather more successful this time, too. He has made more than Pounds
1.5m to date.
Given the length of Albus's lay-off, perhaps it was not that extraordinary
that Jacklin could rid himself so quickly of 10 years of rust.
But do all these stories indicate a lack of quality in the golf played? Far
from it. I attended the recent Ford Senior Player's Championship in Detroit,
where the course on which the tournament was played measured just under
6,900 yards.
Admittedly, it was nowhere near as stringent as that upon which the US Open
at Oakmont was played, however. 'The fairways at Oakmont were faster than
these greens,' said Jack Nicklaus.
Even so, it was set up in such a way that I, an eight handicapper, would
have been delighted to have gone round in anything under 83 (at Oakmont, I
would have been thrilled to have broken 100). On the first day, a third of
the field broke 70.
Jacklin's preparation for senior life perhaps provides an answer as to why
the standard is so high. Six months before joining the tour, he gave up his
handsome mansion in the Scottish Highlands to go and live in Florida - where
he could practise every day, and play in some satellite tour events.
It was just as well he prepared so thoroughly because the senior tour fields
are restricted to 78 players each week. When the exempt players are taken
into account and the four invitation spots (which is how Jacklin has been
getting in) there are usually only about four places left and these scraps
are fed to the 100 or so hungry scavengers who take part in open qualifying
every Monday.
None of this explains why the senior tour is so successful.
There are a number of reasons. The first is that the tour offers not one,
but two pro-ams every week, so that the sponsors can invite twice as many
clients to play with a top name.
Secondly, just look at some of the names who are over 50 and still playing:
Player, Nicklaus, Trevino, Floyd, Arnold Palmer, Chi Chi Rodriguez. How
could any tour fail to attract sponsors and spectators when offering such
riches?
Outside the professional ranks, golf is a game largely played by the over
50s, and the decision makers in the boardrooms are invariably a similar age
to the players on the senior tour. They have grown up with sporting icons
such as Palmer and Nicklaus.
But there is something else as well. These players know how to work a crowd.
Here is an example: on the opening day in Detroit, golf's original big
three, Player, Palmer and Nicklaus, had been drawn together for the first
time on the senior tour.
The par four 11th hole offered the chance to play safe down the left and
have a longish approach shot, or drive riskily over a ravine to the right
but have a short iron to the green.
Player took out his driver. Palmer, summing up a career, went with the
driver too, but Nicklaus, again true to form, played safe.
Uncharacteristically, he pulled his long-iron tee-shot into the rough.
There was silence.
Nicklaus shook his head. 'That was a darn bad shot,' he said.
It was too much for Player. He said: 'You're right, of course, Jack, but it
was a crap decision to go with the iron in the first place and it deservedly
resulted in a crap shot.'
Everyone started laughing. Nicklaus did too. It was something one could
relate to. They may have been three superstars but they were also three
golfers who were enjoying a laugh and a joke. The senior tour is the only
tour where you will find that camaraderie that is so much the heart and soul
of what golf is about for most people.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Motoring: For the super-charged family
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mazda's 626 D-CX five-door hatchback is the first super-charged, as distinct
from turbo-charged, diesel car to reach Britain, writes Stuart Marshall.
The air pump that improves performance is driven directly from the two-litre
engine, not by a turbine in the exhaust gas stream. As a result, instant
boost is available at low engine speeds.
The power-steered 626 D-CX drives with close to a petrol car's refinement
and liveliness, has anti-lock brakes, a sweet five-speed gearbox, and gives
more than 40 miles a gallon (6.89 l/100km).
At Pounds 13,395 - which includes electric windows, door mirrors, and aerial
for the six-speaker audio system - I rate this comfortable, well equipped,
family-size car an attractive buy.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Sport: Jumping through flaming hoops - Equestrianism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever the weather, much of the talk at this weekend's Burghley Remy
Martin Horse Trials will be of heat and humidity.
Most top event riders with an expectation of competing in the 1996 Olympics
at Atlanta are at Burghley. So too is the equine veterinary research team
whose expertise helped avoid catastrophe in the heatwave at the World
Equestrian Games in the Netherlands last month.
In October, the scientists have to give advice to the International
Equestrian Federation on how to conduct a safe three-day-event in the
near-tropical conditions of mid-summer Georgia. Opinions are polarising as
to whether the whole enterprise is desirable or possible.
King William and Mary Thomson, a combination that has won Badminton and
competed at the Barcelona Olympics, finished the WEG cross-country section
with the horse on rubber-legs. A heatwave pushed temperatures in The Hague
to 36'C, with 90 per cent humidity. Thomson had to nurse the massive
gelding, famous for his big-heartedness, over the last few fences.
'He just could not cope with the humidity, like a lot of the larger horses.
I had never seen him like that. He was very distressed and so was I,' said
Thomson, part of the gold medal-winning British team.
Although the pairing is likely to be well to the fore in the selectors'
minds, the rider is adamant that the horse will not endure those conditions
again. 'There is no way in the world I would take him to Atlanta,' said
Thomson.
Michael Clayton, editor of Horse &amp; Hound magazine, has moved from scepticism
to outright opposition over the Georgia venue.
'It is ridiculous. Every horseman knows it is too hot in Atlanta,' said
Clayton. 'I am not a sentimentalist over horses, but the competitors are not
sitting on skis or boats. These are living creatures.'
He believes that the sports's governing body agreed to the demands of the
International Olympic Committee for a compact, one-site Games, because of
apprehension that the IOC hierarchy wished to drop equestrianism and would
use any local difficulties as a lever.
Clayton says that the best decision would be a shift of venue to temperate
New England or Pennsylvania. He attended the 1978 world championships in
Lexington, Kentucky, and was appalled at the effect of extreme heat and
humidity on the animals.
'Some of the top horses pushed hardest at Lexington were never any good
again,' said Clayton.
Many, indeed most, top event horses are no longer owned by their riders. As
the sport's popularity and media profile increases, the animals increase in
value to such an extent that they are sold to a sponsor.
The Burghley entry list gives a classic example. The printed form shows Nick
Burton (son of former England rugby international Mike Burton) as owner /
rider of Bertie Blunt. A last-minute handwritten addendum gives Mark Todd of
New Zealand as rider, with his new sponsor Bond International (a large UK
tyre distributor) as the owner.
Japanese interests scouted the stables at Burghley last year. When Brynley
Powell's promising young horse I'm Sure went well around a demanding course,
he was snapped up and flown off to Tokyo.
Corporate backers may well be unwilling to hazard their equine investment in
the stifling heat of a Confederate summer.
However, scientists such as Professor Leo Jeffcott of Cambridge University's
veterinary department have been researching climatic stress in relation to
eventing for nearly two years. He was in the Netherlands for the WEG and
says that conditions there were at the margins of safety.
'We would not want the horses to become any more tired or hotter than they
were at The Hague,' said Jeffcott.
Beneath a giant marquee to provide shade, the horses were 'aggressively
cooled,' as Jeffcott's report puts it. Six tons of ice and a battery of
hoses were used.
Many of the same animals will be at Burghley, wired to transmit heart and
temperature functions to the vets' computers. This data, plus a recent field
test in Atlanta, will provide the basis for recommendations as to how the
three-day-event will need to be made less physically rigorous in Atlanta.
Shorter tracks, lower fences, and longer rests are likely.
'There will be modifications but we are confident of keeping the horses
safe,' said Jeffcott.
Not everyone is content. Clayton questioned the value of medal won in 'a
bastardised event'.
'This is basically a winter sport,' he said. 'You do not run an Alpine ski
competition in July or a yacht race on a dry lake.'

FT  03 SEP 94 / Motoring: Hatchbacks rule Britain's roads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's most popular type of car is a five-door hatchback - and that is
official. The information comes from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, which also says that Britain's total car population grew to
23,402,347 at the end of last year - a 1.7 per cent increase on 1992 - while
the total number of heavy lorries fell by 1.8 per cent to 536,459.
The society could have fooled me. An increase in the car population I can
believe, if only because getting out of my drive and on to the main road
takes longer, and is more hazardous, every year. But fewer lorries? There
seem more of them around than ever. They block two of three motorway lanes
as they creep slowly past each other on hills, where commonsense dictates
that overtaking should be forbidden, and they make their elephantine
presence felt in country lanes and local high streets where they look like
goods trains that have left the rails and taken to the tarmac.
The society's statistics reveal that while 31.4 per cent of Britain's cars
are five-door hatchbacks, three-door models (28.4 per cent) are not far
behind. Almost 60 per cent of cars now have tailgates and, if you include
another 1.6m estates, it really does make the boot lid look a threatened
species.
Which car started the trend to tailgates? Some say it was the 1959 Austin
A40, with its agreeably sharp-edged body styled by Farina of Italy. But the
first ones I drove had fixed back windows; as I recall, semi-estate A40s
with hinged tailgates came a year or two later. By that time, the gawky but
endearing Renault 4 had appeared, with a tailgate big enough for sofas or
metal milk churns - although purists might, I suppose, argue that this was
more of a van with seats and windows than a hatchback.
The Renault 16 - was any car ever more comfortable to ride in? - arguably
started the proper hatchback line because it combined all the features you
expected of a saloon with a versatility close to an estate car. Also making
its bow in the early 1960s was the Simca 1100, smaller than the R16 but cast
in a similar mould. Where have they all gone? The simple answer is that
rust-proofing was less of a priority then than it is now. While the
mechanicals remained healthy, the bodies rotted. It was not until the 1970s
that the hatchback became the conventional body style for small to medium
cars and a booted saloon the exception, although large-car buyers still
generally opted for a boot. Saab (the first 9000s) was an exception but
Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar have never made a big hatchback.
The large Renault 25 and its successor, the Safrane, are hatchbacks as is
the Citroen XM, although this has a cunning double back window. One goes up
with the tailgate; another - easily removable when required - stays in
place.
Ford must have wished it had something like it when it introduced the
present Granada (itself on the point of being replaced). Instead of
continuing to offer four-door saloons and five-door estates, it said Granada
buyers could have any kind of body they liked so long as it was a hatchback.
(Old Henry Ford - 'Any colour you like so long as it is black' - would have
approved.)
The Granada's styling was an unhappy compromise around the rear end. More to
the point, Ford lost business from fleet managers who had formerly bought
Granada saloons to ferry senior people. When the chauffeur lifted the new
model's tailgate to stow the luggage, the back seat passengers objected to
being exposed to winter's icy blasts.
In the end, Ford did what it should have done in the first place - produced
a Granada saloon and, eventually, an estate car. Even the largest companies
live and learn.
The French may disagree, but body styling has polarised. As the society's
figures reveal, cars for the masses are mainly hatchbacks. Senior people
choose saloons as company cars. And for carrying capacity, there is still
nothing like an estate.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Sport: 49ers make the cap fit - American Football
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new American football year opens tomorrow, but if there was a prize for
the best performance during the off-season, the National Football League
would have crowned its champions already: the San Francisco 49ers.
Not because the 49ers had the best pre-season record. They won three out of
four games, but two teams, the Chicago Bears and Indianapolis Colts, went
undefeated in exhibition games.
But because of the team management's accomplishment in adding a formidable
group of talented veterans to one of the most highly-paid rosters in the
sport while keeping the payroll under the limit imposed by the NFL's new
salary cap.
The salary cap is the cause of the US professional baseball players' strike.
Unlike their counterparts in football, baseball players are not prepared to
accept a limit on their pay. The NFL players' union last year accepted a
ceiling on the total each team could pay its players in return for securing
free agency - which allows players to move teams after a certain period in
the league.
The difference between the NFL's salary cap and the cap proposed by the
baseball owners, is the flexibility of the NFL system. There is a lot of
'wiggle room' under the football cap, and no one has proved more adept at
wiggling than the 49ers.
At the end of last year, the team's total payroll exceeded Dollars 40m. It
seemed that they had to reduce salaries and / or shed players to fit under
the Dollars 34.6m (Pounds 22m) cap the NFL had set for the 1994 season.
Today, however, the 49ers have all their top players from last year on
long-term contracts, including stars such as quarterback Steve Young and
wide receiver Jerry Rice. And they have five new players, each an
established NFL star - on extended contracts. Yet the 49ers team payroll has
dropped from more than Dollars 40m to Dollars 34.59m, just under the salary
cap.
How did they do it? They started late last year by hurriedly signing several
key players to lucrative 'front-loaded' long-term contracts, which paid the
players a lot of money for the 1993 season, and considerably less for
subsequent ones. By paying out so much money in 1993, before the cap came
into effect, the 49ers left themselves considerable room to sign new players
for 1994, year-one of the salary cap.
In basketball - the other sport with an existing salary cap - teams have
fallen foul of the league authorities with this kind of creative accounting,
but in football, the wiggle room leaves plenty of scope for creativity. As
Carmen Policy, president of the 49ers, put it: 'We wanted to be the hunters,
not the hunted. We wanted to do what we could to manipulate the system,
rather than have it control us.'
After anchoring many of their best players to the team, the 49ers went
hunting. They bagged several top free agents, including Super Bowl winners
Ken Norton of the Dallas Cowboys and Richard Dent of the Chicago Bears, and
veterans Rickey Jackson of the New Orleans Saints and Bart Oates of the New
York Giants. It was no coincidence that all of the new signings were
defenders, for the defence has been the chief weakness of the
attack-oriented 49ers for the past few seasons.
Some of the money needed to pay the newcomers came from the release of
well-paid reserve players, including Steve Bono, the back-up quarterback who
so often deputised for injured stars such as Joe Montana and Steve Young.
Also, the 49ers chose to hire a lot of relatively cheap 'rookie' players
fresh from university teams.
The result is a well-balanced team, a favourite to reach the Super Bowl in
January. The only likely obstacle is the defending champions, the Cowboys,
who beat the 49ers in the last two National Football Conference finals. The
Cowboys, however, have lost their coach, Jimmy Johnson and several leading
players including Norton.
Yet, the 49ers' policy of squeezing so much expensive talent under the
salary cap involves a risk. Because the 49ers have let go so many veteran
reserves and replaced them with mostly untested players, a team that was
once renowned for its 'depth' now has little insurance if its stars get
injured. And in the NFL, that is quite a gamble.

FT  03 SEP 94 / How To Spend It: Women seize control of their cleavages -
Avril Groom on how modern bras can be used to flatten and flatter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I recently met a man who claimed he could bestow a cleavage on even the most
meagrely-endowed woman. He worked for a lingerie company and he was talking
about bra design, which today seems to be a branch of structural
engineering.
Underwear that reflects, and even flatters, your real shape is no longer
enough. Now you can be twice, or alternatively half, the woman you thought
you were. That well-known company slogan about 'the bra for the way you are'
needs rewriting. Now you are the way your bra is.
The push-me-up, pull-you-in school of bra design achieves instantly - with
Lycra and fine, flexible metal - far more natural illusions than those
sought painfully and laboriously in the past with whalebone and binding.
Throughout history, women have managed to alter and enhance their shape,
mostly at the dictates of fashion. The difference now is that a woman can
change her shape as often as her clothes. The cleavage-enhancing,
underwired, padded bra that defines the decollete of an evening gown would
look simply vulgar under a skinny cropped T-shirt. For this, all but the
smallest need a minimiser which, in bra-speak, reduces the bust's
projec-tion.
The idea that a woman can change her shape implies that she has a large
selection of bras, which is very good for business. Several bra companies
report sales in the first half of this year up by 25 per cent over the same
period last year, with sales of the type that make you look larger
increasing fastest.
You might expect the reverse, as women and their busts are getting bigger,
due to the modern diet's higher protein content and, according to some
theorists, the cumulative effect of the contraceptive pill taken by women
whose mothers also took it.
I have always regarded my unremarkable 34B figure as average and so it might
have been 20 years ago. But now 36C is the norm and firms such as Berlei are
producing bras with hitherto uncontemplated G cups - yet 30 years ago the DD
cup was regarded as revolutionary.
Men are noticeably uncomplaining about this trend, which perhaps explains
the boom in Wonderbras, Ultrabras et al. It seems we are following the lead
of the US, where women are bigger and men are glad of it. In the race for
sexual selection big breasts, to put it bluntly, still count.
Traditionally, the lingerie business itself has been dominated by men. This,
quite rightly, is changing. Companies such as Gossard and Berlei now have
predominantly female teams, even on the design and structure side.
Yet fashion is firmly on the men's side. After three seasons of the waif,
and the fragile bias-cut layers that go with her, the full-bosomed pulpeuse
is back with a vengeance in her corset tops and hour-glass jackets. This was
seen clearly on the catwalk, where it was demonstrated by hitherto
string-bean supermodels who, overnight and mostly without the aid of
implants, had developed swelling embonpoints, giving credence to my bra
company friend's theory of cleavages.
If they can do it, so can anybody. So I decided to test the bra business in
two categories - minimisers under a clingy T-shirt, and augmenters under a
soft, low-necked shirt. The results were varied, instructive and not always
flattering.
At least one in each section really worked, though it is a clever minimiser
that does not put the unwanted 'extra' under your armpits.
And augmenters really are built for the new average woman rather than me.
Even with the best, to look like the girl on the packet, I still have to
fold my arms and squeeze hard.
Minimisers
These are either specific projection-reducers or sports bra styles meant to
give a smooth, flattering line under clingy clothes.
Playtex Super Look Secrets Cotton Classic. Seamless, 32-36A, 32-38B and C,
Pounds 15.99 from department stores. Lifts bust up and outwards. A smooth,
natural line with a slight cleavage but a bit flimsy.
Triumph Sport Tri-Action 3001, cotton jersey, front fastening, racing back.
Sizes 32-38A, 32-44B-D, Pounds 14.50 from department stores. Flattens but
points slightly downwards; a bit depressing. Very plain, good under
see-through layers.
Berlei Cascade Minimiser, nylon/elastane, sizes 34-42, C-E, from Pounds
13.99, from department stores. A serious supporter, heavily underwired for
separation. Spreads bust outwards but augmented rather than reduced mine.
Marks and Spencer Minimiser, polyamide / elastane, sizes 32-36D-E, 38C-E,
40C-DD Pounds 14. Spreads bust effectively but heavy underwire keeps
under-arm line smooth. Lacy finish tricky under clingy clothes.
Berlei Fitness Bra, nylon / cotton/elastane, sizes 32-38 B-D, Pounds 17.99
from Fenwick, New Bond Street, W1. Double-layer jersey crop top with subtle
seaming, not cups. Pull-on, racing back. Very smooth outline, flattens well,
but the larger bosomed would need more support.
Hanro 1549, sizes 32A-38C, Pounds 21.50 from Fenwick; Harrods of
Knightsbridge, SW1; Harvey Nichols of Knightsbridge, SW1; Dickins and Jones,
Regent Street, W1; and Selfridges, Oxford Street, W1. Cotton jersey,
underwired. Clever diagonal seam pushes bust outwards and underwire prevents
downward turn. The greatest reduction and a flattering, youthful line.
Augmenters
Triumph Bijou, soft lace, sizes 32-38A-C, Pounds 17.99, from large stores.
Underwired, removable pads. All up front; narrows the bust in and up.
Playtex Wonderbra Balconette, sizes 32-36A, 32-38B and C. Pounds 14.99 from
department stores, Hennes and Top Shop branches. Underwired, removable pads.
Pushes up and out. Good with a low-cut evening dress but ledge effect on
upper half of bust.
Berlei Petite, nylon / viscose / cotton / elastane, sizes 30-36AA and B,
30-38A, Pounds 15.99 from department stores. Underwired, padded all over.

FT  03 SEP 94 / How To Spend It: The easyish guide to mobile happiness -
Some portable telephones are getting cheaper but there are hidden costs.

<TEXT>
If you thought buying a personal pension was a nightmare, try getting the
best deal on a mobile telephone. Beginners who want to understand the
complexities of the business have three options, in ascending order of
easiness:
First, read this article very carefully. Next, ask a series of questions of
the smart people (in every sense) who want to sell you a telephone. Then,
work out (preferably, with a spreadsheet) what is best for you.
Second, abandon this article, decide what advertisement you like best (some
fancy the Mercury woman with a gap in her teeth, others prefer the
minimalism of the Orange ads, while the bargain hunters love the cheap
giveaway deals found in the local paper).
Go for the image you like best and the sexiest telephone available - you can
assume it is going to cost a fortune, anyway. Third, and quite the best,
persuade your boss, spouse or rich, doting lover to give you a mobile
telephone with a written promise to pay the bills.
Since the first mobile 'phones were introduced a decade ago, talking on the
move has progressed from being strikingly unusual to socially gauche and
now, oh so ordinary.
While owning a mobile (it's never referred to as anything but a 'mobile')
might not make you different, it can certainly improve your life. But no
matter what deal you strike on these gadgets, if you are paying the bills,
it is going to cost you more than owning an ordinary phone - at least Pounds
150 a year without counting the cost of the phone or the calls.
Even so, with judicious use and firm discipline to curb excessive chatting,
you can escape relatively lightly - from around Pounds 300 a year (plus
VAT), as the table shows. Just follow our 10 steps to mobile happiness.
10 STEPS TO MOBILE HAPPINESS
1. Understand that you are buying a service, not a phone.
The money in the mobile phone business is made primarily by selling air time
(the call costs), not the telephones. Handsets can be bought without an
air-time contract, but they are then very expensive. The price of most hand
portables is subsidised by the companies selling air time, as an inducement
to sign up for one of the many options available from the four operators:
Cellnet, Vodafone, Mercury One-2-One, and Orange.
2. Navigate through the mobile maze.
Mobile telephones (hand portables and car-phones) work on a radio system.
Each operator has set up transmitters and receivers throughout their area of
coverage (usually on tall buildings) in interlinked 'cells', hence the term
cellular radio.
When you make a call your mobile 'phone transmits the conversation to a
nearby receiver which routes it to the operator. The call is then routed to
its destination, either another portable or into the main BT network of
cables. The system works the same in reverse, with the operator's computers
keeping a track on your 'phone as it moves from cell to cell.
To encourage competition, the government set up a system that shared the
spoils between the network operators and middlemen, called service
providers. The service providers buy air time wholesale from the operators
and then sell it on to you, either directly or through a retailer. Your
contract is with a service provider. Network operators are now allowed to
sell air time directly too.
3. Decide where you want to make and receive calls.
Your needs could simplify your choices. Only two networks - Vodafone and
Cellnet - offer a Europe-wide coverage on what's called GSM. This is a
technical standard that allows you to make and receive calls in most
European countries and some others, such as Australia and South Africa. The
same operators are the only ones to offer near-nationwide coverage in the
UK, which is important if you intend to use the 'phone away from the big
towns and cities.
All the networks offer services in London and the south-east. Mercury
One-2-One started there and is extending to other English metropolitan
centres. Orange started in all the large English and Scottish cities and is
extending its coverage to 90 per cent of the population by the middle of
next year.
Remember that you can call anywhere in the world on any of the services, as
long as you are within their demarcated reception boundaries. Once you leave
their area, the 'phone is useless.
If you want a mobile for security in case you should break down or get lost
while driving, members of the AA can buy its Callsafe system. This is a
mobile 'phone that can only be used to call the AA or the emergency
services. It is expensive but may be worth it for the peace of mind. It
costs Pounds 149.99 for the phone, Pounds 25 for a connect fee and Pounds
26.50 per quarter. The calls are free.
4. If you want privacy, go Digital.
There are two types of system, analogue (the original) and digital. Both
offer high quality sound and reception when they are working well. Both
suffer from bad reception. The digital service, although considered
technically superior, can make you sound rather Dalek-like at times.
If you do not want eavesdroppers (remember the Princess Diana 'Squidgy'
calls?) then go digital because it is far more secure. Digital is essential
for secret agents (although your whereabouts could be tracked) and anyone
involved in an extra-marital affair.
5. Estimate how much - and when - you intend to use the phone.
The methods used to charge for air time are complex and confusing. Before
you pay for calls, you have to settle a one-off connection fee (from Pounds
25-Pounds 50) and then pay a monthly standing charge (from Pounds
12.77-Pounds 100). The differences in tariffs are essentially between the
'business' packages (medium monthly fee, high call charges) and packages
aimed at the social caller (low monthly fee, high call charges at peak
times).
There are many variations on the theme, including inducements of free calls.
Mercury gives free local calls after seven in the evening, Orange provides
five different 'price plans' in which it offers from 15 to 540 minutes free.
Some charges are rounded up to the nearest half-minute while others, from
Orange, are charged per second.
It is virtually impossible for those who have never owned a mobile 'phone to
know how much they will use it. Some users have found that the phone changes
the way they work, allowing much more mobility. This makes it exceedingly
difficult to choose the right tariff package, so check if there is a charge
in case you want to move from one package to another on the same system.
The producers of the Financial Times newsletter Mobile Communications have
computed the total cost of the various options over a three-year period. 'We
made some assumptions on the amount of calls made and then worked out the
cost, including the price of the cheapest hand portable available on the
service,' says editor Neil McCartney.
'The cheapest countries for cellular telephone service are in Scandinavia
but because there's a lot more competition in the UK market now, we are the
fifth cheapest country in Europe. Germany, France and Spain are a lot more
expensive.'
European Cellular Tariffs, published by The X25 Partnership, has done some
useful work comparing the costs of using the leading operators. The table
published here shows the average cost per year over three years for low
users and high users and does at least provide some help to those trying to
get straight answers to the complicated question of costs.
6. Beware of cheap 'phones.
Advertisements for cheap 'phones are misleading. The chances are that the
'phones will be yesterday's technology but even if not, the 'bargain' phone
is being subsidised to attract customers for the air time. Look for the
right tariff package first and then see what 'phones are available. Remember
the 'phones have to conform to the technical standards of the operator.
7. Do not be seduced by sexy looks.
They have not squeezed the technology into a wristwatch yet, but hand
portables have shrunk quite dramatically since the early days. Some, such as
the Sony CM-R 111, can be put in a pocket without breaking the stitching.
But there are inevitable trade-offs between size, weight, functions and
performance.
The capacity of batteries is still a problem - the smaller the phone, the
smaller the battery and that means you have to carry a spare. Check too that
the smaller phones are easy to use and have the power to work well when you
are on the fringe of an operator's transmission boundary.
Unless you always carry a briefcase, some 'phones can be rather heavy to
carry around in a pocket or handbag. The Swatch, for example, is 385g, the
Mercury M200 is 370g and the Nokia 1011 is 470 gm. The Sony CM-R 111 is only
185g.
Which? magazine tested 19 mobile 'phones. Its recommendations are:
Analogue: Mitsubishi MT-7, Nokia 101, People's Phone CTN 6000 and for
occasional use, the Sony CM-H 333.
Digital: Mercury M400 and the Nokia Orange. For GSM (Europe-wide service)
the Motorola Micro TAC International 5200 is recommended.
However, other 'phones have been launched since Which? did its tests.
8. Watch out for thieves.
Mobiles are highly prized and some thieves specialise in snatching them from
queueing cars at traffic lights. Make sure yours is insured. This is doubly
important because you will have to buy a replacement at a non-subsidised
price, or pay a penalty for cancelling your contract.
9. Read the contract carefully.
The contract with the service provider will bind you to using the service
for a set time (usually a year, but it could be more). There will be
penalties if you want to give it up or move to another tariff package. Make
sure you know what you are signing because the consequences can be costly.
Look for opt-out clauses for bad service from the operator.
10. Watch that recall button.
Many marital miscreants have been caught out by their spouse after
programming 0 as the quick-dial to their lovers. You have been warned.

FT  03 SEP 94 / The sentimental way to pick a Rose: Lucy Kellaway visits
Tralee and watches a 23-year-old capture one of the most bizarre prizes on
offer to women in the 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
She is a 23-year-old with ginger hair, a job in tourism and a liking for
padded party frocks in blue satin. She was head girl at her school in
Limerick, is a dutiful daughter and is looking for a husband strong enough
to carry the harp that she plays for charity.
This admirable young woman has just become the owner of a gilded crown
studded with fake emeralds and diamonds and a large ornate glass trophy.
Muirne Hurley is what every pure young Irish lass would love to be: the 1994
Rose of Tralee.
This must be one of the most bizarre prizes on offer to women in the 1990s.
The beauty contest, now in its 36th year, is open only to those of Irish
extraction. The winner is supposedly chosen not for her vital statistics,
but for her ability to 'just be herself' - whatever that means.
Nevertheless, there was not a single fatty, nor a set of buck teeth among
the 1994 crop of 32 competing Roses. They had come to Ireland from all over
the world - from the US to Dubai to New Zealand.
Their parents may have escaped from Irish poverty, but their offspring are
delighted to return, gushing over the charms of the mother country in the
hope of winning the title. Most of them were more than bimbos: some had a
university degree, others were tax consultants, investment advisers, vets,
and journalists.
Yet each was prepared to stand on the stage and simper, alongside Gay Byrne,
a 60-year-old smoothie who is the best loved personality on Irish telly.
Comfortable in their vulgar array of evening attire, they cheerfully replied
to Byrne's questions about whether they had boyfriends, and what their
daddies did for a living.
Those who could, then did a little jig, sang a song or recited a poem. Even
those who could not had a go: one gave an alarmingly flat rendering of The
Streets of London. Another got into a sorry muddle over the passage she had
selected from Under Milk Wood.
But the audience loved it. More than half of the women in Ireland were glued
to their TV sets watching the contest. The rest were presumably in the
betting shop initially putting money on the Adelaide Rose, a petite dyed
blonde with a big white smile.
But when Muirne Hurley came on, and in particular when her wet-eyed father
stood up in the audience for an impromptu serenade the hot money switched.
He sang in rich baritone the moving words: 'Though lovely and fair as the
rose of summer/ Yet 'twas not her beauty alone that won me/ Oh no, 'twas the
truth in her eyes ever dawning/ That made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee'.
The people of Ireland know a winner when they see one, having watched this
annual display of sentimentality for more than three decades. Within minutes
the odds on the Limerick Rose had shortened from 12-1 to 3-1.
There is an implicit code of conduct that Roses only break at their peril.
The Boston Rose did herself no favours by boasting about the paper she had
written on the politics of Northern Ireland. The Belgian Rose should never
have admitted that if she saw a man she fancied she invited him out. When it
comes to 'just being herself', it seems a Rose can go too far.
More important still, Roses must not be seen to be competitive. They have to
keep up the pretence that simply being in Tralee (a workaday town in Kerry)
for a week of trips to distant hotels to shake the hand of ex-prime minister
Charles Haughey is prize enough.
They must not drink or smoke in public. They are expected to pick at their
food: indeed when the Galway Rose put away a large heping of lemon pie and
cream at one of the main banquets the story was reported in the Irish Times.
Neither must they read the newspapers. It is feared that if the Roses read
everything written about them - most papers carried several pages of fulsome
copy and glamorous pictures every day of the festival - they might be left
with no time to fulfil their busy schedules.
Try as it might to recreate an age of sentimental innocence, Tralee could
not quite keep the modern world at bay during the week. While the Roses
batted their eyelids inside the festival dome on the streets of Tralee a
booze-up was taking place on a scale remarkable even by Irish standards.
Young lads poured into the town's camping sites and pitched their tents in
preparation for a week of dedicated drinking. One got so over-excited as he
watched the Limerick Rose being crowned that he took off all his clothes and
mounted the statue in the town square. That poor chap is now facing a prison
sentence for his moment of abandonment.
Even more shaming, two of the nice Irish boys given the job of chaperoning
the Roses during the week disgraced themselves. One got woefully drunk, and
another was caught in bed with a young woman (mercifully not his Rose, whom
he had safely escorted back to her hotel by midnight).
Another regrettable incident was the photo opportunity for the first ever
black Rose. With an almost touching lack of political correctness
photographers had her pose with a pint of Guinness, with a view to a 'Black
on Black' picture caption.
All hell broke loose among the festival committee - a gang of five officious
pale green jacketed locals, headed by a Bill Looney.
They were offended not just at the association with alcohol, but also
because the Roses must not be seen to advertise anything.
But most sobering of all was when the Washington Rose was made to relate the
tale of how her two cousins had been gang raped and murdered, and how her
brother - who was trying to save them - was charged by an incompetent
policeman with having killed them. This grotesque story made the cheerful
chatter that followed even harder to swallow than before.
Still, on the whole the week was deemed to be the greatest success - nearly
Pounds 3m poured into the town that week, and if much of that was spent on
booze it should not bother the chief sponsor of the event: Guinness.

FT  03 SEP 94 / On holiday with my brain cells: Christian Tyler explains why
getting away from it all is harder than you think
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first apparition materialised at a cafe opposite San Sepolcro cathedral.
My wife scribbled a note and held it up to my nose. 'DO NOT STARE,' it said.
'The man at the next table is John Cleese.'
I turned and stared. 'It can't be,' I hissed. 'What's he doing here?'
She hissed back: 'What are we doing here?'
The second shade was standing disconsolately in a scrum of Italian
housewives at the delicatessen counter of the Co-op. It looked strangely
like Professor Bill Wedderburn, the eminent labour lawyer and Marxist peer.
I stepped forward: 'Well, if it isn't . . .' It was. So we retired to the
bar with our trolleys for a beer.
When the third manifestation occurred a few days later I began to wonder
what agency was sending them, and why. This phantasm was tucking into a
tutti frutti ice-cream opposite the Minerva temple in Assisi.
I nudged my brother-in-law. 'Is that who I think it is?' 'Madre di Dio]' he
exclaimed (or something like it). 'It's Kenneth Clarke.' We decided on
balance, being sensitive souls, to leave him in peace with his pudding.
We like to say that we shun other tourists, especially our own compatriots.
Yet I was surprised to feel a pang of solidarity with these fellow escapees
from the little off-shore island on the rim of the Eurasian landmass.
There seemed to be a message in the coincidences. But what were the
wraith-messengers trying to tell me? Surely it was something more profound
than that middle-aged swingers take their holidays east of Arezzo? And why
were they so difficult to recognise?
Back at home again, the answer seems obvious: We were all in the wrong
place. In other words, you may pack your possessions and your children, put
the cat in a boarding house, lock the front door and drive 1,000 miles. But
you cannot take your brain cells on holiday. Transport your body, soul and
senses where you please; your cerebral cortex remains helplessly wired into
its own version of reality.
For the first week the brain refuses to leave home at all; it must be
distracted with the minor tasks involved in living in a foreign place. In
the second week it begins to surrender and take an interest in its new
surroundings. But by the beginning of the third (if you are wise enough to
take three weeks) it is already making ready to return.
Our desire for total dislocation was not entirely vain. Spread-eagled by the
heat on an Umbrian hillside, lost to view round the last hairpin bend, it
was easy to cultivate the illusion of escape. But the substitute reality of
rural middle Italy remained as elusive as the tree frogs whose telephonic
trilling filled the nights.
The body was a willing slave to lassitude, the spirit succumbed. And then
the brain piped up: 'When do the banks shut? Is there enough milk for the
morning? Hell] It's half-day closing. And the well is running dry . . . Dear
God, will it never rain?'
There are stratagems for this condition. One can play at living the peasant
life - up at dawn, walk round the fields of sunflowers browning in the sun,
inspect the tobacco plants being expensively watered from the reservoir,
scramble indoors out of the sun to read, eat and doze until it is time to
open the first bottle of the night.
But the townie's rustic roots are too deeply buried and his agricultural
memory has atrophied. A former ambassador to Tokyo once told me that when a
foreigner says to you he understands the Japanese it means he has become
Japan-ese.
That voluntarily displaced person, the holidaymaker, can live like a peasant
only by becoming a peasant, which - if he has any sense - is the thing
furthest from his mind. So while his eye is delighting in the scene from his
vine-clad terrace his cortex is probably calculating how much European Union
subsidy he has personally contributed to create such charming effects.
Macbeth was wrong: returning is not more tedious than going o'er, even if
the first encounter with native British reality can be a shock.
My heart sank to my deckshoes at the sight of the newspaper headline on the
Channel ferry: 'Princess Di in phone leak probe'. Was nothing else happening
in my real world? Lord Archer was still in trouble over his share dealings.
The replacement royal yacht Britannia was to be hawked around to corporate
sponsors and former Page Three girl Samantha Fox had discovered Jesus.
The only piece of genuine news was simply incredible - that the IRA was
about to declare a ceasefire in Northern Ireland.
'Good holiday?' they ask you kindly as you mooch into the office. Yes,
thanks. Great. (And it was). 'Glad to be back, ha, ha,' they always add. The
proper answer is to roll the eyes heavenward and twist the face into a
grimace of simulated pain.
It is a foolish convention. It connives at the strange superstition that we
must never admit, because of the huge investment we have made in going away,
that coming home is a real pleasure.

FT  03 SEP 94 / The temptations of Utopia: In search of a perfect world, 25
'Freelanders' set sail for Africa 100 years ago. JDF Jones tells how it all
ended in disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JDF JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One hundred years ago this summer, two dozen Europeans of different
nationalities, members of 'The Freeland Association', attempted - and failed
 -to establish a Utopian 'Freeland' in East Africa, on the slopes of Mount
Kenya.
Not that they ever got within sight of that wonderful mountain which sits on
the Equator - they never set foot beyond the exotic Indian Ocean island of
Lamu, where they arrived on All Fools Day, 1894, and sat there sweltering in
the Big Rains for three months before they gave up.
Their expedition is remembered today only as one of the smallest footnotes
of colonial history, forgotten almost at once by the chancelleries of Europe
and by the people of Lamu. But the story of Freeland, inasmuch as we can
rescue it from obscurity, has its own particular fascination, coming as it
did just before a century whose political history was to be dominated by the
great Marxist experiments.
It was just one of countless examples of our human attraction to Utopias:
the Freelanders were a very minor example of the phenomenon, a ridiculously
tiny group in comparison with the millions who were to be involved in the
Marxist revolutions, but their story illustrates the temptation, and the
inevitable frustration, of the journey.
The Freeland movement flourished briefly in Europe in the early 1890s under
the inspiration of Dr Theodor Hertzka, a not-too-nutty Austrian economist
and visionary who, in an extraordinary book Freeland: A Social Anticipation,
described in extreme detail how a new and splendid community might be
achieved if interest rates were abolished and land held in common.
He chose to describe this revolutionary social order - which was to be
accompanied by a host of other high-minded reforms - by setting it in the
hinterland of East Africa, which he apparently assumed was under-populated
and therefore available to newcomers.
The Freeland movement managed to attract adherents from across the fringes
of radical Europe - anarchists alarmed by the police crackdown throughout
the continent, revolutionaries on the brink of admitting defeat, socialist
idealists disillusioned by the drift into conventional and cautious
political processes - and, it seems, more sober citizens who were looking
for a new life.
Astonishingly, Dr Hertzka managed to persuade the Foreign Office in London
to grant permission to the Freeland Association to send a pioneer party to
establish a settlement near Mount Kenya: hence the arrival of 25 Austrian,
German, English, French, Dutch and Scandinavian members, of whom two were
women, on Lamu Island on April 1.
'Freeland' shared many of the characteristics of Utopian movements worldwide
and across the centuries. For instance, its adherents were inspired by the
vision of a single leader or sage - the counterpart of Karl Marx, the said
Dr Hertzka, of whom little else has been remembered.
Dr Hertzka had never been anywhere near East Africa - though he must have
read the self-regarding memoirs of Carl Peters, the vicious German imperial
adventurer of the time - but he does not hesitate to expound, over hundreds
of pages, a ridiculous farago of fantasies about life on the African
savannah: zebras will be trained to draw carriages, elephants will be
amenable to domesticity like their Indian counterparts, the Masai maidens
will embrace chastity, their warriors will lay down their spears and don
tunics of Grecian style, criminals will reform, wives will be faithful,
drunkenness will vanish, nihilism will wither away, hundreds of thousands of
European disciples will soon flock to Freeland.
There were plenty of people who read the good doctor's prophecies in 1892,
either in German or in the English edition, and joined the various branches
of the Freeland Association in the principal cities of Europe.
In 1894, 25 of them sailed for Lamu Island. These Freelanders were radicals,
as Utopianists usually are. They were eager for a vision of the future - a
better future. They were also, we may guess, in retreat from their own
European world.
But the particular fascination of the Freelanders is that they were
emigrants who rejected the motivations of their age. This was a decade when
millions of people were leaving Europe to make a new life overseas  - in the
United States, in South America, in the Antipodes, in Southern Africa. Many
of these millions, probably most, left the poverty and impediments of Europe
in order to seek economic success.
The Freelanders were not like this: they left Europe in order to get away
from the norms and ambitions of bourgeois society; they were trying to start
again.
Of course, 'Freeland' was a disaster. The detail of what happened has been
lost but we know that the pioneer expedition never managed to get away from
Lamu - an island whose exotic and decadent charms have been famous in the
Indian Ocean for centuries (the local speciality, then as now, was
transvestites).
The Freelanders had arrived at the wrong time of year; the rains were
imminent; the Tana River which they proposed to use as their route to the
Highlands (utterly unrealistically because the Tana is not navigable) was in
flood; the wild behaviour of their members offended the local community,
which was and is strictly Islamic, with the women in deep purdah.
There is today only the faintest folk memory of the Freelanders on the
island: they are remembered for urinating from the rooftops on to the
pedestrians in the narrow streets, for shooting water pots off the heads of
servant girls, for carousing and drinking and for the immodest dress of the
women.
They hung around in Lamu for a few months, their morals and their behaviour
degenerating in the uncomfortable heat of the 'off' season, until the
British authorities lost patience and ordered the cancellation of the
expedition and the disbandment of their association.
Some of the Freelanders went home, where Dr Hertzka, who had not actually
accompanied his disciples, admitted the failure of his Utopia; rather more
of them went elsewhere in Africa, to Tanganyika, Rwanda, Mashonaland, the
Transvaal.
Perhaps some of them could not face going home after such a rapid
humiliation, perhaps some of them could not risk it - an expedition of this
sort would have included adventurers and rogues as well as idealists and
socialists.
So the Freelanders were soon forgotten. But the moral of this tiny episode,
this abortion of an equatorial jaunt by a small bunch of fantasists, niggles
away. If these Utopian projects seem invariably to fail, why have there been
so many?
What is it in the make-up of morally-aware and not-necessarily-foolish
people that tempts us to venture out so rashly to seek to make a reality out
of manifest fiction? Did the Freelanders seriously think that the African
tribes of the Kenya Highlands would welcome them?
The explanation must be that it is too easy to invent Utopias, to dream.
Occasionally that dream is so persuasive that it comes to be implemented and
offered up to the experience of reality. Always, the dream fails, whether of
Dr Hertzka or Karl Marx, Freeland or Soviet Russia, the Third Reich or
Apartheid.
Better to be Plato or More, Fourier or Butler, Proudhon or Morris, Bacon or
Coleridge, and remain in the library. Dr Hertzka's tragedy was that, in the
summer of 1894, Freeland was essayed.
Freeland, a novel by JDF Jones based on these events of 1894, has been
published by Sinclair-Stevenson (Pounds 14.99).

FT  03 SEP 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Sales pitch that fills rooms -
Tim Minogue visits a hotel that found success by creating its own cricket
square
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM MINOGUE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Encouraging parties of amateur cricketers to leave their wives and
girlfriends at home for several days and stay in a hotel with a 24-hour bar
sounds like a recipe for disaster. Hoteliers of a nervous disposition might
imagine fragile profits shattering along with the crockery in the course of
boisterous boys' nights in.
In fact, concentrating on catering for amateur cricket tours proved to be
the salvation of Linda Harrison and David Buck's hotel business.
The couple, who both worked in marketing and conference organisation,
impulsively purchased a 15-year lease on the seven-bedroom Old Vicarage
Hotel at Hinton, Hampshire, for Pounds 72,000 in 1992.
The business was in receivership, having lost Pounds 88,000 in the previous
year. What made Buck and Harrison believe they could succeed where others
had failed?
Harrison, who is 43, says: 'None of the partners worked here. The restaurant
had a bad reputation. There was little control over costs and the marketing
was unprofessional.'
Having cut costs and raised standards, Buck and Harrison played on the
hotel's strengths: a quiet rural location, 10-acre garden, in the New Forest
yet only a mile from the sea. Mailshots targeted potential customers. Yet,
at the end of their first season, they were struggling to break even.
Buck, 42, says: 'We realised that whatever we did, we were not going to make
a living out of British holidaymakers.'
Foreign visitors loved the place, but usually only stayed a night or two.
'What we needed,' says Harrison, 'was to find a niche - something no one
else in the Forest was doing - that would guarantee room occupancy during
the week.'
In the summer of 1993 they took a lease on an overgrown neighbouring field
with the idea of using it as a car park for wedding receptions. When he had
cleared the chest-high nettles, however, Buck realised that he was standing
in the middle of what could become, with imagination and hard labour, a
delightful, rustic cricket oval. Could cricket be the niche they had been
searching for?
A crude square was prepared and an advertisement placed in the Cricketer
magazine, suggesting the hotel as a base for teams touring the area.
'We expected about six replies,' says Buck. 'We were astonished to receive
more than 50 serious inquiries.' Within weeks, 25 cricket teams had booked
to stay at the Old Vicarage in the 1994 season.
Buck invited an old friend, former Hampshire county cricketer John Rice, to
inspect the wicket. 'His advice was to dig it up.' Hampshire's groundsmen at
Southampton and Portsmouth gave some tips on basic groundsmanship. An
advertisement in the local paper produced a nucleus of players for a revived
Hinton Admiral CC - there had not been a team in the village since the 1970s
 -and offers of equipment. The local blacksmith made a roller. A scoreboard
was painted on the back of a decrepit stable. The result is a ground which
looks as though it has existed for 100 years, yet in fact is not a year old.
Buck, who reached the pinnacle of his own cricketing career in the 1970s
with three or four appearances as a fast bowler for Hampshire Second XI, was
impressed by the enthusiasm if not the talent of his recruits, who range in
age from 24 to 74 and include the hotel's chef, a couple of City types, an
engineer, a roadsweeper, a toymaker and a retired major. Intensive coaching
sessions are slowly paying dividends: Hinton's record to date is played 17,
won three, lost 13, drawn one, compared with a 100 per cent record of
defeats at the end of July.
Buck provides prospective touring teams with a fixture contact list for more
than 100 local sides in Hampshire and Dorset. The bar, crammed with
cricketing memorabilia, stays open as late as the guests wish. Only on one
occasion have victory celebrations got out of hand, when a 2am water fight
ruined several mattresses.
Half of the teams which stayed at the Old Vicarage in 1994 have made firm
bookings for 1995.
Harrison says: 'The cricket enables us to plan ahead. We know we will have
that cash flow in a year's time.'
The couple believe that only two or three other hotels in Britain have their
own cricket pitches. It is proving an attractive asset for corporate
entertainment. Plessey, Lloyds Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank have all held
staff cricket matches and barbecues at the Old Vicarage; another company
plans to use the ground for an archery day.
Buck and Harrison expect to make a small profit this year on a turnover of
about Pounds 130,000.
A bonus for Buck is that he gets to be captain of his own cricket team. He
can afford to be more philosophical about losing than most skippers: 'I like
to see our visitors go home happy. Anyway, when they've won, they spend more
at the bar.'

FT  03 SEP 94 / As They Say in Europe: Confused by the lessons of war -
James Morgan asks if Bomber Harris would stamp out crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a fairly interesting editorial in the London Sunday Telegraph last
week on the subject of crime and punishment, an Anglo-Saxon obsession these
days. Its main thrust, if I understood it, was that in western societies the
(criminal) enemy at home resembled the enemy abroad of past times, that is
to say Germany. And enemies have to be severely punished, not understood.
That was aimed at Tony Blair, the leader of the Labour Party, who once said
he would be 'tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime'.
The Telegraph said the background to criminal behaviour should be a
secondary matter of concern and concluded with a reference to 1914:
'Germany's illegalities then, as again in 1939, were defeated by force, not
by inquiring into their causes.'
This argument suggests bizarre conclusions and on this day, the 55th
anniversary of the outbreak of the second world war, it is worth seeing what
they are. Let us start with the Great War, which Le Monde celebrated all
last month with a series of illuminating studies of lesser known aspects of
that event. One of the last pieces was headlined, 'The army distressed by a
beaten and shocked Germany.'
It dealt with the reception given to the armies of the Kaiser on their
return to the Fatherland in November 1918. The army believed it had not been
beaten. The last message of the commander, Field Marshall Hindenburg, ran:
'Thanks to victorious attacks as well as determined defence we have been
able to keep the enemy far from our borders. We have saved our country from
terror and destruction.'
The population disagreed and greeted the solders with hostility, which Le
Monde called la fete refusee. The troops believed they had been sold out by
traitors at home. Then came the Treaty of Versailles which, in another
article, Le Monde called, 'The antechamber of the next catastrophe'. At
Versailles, Germany was punished in a manner that would gladden the heart of
a Sunday editorialist. She was found guilty in the dock of world opinion,
lands were lost and huge fines imposed (which were not paid).
To cut a long story short, Hitler played on the myth of the stolen victory
and the stab in the back, launched the second world war and tried to murder
the Jews whom he held responsible.
These 'illegalities' eventually met with a firm response. The anniversaries
of that action now flood the newspapers. But the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung celebrated the anniversary of the liberation of Paris in an unusual
manner. One item started: 'In this year is there no end to the
commemorations of the events of 50 years ago. They will continue until May
1995. Fifty years ago many in Europe experienced horror.
'In Germany it was above all the allied bombardment which the people had
increasingly to suffer. Almost every day towns were the target of heavy
attacks, some places were bombed again and again, for example Kiel with its
harbours and U-Boat depots. Not only were military installations hit by the
allied air fleets, but also, systematically, residential districts. What
happened in one such attack is reflected here in the matter-of-fact words of
the record kept in the war diary of a marine auxiliary on August 26 1944.'
The report was a hair-raising account of nearly six hours of heavy bombing
in which both sides suffered substantial losses. But, having read Le Monde
just a day before, one was struck by a resounding fact: how different things
were in 1945 from 1918. At the end of the second world war no German could
think his country had been spared 'terror and destruction' nor could he
think it had not been defeated. And Germany, as the FAZ implicitly pointed
out, suffered a similar fate to that of its victims in the second war.
One conclusion might be that we must all thank Lord 'Bomber' Harris for half
a century of peace in western Europe. The controversial head of the Royal
Air Force is regarded as a war criminal in some circles in Germany because
it was he who implemented the policy of so-called carpet bombing of German
cities. But one must recognise that Germany, where memories of the raids are
as vivid as ever, has presented no threat to anybody for the first time in
100 years. And still does not today.
That looks likes one up to the Sunday Telegraph. Yet there is another side
to the story. After the second world war there was no Versailles. Germany,
at least the western bit, was given a shiny new constitution and pots of
money. No huge fines, no isolation from the community of nations, instead a
willingness on the part of the victors to learn from their past mistakes.
If there is a lesson in terms of domestic law enforcement in all this, which
is doubtful, then it is a peculiar one. The police should be extravagantly
violent in their pursuit of the criminal, but the judicial agencies must
exercise extreme leniency in the imposition of penalties. In other words, in
English terms, the accused should be beaten up in the remand cell before the
trial and given an unconditional discharge after it.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: House sold for less than value
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I sold a house to my daughter recently. The property was purchased in 1983
and lived in as the family home for five years. My wife and I then moved out
of the house to another house, which I declared to be my main residence for
mortgage tax relief.
Our daughter continued to live in the house which she has just bought,
sharing it with two other people and paying a rent to me which just paid for
the mortgage.
The purchase price in 1983 was Pounds 30,000; the valuation for the sale
(last December) was Pounds 55,000; and the actual price taken for the house
from my daughter was Pounds 40,000. The difference of Pounds 15,000 is, as
far as we are concerned, a gift to our daughter.
I do not imagine that I will have to pay much, if any, capital gains tax on
the house. But I am not sure if there are any tax complications or
liabilities on the Pounds 15,000.
The solicitor who acted for you in the sale is, of course, best placed to
guide you through the CGT labyrinth.
To get a broad idea of the intricate and arbitrary rules, you could ask your
tax office for the free leaflets CGT 4 (Owner-occupied houses) and CGT14
(Capital gains tax: an introduction), but bear in mind that they are not up
to date.
You will be assessable to CGT on the sale as though you had sold the house
at its full market value (by virtue of section 18 of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (Transactions between connected persons)).
But, in addition to the relief for the number of days during which it was
your main residence, you should be entitled to relief for the same number of
days during which it was let (by virtue of section 223 of the Chargeable
Gains Act (Relief on disposal of private residence - amount of relief)),
without double counting the final 1,096 days before the sale.
As you will see, the calculation depends upon precise dates - but you might
well have no CGT to pay.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Wife wants her money faster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I lived and worked overseas for 10 years with my husband, who is a foreign
national, but I have now returned to the UK with our two small daughters.
We decided to separate as he wants to live in his own country. Before
applying for a divorce, we agreed to divide our savings in half, with my
portion being transferred to the UK.
In order to make tax-efficient investments, we have begun using a personal
equity plan under my name to bring in the money. But it would take about 10
years to transfer it like this. Is there a better way to do it?
It might well be in your own interests, and those of your children, to
ensure that the division of savings be carried out immediately rather than
be prolonged over 10 years.
As an individual, you are allowed to put Pounds 9,000 a year into Peps -
Pounds 6,000 in a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 in a single company PEP. In
addition, Tessas (tax-exempt special savings accounts) enable a total of
Pounds 9,000 to be invested over a five-year period.
As for investing the balance, this depends on the amount of money involved
and your personal circumstances. As a rough and ready suggestion, it could
be well be worth looking at high quality investment trusts where the
investment criteria is very low or nil income but maximum capital growth.
Thus, your income tax situation could be minimised and, providing you use
the annual exemption for capital gains tax to mitigate CGT as much as
possible, you should be able to run a simple, tax-efficient portfolio for
yourself. (Answer by Murray Johnstone).

FT  03 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Guarantor who had to pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Several years ago, I agreed to be a guarantor in respect of a company
overdraft. But the business failed and I was obliged to compensate the bank
to the full extent of my guarantee.
Is it possible for the sum thus paid to be used in offsetting a current
liability for capital gains tax? If so, are copies of correspondence
sufficient evidence to forward with my tax return? And can the 'loss' be
indexed?
There is no indexation relief on guarantor's payments. Section 136(4) of the
Capital Gains Tax Act 1979 (re-enacted as section 253(4) of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992) says:
'If, on a claim by a person who has guaranteed the repayment of a loan which
is . . . a qualifying loan, the inspector is satisfied that (a) any
outstanding amount of, or interest in respect of, the principle of the loan
has become irrecoverable from the borrower, and (b) the claimant has made a
payment under the guarantee . . . in respect of that amount . . .(then) this
act shall have effect as if an allowable loss had accrued to the claimant
when the payment was made; and the loss shall be equal to the payment made
by him . . . less any contribution payable to him by any co-guarantor in
respect of the payment so made.'
It is a pity you have waited nearly five years before making your claim.
However, you should submit one forthwith, without waiting any longer.
In addition to the correspondence, you should give the inspector the name
and address of the company and any other details which may help in tracing
the company's tax files.
The inspector will want to see exactly how the money was used by the company
 -to check (for example) that the whole of the payment which you made
relates to a 'qualifying loan'.

I live on a private road, the common parts of which are owned by a limited
company in which all the freeholders are also shareholders. The company has
reserves of about Pounds 35,000 in an account earning 2 per cent.
What is the best kind of investment account in which to keep this money?
Because of the relatively small amount of money involved, it is difficult to
see how you are going to get significantly better rates with a bank deposit.
If the company employs an accountant or solicitor to prepare annual
accounts, it might be worth seeing if this amount of money could be bulked
with other sums on client account to achieve a better rate of interest than
the present one. (Murray Johnstone Personal Asset Management).

FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Rates hold up - Annuities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER QUINTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
August has seen a relatively even split between companies which have
decreased their annuity rates and those which have increased them.
Key players to have moved downwards include Equitable Life, which dropped
its rates by 4 per cent on August 11, and Stalwart Insurance which dropped
by 2 per cent on August 8.
The most recent movements, however, have taken a slight upward trend;
companies to have increased their rates include Sun Alliance which moved up
by 2 per cent on August 23, and Sun Life of Canada which increased its rates
by 1 per cent on August 25.
The continuing shifts make it hard to predict what might happen over the
next few weeks, but those soon to retire should take comfort in knowing that
rates remain very good. This is encouraging for people seeking an immediate
income and who would prefer to buy an annuity now rather than wait for the
possibility of better returns later in the year.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Skipton flies high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU

<TEXT>
Skipton building society's fixed-rate bond, paying 8.25 per cent gross per
annum for three years, has entered our Highest Rates table (below) in the
week of its launch, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu.
The rate is paid on a minimum deposit of Pounds 2,000 to a maximum of Pounds
250,000. Withdrawals cannot be made until September 30 1996; any made after
this date and before the redemption date will be charged a 4 per cent
penalty.
The Skipton bond pays interest annually. But for those wanting monthly
interest, Leeds &amp; Holbeck's three-year Triple Choice bond pays a fixed rate
of 8 per cent gross.
From November 1, the cheque clearance time for Nationwide FlexAccount
customers will be reduced from up to seven working days to three days
(cashcard-only FlexAccount cheques will still take seven days, though).
Unauthorised overdraft charges will be increased, however. Those who go
Pounds 20 into the red will be charged Pounds 10; previously, the fee
applied to those with a Pounds 100 unauthorised overdraft.
Abbey National has issued a new range of fixed-rate mortgages which are
almost 2 percentage points higher than ones withdrawn. The two-year fixed
rate is 8.75 per cent (9.3 APR) - higher than the bank's standard variable
rate of 7.74 per cent. The previous two-year fixed rate had been 6.94 per
cent.
The other fixed rates are: three-years at 9.15 per cent (9.7 APR); four
years at 9.5 per cent (10.1 APR) and 10 years at 9.99 per cent (10.7 APR).
Fees are between Pounds 250 and Pounds 300.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Private health cover spreads -
Bethan Hutton finds that Bupa remains the biggest but Norwich is making its
mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One in nine people in the UK is now covered by private medical insurance,
according to research by market analyst Euromonitor. It says the UK will
spend Pounds 1.4bn on medical premiums this year and predicts the figure
will have reached more than Pounds 1.5bn by 1998.
Spending on premiums rose by 46 per cent between 1989 and 1993, while the
amount spent on advertising surged during the same period: up by 126 per
cent to Pounds 12.9m in 1993. Much of this was spent as the British United
Provident Association (Bupa) battled to retain its dominant position and
Norwich Union launched a growing range of plans.
Bupa still has the largest share of the market, with 46 per cent, followed
by PPP with 28 per cent. Figures from specialist health analyst Laing &amp;
Buisson show that Bupa's market share has fallen from 59 per cent in 1985.
Newcomer Norwich Union, which started selling medical insurance only in
1991, has taken 8 per cent of the market already and overtaken the Western
Provident Association to become the third-largest provider of private
insurance.
L&amp;B's latest report shows that an estimated 6.58m people in the UK have
private cover, which is a slight fall from the peak of 6.63m in 1990. The
decline is thought to have been caused mainly by the recession and steep
premium increases. These have slowed, from 6.9 per cent above inflation in
1991 and 9.7 per cent in 1992 to 3.8 per cent in 1993. But L&amp;B says that,
despite the success insurers have had in controlling costs, premiums are
likely to continue to rise faster than inflation for the rest of the decade.
Euromonitor and L&amp;B both expect the market for private medical insurance to
start expanding again over the next few years as worries over the National
Health Service continue and new products make private cover more accessible.
L&amp;B projects from present trends that almost 17 per cent of the population -
or 9.9m people - could have private insurance by the year 2000, compared
with just over 11 per cent today.
Several new types of policy have appeared, particularly at the low-cost end
of the market. This started with PPP's introduction of the first 'six-week
wait' policy in 1979; this paid for private treatment only if the NHS
waiting list was longer than six weeks. Since then, helped by all the
publicity about long NHS waiting lists, six-week plans have spread
throughout the market. Other plans restrict cover to in-patient treatment or
certain types of hospital.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Be sure to keep records
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax inspectors, like birds of prey, wait for their victims to make a
mistake. In many cases, people coming to the UK take detailed advice on
arranging their affairs only to find, several years later, that their plans
have not been implemented properly.
This can be caused by complacence, coupled with ignorance of the small print
of the tax legislation - or by new rules that are overlooked. The result is
rich pickings for the Inland Revenue.
It is becoming increasingly common for inspectors to harass taxpayers,
whether they are UK-domiciled or not. Quite often, tax is not due - but the
documentary evidence to prove it beyond doubt is lacking. The victim is,
therefore, pressured into paying some tax simply to avert the stress of a
full-scale investigation.
So, if you want an offshore structure to be tax-effective, it is crucial to
have regular meetings with your UK tax advisers and make sure that proper
records are kept.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Pounds 50,000 fine on IFA - Knight
Williams hit for breaches of Fimbra rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Knight Williams, an independent financial adviser, was this week fined
Pounds 50,000 for breaching 10 Fimbra rules; these included issuing
misleading advertisements and failing to maintain proper client records. In
addition to the fine - the second-largest imposed by Fimbra, the
self-regulating body for IFAs - the company was ordered to pay Pounds 23,400
costs.
Kenneth Jordan, head of the 255-member Knight Williams Investors' Action
Group, said: 'The fine is derisory. What is invigorating is that Fimbra has
finally done what it should have years ago.'
Knight Williams, which specialises in giving advice to the elderly and
retired, was the subject of an early day motion in the House of Commons in
July. This referred to the number of complaints received from MPs'
dissatisfied constituents.
In an unusual step, the Securities and Investments Board, the chief
regulator for the financial services industry, issued a statement this week
saying it had been 'closely informed' of the disciplinary procedures
resulting in the Fimbra fine.
Knight Williams was also found to be in breach of SIB's principle 9 stating
that 'a firm should organise and control its internal affairs in a
responsible manner, keeping proper records'. The firm should ensure that
staff employed to conduct investment business 'are suitable,
adequately-trained and properly supervised, and that it has well-defined
compliance procedures'.
SIB added that, along with Fimbra, it would stay in close contact with
Knight Williams regarding the firm's handling of complaints. Dissatisfied
clients wanting to make a complaint should first address it to the company.
Most of the Fimbra charges covered failings in client files; these included
an inability to demonstrate that the firm had adhered to the Know Your
Client and Best Advice rules. Financial advisers must be able to show they
have given suitable advice to clients based on a knowledge of their
investment requirements and financial circumstances.
Other charges included issuing advertisements containing 'inaccurate and
misleading information'; 'issuing an advertisement that was clearly not an
advertisement, and which was clearly capable of being taken as a news item
or editorial matter'; and 'issuing a comparison or contrast which was not
clearly based on facts verified by the issuer, was not presented in a fair
and balanced way, and which omitted material items'.
Knight Williams, which has 24,000 clients, says it will be writing to
investors whose files were criticised and will also try to identify those
clients who responded to the advertisements cited by Fimbra. The company
would not say how many clients were involved.
In a written statement, managing director John Williams said: 'We are
naturally concerned about being censured by our regulator - it is a serious
matter.' The fine will be paid out of dividends to the firm's three
shareholders: Robin Knight Bruce, John Williams and Stephen Prescott.
The Action Group is due to meet SIB later this month. According to Jordan,
who lost his own case against Knight Williams at arbitration: 'We hope to
come to an arrangement to increase the chances of small investors getting a
good deal.'
Jordan, who favours conciliation rather than the Fimbra arbitration process,
added: 'Arbitration is weighted in favour of the IFA because they have the
financial and legal muscle to present their case.'

FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: How to minimise your obligations to
the taxman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Paulo has arrived from Italy to set up a business in Britain through a UK
company. He is UK resident but not domiciled. What should he do to minimise
his tax obligations?
Capital gains tax
To escape CGT, it is better for him not to own the shares personally but
through an offshore trust. Any gain made on selling the company would then
be free of CGT.
Inheritance tax
Since Paulo is not domiciled in the UK, he is liable to pay IHT only on
assets owned there, such as his company. Paulo would, therefore, be well
advised to own this company through an offshore company since he would not
then own the UK assets directly.
This advantage would stop once he had been resident in the UK for 17 of the
previous 20 years. But if he had placed his offshore company into a trust
before the 17 years, the arrangement could continue indefinitely. It might,
however, backfire for income tax purposes. If the income was brought back to
the UK, it could be taxed without any allowance for the tax credit on the UK
dividend.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Why the UK can be the world's best
tax haven - The catch is that you need to be resident but not domiciled.
Caroline Garnham examines the best ways to keep the Revenue at arm's length
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE GARNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some might find it hard to believe - but the UK is the best tax haven in the
world if you are resident but not domiciled there.
UK legislation takes into account two factors in taxing individuals:
Residence, which is determined by how much time you spend in the country.
Domicile, a common law concept which has nothing to do with either residence
or nationality. In essence, it is the country you consider to be your
'home'.
If you are resident in the UK but domiciled elsewhere, you will not have to
pay tax on profits - whether income or gains - made abroad unless you bring
them into the UK. Nor will you have to pay inheritance tax on any assets or
investments you own abroad for the first 16-17 years.
Indeed, you can reside in the UK tax-free if you own or earn nothing in the
UK; keep all your investments abroad; and bring into the UK only 'pure'
capital. That is, money to which neither income nor capital gains made while
resident in the UK has been added.
There are many ways in which profits can be separated from capital so that
they are left offshore, with only the capital brought to the UK. One is for
pure capital to be deposited in an offshore bank account (account 1) with
all the income mandated to a separate offshore account (account 2). Money
can then be brought to the UK from the first account without having to pay
income tax.
The usual difficulty is finding pure capital. So, the best time for you to
do any tax planning is before you arrive in the UK or just after you have
received an inheritance or substantial gift.
There are some ways in which income can be converted into pure capital.
Investment income - such as the interest in account 2 - can be converted if,
immediately before the beginning of the tax year on April 6, account 1 is
closed down and the money transferred to a new bank account. The interest
earned on account 1, which is sitting in account 2, can then be brought into
the UK in the new financial year free of income tax.
Converting investment income abroad into tax-free sums has been done by many
people for many years. But it works only with investment income, not earned
income, and then only for those with an eye for detail.
One woman, of whom I know, thought she was operating the scheme successfully
until the Inland Revenue asked her for proof. It was only then that she
discovered her bank offshore had been operating only one account, to which
both income and gains had been added regularly.
The woman, who had been bringing substantial sums from this account into the
UK, had no option but to pay a significant amount of tax plus interest and
penalties.
If you are lucky enough to be non-UK domiciled but UK resident with
substantial funds, it is, usually, easier to set up one or two trusts
offshore. The trustees then can be responsible for making sure the income is
removed from the trust funds and kept offshore, and that only pure and
untaxable capital sums are brought into the UK.
The other big advantage, if you benefit from a trust set up by someone not
domiciled in the UK, is that all gains made in the trust are tax-exempt -
even if they are brought into the UK later. This is true even for gains made
in the UK.
You might wonder why the law is not changed to catch long-term UK residents
who live tax-free.
The reasons are simple. The government has admitted that it does not make
economic sense to change the law for non-UK domiciled British residents
since, for practical purposes, the tax advantages are available only for
capital-rich foreigners. And these are just the people the UK wants to
attract because they are either big spenders or good profit generators.
Thus, it is highly unlikely that these tax laws, unfair though they may be,
are likely to be amended by this government or any future administration,
irrespective of party.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Looking to the long term - The
Professional / Joanna Slaughter sums up her series on private client fund
managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The investment managers profiled over the past 10 weeks differ on asset
allocation, stock-picking, the use of derivatives and the management of a
private client relationship. But none would dissent from the view that Big
is Beautiful. Indeed, size is their most seductive sales pitch.
Certainly, it bestows benefits that more modest investment houses cannot
provide. There is much advantage to be had in pointing out that the
portfolio managers who look after private clients draw on the same research
and global investment resources as the managers who run billions of pounds
of institutional money.
Size also provides a great degree of security for the assets of private
clients, along with capital resources for the systems and manning levels
needed to provide customers with the attention they want. After all, those
who go to the investment equivalent of Savile Row expect both a bespoke suit
of financial clothes and first-class service.
Accordingly, many of the largest firms are able to devote considerable
resources to matching the client to the fund manager, and to ensuring that
an administrator is a lead player in the private client team, not a tail-end
Charlie. As David Rosier, the chairman of Mercury Asset Management (the
investment management arm of the SG Warburg Group), put it: 'People can
understand that you don't always get that extra bit of performance, but they
can't understand if you don't spell their name right or if they don't
receive their dividend cheques.'
Although the investment styles of the large fund management firms vary,
private clients will find that a top-down investment approach is common.
Most managers view the right asset allocation as central to managing
portfolios - and asset allocation processes are highly disciplined.
The investment management of private client portfolios also tends to be
controlled tightly, and many management firms run white and black lists of
stocks. The freedoms allowed to individual managers within these lists vary
but, overall, most firms might well agree that their investment style was
long-term, cautious and conservative.
Although portfolio management starts from the premise that the client is
king, not all firms allow their clients to be absolute monarchs. Indeed, in
flexibility, some of the blue-chip investment management outfits compare
badly with more modest rivals.
Some accept clients only on a discretionary basis, and the use of collective
funds for overseas and specialist investments is universal. At Schroder, any
private client with less than Pounds 500,000 is directed to the Schroder
World Fund unit trust, and assets of Pounds 2m are needed for a managed
portfolio of equities.
Of course, controlled investment management, underpinned by huge research
capability, is of little benefit unless it produces performance - but
relative performance is not easy to gauge with bespoke portfolios. Alastair
Begg, chief investment officer of Kleinwort Benson Investment Manager, says:
'There is no answer that is likely to be right for more than one client.'
Some managers run model portfolios, however, and firms increasingly are
offering a unit trust that replicates the portfolio of a private client
portfolio. This fund acts both as a shop window for the firm's investment
skills and a way of appealing to the smaller investor market.
The big question is whether the intimate relationship between client and
manager; the services offered; and the investment results achieved by the
private client division of a huge investment house are enough to justify
what are, in some cases, very high minimum investment requirements and stiff
management fees.
Certainly, exclusivity can come at a price that only a niche market of
investors can afford. Tim Keown, director of Pounds 125m Ely Fund Managers,
points out that many of the leading investment managers are declining to
consider large numbers of private clients if they are looking for managed
portfolios of equities.
Keown adds: 'There is a large chunk of the private client market where the
average family or individual has investment capital of Pounds 50,000 to
Pounds 400,000. They want a discretionary service and a genuinely reliable
personal relationship at partnership level.'
In the main, that certainly is not the market that the big investment
managers are chasing. They want to attract more investors into their unit
trusts; but most believe that future expansion of their private client
numbers will come from 'new' money - the fruits of entrepreneurial activity
 -and from overseas clients.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: You can bet on it] - Fancy a flutter
on exam results? No problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the GCSE school examination results came out last month, one Manchester
mother and daughter had much to celebrate. The daughter got 10 A-grades and
her mother won Pounds 150 from a bet on the outcome.
Putting money on a child's academic success might not appeal to everyone -
it could put unwelcome additional pressure on a nervous candidate - but,
every year, a few parents choose to have a flutter.
Bookmaker William Hill started offering odds on exam grades a few years ago
when a 15-year-old boy studying for GCSEs asked to lay a bet on his own
chances. He was refused - betting is illegal for under-18s - but his father
then staked Pounds 50 at 20-1 that his son would get all A-grades.
Then the boy's headmaster also placed a bet - and with such confidence from
those with inside knowledge of his form, it was not surprising that the boy
turned out a winner.
Since then, the typical odds have narrowed. Graham Sharpe, at William Hill,
gave the bright Manchester girl odds of 3-1 after seeing her latest school
report and mock GCSE results. But, given that about 80 per cent of bets on
exam results are successful, Sharpe's odds may still be on the generous
side.
Another winner this year was a father whose son arrived in the UK from the
former Yugoslavia only in May 1992 but still managed three grade As at
A-level this summer.
Winnings usually end up in the hands of the successful youngsters, perhaps
as a cash bonus or in the form of a new bike or holiday. If you had planned
to wave a Pounds 50 note or two in front of your child as an incentive for
diligent revision, then placing a bet could be one way of doubling or even
tripling the potential reward. If, however, your child slipped one grade but
then demanded a reward for all the effort, anyway, you might regret having
staked the money.
As with all wagers, there is a tax of 10 per cent. You can decide whether to
pay it when you lay the bet or run the risk of paying 10 per cent of your
winnings.
If your children's talents lie in other directions, you can find bookies
willing to lay odds on sporting prowess or almost any other achievement.
Sharpe was contacted recently by parents wanting to bet that their son would
play rugby for England. Any win would be a long time coming, though - the
lad was only 17 days old.
At that age, the odds offered can be spectacular: perhaps 10,000-1 or more.
But when the child is older, and has had the chance to show if it has some
footballing talent, they drop quite sharply.
Even so, most parents betting on their children's sporting success get only
entertainment value from the bet. But, six or seven years ago, Sharpe
accepted Pounds 200 from a proud father who wagered - at 500-1 - that his
son would win the 1,500 metres race at the 1996 Olympics.
That boy is Curtis Robb who was, at the time, just another good teenage
runner. Since then, though, he has become a leading athlete who ran in the
800 metres at the Barcelona Olympics two years ago. Sharpe is now
confronting the real possibility of having to pay out Pounds 100,000.
So, if you cherish dreams of your son or daughter winning an Olympic gold or
getting into parliament, there is nothing to stop you backing the dream with
a little cash. It might be a very long shot - but how many other investments
could pay out Pounds 100,000 after 20 years for a one-off Pounds 200
premium? Just be sure you don't lose the betting slip.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Europe boosts Burmah - The Week
Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The gathering recovery in continental Europe should benefit Burmah Castrol,
the lubricants, chemicals and fuels group, which is expected on Monday to
report a double-digit increase in pre-tax profits - from Pounds 90.5m to
more than Pounds 100m. The lubricants business is doing well in the US and
Asia and the upturn in the German market will at last benefit the
metallurgical businesses of Foseco, which was bought at the end of 1990.
Bowater, the packaging, printing and coated products group, is expected on
Tuesday to announce profits for the half-year to June broadly similar to
last year's Pounds 102.6m. Consensus forecasts are just over Pounds 100m,
with a range of Pounds 99m to Pounds 105m.
Last year's figure, however, was boosted by an exceptional gain on disposals
of Pounds 7.9m, so underlying profits growth is expected to be about 8 per
cent.
While good performances are likely to be reported from some overseas
operations, especially in Australia and the Specialty Coatings International
business in the US, many businesses have experienced margin pressures in the
first half.
Hillsdown Holdings, the food manufacturer, is likely to report on Wednesday
a moderate increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 63m to about
Pounds 65m. With trading conditions remaining difficult, the most positive
news will come on the financial side. No dividend increase is expected this
time but management comments at the AGM raised shareholder hopes of a
year-end rise.
RTZ, the minerals group, is expected to report on Wednesday a steep rise in
profits for the first half of 1994, from Pounds 186m to about Pounds
210m-Pounds 215m on the back of higher base metals prices.
Analysts are anticipating Cookson, the speciality chemicals and metals
group, to report on Thursday a rise in interim underlying profits from
Pounds 37m to about Pounds 50m. But the pre-tax figure will be hit by about
Pounds 50m of exceptional losses, relating mostly to March's disposal of
Calder, the engineering business.
BTR, the industrial conglomerate, will provide one of the most important
indicators of the capital goods sector when it reports interim results on
Thursday. Analysts are expecting a double-digit increase in normalised
pre-tax profits to about Pounds 660m-Pounds 670m, and a 10 per cent rise in
the dividend.
Most attention will focus on the group's margins, following concern that
manufacturers will find it difficult to pass on the rising cost of raw
materials to their customers.
Glaxo, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals group is expected to report interim
profits up from Pounds 1.67bn to between Pounds 1.88bn and Pounds 1.9bn on
Thursday following increased volume sales of Zantac, its best-selling
anti-ulcer drug, and buoyant demand for its respiratory products.
The figures, however, could be hit by the group taking some of July's Pounds
100m bond losses against first half profits.
Analysts are also watching its dividend policy closely for any signs of
concern over patent infringement cases in North America. If, as expected,
the dividend is increased sharply to around 27p (22p), that would reflect
some confidence of the likely outcome. A maintained dividend could leave the
group open to accusations of expecting the worst.
British Gas will report its half-year results on Thursday. Second-quarter
results usually show a loss due to a seasonal downturn in demand, and
analysts are expecting a net loss of Pounds 15m-Pounds 47m. Some analysts
believe British Gas may use the occasion to elaborate on its future dividend
policy.
Earlier this year, the company warned that regulatory uncertainty was
threatening its ability to maintain dividend growth. Most analysts expect
that the 6.4p dividend will be maintained.
Cadbury Schweppes is expected on Thursday to report some of the best interim
results among UK food manufacturers with pre-tax profits up by about Pounds
40m to around Pounds 200m.
The level of recovery in profits expected from Sun Alliance, the composite
insurance group, on Thursday has produced a wide range of forecasts among
analysts. These start at Pounds 140m and rise to Pounds 215m, against Pounds
61.7m. The shares have been among the worst performers among its peers and
there is a growing view among some market watchers that the bad news is in
the price.
Interim pre-tax profits from Blue Circle on Thursday are expected to fall in
the range of Pounds 80m-Pounds 95m, against Pounds 60.5m. Attention is
likely to focus on the performances of both the UK cement market and the
home products division.
Both are expected to show a good recovery, but the level of the rally and
the accompanying outlook from the company will be watched with keen
interest.
The dividend is expected to be pegged at 3.75p.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Anyone for an armadillo? - Diary of
a Private Investor / Kevin Goldstein-Jackson explains why he finds salerooms
and their contents irresistible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For aesthetic and investment reasons, I am an avid collector of all sorts of
things including paintings, sculptures and interesting items. How, then,
could I resist a lot, offered at my local auction, comprising a stuffed
armadillo, a crocodile skin, a stuffed alligator, a stuffed marsupial,
various wooden Chinese figures and a mule saddle . . . especially as the
catalogue estimated only Pounds 40-Pounds 60 for it.
Equally intriguing was a similarly priced lot consisting of 'two boxes of
assorted curios, blowpipe, quivers, early shoes, polished stones, gas masks
etc.'
Also on offer were 'numerous pre-1947 coins and others', estimated at Pounds
30-Pounds 50. Perhaps I might find a 1933 penny worth more than Pounds
25,000. After all, I once bought a small collection of paintings at the same
auction house only to find, when I got them home, that three more pictures
were hidden behind one of the canvases.
I enjoy local auctions. They are convivial and informal places where people
sit on the chairs to be auctioned while a whole parade of objects is
displayed and, rapidly, sold.
Experts can, and do, find bargains although I have no such insider
knowledge; I just buy what appeals to me. But, over the years of
auction-going, from the grand venues of London to local salerooms, I have
learned several valuable lessons.
The most important is always to inspect the items before the sale starts.
What might appear a flawless piece of china when held up during the auction
can, on close inspection, turn out to be a mended item. A painting could
look superb from a distance; close up, it might have irreparable damage.
Close examination prevents such embarrassments.
Auction customs have changed over the years. In the past, bids have been
made by nods, winks, raising a hand or scratching your nose. In many venues
today, they are made by displaying a 'paddle' - a length of wood or plastic
to which a number has been fixed.
Intending bidders register their name and address - and often, for major
auctions, their business or banking details - with the saleroom. In return,
they get a numbered paddle to raise when they wish to make an offer. Many
auction houses use computers to track bids.
For a novice, it is easy to overlook that the final bid price is not the
only amount to be paid. To this must be added a buyer's premium, which is
usually 15 per cent on the first Pounds 30,000 and 10 per cent on the rest.
Some auction houses charge less; at Christie's in South Kensington, London,
the premium is a flat 10 per cent. But remember that value added tax must be
paid on premiums.
While the major London salerooms offer a packing service, you have to take
your own wrapping and packaging materials to most local auctions.
Before visiting an auction room on viewing day - usually the day before the
actual sale - I always get a copy of the catalogue. It is important to
remember that the estimated prices given may vary considerably, up or down.
In my early days of collecting, I used to write on the catalogue the limit
to which I was prepared to go to acquire an item. I stopped doing this after
a charity auction at which a friend kept bidding against me for a painting
until it was knocked down to me at my limit.
'I'm sorry I bid against you,' I said later. 'But I really liked the
picture.'
'That's all right,' he replied. 'I didn't want it. I saw you write down your
limit for it, so I thought I would help the charity to get a full price for
it.'

FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The largest transactions of the week were recorded at two of the giants of
the City.
SG Warburg has a market capitalisation of more than Pounds 1.6bn, but its
share price has been hit over the past year. Board members have sold stock
at various times, the most recent being Oscar Lewisohn, an executive
director, who disposed of 70,000 shares - more than a third of his holding -
at 758.5p.
Smith New Court is another large financial house where directors have been
sellers. Michael Marks, the chief executive, and Brian Mackley have sold a
total of 90,000 shares at 405p. Both retain large stakes in the company.
Neil Chisman has been finance director at Stakis, the hotel and casino
operator, since 1989 and his holding is now the second largest after Sir Reo
Stakis, the founder and president. Over the past 12 months, the shares have
had a period of considerable outperformance, although this has tailed off
over the summer. The sale of nearly 22,500 by Chisman leaves him with more
than 127,000.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Playing the markets - This has been
a relatively strong summer for UK equities. Although the FT-SE-A All-Share
index is still about 8 per cent below February's peak. What are the
prospects for the UK and elsewhere over the rest of this year and 1995?
Scheherazade Daneshkhu asked several leading fund managers for their views
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIMON DAVIES, HEAD OF GLOBAL INVESTMENT, GARTMORE:
The key to most world markets is what is likely to happen to interest rates
over the long term. The first half of 1994 saw bond markets collapse
world-wide, pulling equity markets down with them.
In the UK, a dismal performance by the gilt market has prevented equities
from reacting positively to higher than expected dividends and better
earnings prospects. The gilt market must recover for equities to have any
real chance.
In fact, the outlook for long-term rates now looks positive. Inflation looks
likely to stay down for some time and may not cross the 3 per cent barrier
until the end of 1995.
At 8.5 per cent, gilt yields look attractive, given our view that base rates
will not have to rise for some time.
With a bond market recovery, equities should do well. Economic growth should
be 3.5 per cent this year and possibly next year as well. Profits should
meet or exceed expectations.
We are probably talking about returns of 10 to 12 per cent rather than an
explosion, but still an attractive return against deposits or viewed against
2 per cent inflation. The FT-SE 100 could reach 3,400 by the end of this
year and 3,600 by the end of 1995.
Overseas, the picture is complicated by the poor showing of sterling, which
has boosted the return of overseas assets to date but seems unlikely to be
repeated.
The only currencies against which the pound looks over-valued are those in
the dollar bloc. Investors could diversify with purchases of US dollar
bonds.
Pacific and other Emerging Market equities look good value again after their
setback and are also dollar linked.
Overall, bonds and equities look a good bet relative to cash.
MICHAEL HART, CHAIRMAN, FOREIGN &amp; COLONIAL MANAGEMENT:
We are taking a fairly optimistic view of stock markets for the end of 1994
and 1995. The key factor is that higher interest rates in the United States
have begun to slow down the economy, with the result that stock and bond
markets may now be taking too pessimistic a view of the outlook for
inflation.
We expect the UK base rate to be 5.75 per cent at the end of 1994 and 7 per
cent at the end of 1995, but this is well discounted in the market.
Ten-year bond yields should move lower by end-1994 and even lower by
end-1995. Bonds in the UK and France could be especially cheap.
As far as equities are concerned in the UK, Europe and Japan, profits could
be showing good increases. However, the US is four years into its recovery
and further advanced in the profit cycle, so the best of the increase in
profits may have been seen.
If all goes well, the FT-SE 100 index could be 3,500 by the year end and
3,850 by the end of 1995. Japan could be a particularly attractive market if
local investors are encouraged by further political reforms.
Probably the most exciting returns may be obtained in Latin America.
Brazil could be the star, with gains of up to 50 per cent if the new
president, to be elected in October, is able to introduce vital reforms.
Gains of around 25 per cent could be possible in Mexico.
South Korea looks the most promising of all the emerging Asian markets, with
a possible rise of 25 per cent.
KENNETH LEVY, HEAD OF FUND MANAGEMENT, CAPEL-CURE MYERS:
The fundamental backdrop for UK equities remains quite attractive, despite
the disappointing performance of the London market so far this year.
Inflation is displaying little tendency to accelerate and pay settlements
have barely budged, despite the sharp decline in unemployment over the past
18 months. More importantly for equities, the gilt market already appears to
be discounting a significant deterioration in the inflation environment.
Given all this, we expect the FT-SE 100 index to advance to about 3,400 by
the end of this year and perhaps to 3,700-3,750 by the end of 1995.
Elsewhere, the picture is more mixed.
We feel the outlook for Wall Street is relatively positive, with recent
corporate results indicating that double digit profits growth will be
achieved this year. But we are more cautious on the prospects for
continental Europe. Valuations remain stretched, even allowing for
substantial profit gains, and this is likely to exercise a restraining
influence on the performance of these markets.
Japan may also offer private investors only limited potential over the next
12 months. The economy is gradually emerging from recession but the recovery
is likely to be anaemic.
We believe that it is right for private investors to remain committed to
equity markets. Our preference is for the UK and US markets, and we would
retain a relatively modest exposure to cash and bonds.
DAVID ROSIER, CHAIRMAN, MERCURY ASSET MANAGEMENT:
We remain positive about the UK for three main reasons: the large degree of
under-utilised capacity, enabling the economy to grow above trend without
provoking inflationary pressures; the likelihood of a significant
improvement in public sector finances, so improving the technical position
of the gilt market; and a favourable valuation compared with other major
markets.
This year has seen a dramatic upswing in sentiment towards Japan, partly
fuelled by the underweight position in Japanese stocks of many international
portfolios. Anticipated shifts in the economic structure, combined with the
opening-up of the domestic Japanese market, will encourage inward
investment.
In the Pacific area and other emerging markets, the main risks are the
reversal of international portfolio flows and adverse developments in China.
But the profit potential now appears more significant than the downside
risks.
We remain underweight in the US mainly because the opportunity for
outperformance is stronger elsewhere. Our stance on continental Europe is
still neutral due to the likelihood of corporate earnings disappointing
expectations, uncertainties in the political arena, and the valuation of its
equity markets relative to other regions.
CLIVE BOOTHMAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, SCHRODERS UNIT TRUST LTD:
As far as the UK and Europe are concerned, a combination of relatively
pallid consumer demand, spare capacity and continuing low costs, especially
wage costs, points to the continuation of a slow growth, low inflation
recovery. Consequently, we believe both equity and bond markets represent
reasonable value at these levels and have good growth potential over the
medium term.
Our most-favoured market remains Japan and we believe that it also offers
low inflation growth. But both the depth of its recession and the scale of
its market falls suggest that it may well have greater recovery potential.
Inflation fears are most pronounced in the US which is hardly surprising -
it is now entering its fourth consecutive year of growth and so spare
capacity is inevitably becoming scarce.
However, the series of pre-emptive interest rate rises seem to be slowing
growth and we predict that US inflation will show only a modest rise to just
over 3 per cent.
Increasing evidence of low inflation is stabilising the bond and equity
markets already and should give them some scope to rise.
Stability in the US bond markets will be especially good news for the
emerging markets of the Pacific and Latin American regions and should begin
to allow their strong economic growth potential to be once more reflected in
rising stock markets.
DICK BARFIELD, CHIEF INVESTMENT MANAGER, STANDARD LIFE:
Economic growth in the UK is well under way; although consumers are not
racing back to the shops, we are spending a little more than last year.
Companies are benefiting from lower unit costs and increased productivity.
Earnings and dividend growth are, so far at least, justifying the confidence
shown by market ratings and I expect this to continue.
Inflation is still weak. I do not think the government will find enough
reasons to raise interest rates far from where they are now.
The Chancellor will not stifle a recovery that has yet to translate into a
'feel good' factor so I will assume a business-friendly Budget.
Despite the decline in markets since February, equities are still quite
highly valued against bonds. Although we expect bonds to stabilise in the
face of continuing good inflation figures, the tide has turned for bond
markets. This will undoubtedly restrain equities.
For similar reasons, the US and continental Europe will not produce
outstanding returns for equity investors. The Far East - and, in particular,
Japan as recovery there gains momentum - will move ahead quite well.
My verdict for the FT-SE is around 3,400 at the end of 1994 and above 3,600
by end-1995.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Markets: Building for a confusing future - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The conflicting signals from the housing market must be as daunting for
Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as they are for equity
investors and home-owners.
Should Clarke decide to raise interest rates, he faces the problem of doing
so without denting weak consumer confidence and derailing the UK's economic
recovery. Investors, meanwhile, are wondering if building shares have
over-reached themselves. And owners - particularly those hit by negative
equity, where the value of their property is less than that of their
mortgage - are worrying that the upturn may never come.
Broadly, the picture is that sales of new houses are rising briskly but
those of old ones are not. Unless these pick up, the market for new housing
is likely to run out of steam as well.
But many people are afraid that any rise in interest rates - or even the
threat of it - may stop potential buyers taking on new mortgage commitments.
And occupiers are reluctant to move, anyway, while prices remain so
sluggish.
Housebuilders' profits are likely to rise sharply over the next 18 months as
they use up the expensive land they bought late in the 1980s and early
1990s, and as sales incentives are reduced. But the much slower recovery in
the general housing market has restricted sales of building materials for
repair, maintenance and do-it-yourself work. In the past these have risen in
line with a general improvement in house sales.
Half-year figures this week from construction and building material
companies confirmed this broad picture. It was emphasised by house price
statistics from the Halifax and Nationwide building societies which showed
that prices are still struggling to rise.
Persimmon, the country's eighth largest house-builder, reported on Wednesday
a 34 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 11.3m. Sales of new homes,
which had dipped in June and July, bounced back in August, according to
chairman Duncan Davidson; indeed, they were a quarter higher than during the
same month last year.
Some of the increase will have come from the company selling more
development sites as it pursues its ambition of raising output from 2,771
homes last year to 4,000 a year by the mid-1990s. But other builders have
also reported higher August sales.
Normally this would bode well for September and October, traditionally good
months for house sales. These months have been blighted in the past two
years, though - first, when Britain left the European exchange rate
mechanism in September 1992; and then in autumn last year as potential
buyers stayed out of the market during the run-up to the November Budget,
the first at that time of year.
Many builders are concerned that sales could again be affected this
September and October by fears of interest rate rises, although Davidson
believes the recovery is now solid enough to withstand a small increase.
Persimmon, meanwhile, increased the net profit it made on each sale in the
first half to Pounds 7,818 from Pounds 4,825 in the first six months of last
year. This compared with a peak profit per house of Pounds 18,000 in
1988-89. The company aims to get this back to Pounds 10,000 a unit in the
next 18 months.
Rugby, which this week announced a 17 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax
profits to Pounds 35.6m, said UK cement sales overall had risen by 8 per
cent. But purchases of bagged cement, sold for mainly small works, had
fallen slightly.
More worryingly, the company warned of price competition in the UK joinery
market which, unlike other building material sectors, did not reduce
capacity during the recession.
For equity investors, the conclusions may be that house-builders and their
material suppliers, particularly those which have cut capacity and are able
to contain prices and margins, are performing best.
The recovery, however, is slow and modest and most of the virtues have been
reflected already in these companies' share prices - in spite of this week's
flurry of price increases for builders prompted by the August sales boost.

The two largest building societies, Halifax and Nationwide, once again
disagreed on the direction of house prices for August. Nationwide found that
prices rose by 0.6 per cent while Halifax, which has a larger sample and
publishes seasonally-adjusted figures, found they fell 0.7 per cent. It was
the first fall since May, according to the society.
Nationwide said the recovery in market activity, which appeared to be
strengthening early in the year, was 'marginal,' although underlying
transaction levels appeared to have stabilised. Halifax said underlying
house prices were flat, a trend which would not change until consumer
confidence improves.

 -At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
All sections of the London market have performed strongly over the past
quarter, but the FT-SE 100 index, which includes the largest companies, is
trailing its smaller rivals.
When the US Federal Reserve raised its key interest rates in February the
first UK equity sector to fall was the FT-SE 100 as institutions, whose
principal equity holdings are in the main index, sold heavily.
The gap between the Footsie and the smaller indices widened while the gap
between the second and third-line indices (the mid 250 and the small cap)
only grew towards the end of the sell-off. In the past quarter all sectors
have recovered sharply.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Markets: The arbs return, with defence in their sights -
Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is one type of inflation that Wall Street knows and loves. It works
like this. You seek out a company in an industry that has been the subject
of some big takeovers recently - a list currently dominated by defence,
healthcare and entertainment. Then you pump up its share price for all you
are worth: spreading rumours to the effect that the company in question is
up for sale is usually a particularly effective way of doing it.
The rumour and a jump in the share price is often enough to put a company
'in play,' flushing out potential buyers. The trick is then to sit tight and
wait for the company to get taken over at a premium - or to sell out before
the rumours prove untrue and stock deflation sets in again.
The 'arbs' (an abbreviation of arbitrageurs) who specialise in trading
takeover stocks are out in force again. Not since the end of the 1980s has
short-term speculative stock trading reached such levels. And there is
plenty of activity to keep these traders busy.
This week there was an agreement to merge two of the US's biggest defence
contractors, Lockheed and Martin Marietta, and a planned Dollars 2.9bn
purchase by Anglo-US drugs group SmithKline Beecham of Kodak's
over-the-counter drugs operations.
These are hectic times in the takeover business. Other proposed deals that
surfaced last week, such as a Dollars 1.3bn takeover by General Signal of
Reliance Electric, a Dollars 600m purchase of Zenith, a maker of generic
(non-branded) drugs, by Ivax and an improved, Dollars 950m bid by buy-out
firm Forstmann Little for the money-transfer business Western Union, hardly
made the front pages.
It is clear where the arbs are looking to turn their next quick dollar. Top
of the list is CBS, one of the big three television networks. CBS became a
plaything of the stock traders two months ago, when it first announced a
plan (later dropped) to merge with Barry Diller's home shopping network,
QVC. Renewed takeover rumours last week, this time of an interest by Disney
(and a possible takeover of another network, NBC) pushed CBS's shares higher
still, to Dollars 333 1/2 by midday yesterday, nearly a third up on its
level before the QVC announcement.
In the healthcare sector, which has seen Dollars 30bn-worth of deals in the
past 12 months, two stocks stood out on the arbs' list, Warner-Lambert, a
company with a strong over-the-counter drugs business to match its
prescription pharmaceuticals side, gained further attention after the
SmithKline deal. Its shares were trading at Dollars 82 1/2 yesterday, having
started the month of August at around Dollars 65. Marion Merrell Dow, a
drugs company majority-owned by Dow Chemical, released a wave of speculation
with the announcement that it had asked an investment bank to consider how
it should respond to changes in the US healthcare industry. Its share rose
to Dollars 24 1/2 at one point during the week, up from less than Dollars 20
at the start of August.
The defence industry, meanwhile, had its own flurry on news of the Lockheed
/ Martin Marietta deal. Other contractors will need to merge in the face of
a shrinking US defence budget, ran the argument.
Though some of this speculation will no doubt be rewarded, much will end in
tears. As Nextel, a wireless communications company, proved last week, even
agreed deals sometimes do not come off: its shares plunged 26 per cent from
their level a week before, to Dollars 22 1/2 , as talks with MCI and
Motorola were called off. Punting on takeover stocks remains a game for the
risk-hungry and the wealthy.
While busy inflating takeover stocks, Wall Street also kept a wary eye last
week on the other type of inflation. The Federal Reserve's move to raise
interest rates on August 16 was meant to be the final twist to the the rate
spiral for several months, dampening the risk of inflation and putting a new
bounce in the stock market. That, at least, was how the market saw it then:
but the yield on long-dated bonds, the clearest sign of inflation fears, has
edged back up, rising further yesterday to brush up against 7.5 per cent.
The difference between short and long-term rates has also edged higher,
another sign of inflation fears.
Employment data for August, released yesterday, failed to ease the concerns
of the skeptics. The number of jobs created during the month was less than
expected: that is good news for markets, since it means wage pressure is
less than it might be. However, the average work week edged up, suggesting
more hiring and a growing shortage of skilled labour in future. The stock
market at first took heart at the figures, then reversed course. Yet at
3,896 at midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remained around 15 points
ahead on the week.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Markets: Tiny, constant point in an uncertain time - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an uncertain world, there is something almost reassuring about the
ability of Tiny Rowland to hang on to his position as chief executive of
Lonrho.
An attempt by fellow joint chief executive Dieter Bock to strip the
76-year-old Rowland of his executive duties at the mining and trading group
foundered when non-executive directors refused to back the German pretender.
The Pounds 5.5m a year package which Rowland costs Lonrho - including the
Pounds 2m spent on running the group's Gulfstream private jet - will be
scrutinised by the remuneration committee set up by Bock, but Tiny lives to
fight another day.
The FT-SE 100 did not prove quite so resilient as the redoubtable Rowland,
but still managed to hang on to some of the gains made in the previous
week's surge through the 3,200 barrier. Profit-taking and renewed concern
about interest rates helped the index shed 34.8 points on Thursday, but the
market steadied yesterday to close the week at 3,222.7, down 42.4 on the
week.
In spite of some twitchiness about the timing of the next increase in
interest rates, the City continues to be pleased by the strength of the
recovery in corporate performance. The chart shows that, of the changes made
by analysts to their profit forecasts for individual companies, the
proportion which are upgrades rather than downgrades remains comfortably
above 50 per cent.
The market's performance is all the more impressive, given that the start of
the heavy reporting season of interim results included some disappointments.
Rolls-Royce, the aero engine and industrial power group, increased profits
by 29 per cent, thanks mainly to the effects of cost-cutting and
restructuring. But the group said it did not expect to see any improvement
in its markets until 1996.
Shares in Reckitt &amp; Colman, the household products and toiletries group,
fell after the company warned that tough competitive and economic conditions
persisted and were unlikely to improve in the second half.
However, this gloom did not extend across the whole market and second-line
stocks proved more buoyant. On Tuesday, when profit-takers knocked more than
15 points off the FT-SE 100, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index - which includes both
the top 100 companies and the next 150 by market capitalisation - actually
gained nearly 7 points.
Share prices of housebuilders rose sharply after companies reported that new
house sales had recovered last month after a poor June and July. Persimmon,
the UK's eighth-biggest housebuilder, said it had sold 250 homes in August,
25 per cent more than August last year.
Market sentiment was also bolstered by news of two large takeover deals,
which have important implications on both sides of the Atlantic.
The proposed Pounds 1.88bn purchase by SmithKline Beecham of Sterling Health
from Eastman Kodak of the US will create the world's biggest consumer drugs
business. Pharmaceutical stocks rose as the market pondered the wave of
mergers and takeovers which have been transforming the healthcare market.
The industry is consolidating in response to pressure from customers -
employers who pay health insurance premiums in the US and governments
elsewhere - to cut healthcare costs.
The deal doubles the size of SmithKline Beecham's over-the-counter
operations and makes it the world's biggest maker of OTC medicines,
outselling Johnson &amp; Johnson of the US. The combined group would have OTC
sales of about Dollars 2bn.( Pounds 1.2bn)
The pharmaceuticals companies are also keen to sell formerly
prescription-only medicines over the counter because it allows them to
extend the product-life of their drugs. This has become increasingly
important for the drugs groups because patents on half of the 50 top-selling
US medicines will expire in the next four years.
Defence is another global industry which must consolidate in the face of
rapidly falling spending by governments. The process took a huge step
forward when Lockheed and Martin Marietta, two of the top three US defence
contractors, unveiled plans for a Pounds 6.4bn merger.
European defence companies are acutely aware of the need for consolidation,
but the process faces much greater political barriers. However, Vickers this
week emphasised that it was on the look-out for international partnerships.
Having recently won a follow-on order from the UK government for 259
Challenger 2 tanks, the group said its Pounds 1.5bn defence order book made
it a much stronger and more attractive partner when considering
collaborative projects.
The logic of international consolidation can extend to the most unlikely of
industries. Service Corporation International, North America's largest
funeral group, last month successfully bid Pounds 113m for Great Southern
Group, the UK funerals company. It waited until the market had closed
yesterday to reveal that it has now won control of Plantsbrook, another
UK-quoted funeral company, with a recommended offer worth Pounds 193m.
The Texas-based SCI gained control of Plantsbrook by purchasing the 46.3 per
cent stake in the UK company owned by Pompes Funebres, France's largest
funeral business. SCI said it was anxious to avoid Plantsbrook falling into
the hands of Loewen, the Canadian funeral group which had been interested in
acquiring Great Southern.
Given that SCI has now acquired the only two quoted UK funeral companies,
scope for further consolidation is clearly limited. Yet the hope that trends
in the healthcare and defence industries will lead to further big takeovers
will continue to help market sentiment as traders await the inevitable
increase in interest rates.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Markets: Keep your eye on the managers, too - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hundreds of private shareholders will have cheered as Tiny Rowland once
again showed his Houdini-like capacity for survival. Dieter Bock, his fellow
chief executive at Lonrho, had planned to strip Rowland of his executive
powers in the wake of revelations that he costs Lonrho more than Pounds 5.5m
a year. But Rowland shrugged off the attack, as he has shrugged off so many
in his 33 years at Lonrho's helm.
It is more than 20 years since the early chapters in the Lonrho saga spawned
the epithet 'the unacceptable face of capitalism'. The shares have never
been a favourite with professional fund managers since, but many private
investors have stuck with their maverick hero through thick and thin. Sadly,
their loyalty has not been rewarded. Apart from a couple of brief flickers
in the mid-1970s and late-1980s, Lonrho shares have been a remarkably poor
investment.
Is Lonrho a typical example of what happens when investors back an
entrepreneurial company run by a single dominant figure?
Many serious investors prefer to invest in companies which are run by their
founders, or by managers who act like owners. Warren Buffett, an
outstandingly successful American investor, often takes long-term minority
stakes in sound, family-run businesses and likes all managers to have a
significant share stake in the companies they manage. His typically homely
analogy is with a restaurant where the proprietors can honestly say 'We eat
our own cooking'. And his favourite investment is in the local furniture
store run by its founder, Mrs Rose Blumkin.
But it is just as simplistic to conclude that owner-run businesses make
better investments than those run by professional managers as the reverse.
There are good and bad companies in both categories. What really matters to
the outside investor is not the status of the company or its managers/owners
but their attitude.
Take a few other examples. Fallen favourite Amstrad had a brilliant start.
It gave its high street customers what they wanted at unbeatable prices: its
computers worked and were cheap, smart and easy to use.
But the real problem was that Amstrad boss Alan Sugar showed very little
interest in the well-being of his outside shareholders. He sold a large part
of his own holding before the share price collapsed - and offered to buy out
the outside shareholders when the price was on the floor.
Now take Hanson, one of the few founder-run companies which has stayed the
course. Its shares consistently beat the index until the mid-1980s. Since
then, though, it has moved broadly in line with the market and it has been a
relatively unexciting investment for the past decade. The founders have
treated outside shareholders well, but the company has lost the fizz of
youth.
Our last company is Marks and Spencer. Over the past 20 years, M&amp;S shares
have done slightly better than the stock market. It is a fascinating example
of a company run by professional managers who behave as if they were owners,
in the best sense.
The message for investors is that weighing up their managers can be as
important as crunching the balance sheet numbers.
* * *
Maverick directors and cowboy companies can appear on any market. But they
tend to cluster thickest on fringe markets - the Over the Counter Market,
the Unlisted Securities Market (in its early days) and the Third Market: all
had their clutch of black sheep.
This does not mean that all private investors should avoid the new
Alternative Investment Market (AIM) planned to replace the USM. It does mean
that they should approach it with extreme caution and keep a padlock on
their wallet until they can see the whites of the managers' eyes.
The new stock exchange boss, Michael Lawrence, pointed out months ago that
'while companies want cheaper access to equity capital, investors want a
similar level of protection to that now provided. These are incompatible
requirements'. AIM gives the companies cheap access to equity capital with
the minimum of red tape. And, already, some bystanders are warning that it
could be more dangerous than the OTC.
But the intelligent investor who understands the risks might enjoy spicing
up his portfolio with a few carefully researched AIM shares. It appears
probable that they will have tax advantages. And fund managers are already
launching funds concentrating on AIM shares. Just keep your eyes wide open.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Sunset on a boulevard of inflated egos: The agents control
Hollywood and, while the stars have grown bigger, the pictures have got
small
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Motion pictures are 100 years old next year but they are not ageing well.
This summer's releases - The Flintstones, Maverick, Beverly Hills Cop 3,
Robocop 3 - suggest that Hollywood, for 80 years the undisputed headquarters
of the movies, is sinking ever deeper into a second childhood.
In 1913, Cecil B DeMille chose a one-horse suburb of Los Angeles for his
western The Squaw Man. Since then, Hollywood has grown to reflect the dreams
and aspirations of America, and to shape the popular culture of the west.
But what is becoming of it now? Judging by this year's alarming and widely
castigated movies, it is turning into a sort of box-office Babel. Hollywood
on the brink of the new millennium is a place where movies are overpriced
and overhyped, competing only for financial return rather than critical
acclaim or even word-of-mouth commendation.
Of course the Hollywood culture has always been tied to box office success.
But in the past the integrated studios, with their own stars, producers and
writers were at least striving to make great movies. The decline of the
studios, under the assault of middlemen acting for big name producers and
stars is throwing up quite different products, such as The Flintstones and
Maverick (both out of 1950s TV), True Lies (out of James Bond via Last
Action Hero) and sequels of sequels such as Robocop 3 and Beverly Hills Cop
3. Such movies use mass publicity to project tired and derivative ideas as
ephemeral 'hits'.
The fees (including shares of profit) paid to stars and producers have
become so huge that studios can no longer afford the great and original
screenwriters, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, who once worked for them. So
they do not generate the stream of well-crafted stories on which to base
their productions.
Many commentators, including me, believe that the western film industry is
dying by inches and that we know who is responsible. Hollywood today is a
kingdom under enemy rule. We mean it is ruled by the agents and publicists
who have staged a spectacular coup against the reign of the studios.
The rise of the agents began in 1945 when the talent impresario Jules Stein,
president of Music Corporation of America, bought the client list of the
famous agent, Leland Hayward. It was an extraordinary inventory of talent,
including Astaire, Garbo, Gene Kelly, James Stewart and Katharine Hepburn.
Stein began at once to create from this list a new instrument which would
gradually break the contractual hold of the studios over the stars.
By 1948, MCA was putting pressure on the head of Warner Bros to release
Bette Davis from a contract that still had several years to run. And one
year later Stein secured an historic, unheard-of profits-share deal for
another studio escapee, James Stewart, for the Western, Winchester 73.
The studios, which for a generation had thrived by controlling costs and
nurturing their own talent under tight contracts, began to crumble in the
face of this onslaught. And when MCA itself broke up in 1962 - disbanded by
Stein as the Justice Department began growling about its stranglehold on the
industry - the stage was set for the three replacement companies we know
today. CAA (Creative Artists Agency), ICM (International Creative
Management) and a new William Morris Agency took over the talent-handling
business and, many people believe, now run the entire film industry. And in
recent years they have enabled stars with inflated fees to shape the
industry's output.
This is good for the talent, or at least for their bank balances. But bad
for audiences.
To understand why, let us see how this new-look industry operates. Broadly:
for every Jack Nicholson or Julia Roberts or Francis Coppola, there is a Joe
Blow or Jane Blow, an agent or publicist, to act as bellows-minder to the
myth. Their job is to tell the outside world that 'Mr Nicholson's price for
his next movie is Dollars 12m plus 2 per cent of the gross' or 'Mr Coppola
will do The Tonight Show but not Oprah Winfrey' or (if you are a journalist)
'Miss Roberts has never heard of you, go away.'
As the studios declined, these doorkeepers to the stars became stars
themselves. In the old-style studio, most employees had some hands-on
relationship with the stuff coming off the line: the movies. Veteran VIPs
will describe the interconnectedness of every studio activity. Publicity,
marketing, negotiating for roles, even schooling - for infant stars such as
Elizabeth Taylor or Margaret O'Brien - took place inside those walls. And
however despotic the seven-year contract may have seemed, it allowed the
studios to plan a stream of well thought out movies tailored to the
available talent.
Today, as the veteran, Billy Wilder says, the studios are 'like the Ramada
Inn. You check in, you check out.' The people running studios now change
rapidly, whereas the agencies have an awesome consistency of top personnel -
and of personality too, handed down from men such as the CAA boss, Michael
Ovitz, obsessed with Oriental disciplines and near-religious team spirit.
The studios are like British soccer clubs. They reel from one whizz-kid
manager to the next. And when a new whizz kid comes in, where does he turn
for ready-made ideas and projects to jump-start his production schedule?
Why, to the agents. And what is the agent's main interest? To get more money
for his client.
Hand in hand with these agents, and symbiotic with them in the modern
Hollywood are the more recently arrived publicists. Agents (mostly men) find
a project for one of their stars and try to package him or her with other
clients for the same film. (The most famous - or infamous - example was
Legal Eagles, concocted by an agency as a vehicle for Robert Redford, Debra
Winger and director Ivan Ghostbusters Reitman. It bombed at the box office,
costing Paramount Dollars 35m and earning a small fortune in commissions for
CAA.) Publicists (mostly women) ensure that their star, director or prodigy
gets on the right chat shows and magazine covers.
This double act performs the old one-two that used to be achieved seamlessly
by the studios. Get the celebrity in the movie project; then get the
celebrity in the public eye.
The doyenne of present-day publicists, Pat Kingsley of PMK, went into
history as the first to ask a magazine editor: 'Why do you always get to
choose the cover?'
While the publicists wheedle or coquette or menace, the agents flex ever
more alarming muscle. Sometimes they just sit around forcing up clients'
fees, until studios, like opera-houses, must risk near-bankruptcy in order
to get the crowd-pleasing talent.
Sometimes agents put the fear of God into clients who might desert to
another firm. And sometimes they graduate to brokering super-colossal deals
as Ovitz himself did in the case of the Sony-Columbia and
Universal-Matsushita mergers.
But Hollywood's new rulers could not have assumed such power without help
from the pre-existing power of the artist-megastar. If the break-up of the
studios created the opening for these 'personal' minders and advisers, it
also made Hollywood a place where artists' egos now float like dirigibles
far above the old studios, while the strings are held by the career
adjutants down on the ground.
These adjutants cannot, many critics suspect, sniff the air as the best
bygone studio bosses did, nor see the further horizons of cinema and popular
culture. They feel only the immediate crunch of career opportunity.
Jeff Berg, head of ICM, has heard the bad press before and answers it for me
in his penthouse office on Beverly Boulevard. No, he claims: he and his
fellow agents are not taking over: 'We have no interest in assuming the role
of the studios. We are not distributors or financiers or producers.'
Yet do they not have great power over what is produced? An agent might tell
a studio, for example, Look, you can have Macaulay Culkin for Home Alone
VIII; but only if you take two of our other stars plus one of our directors
and a screenwriter for the same project. Berg says only that: 'We are a
mechanising process between the gatekeepers of the studios and the world at
large.'
At this point the telephone rings and Berg picks it up. 'Hi, Terry.' It is
Terry Semel, not so much a gatekeeper at Warner, more President of Motion
Pictures. Inspired by this example of spontaneous synergy I walk round to
Warner to catch Semel or his fellow supremo at the studio, Robert Daly.
Daly is sitting in a large room with a fish tank and a small army of
minders. He has an empire to run; and if studios are crumbling, then
top-of-the-box-office Warner will be the last one to go. Are agents more
powerful today? 'Yes, of course. When Bette Davis was under a contract with
us, her agent would come in and scream and kick and Jack Warner would say,
Goodbye]'
Daly chooses an unfortunate example. After 1949 it was Bette Davis who said
the goodbyes.
But I take the point - and also Daly's observation on modern times. 'Today,
if you want Julia Roberts for a new movie you have to woo her agent.' And do
deals. 'They can demand a lot of rights. Most of the time they are asking
for more money.'
And that money, 90 per cent of which floats up from the agent to the artist,
is part of the fine madness guiding modern movie practice. Dollars
12-Dollars 15m per picture plus profit-points is now the going rate for a
top male star - a Tom Cruise, Mel Gibson, Bruce Willis or Arnold
Schwarzenegger - with top women such as Roberts trailing gamely at Dollars
8m.
So the star, having broken free from the old-style studio's ceiling wages
and being further flattered by the ministrations of his publicity people,
suddenly commands both the ego and the capital to initiate his projects.
However much the star's advisers may demure, dreadful films such as Hudson
Hawk and Ishtar and Last Action Hero get made. And although the ego may land
with a thud, the agents get their upfront 'packaging' commissions and 10-per
cents. And the star - such is the militarised power of modern Hollywood hype
 -is up and flying again before you can cry 'Variety charts]'
The great virtue of the old studios was that egos were kept in check. People
knuckled under to the next film on the contract. And when they bowed to the
studio's routine publicity demands, it was to a genial daftness quite unlike
the terrorism of today's PR work. As Deborah Kerr once remembered for me:
'They would wheel us out for an hour or so to pose for magazine covers -
green background for this magazine, pink for that one - or to chatter about
how we kept our cold cream in the ice-box. Then back to the movie.'
Today it is not this benign exposure that counts in PR work, but the cult of
near-mystical elusiveness. The modern publicist's job is to preserve the
idea of the star, or star director, as above us all: and to gloss over minor
fallings from the sky. (Flop movies often mysteriously vanish from later
publicity-packs about a film personality.) Hollywood press agents have
become known as 'sup-press' agents for their ability to preserve this myth
of unattainability.
So big Hollywood movies, powered by their stars' artificially-generated
rarity value, are made to seem like visits from an extraterrestrial. It
hardly matters whether the films themselves are good or bad: that rarity
value invariably makes them an 'event'. And when the star deigns to fly to
Earth once a year to open his new film, the PR people surround him and the
picture with an entire ecology of support iconography. Batman T-shirts for
Tim Burton / Nicholson's offering; Flintstone toys for Spielberg's latest; a
whole playroom arsenal for Arnie's new actioner . . .
Edward Pressman, the independent producer who has rolled out high-visibility
films as diverse as Conan The Barbarian, JFK and Reversal Of Fortune, thinks
the age of the ego, encouraged by agents and publicists, has its
compensations. 'There is a level of talent and idiosyncrasy that didn't
exist in the old Hollywood,' he tells me. 'You could say the quality of
mainstream movies that the studio factories made, was more consistent. But
it's compensated for today by a lot of films that would never have been made
then: experimental films, ones that break the mould.'
Point taken: but it applies more to the low-cost end of the market than the
high. (Even Schindler's List was a shoestring operation by Spielberg
standards.) What we have at the high end is star egomania eternally
demanding more money, via the agent, and more image-enhancement, via the
publicist.
In a word, hype. The same hype that causes millions of gullible film fans to
flock to movies like this summer's: movies so freighted with star names or
so pre-publicised as Happenings that no one realises - until they have paid
Dollars 100m to push The Flintstones or Maverick or True Lies into profit -
that the films are as imitative, overblown and perishable as carnival
floats.
What do the agents care? They take the money (up-front) and run. What do the
publicists care? The triumph of their art is written in the ledger books.
And what does the 'talent' care? It thinks it is God anyway. Everything
tells it so, from the people it employs, to the film-goers hyped into
overpaying for its films.
If it is a mad world, it is one with its own dismaying logic. When MGM mogul
Louis B Mayer saw trouble coming back in those star-enfranchising 1940s -
'The lunatics are taking over the asylum' - little could he have guessed at
the perfect mutual support which would evolve decades later, between those
lunatics and their Lotusland lackeys.

FT  03 SEP 94 / The Long View: The profits of boom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most British investors grew effortlessly richer during their holidays.
Events in August confirmed the broadening strength of the international
economy, with the US and the UK growing at 3 1/2 to 4 per cent and even
troubled Germany staging a convincing rebound. Stock markets have gained in
confidence.
Clearly, though, short-term interest rates are on the turn. During August,
key rates rose in the US, Italy and Sweden while French commercial lending
rates edged up this week, too. The British authorities may yet come to
regret their failure to raise UK rates at the beginning of last month.
At this stage of the cycle, stock markets are, classically, subjected to a
particular kind of two-way pull. Strong growth in profits and dividends is
dragging them up, while rising interest rates are pulling them down. This
particular cycle has been distorted by last winter's bond market crash, but
I pointed out two months ago that UK share prices had drifted back into a
buying range. It is not yet clear whether the main UK indices will get back
to their January/February highs, as Wall Street very nearly has; but the
next market peak will be determined by the point at which bullishness over
corporate prospects begins to be overwhelmed by concern over rising
short-term interest rates.
Daily headlines tell us of the surge in corporate confidence on both sides
of the Atlantic. Big deals are back in fashion, and mega-mergers are seen
once again as a triumph of vision in the executive suite rather than a
symptom of dangerous empire-building.
This week's purchase of Sterling Health by SmithKline Beecham for Dollars
2.9bn was presented as a triumphant strategic move by SB. Perhaps it should
rather be seen as a welcome move by Kodak, the seller, to extricate itself
from the disastrous consequences of its own ill-judged expansion in the
1980s. We can simply note that macho corporate buyers are, once again,
beginning to out-bid the stock market when it comes to putting a price on
companies.
Certainly, there is nothing like a healthy stream of profits to add a gleam
to a chief executive's eye. In the UK, earnings per share - on the basis of
the constituents of the All-Share index - have risen by 22 per cent over the
past year, and dividends by 7 1/2 per cent. Investors appear to expect that
growth rates will be nearly as good over the next year, too (perhaps still
faster, for dividends).
Curiously, big companies have outperformed the rest. The top 100, the
Footsie index constituents, have raised earnings per share by 27 per cent in
12 months, and dividends by 9.7 per cent. Small companies, which were
supposed to have greater recovery potential after the recession, have
increased their earnings by only 13 per cent over the same period (I have
calculated this from the SmallCap index, excluding investment trusts). Their
dividends have not yet gone up at all, on balance.
Perhaps the big companies have benefited more from restructuring, and
perhaps the recovery is taking longer to percolate down to the smaller
company sector. It had better do so soon: the tiddlers are valued more
highly by investors because of their assumed higher growth.
These 20 per cent growth rates in company earnings contrast strongly with
the muted and stable 3 3/4 per cent growth in personal incomes. There has
been a marked shift in the balance of power between capital and labour. The
important question now is whether this is just a temporary cyclical effect.
Already, company trading profits have moved above 15 per cent of national
income (against only 12 per cent in 1992) and, on present trends, the
proportion will reach an exceptional 17 per cent in 1995 (against previous
peaks of just under 16 per cent in 1960 and 1985).
History tells us, however, that profit booms tend to finish in inflationary
surges as companies bid up the prices of labour, property and raw materials.
This week's purchasing managers' survey showed, sure enough, that
manufacturers' costs are rising - but this has yet to show in a significant
acceleration of output prices.
Judged by past cycles, pay rates will now begin to rise sharply. But
unemployment still remains relatively high, at 9.3 per cent of the labour
force. It is worth thinking about the theory of long cycles; according to
this, at the start of a new long-term upturn (in a cycle which may run for
50 or 60 years), big new industrial growth sectors can generate high rates
of return on capital for extended periods.
Western countries have been through a phase of widespread recession and
industrial rationalisation. Now, though, new industrial processes based on
information technology are bringing about radical improvements in
productivity. The result could be a protracted corporate boom at the same
time as the labour markets remain relatively subdued (except for certain
categories of skilled workers). It sounds like a capitalist's improbable
Shangri-La - but, certainly, the present upturn is strikingly less
inflationary so far than any seen in the UK in the past 25 years.
Whatever the mysterious message of the long cycle, however, attention now
switches to short-term interest rates. After the Bundesbank council meeting
on Thursday, and the evidence of a quite vigorous German economic recovery,
led by exports, the question is whether we have now reached the bottom, even
for D-Mark rates. With the recession clearly over, the Buba must now focus
on getting the German money supply back under control.
As for the UK, there is a let's-get-it-over-with mood as the market looks
for 5 3/4 per cent sterling rates soon, with the implied hope that the move
might release tensions as effectively as the jump to 4 3/4 per cent in the
US last month. But then, London has had the unearned benefit of that
already. And we can't go on holiday again.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Investment doubts raised over plan for small companies
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY, GILLIAN O'CONNOR and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Stock Exchange proposals to help small companies raise capital were
given a cautious welcome yesterday but there were strong doubts that the
proposed new market would interest institutional investors.
A leaked draft of a consultative document due to be published next week
suggests the stock exchange is planning to set up a lightly regulated
Alternative Investment Market.
The exchange hopes the new market will provide existing small companies with
a market for their shares and new companies with a way of raising capital
that is far less costly than a flotation on the Official List.
Mrs Katie Morris, chief executive of CISCO, the City Group for Smaller
Companies, welcomed the exchange's move. 'We are delighted to see that after
two years and hard lobbying we are seeing some action,' she said.
But some venture capitalists who are keen for an alternative to the Unlisted
Securities Market (USM), particularly for rapidly growing hi-tech companies,
were more cautious.
'I wonder if institutions will be willing to get involved in a market that
is not policed as well against fraud as the main market or the USM,' said Mr
Ronald Cohen, chairman of venture capital group Apax Partners.
Some investors believe that young growing companies in the UK are failing to
raise venture capital because there is no exit route to a regulated but
easily accessible market such as NASDAQ in the US. The proposed market would
be a modified version of the exchange's occasional trading facility - the
rule 4.2 market - which already allows the trading of shares in a very
lightly regulated market.
The stock exchange says European Union rules are forcing more regulation on
this market. Next week's proposal will form part of the stock exchange's
seven point programme announced in April to help smaller companies.
Mr David Macnamara, a director of Winterflood Securities, market makers in
smaller company shares, commented: 'We are very interested in any new
smaller company market, provided it is regulated properly.'
Some investment firms have already launched funds which are intended to
concentrate on companies traded on the 4.2 market and its successors.

FT  03 SEP 94 / US burial group expands in UK: SCI to become Britain's
biggest funeral company with Pounds 193m takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Service Corporation International, the biggest funeral company in the US,
achieved the same status in Britain yesterday through a recommended Pounds
193m offer for listed funeral group Plantsbrook.
The announcement follows SCI's hostile but ultimately successful battle for
Plantsbrook's only listed competitor, Great Southern Group, and will give
the Houston-based company 15 per cent of Britain's funeral market.
Plantsbrook buries almost one in 10 Britons, and made a profit of Pounds 12m
last year. Its geographical strength is in northern England, whilst Great
Southern is strongly focused on the south, making it a logical fit. Mr Bill
Heiligbrodt, SCI's president, said the company intended 'to continue our
policy of vigorous growth within the UK'.
The bid for Plantsbrook was not unexpected. SCI had already purchased 8.4
per cent of Plantsbrook, and was known to be in discussions with the
company's largest shareholder, Pompes Funebres Generales (PFG), the French
funeral group which holds a 46.3 per cent stake.
SCI is paying 175p a share for PFG's stake, and the board of Plantsbrook has
recommended the offer to shareholders.
The offer represents a 10p premium to Plantsbrook's closing price on
Thursday, but a 113 per cent premium to the 82p a share price before SCI's
offer for Great Southern, on June 9. SCI has made no secret of its ambition
to spread beyond the UK, and it is understood that it has also discussed the
possible purchase of other PFG funeral businesses. 'We do want to be active
on the continent,' said Mr Heiligbrodt. PFG controls about a third of the
French burial market, and funeral businesses from Africa to Singapore.
SCI, which has a market capitalisation of Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.4bn), has
been the most acquisitive of the US funeral groups. It is set to invest
Dollars 250m this year in North America alone, with a further Pounds 306m on
its two UK purchases.
It also operates Australia's largest funeral business, and has a substantial
presence in Canada.
The UK funeral industry has consolidated rapidly, following a spate of
takeovers during the mid-1980s. About 25 per cent of the UK market is
accounted for by various branches of the Co-operative Movement, but SCI will
be the largest individual burial group, performing more than 80,000 burials
this year.
SCI's bid for Plantsbrook is unlikely to be referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, given the combined market share for funerals of 15 per
cent.
Any concerns would focus on pre-paid funerals, where Great Southern has a 65
per cent market share, and Plantsbrook a 15 per cent share. However, it is a
small market, with few barriers to entry. The offer for Plantsbrook is
contingent upon there being no MMC referral.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Balladur pledge on Renault sell-off as profits rise 125%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Renault, the French car group, yesterday reported a 125 per cent rise in
first half profits to FFr1.7bn (Pounds 200m). Though the increase was
largely due to financial gains, it was well-timed to encourage the
government to sell part of the state's stake in the group.
At the same time, prime minister Edouard Balladur confirmed in a press
interview that the state would retain a majority stake in the vehicle group
after any privatisation.
Indicating his desire to bring back under French control some or all of the
20 per cent stake held in Renault by Volvo of Sweden, he said: 'We will
proceed progressively to make Renault French again, with the state retaining
the majority.' The Renault group's turnover in the first half of this year
was virtually unchanged at FFr89.9bn on the same period last year.
This masked a 9 per cent increase in car sales in Europe, outstripping the
general market rise of 6.8 per cent in registrations. Renault also enjoyed
an 11.4 per cent increase in the turnover of its trucks in Europe and by its
north American subsidiary.
However, many of the cars sold in France and Spain were small ones, helped
by special government incentives. These brought relatively little profit. In
addition, the first half saw a 40 per cent collapse in sales in Turkey,
which last year was Renault's third largest market worldwide. Renault
dealers also reduced their stocks to an historic low by the end of June.
Operating profit, therefore, amounted to FFr668m, compared with FFr774m in
the first half of 1993. But net financial income rose to FFr640m in the
first half as against only FFr160m a year earlier, chiefly from a FFr302m
profit made on the partial sale of a Renault operation in Argentina and from
a FFr488m profit made on last February's sale of some of Renault's shares in
AB Volvo, the French car company's erstwhile partner.
The Balladur government is due by mid-September to decide whether to put
Renault or the Assurances Generales de France insurance group up for sale
first.
The government has already approved a specific privatisation decree for AGF,
but has yet to do this for Renault. This week AGF announced an inopportune
drop in first half net profits.

The interim results season, which started in fine form last month, went off
the boil a little this week. The City had become accustomed to all surprises
being pleasant and was unsettled by some disappointing figures from leading
companies. Apart from Vickers and Rolls-Royce, which are somewhat special
cases, the disappointments tended to come from companies close to the
consumer. Ladbroke saw profits collapse at its Texas DIY chain, though the
betting side held up, and while several housebuilders reported an upturn in
sales in August, the week brought evidence from building products companies
that housing related markets remain extremely difficult.
The pattern fits the wider economic picture, with exports and investments
leading the recovery while consumer spending remains sluggish. The fact that
Reckitt &amp; Colman's continental household products business did worse than
expected while Williams Holdings' more broadly-based manufacturing companies
did better suggests the rest of Europe may follow the same path.
The equity market reacted quite calmly to the disappointments, with shares
holding on to much of the gain made last week. But further setbacks for
consumer stocks could widen their discount against general manufacturers.
With input costs rising - and no sign of the retail inflation which would
allow this to be passed on - analysts' forecasts for next year are starting
to look ambitious.

FT  03 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Schroders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The most striking figure in Schroders' maiden set of interim results was not
the growth in group profits or even the nearly doubled contribution from
fund management; it was the 21 per cent rise in shareholders' funds to
Pounds 740m over the past year. Given the group's high quality of earnings
and high level of retention, the trend is likely to continue. The return on
capital remains healthy and the company increased the dividend by another 50
per cent. But that rise is partly intended to reduce the disparity between
the interim and final dividends. Even if the final dividend was also
increased by 50 per cent, the total would still be covered five times by
earnings. While the acquisition of the remaining shares in Wertheim was a
sensible use of capital, it leaves the group with fire power to direct
elsewhere. Its eagerness to gain full control of Wertheim's securities
business raises the question of whether that capital might be used to build
up a domestic distribution arm in London.
If Schroders' decision not to operate as an integrated house in London has
been vindicated so far, there are tentative signs that the world is
changing. Kleinwort Benson certainly believes its advisory business is
benefiting from its strength in distribution and analysis, and it is perhaps
significant that its fee and commission income grew almost twice as fast as
Schroders' in the first half. Schroders still believes it has no need to be
integrated in the UK and that most of its clients prefer using independent
advisers and brokers. Of course, if Cazenove were ever to come on the market
it might be a different matter.

FT  03 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Renault
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospects for Renault's privatisation are not as bright as they were
even a week ago. Not only were yesterday's half-year results disappointing.
Comments by Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, that the state
will retain a majority stake in the motor group will also take the shine off
the sale.
Renault was able to boast a 125 per cent rise in pre-tax profits. But this
was flattered by a large capital gain on the sale of part of its stake in
erstwhile partner Volvo. Operating profit actually fell 11 per cent. And
revenue in the car division was flat, despite 15 per cent growth in unit
sales. There were special factors in the half year - notably government
incentives which encouraged consumers to buy cheap cars, so pulling down the
average price per vehicle sold. But the uninspiring results will spoil the
marketing campaign for a share sale since the main bull point was supposed
to be that Renault was in the midst of a strong cyclical upswing.
Meanwhile, international investors will be worried about government plans to
keep a controlling stake. Mr Balladur's remarks may be necessary to head off
union opposition to privatisation. But they will fuel fears that wider
political concerns could take priority over Renault's commercial interests.
None of this means the motor group cannot be sold. Renault still looks a
more attractive candidate than AGF, the insurance group. But the government
will now have to settle on a lower price.

FT  03 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Wall Street worries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Federal Reserve's chances of piloting the US economy to a soft landing
seem to have improved this week. Yesterday's employment figures point to a
slower rate of economic growth. Data on manufacturing orders and consumer
confidence as well as the important purchasing managers' report - all
published this week - also suggest that higher interest rates have taken the
heat out of the economy. But Wall Street, which fell yesterday, is in no
mood to celebrate.
Inflationary pressures continue to niggle. The manufacturing sector is
particularly strong, with job creation showing no sign of slowing. If
capacity utilisation continues to rise, inflation could result. Bears can
get exercised about the overall employment picture too; jobs growth of
180,000 a month is hardly pedestrian and the national unemployment rate is
still falling. Since purchasing managers also reported rising materials
costs and higher commodity prices that are expected to feed through into the
wider economy, it is still possible to paint a bleak picture on inflation -
though the worries look overdone.
The bigger problem for equities could be that earnings expectations have not
fully adjusted to the more relaxed pace of growth. On a multiple of around
16 times this year's forecast earnings, Wall Street is anticipating that the
earnings momentum will continue at least into next year. Since the economy
is slowing and the best of the rationalisation gains have already been seen,
that can no longer be taken for granted. Even if the economy achieves a soft
landing, equities could come down with a bump.

FT  03 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Profit-taking trims
rises after strong week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate profit-taking ahead of this month's interim book closing supported
volume and the Nikkei 225 average, caught between buying and selling,
finally closed almost flat, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index rose 10.90 to 20,653.83 after moving within a narrow band between
20,615.52 and 20,675.54. Dealers supported telecoms-linked shares, while
domestic institutions bought steels. However, arbitrage-linked selling and
profit-taking eroded most of the gains.
Volume totalled 359m shares against 341m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks inched up 1.23 to 1,641.14, and the Nikkei 300 by 0.15 to
299.37. Advances led declines by 514 to 440 with 216 unchanged and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.10 to 1,340.46.
Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, added Y4 to Y385, a new high
for the year, and NKK gained Y2 to Y294. Kawasaki Steel, however, fell Y4 to
Y430.
Contractors were sought by overseas investors. Obayashi gained Y10 to Y758
and Shimizu Y40 to Y1,100.
Telecoms stocks were higher on purchases by dealers. NTT gained Y10,000 to
Y930,000 and NEC Y40 to Y1,250. DDI, on the second section, fell Y2,000 to
Y998,000 on foreign selling.
Suzuki Motor rose Y20 to Y1,260 on reports that the company will supply Fuji
Heavy Industries with vehicles manufactured in Europe.
Nippon Shoji, the drug wholesaler and manufacturer, ended unchanged at
Y1,440 in spite of the government's suspension of its production facilities
for 105 days starting Monday. Mr John Wilson, pharmaceutical analyst at
James Capel, said the suspension was damaging to the company's earnings, and
the stock, on a p/e ratio of 24, had still further to fall.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 22.32 to 22,899.37 in volume of 85.9m shares.
Roundup
Profit-taking also affected much of the region after firm performances
during the week.
KUALA LUMPUR was mixed on profit-taking after a strong week as investors
shrugged off the detention in Thailand of Ashaari Muhammad, leader of the
banned Islamic group Al Arqam. Prices fell sharply a week ago on rumours of
Ashaari's return to his native Malaysia. The composite index rose 4.54 to
1,160.88, for a 4.4 per cent rise on the week.
Ekran, the builder, soaring MDollars 2.50 or 12.4 per cent to MDollars 22.70
after winning Securities Commission approval for a bonus issue.
BANGKOK closed higher on buying of blue chips, led by communications and
banks, in spite of occasional profit-taking during the day. The SET index
closed 13.22 higher at 1,539.06, up 6.1 per cent on the week, in heavy
turnover of almost Bt15bn.
Cathay Finance, making its debut, finished at Bt82.50, compared with its
offer price of Bt66, but down from the Bt90-95 at which it had traded in the
grey market.
WELLINGTON remained at a five month high, helped by a buoyant forestry
sector, and the NZSE-40 capital index ended 11.73 up at 2,187.75 in volume
of NZDollars 67.2m.
TAIPEI reversed early losses to close slightly above the 7,000-point
resistance level as plastics regained strength to lead the market after
consolidation. The weighted index closed up 36.48 at 7,010.63, for a 1.9 per
cent rise the week. Turnover shrank to TDollars 68.59bn from Thursday's
TDollars 99.61bn.
SEOUL closed lower in moderate trading following three straight days of
advances, although some primary blue chips continued their rally. The
composite index lost 4.71 to 944.52, for a 0.7 per cent fall on the week.
HONG KONG finished slightly higher after a day of slow trade as investors
were sidelined ahead of the weekend and key US non-farm payroll data.
The Hang Seng Index rose 10.66 to 9,901.56, for a 5.3 per cent rise on the
week.
SINGAPORE finished mixed with the Straits Times Industrials index losing
6.22 to 2,330.61, for a 1.6 per cent rise on the week. Cycle &amp; Carriage lost
30 cents to SDollars 11.90 after an announcement denying rumours it was in
discussions to buy a prime commercial building.

FT  03 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Conflicting influences move French
equities - David Buchan explains the recent volatility in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interest rates have given the Paris Bourse two nasty jolts this week, as
well as raising some doubts about the pace of the undoubted recovery that is
taking place in the French economy.
The first jolt came on Tuesday, when French commercial banks, anxious to
restore profitability sapped by fairly weak demand for credit as well as by
continued property loan provisions, raised their base lending rate by a
quarter of one per cent to 7.95. Since May it had been at 7.70 per cent, the
lowest for two decades.
The sharper jolt came two days later, with the French Treasury selling a new
tranche of 10 year bonds (OATs) at 7.92 per cent, compared to 7.23 per cent
only a month earlier. This led to a 1.65 per cent fall in the Bourse's CAC
40 index which closed on Thursday at 2,034.91; yesterday, eventually, it
fell further to 2,020.37. it still ended xxx per cent lower on the week.
In deciding between bonds or shares, 'most market operators compare the
yield of OATS with the cash flow yield of companies', says Ms Monique Cohen,
equity director at Paribas, and by this measure she says the Paris bourse is
now overvalued by as much as 20 per cent. The significant correction of
around 10 per cent in French shares in the second quarter of this year has
been balanced by the fact that long-term rates are again heading upwards.
All eyes, therefore, are on the first-half results which French companies
are now beginning to report. 'We are at the stage of seeing whether
companies really did perform this year as the bourse anticipated they would
in the first half', says Mr Guillaume Beau, head of equity services at
Cholet Dupont. The first signs have not been particularly promising, with
such blue chip companies like Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group, and Danone, the
food group, turning in first half decreases in net profits of 10 and 7.8 per
cent respectively. But barring any further big disappointments that could
cause a collapse in the market, Ms Cohen expects to see the CAC 40 index
recover modestly to end this year at around the 2,100 level.
It would be perverse for the stock market to continue to fall if the general
economy continues to rise. Unshaken by the latest interest rate rises, Mr
Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, confirmed this week that the
government had revised its 1994 growth estimate up from 1.4 to 2 per cent in
real terms, in line with international forecasts.
In itself, this is not going to give a boost to the bourse which, as Mr Beau
points out, built its anticipations of recovery into share prices last year.
Nor does Prime Minister Edouard Balladur seem to set to give the economy the
sort of fiscal stimulus that one might have expected eight months away from
the presidential election in which he is a candidate. The 1995 budget which
he is due to unveil on September 21 will be largely aimed at deficit
reduction, using any margin provided by economic recovery to lower social
security charges rather than income or corporate taxes.
But corporate France is, for the most part, fairly flush with cash. A recent
report by the Banque Nationale de Paris predicts that 'the return to a
annual rate of GDP growth of 2 per cent should permit a cyclical rebound in
productivity (almost 2 per cent a year) against a background of moderate
growth in wages (2.5 per cent)'. Companies' cash positions have also
benefited from 'the scissor effect' this year of steadily rising turnover
and of continued destocking, the bank says.
However, market analysts remain choosy. In very general terms, Mr Beau says
that industrial stocks are to be preferred over financial institutions, many
of which are still catching up on the bad loan provisions they should have
made earlier. Among industrials, he shares with Ms Cohen a preference 'at
this stage in the recovery' for makers of capital equipment and heavy
industrial goods, in which French manufacturers are expected to increase
their investment.
These preferences also include the car sector. Yesterday's announcement by
Renault that it had more than doubled its first-half pre-tax profits to
FFr1.7bn clearly puts the vehicle group in pole position, at the start of
its race to be privatised this autumn ahead of the AGF insurance group that
had been scheduled to be sold first.
Some observers, however, feel that a contributory reason for this year's
bourse decline is that, recently, too much paper has been put on the market
and that this, in turn, could hamper autumn privatisations. The level of new
issues and capital increases in the first eight months of this year was
FFr30.7bn, compared to FFr27bn in the whole of 1993.
On the other hand, officials at the Paris bourse see this as reflecting the
intrinsic health of their market, where average daily volume this year has
been FFr4.64bn compared to FFr3.82bn last year. This is despite the fact
that trading only averaged FFr3.3bn a day last month, or only about a
quarter of what was traded a year ago in the immediate wake of the 1993
monetary crisis.
Several measures, meanwhile, have now been taken to ensure that most French
shares are henceforth traded in Paris. Following the abolition of the bourse
tax for non-residents, and the placing of a FFr4,000 ceiling on that tax for
residents, Paris is to provide instant quotes for trades in blocks of FFr1m
shares or more in its 53 most international stocks from September 19. This,
the bourse hopes, will repatriate most block trades in French shares from
London.

FT  03 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich defies afternoon bourse
downtrend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apart from an unusually detached Zurich, bourses mostly backtracked
yesterday on the lower dollar and a retreat from an early rally in US
treasuries, after dealers reassessed what appeared to be a smaller than
expected rise in US payrolls, writes Our Markets Staff.
ZURICH concentrated on domestic corporate developments and rallied 1.7 per
cent. The SMI index rose 43.6 to close near its best level of the day at
2,672.0, a rise of 3.5 per cent on the week.
Roche certificates rose SFr190, or 3.1 per cent, to SFr6,270 in reply to its
its better than expected first-half results - the first time it has
presented six month figures. Analysts commented that stock now looked as if
it was heading back towards SFr6,500 after its spell in the doldrums.
The mood spilled over to the other pharmaceutical stocks, pulling Sandoz
SFr11 higher to SFr684. Ciba added SFr7 to SFr808 in spite of downgrades
from Swiss Volksbank and CS Investment Research after its flat first half
figures earlier in the week.
UBS was supported by Thursday's news of improved trading income in July and
August, adding SFr27, or 2.3 per cent, to SFr1,199. CS Holding rose SFr6 to
SFr557.
Nestle closed SFr25 higher at SFr1,237 on heavy foreign buying.
PARIS closed more than 2 per cent below its best, and 2.6 per cent down on
the week as French investors became preoccupied again with interest rates.
The CAC 40 index ended 14.54 lower at 2,020.37 after a day's high of
2,064.35.
The market's earlier strength had a lot to do with provisional sales data
from the French car industry, showing an 18.9 per cent increase on a year
ago and a 14.7 per cent rise in the first eight months. Even after falling
in line with the market in the afternoon, Peugeot rose FFr7 to FFr864 on the
day and the tyremaker, Michelin, by 20 centimes to FFr238.50.
The best rise of the day came from La Rochette, the paper and pulp group
which climbed FFr3.75, or 7.1 per cent, to FFr56.75 after the broker,
Detroyat, changed its opinion to positive on the loss-making wood pulp and
paper group, citing the speed and depth of recovery in its sector.
FRANKFURT was looking happier, both on the session and in the post-bourse,
before the second thoughts on Wall Street about the US jobs data. After
Thursday's post bourse slide to 2,185.78 it recovered to 2,204.71, 2 per
cent up on the week, before peaking at 2,215.75 in the afternoon.
Turnover eased from DM6.4bn to DM6.1bn. After that, it was mostly downhill
as bund futures dropped through the 91.00 support level. The Ibis-indicated
Dax resisted a deep reversal on the French pattern, but still lost a few
points to 2,197.38.
On the session, carmakers saw profit-taking after rising earlier this week
on the back of strong first-half figures from Daimler-Benz. BMW fell DM7 to
DM819 and Daimler itself by DM2.50 to DM838.50.
MILAN hosted another a quiet session, unmoved by political developments and
still waiting for action on the budget, and the Comit index dipped 0.98 at
685.03, leaving it little changed on the week.
Montedison was an exception, losing L35, or 2.5 per cent, to L1,378 on news
that the company had valued its shares at L1,208 for the purposes of an
exchange of shares that will play a part in the fusion of Finanziaria
Agroindustriale back into Montedison.
Olivetti, under heavy pressure in recent sessions, bounced L28 higher to
L2,143 after news that it would cut the prices of its personal computers by
12 per cent over the next few months, following price cuts by rivals.
Among the banks, BCI lost L9 to L3,692 amid continuing arbitrage business
between the ordinary share and the rights to its capital call.
AMSTERDAM was encouraged by the lower than expected US non-farm payroll
data, and the AEX index finished 3.03 higher at 419.14, after peaking at
420.77 in the immediate aftermath of the figures. The index fell 0.4 per
cent on the week.
VNU was the day's highlight for the second successive session after
Wednesday's better than expected first half figures. The share peaked at a
new intraday high of Fl 203.00 before settling back to close Fl 2.20 higher
at Fl 198.20.
MADRID took its loss on the week to 2.1 per cent as the general index closed
3.17 lower at 303.95.
DUBLIN continued to celebrate the Irish Republican Army's laying down of its
arms, the ISEQ overall index closing 17.29 higher at 1,932.79, 3.6 per cent
higher on the week, on the possibilities that the peace dividend might
offer. Equities rose in spite of a slight decline in Irish gilts.

FT  03 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains reduced as rate worries
continue - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deepening concern over the interest rate outlook, coupled with a negative
reaction in New York to the US payroll data, cut sharply into early gains in
UK stocks yesterday. British government bonds fell in late dealings as US
Federal bond prices weakened and a leading US investment bank was believed
to have turned negative on interest rate prospects in Germany.
Once again, UK shares displayed considerable volatility, with the stock
index futures traders often influencing the underlying market. Selling of
the water industry and electricity generating stocks took its toll of the
second-line market indices. Market strategists remained confident that the
stock market could resume its upward trend.
But this confidence was tested by suggestions by some analysts that the
question of a pre-emptive rise in UK base rates may be raised at this week's
meeting between the chancellor of the exchequer and the Governor of the Bank
of England.
With gilts fairly steady in early trading, the FT-SE 100 Index was able to
gain nearly 26 points after a slow start. Share prices were helped by the
technical reaction from the large selling programme of the previous session,
which is thought to have involved a switch of as much as Pounds 800m out of
equities and into gilts.
New York's immediate response to the modest rise payroll numbers and stable
unemployment rate in August was favourable but a gain of 13 points on the
Dow began to melt away as Federal bonds eased. By the time London went home,
the Dow was 3 points off.
The turn down in New York hit hardest at UK government bonds. Short dates,
closely linked to base rate prospects, slipped by  1/8 in late trading,
while the longer dates extended early gains to show total losses of just
over a full point.
The gain on the FT-SE 100 Index was whittled away to only 6.2 at the close,
for a final reading of 3,222.7. But the weakness in the second half of the
session fell more harshly on the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, finally down 13 points
at 3,781.3.
Over the week, the Footsie 100 Index has fallen by 42.4 points, or around
1.3 per cent, as profits have been taken following the powerful advance of
the previous five trading sessions.
Growing belief that the global interest rate cycle is on the turn have
increasingly unsettled markets. However, with the focus on the blue chip
market leaders, last week's fall in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index has been held to
around 0.6 per cent.
About 60 per cent of yesterday's Seaq-reported trading volume came in
non-Footsie stocks, which includes many of the utility stocks. On Thursday,
retail, or genuine customer business, in UK equities topped Pounds 1.65bn,
one of the better daily totals for the year; this figure bore out reports of
a trading programme involving switching out of blue chip stocks.
Traders stressed that UK and continental European securities houses were
striving to keep their trading books flat yesterday afternoon to avoid
getting caught with large open positions until Tuesday, when the New York
markets return from the Labor Day holiday.
Next week is expected to bring a general return to full trading in Europe as
the August holiday period is finally left behind. The UK market fears that
indications this week of economic recovery gathering pace in Germany and
elsewhere may imply that the interest rate cycle could turn upwards sooner
than investors had anticipated.
However, UK stocks are expected to continue to benefit from the higher
company earnings and dividends which have been spurred by the recovery in
the domestic economy.

FT  03 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Setback for Arjo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Paper maker Arjo Wiggins was one of the chief casualties in the FT-SE 100
and also the most heavily traded as the company announced it had lost its
finance director.
The shares dropped 10 to 265p on turnover of 10m - the highest this year -
after it was revealed that Mr Tony Isaac, was leaving to join chemicals
group BOC. Mr Isaac had been with the group since its formation in 1990. His
departure left only two British non-executives on the board and revived
worries of growing domination by Groupe Saint-Louis, the French company
which owns 39 per cent of Arjo.
BOC shares were up on the news but fell with the sector to end the day 3
lower at 737p.
Media conglomerate Pearson fell 31 to 628p after the Financial Times owner's
first-half results showed operating losses in the company's book division
and the chairman warned progress would be harder for the rest of the year.
Profits were up 50 per cent to Pounds 69.3m and within the range of
analysts' forecasts but there was concern over the prospects for the second
half.
Carlton Communications fell 11 to 843p on news reports that approval for a
new fifth television channel in the UK was imminent. Its arrival would hit
Carlton's control of the lucrative London region.
The recent burst of strength in the bank sector spilled over into the
sector's two laggards, Barclays and NatWest, which gained ground at the
expense of Bank of Scotland. NatWest jumped 7 to 494p after turnover of 3.4m
while Barclays moved up 7 to 586p on 6.8m traded. Royal Bank of Scotland
edged up 3 1/2 to 434p.
TSB, where buying was again stimulated by the buy note published by Hoare
Govett in mid-week and which focused on the bank's ability to maintain
profit margins and its dividend paying potential, gained 3 1/2 more to 227
1/2 p on turnover of 10m.
Abbey National was aggressively bought, the shares moving up 5 1/2 to 420p,
after 423p, with Swiss Bank Corporation said to have been a heavy buyer.
Schroders, the second largest UK merchant bank by market capitalisation,
fell 25 to 1478p and the non-voters 20 to 1393p, as a flurry of
profit-taking followed the bank's interim figures, which were at the top end
of expectations.
SG Warburg, the only merchant bank in the FT-SE 100 index, edged up 6 to
778p in the wake of switching from Schroders.
Smith New Court, the securities house regarded as the UK's premier
marketmaking firm, moved up 5 to 440p following the elevation of Mr Michael
Marks to executive chairman in succession to Sir Michael Richardson who
announced his retirement as from December 31.
Courtaulds Textiles which reports on Thursday jumped 18 to 511p after agency
broker James Capel moved its recommendation from hold to buy. The house
cited the long-term growth prospects and the boost to profits from the
acquisition of Hartstone's hosiery business.
Bowater, reporting on Tuesday, added 7 at 467p and RTZ, reporting on
Thursday was 4 stronger at 884p.
Retailing group Body Shop continued to shake off the recent gloom and the
shares put on another 6 1/2 to 230 1/2 p.
Speculation that food and drinks manufacturer Cadbury-Schweppes was
considering a bid for Cott, the Canadian soft drinks group, left the shares
trailing 7 at 484p, in trade of 2.3m. The shares have been strong performers
in recent sessions, boosted by big US buying. NatWest Securities expects its
interim profits forecast of Pounds 194m to be exceeded when the company
reports figures next week, but said this is already reflected in the share
price.
The day's biggest rise among FT-SE 100 constituents was recorded in defence
and engineering group British Aerospace. The shares closed 15 ahead at 513p,
on speculation that a US leasing company was about to place a Dollars 900m
order for Airbus aircraft. BAe not only builds the wings of the Airbus
series but is also a 20 per cent stake holder in the Airbus consortium.
However, several analysts dismissed talk of such an order and said smaller
orders may be announced at next week's Farnborough air show. They also
attributed the day's interest to general buying ahead of the air show.
Engineering group Siebe shook off recent accountancy worries to jump 18 to
590p, as dealers awaited the traditional upbeat statement from the company
at Monday's annual meeting.
The oil sector was one of the market's better performing areas, led by BP
which advanced 8 to 417p on turnover of 7.7m, following keen US buying
interest. Shell put on 7 to 752 1/2p on 3.1m traded.

FT  03 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Electricity buy-back
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South Western Electricity confirmed it had been buying back its own shares,
announcing the purchase of 2.5m shares late on Thursday at 820.5p a share
and a further purchase of 1m shares, for between 817p and 819p a share
yesterday. The acquisitions total 2.8 per cent of the company's shares.
south Western has shareholder approval to buy in up to 12.3m, or 10 per cent
of its own shares.
South Western shares settled 6 off at 816p, outperforming the rest of the
sector which suffered from another bout of large scale profit-taking.
Southern Electricity, viewed as a potential predator or target in the recent
speculative burst of activity in the sector, was badly treated by
marketmakers who hammered the stock price all day; the shares closed 28
lower at 777p. Yorkshire dropped 26 to 764p, Norweb 25 to 798p and Northern
24 to 810p.

FT  03 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: WPP busy ahead of placing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Marketing group WPP gained a penny to 120p with 3.5m traded as it announced
the details of a big placing of shares set to take place on Monday.
Banks which bailed the company out in a Dollars 271.6m debt-for-equity swap
two years ago are poised to sell 190m shares in the market. The preference
shares were converted into ordinary stock at 45p each and dealers suggested
yesterday that they would be sold off at around 112p.
The book building process by which the managing consortium made up of
Bankers Trust International, JP Morgan and SG Warburg tender for offers has
apparently seen very strong demand and the placing is expected to be
oversubscribed.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Dollar fades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar wilted on the foreign exchanges yesterday after the US treasury
market responded negatively to US employment data, writes Philip Gawith.
Although the market's initial response was positive, it soon changed its
mind and the dollar followed Treasury bonds lower, slipping three pfennigs
from a high for the day of DM1.5840 to DM1.5540 later. Against the yen, it
fell from a high of Y100.2 to a low later of Y99.05.
The D-Mark's firmness against the dollar helped it to end sharply higher
against various European currencies. A late afternoon flurry saw it finish
at L1,009 against the lira from L1,002.
Sterling also suffered at the hands of the firmer D-Mark, losing nearly
three pfennigs from its high for the day to close in London at DM2.4101. The
sterling trade weighted index closed at 78.8, down from a high of 79.4
earlier in the day.
At first glance, the payroll figures looked to be supportive for the dollar.
The 179,000 increase was well below the 234,000 consensus forecast, and this
should have supported US bonds, and hence the dollar.
The market, however, chose to focus on the strong manufacturing data, where
jobs, hours worked and overtime were all seen as indicating wage pressure.
The dollar's woes were later exacerbated by the Columbia University
inflation index - said to be closely watched by Fed chairman, Mr Alan
Greenspan - rising to 111.4 in August, from 109.5 in July.
On top of this, there was talk in the market of an upcoming article in
Forbes magazine quoting the head of business research at Columbia saying
that US inflation would rise to 5 per cent later this year.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS in London
cautioned against reading too much into the dollar's behaviour. He said it
was the Friday before a long weekend, and trading conditions were thin. 'The
end-users are not here. They are still on vacation. They haven't done
anything.' He said the market was still being driven by short-term players.
'This is the thinnest August market in a number of years and small flows are
having a quite disproportionate impact,' said Mr Chertkow.
Mr Michel Sapin, a Bank of France monetary council member and former finance
minister, criticised French commercial banks for raising interest rates by
25 basis points earlier this week.
'This decision is not apparently distinguished by a concern for the wider
public interest. Indeed, it does not take into account the continuous and
significant lowering of official Bank of France rates in the last six
months,' he told Le Point weekly.
The weakness of the treasury market spilled over into European bond markets,
which set the tone for activity at the short end of the yield curve. The
December Euromark contract traded nearly 48,000 lots to close at 94.79 from
94.84.
Short sterling volumes were low and the December contract ended at 93.40
from 93.43.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 35m late
assistance. Earlier it had provided Pounds 27m liquidity, at established
rates, after forecasting a Pounds 250m shortage.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Metals up on better
prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Metal markets were buoyed this week as traders expressed optimism about the
erosion of stock levels and a labour dispute in Canada lifted the nickel
price. Aluminium prices at the London Metal Exchange reached a 3 1/2 -year
high on Thursday on an improvement in the fundamental prospects for the
metal.
Traders believe that an informal agreement between producers to cut
aluminium output agreed earlier this year is finally beginning to eat into
previously-high inventory levels.
At the same time, a drought in Ghana and a strike at Australia's largest
aluminium smelter have added strength to the market. The lack of water in
Ghana is expected to lead to the closure of the Volta Aluminum Company
smelter on September 10 - the plant was expected to produce 140,000 tonnes
of metal this year. The Tomago smelter in Australia plans to close one of
its three potlines on Monday unless striking employees return to work.
Aluminium prices for delivery in three months rose by Dollars 52 a tonne
over the course of the week, adding Dollars 29 a tonne on Thursday to close
at Dollars 1,565 a tonne - a slight drop from the 3 1/2 -year high point of
Dollars 1,570 a tonne reached earlier in the session.
A further stock drawdown yesterday when LME stock levels were released
reinforced the bright outlook for the aluminium market. Aluminium stocks
dropped by 19,755 tonnes. But although prices rose higher during the
session, the market failed to break the Dollars 1,565 a tonne mark at the
close.
Strength in the copper and nickel markets complete a picture of a buoyant
week for metals. Nickel prices for three months' delivery increased by
Dollars 400 a tonne over the course of the week after workers at Canada's
Falconbridge - the second biggest nickel producer in the west - decided to
go on strike over pay and conditions.
Nickel closed at Dollars 6,350 a tonne yesterday - Dollars 40 below its high
point as traders reacted to higher-than-expected levels of LME stocks.
Copper continues to be lifted by speculative and investment fund buying even
though a rise in LME stock levels yesterday temporarily dampened market
sentiment. Copper prices managed to remain above a key resistance level at
Dollars 2,500 as tonne, having touched Dollars 2,520 a tonne earlier in the
week.
After gaining ground at the beginning of the week following the closure of
Forcados - Shell's big export terminal on the Nigerian coast, the oil price
lost almost Dollars 1 a barrel. The price drop occurred as scares over
delivery problems in Nigeria disappeared from the market and traders came to
terms with high output levels in the North Sea.
North Sea crude prices slipped from Dollars 17.14 a barrel to Dollars 16.20
a barrel yesterday, but at one stage dropped much further.
Coffee prices rose by over Dollars 100 a tonne during the course of the week
with most buying heavily influenced by technical signals and activities of
investment funds. Uncertainty over weather in Brazil which remains very dry
helped to lift prices towards the end of the week. The November futures
contract rose to Dollars 3,830 a tonne by Friday.
However, the cocoa market was depressed with prices dropping by around
Pounds 50 a tonne.

FT  03 SEP 94 / International Company News: Profits at Goodman Fielder flat
at ADollars 169m

<TEXT>
Goodman Fielder, the beleaguered Australian food company where dissident
shareholders are pushing for boardroom changes, yesterday disclosed another
12 months of static profits. This was the fifth successive year it has shown
minimal bottom-line progress.
Profits before tax and abnormals in the 12 months to the end of June rose
marginally, to ADollars 168.9m (USDollars 125.6m) from ADollars 164.1m,
while sales were ADollars 3.86bn, down from ADollars 4.71bn.
However, a ADollars 17.8m abnormal charge, against last time's ADollars
109.4m surplus, lowered operating profits after tax and abnormals down to
ADollars 93.4m from ADollars 182m.
Basic earnings per share before abnormal items fell to 9.2 cents from 10.4
cents. After abnormals, they dropped from 16.1 cents to 8.1 cents.
The company insisted the results picture had been muddied by disposals and
acquisitions. It said the increase in pre-tax profits based 'only on current
businesses and adjusted for timing' would have been 22 per cent.
It also blamed the stronger Australian dollar for depressing earnings from
international operations in local currency terms.
Goodman said profits had picked up in its domestic baking and milling
operations, while consumer foods had shown a strong improvement. The poultry
division, by contrast, made an 'unsatisfactory contribution', and the
ingredients arm was hit by falling gelatine prices.
Mr Barry Weir, chief executive, said a 'significant earnings improvement'
was budgeted for 1994-95, and 'further significant gains' in the following
year.
These would come from cost-reductions, baking industry rationalisation, some
volume gains and the start of a turnround in Goodman's Asian businesses.

FT  03 SEP 94 / International Company News: VW studies strategy for
Portuguese joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen is to draw up a new business plan aimed at improving the
viability of its Dollars 2.8bn joint venture with Ford to build
multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) in Portugal, which goes on stream at the end
of this year.
The German vehicle maker, Europe's largest, is concerned that increasing
competition in the van-like MPV sector, and adverse currency movements since
the deal was signed in 1991, may make the plant less profitable.
The factory is scheduled to make 190,000 MPVs a year in full production.
The greenfield project, at Setubal, south of Lisbon, is the largest single
foreign investment in Portugal. In full production, it is scheduled to
employ 4,700 workers, and create indirectly up to another 10,000 jobs in the
area.
VW stressed last night there was no danger of it seeking to withdraw from or
scale down the venture. The project is receiving Ecu750m (Dollars 619.8m) of
EC development and training subsidies, and the Portuguese government regards
it as its flagship foreign investment project.
Ford of Europe, which is a 50 per cent partner with VW in the venture, last
night described the Wolfsburg initiative as a 'routine' financial
reassessment. It said Ford itself was not concerned about the project's
viability.
VW's managing board has been asked to come up with the plan in time for the
supervisory board's next meeting, in November.
The plant's vehicles will compete in one of the few sectors still enjoying
rapid growth in Europe.
Sales of multi-purpose vehicles have risen by an average 80 per cent a year
since 1986, and are projected to reach 700,000 units a year by the end of
the decade.
However, every big vehicle maker in Europe is now planning to seek a share
of this growth.

FT  03 SEP 94 / International Company News: Kuok sells part of TVB holding
for HKDollars 1bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Robert Kuok, the Malaysian financier, has sold 7.5 per cent of Television
Broadcasts, Hong Kong's premier television company, for more than HKDollars
1bn (USDollars 129.5m).
He placed 30m shares at HKDollars 35.80 each to investment institutions on
Thursday - the day after TVB unveiled a 70 per rise in first-half net
earnings to HKDollars 278m.
The sale has reduced Mr Kuok's stake in TVB to around 17 or 18 per cent. The
shares, when they were acquired in 1989, cost Mr Kuok HKDollars 14.60,
suggesting a gross profit on the transaction of around HKDollars 640m.
Analysts said Mr Kuok had been keen for some time to reduce his exposure to
TVB. He did not take an active interest in the management of the company,
but rather treated his near 25 per cent interest as an investment, they
said.
Mr Kuok had for several months been in talks with Pearson, the UK media and
banking group which owns the Financial Times, about the British group buying
up to 10 per cent of TVB.
Pearson has, however, confirmed that it pulled out of the talks a few weeks
ago on the grounds of price.
Analysts expect Mr Kuok to seek to reduce further his investment in TVB.
They note, however, that TVB's share price has performed well over the past
months.
Last month Mr Kuok, who has made Hong Kong his home, reduced his stake in
Shangri-La Asia - his hotels group - to 58.8 per cent form 61.5 per cent.
The placing of these shares realised HKDollars 676.2m.
The combined proceeds of the two placements leaves Mr Kuok with nearly
HKDollars 1.7bn. The money could go toward his ambitious plans for
residential property development in Hong Kong, and more investment ideas in
China.

Nextel project

<TEXT>
Nextel Communications is to press ahead with its plans to build a US-wide
wireless communications system, despite MCI's decision not to collaborate in
the venture, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco.
Nextel said yesterday it had Dollars 2.1bn in cash and commitments toward
the estimated Dollars 2.5bn needed to establish a system covering 85 per
cent of the US population by March 1997.
MCI, the US long-distance telephone company, was to have acquired a 17 per
cent stake in Nextel for Dollars 1.3bn and become a marketing partner,
lending its well-recognised name to Nextel's wireless communications
services.
Earlier this week, MCI called off the agreement, but talks continued aimed
at forming a strategic alliance.
MCI said the new talks had been positive. However, any new deal would
require Motorola's consent, and MCI and Motorola were unable to reach
agreement on terms. Motorola earlier agreed to sell Nextel all of its
special mobile radio licences for Dollars 1.7bn in stock.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Delhaize 'Le Lion', the big Belgian retail group, posted a BFr1.7bn (Dollars
52.4m) profit in the first half of this year, a 73 per cent rise on the same
period of 1993. Turnover rose 10 per cent to BFr179.6bn.
The half-year result compares with earnings for the whole of 1993 of BFr1bn,
against a BFr6.3bn profit in 1992. The group said it expected a significant
improvement for the whole of this year.
The Belgian supermarkets and stores saw sales rise 5.4 per cent to BFr47.8bn
from BFr45.3bn. However, profits are only just begining to recover from
recession, sharp discounting in food prices, restructuring costs and
industrial disputes.
Delhaize's main interest abroad, the Food Lion supermarket chain in he US,
turned in a 6.4 per cent increase in sales, to Dollars 3.6bn, for the first
half, with profits of Dollars 66m.
This rise, of 25 per cent, is particularly satisfying to the Belgian group
after a tough six months in which it weathered bad publicity in the US over
alleged hygiene shortfalls, fierce competition, and a dispute with the US
Department of Labor over overtime work and safety conditions for employees.
Sales and profits also showed modest increases at the Belgian group's stores
in Greece, the Czech Republic, and at the northern French PG Group in which
it acquired a 74 per cent stake last May.

FT  03 SEP 94 / International Company News: Solid earnings growth at Roche
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Roche, the Swiss health products group which recently acquired the Syntex
pharmaceuticals company of the US for Dollars 5.3bn, achieved first-half net
income of SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1.2bn), on SFr7.3bn in sales.
It is the first time the group has reported interim profit figures, and no
comparative data was given, except for a 2.4 per cent gain in sales.
However, it said earnings 'continued to improve', thanks to a steady growth
in the operating result and higher financial revenues.
Roche's financial managers again performed well, showing an increase in
earnings on the group's SFr14.6bn liquid assets in spite of the upheavals in
world securities markets. Net financial income was SFr506m, equivalent to 64
per cent of the amount earned in the whole of last year.
Both of the group's Basle rivals, Ciba and Sandoz, suffered sharp reversals
in their financial earnings in the first half.
Roche also outperformed its local rivals at the operating level: its
SFr1.56m operating profit reflected a 21.3 per cent margin on sales.
Sandoz's operating margin was 16.5 per cent, while Ciba's was 17.2 per cent.
Roche said sales growth in the second half would be slower than the recent
trend. It blamed government pressures on prices of drugs and laboratory
services and said profits would be lower than in the first half.
However, it forecast 'a further significant rise' in net income for the full
year, a more optimistic outlook than in mid-July, when it announced
first-half sales.

FT  03 SEP 94 / International Company News: Research focus provides the edge
 -Swiss drugs groups are pursuing diverse strategies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The increasingly divergent strategies of the three big Basle-based
pharmaceuticals and chemicals groups - Ciba, Roche and Sandoz - have been
tested severely in the trying circumstances of the first half of 1994.
For the moment, Roche, which has decided to focus on developing leading-edge
drugs and diagnostic equipment, has emerged the clear winner.
Ciba and Sandoz, which have opted for more diversified business portfolios,
have yet to prove the wisdom of that choice.
Roche's first-half net income of SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1.2bn) was not only the
largest among the three, but it reflected the highest profit margin and
probably the greatest growth.
Issuing an interim profit statement yesterday for the first time, the group
gave no comparative figures. However, first-half net income was equivalent
to 65 per cent of the result in the whole of last year.
Its operating profits have also grown strongly: the first-half result was
equivalent to two-thirds of the full-year 1993 figure.
Roche has, therefore, again confounded many investors. They believed the
group was going to suffer as much as other international drug groups from
the price squeeze being applied by governments throughout Europe and North
America.
Investor scepticism peaked in July when the group issued a cautious sales
forecast. The non-voting shares, which enjoyed a premium rating for much of
last year, plunged from a February peak of SFr7,270 to SFr5,160 in July.
Yesterday, they bounced up SFr190 to SFr6,270 on the interim figures.
Roche has argued that its concentration on leading-edge drugs has enabled it
to maintain sales and margins better than some of its competitors. In the
interim report, it claimed its pharmaceuticals division sales in the US and
Europe 'easily outperformed the market as a whole'.
And, in spite of the high costs and risks of its research-intensive
strategy, it is convinced it can continue to develop winning drugs.
Its Dollars 5.3bn acquisition of Syntex was motivated in large part by the
US drugs group's substantial R&amp;D efforts in areas complementary to its own.
Ciba and Sandoz, on the other hand, are inclined to hedge their bets on the
increasingly uncertain pharmaceuticals sector by nurturing other, more
stable health-related businesses as well as their traditional cyclical
industrial and agricultural chemicals businesses.
Their significant acquisitions in the past year have been in the
health-related businesses. Sandoz has just completed its Dollars 3.7bn
takeover of the US Gerber baby food group, and Ciba has made two large deals
to boost its Ciba Vision eye-care side.
These businesses are performing respectably, but the cyclicals have yet to
respond in the way investors hope.
Roche has also shown up its rivals in the game of managing liquid funds.
Ciba's net financial income was down 30 per cent, Sandoz plunged from a
SFr79m profit to a SFr90m loss. However, Roche's SFr506m net financial
income was equivalent to 64 per cent of that earned in the whole of last
year.
All three suffered from the sharp decline in market values of many
investments held, especially bonds, in the first half, but only Roche offset
those losses with higher returns on other investment and asset sales.
Roche is guarded about its investment strategies, but it is known to favour
equities over bonds.
Mr Henri Meier, finance director, said earlier this year it invested only in
Triple A securities. 'We do take risks, trying to anticipate market moves,
but we think our risk management is as good as anyone's,' he said.

FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Richardson quits chair at Smith New Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Michael Richardson, who yesterday announced that he will retire as
chairman of the broking firm Smith New Court, is not only a shaker in the
City of London, but one of its rare movers.
Unlike most City financiers, Sir Michael has worked at the helm of both a
broking firm and a merchant bank.
Sir Michael, 69, retains the energetic manner which earned him his
reputation as the top corporate finance adviser to UK government
privatisations while at NM Rothschild. He is far from retiring. Although
remaining a vice-chairman of Rothschild, he insists he is now looking for
work.
'If you are here at 8am every morning and stay until 6pm at night, you are
bound to have a bit of a gap when you stop,' he said yesterday, 'I do not
really feel terribly old, and I think I have still got an enormous amount of
energy and experience. I hope something will come along.'
Sir Michael is to retire from the end of the year, and will be succeeded as
executive chairman by Mr Michael Marks, chief executive. Mr Paul Roy, head
of the UK broking business, will be chief executive, and Mr Gavin Casey will
step up from finance director to be chief operating officer.
Sir Michael's breadth of experience, from his days as a partner in Cazenove
&amp; Co, the broker, to heading corporate finance at NM Rothschild, is unusual.
Furthermore, he had bridged an old divide without joining one of the
integrated investment banks which increasingly dominate the City.
These are buoyant times for Cazenove and Smith New Court, as the two large
independent brokers which can be used by merchant banks such as Rothschild
and Schroders. Sir Michael argues that 'Cazenove is at the top of the tree
and we are somewhere up it' as a result of staying independent.
But despite his reasons for sentimental attachment to the divide, Sir
Michael says it may not last. He says that new capital adequacy requirements
in the EU will make it harder for independent brokers to take on large
blocks of shares in 'bought deals' before placing them with clients.
Furthermore, he argues that distribution capacity will become more important
for merchant banks and 'there will come a time when people do not want a
bank just for the brilliance of its ideas'. He says he cannot predict when
the defining moment will come, although it will be within a decade.
Smith New Court is already linked to Rothschild through the 26 per cent
stake the bank bought in the jobber Smith Brothers in 1985. Since then, it
has grown corporate and retail broking in both UK and abroad to the point
where UK market-making in equities accounts for only 20 per cent of profits.
Market-making is now under pressure, a report commissioned by the Office of
Fair Trading having found that market-makers gain excessive commissions. Sir
Michael defends the system as ensuring liquidity, saying that a continental
European-style order-matching system would be 'madness' for London.
Yet Sir Michael, who retired earlier this year from the board of the London
Stock Exchange, is not complacent about London's financial role.
He is among City figures who worry that developments such as the siting of
the European Central Bank in Frankfurt could be portents of decline.
'The City has to be very careful about things such as the difficulties at
Lloyd's (of London), the internationalisation of banking and commodities
dealing, and the growth of small stock markets. It is not going to remain
the financial centre of Europe unless it is constantly watchful,' he says.
Sir Michael was one of a group of senior City figures such as Lord
Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, who have made way on the
Stock Exchange board for figures such as Sir Michael's successor, Mr Marks.
Sir Michael argues that the new group will need all the initiative it can
muster.
'John Kemp-Welch (the new chairman of the exchange) could be marvellous, but
he needs a group of punchy young executives like Michael Marks to provide
new ideas,' he says. Sir Michael has been a strong supporter of the exchange
taking on a more European role to reinforce its primary position.
One of Smith New Court's unusual policies has been that nearly 10 per cent
of equity is held by staff. Sir Michael argues that this has helped to
prevent employees being poached in lean times. 'All my assets have two legs.
If you are having a bad year, someone can take them away,' he says.
Sir Michael seems unlikely to disappear from the City for some time yet. In
addition to his role at Rothschild, he is a non-executive director of
Sedwick Group and Savoy. And if he has his way, it should not be too long
before one of the City's guiding hands re-appears at another helm.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One director of ED&amp;F Man, one of the world's largest commodities traders,
could net up to Pounds 6.7m as a result of the group's Pounds 500m flotation
next month.
Mr Dan Rosenblum, 49, heads Man's US sugar business and is the largest
shareholder on the board with 9 per cent.
The directors, many of whom incurred substantial debt to acquire the stakes,
are widely expected to sell between 10 and 15 per cent of their collective
50 per cent holding.
Some 50 employees will become millionaires - on paper at least - as a result
of the flotation.
The company will remain under employee control, however, with only 30 per
cent in public hands.
Man said trading was 'comfortably ahead' of last year, in spite of a sharp
drop in the group's substantial fund management business. Last year the
group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 70.7m (Pounds 50.5m).
Man also named Mr Glen Moreno, former chief executive of Fidelity
International, and Mr Garth Ramsay, former deputy chairman of Ivory &amp; Sime,
as non-executive directors.
About 75 per cent of the shares to be sold will be placed with institutions
and the rest offered to the public.
The shares, which will be priced on September 22, are likely to trade on a
historic multiple of about 12 times, against a sector average of 14.
The flotation will raise Pounds 90m, half of which will be used for the
early repayment of preference shares.

FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Acquisition puts Hobson Pounds 0.5m in the
black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A turnround from pre-tax losses of Pounds 544,000 to profits of Pounds
530,000 for the half year to June was announced by Hobson, the toiletries
and homecare products group which moved up to the main market in May. The
group has changed its year end and the comparatives are for the six months
ended September 30.
The improvement follows the acquisition in May of the food manufacturing
side of the Co-operative Wholesale Society.
Turnover jumped to Pounds 29.1m (Pounds 1.62m). Earnings were 0.23p (0.64p
losses) and there is no dividend. The directors intend to recommend a final
of 0.4p.

FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Torday &amp; Carlisle incurs Pounds 0.55m
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Torday &amp; Carlisle, the Newcastle-based engineer, reported a pre-tax deficit
of Pounds 546,000 for the six months to end-June, refecting the warning in
the 1993 accounts of a poor start to the current year.
The pre-tax outcome compared with a profit of Pounds 17,000 in the
corresponding period, although that included a Pounds 380,000 profit
contribution from Elfab Hughes, the safety equipment arm which was sold in
the fourth quarter of 1993.
Group turnover fell to Pounds 14.1m, against Pounds 17.2m - including Pounds
2.05m from discontinued operations. Losses per share came out at 3.4p (0.4p
earnings).

Fife Indmar, the Edinburgh-based engineer, edged ahead from Pounds 424,000
to Pounds 431,000 pre-tax in the half year to June 30.
Mr Gavin Hepburn, the chairman, said that as anticipated, the slowdown in
North Sea activity had been compensated by improved returns from the other
businesses and lower interest costs.
Turnover grew from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 16.5m, including Pounds 709,000
from acquisitions. Earnings per share slipped to 2.5p (2.7p) because of the
March share issue and the interim dividend is held at 0.75p.

FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: UAPT extends time frame for bids
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UAPT-Infolink, the credit reference company caught in a bidding war, has
altered its articles of association so that offers for the company can
proceed.
The group is being fought over by Equifax, the US credit data group, which
is now offering 650p a share against its original offer of 500p, and Trans
Union, Equifax's main US rival, which is offering 550p.
UAPT's board had recommended Trans Union's lower offer, which was to have
closed on August 31, because Trans Union has no UK operations and so does
not risk a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Equifax
already owns a credit information business in the UK.
However, UAPT's board has now rescinded its recommendation, effectively
leaving the outcome of the bidding war to the OFT.

restated Pounds 1.37m to Pounds 787,000 for the half year to June 30 on

FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Isotron static at Pounds 3.07m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Isotron, provider of sterilisation services to the healthcare industry,
yesterday announced static pre-tax profits at Pounds 3.07m for the year to
June 30, compared with Pounds 3.11m. This followed a rise at half-way from
Pounds 1.44m to Pounds 1.51m.
The profit included interest income down from Pounds 319,000 to Pounds
151,000 and was achieved from turnover 6 per cent higher at Pounds 7.75m
(Pounds 7.3m). The fall in income was due to cash being invested in a new
Irish plant and lower interest rates.
The operating profit, up 4.5 per cent at Pounds 2.92m (Pounds 2.79m), was
after charging Pounds 111,000 of pre-operating costs at the Irish plant.
The dividend is raised by 10 per cent to 4.77p (4.34p) with a proposed final
of 3.11p from earnings per share of 17p (17.3p).

FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: GRT to take over SMT with agreed Pounds
11.2m bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consolidation of the competitive bus industry continued yesterday with
the announcement by GRT, one of the fastest growing bus operators in the UK,
of an agreed Pounds 11.15m offer for SMT of Scotland.
Mr Moir Lockhead, chairman of GRT, said the acquisition was expected to
enhance earnings in the first full year. GRT, which came to the market in
May, is paying about 74 per cent of the consideration in cash and the
balance in new shares to value SMT at about Pounds 10m. It has also agreed
to redeem some Pounds 1.15m in SMT preference shares if the offer goes
unconditional.
Mr Lockhead said SMT would further strengthen the group's competitive
position in central Scotland. SMT operates public bus services in Edinburgh
and the Lothian region.
GRT currently operates in the north-east and central belt of Scotland, as
well as Leicester and Northampton.
SMT said the deal would protect the group in a period of intense
competition. 'In our rapidly consolidating industry it is in the best
interests of our employees and shareholders to become part of a larger bus
group,' said Mr Andrew Gall, SMT chairman.

FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Fund management boosts Schroders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Schroders, the merchant bank, yesterday insisted that it wanted to remain
independent from securities brokers in the UK as it disclosed a 7.6 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits for the 1994 first half to Pounds 103.2m.
Mr George Mallinckrodt, chairman, said there was no intention of buying a
stake in a broker such as Cazenove &amp; Co or Smith New Court in an effort to
become an integrated investment bank similar to SG Warburg.
Mr Mallinckrodt spoke after rumours that Schroders might follow its
acquisition of the remaining 42.5 per cent of its US subsidiary Wertheim
Schroder with a UK acquisition helped drive up shares in the lead-up to its
results.
Schroders did not believe it needed to distribute securities in the UK, and
there was no pressure from its customers to be able to do so. 'We are not
doctrinaire about it, but we absolutely do not believe we need it now,' he
said.
Schroders announced a 50 per cent rise in its interim dividend to 6p (4p)
after earnings per share rose to 56.6p (55.1p). But Mr Mallinckrodt said
this was partly to restore the interim to being about one third of the
total.
'I am anxious to make it clear this does not mean there is another
significant dividend increase in the pipeline next year,' he said. Net asset
value per share rose to 572p from 474p, and shares closed 25p down at Pounds
14.78p.
Earnings from fund management nearly doubled to Pounds 40.6m (Pounds 22.7m),
while those from merchant and investment banking fell from Pounds 73.2m to
Pounds 62.6m. The fall in the latter was mostly due to a drop in dealing
income from Pounds 32.8m to Pounds 18.4m.
Expenses rose to Pounds 157.2m from Pounds 132.5m. Mr Mallinckrodt said this
was mostly because it had taken on 300 extra staff, but partly because it
had provided more in the first half this year against bonuses to be paid for
the full year.
The fund management business gained from a strong inflow of new business,
and funds under management grew from Pounds 52.9bn to Pounds 53.1bn despite
a fall in market values. Corporate finance activity also picked up through
mergers and acquisitions.
Capital increased by Pounds 64m but Dollars 76m (Pounds 51m) will be
absorbed by a goodwill write-off from the Wertheim acquisition. The
write-off comprises a Dollars 41m premium over book value, and Dollars 35m
of goodwill carried in Wertheim Schroder's accounts.
Mr Mallinckrodt said the price was 'at the topside' but the overall purchase
price including that for the original stake in Wertheim was advantageous.

FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bus side fuels strong advance at Henlys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong demand for buses helped pre-tax profits at Henlys, the motor trading
and bus and coach manufacturing and distribution company, jump from Pounds
3.22m to Pounds 8.46m in the six months to June 30.
The result included a Pounds 1.9m profit from property sales.
Turnover rose from Pounds 188.2m to Pounds 199.5m with the motor division
contributing Pounds 159.8m (Pounds 154.5m) and the coach and bus side Pounds
39.7m (Pounds 33.7m).
'Trading conditions remain competitive but we are encouraged by the rate and
strength of growth in the bus and coach division,' Mr Robert Wood, chief
executive, said.
A strong demand for buses helped push vehicle registrations up by 17 per
cent in the period. Operating profits in the coach and bus division rose
from Pounds 438,000 to Pounds 3.18m contributing to a 69 per cent rise in
total operating profits to Pounds 7.24m (Pounds 4.27m).
Mr Michael Doherty, chairman, said the order book for this division was at a
record high and the company planned to increase production to meet demand.
Badgerline recently announced a Pounds 22m order for 836 bus bodies.
He said manufacturing output had increased by a quarter in the first half.
Flat turnover in the motor division was partly because of the company's
reluctance to take on fleet business where margins were very slim, Mr
Doherty said. A fall in after-sales profits offset a slight increase in
vehicle sales profits.
An interim dividend of 2.5p (1.5p) is payable on earnings per share of 14.5p
(6.4p).
The March rights issue raised Pounds 25.8m, leaving Henlys with net cash of
Pounds 8.7m. Last time there were borrowings of Pounds 23.9m representing
gearing of 50.7 per cent. Interest charged fell from Pounds 1.33m to Pounds
753,000.
COMMENT
A sound set of results led by the bus and coach division. Pent up
replacement demand from the bus industry which continues to recover and the
coach sector which is showing tentative signs of improvement should
contribute to further growth. Although turnover in the motor division looks
flat, the strategy to steer away from high volume low margin fleet business
seems to be paying off. The company's desire to broaden its franchise base
and reduce its high volume business through acquisitions makes good sense.
The shares remain attractive with profit forecasts of Pounds 13.4m for the
full year and a prospective p/e of 15.

FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pearson rises 50% to Pounds 96.3m and plans
sale - Shares fall 31p to 628p on caution over second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shares of Pearson, the media and entertainment group which owns the
Financial Times, fell by 4.7 per cent yesterday, in spite of a 50 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 46.3m to Pounds 69.3m for the six
months to June 30.
The 31p drop to 628p, the worst percentage performance by a FT-SE 100
company yesterday, reflected disappointing results from the book publishing
division, a modest interim dividend increase and fears of increased pressure
in the second half which will not benefit from special factors that boosted
the first half.
Lord Blakenham, Pearson chairman, admitted that 'progress will be harder
during the rest of the year.'
Pearson also formally marked the end of its transition from conglomerate to
media company by saying it planned to sell its remaining 41 per cent stake
in Camco International, the oil services company. The sale of 59 per cent of
Camco at the end of last year raised nearly Dollars 230m (Pounds 149m).
Pearson's operating profit rose by 31 per cent to Pounds 67.6m (Pounds
51.5m) on turnover down by 21 per cent to Pounds 648.8m (824.4m) Earnings
per share rose by 48 per cent to 9.2p (6.2p) and the interim dividend is up
7 per cent to 5.75p (5.375p).
Direct comparisons with the first half of 1993 are difficult to make because
the intervening period has seen the demerger of Royal Doulton china, the
sale of the Camco majority stake, and the receipt of Pounds 52m from British
Sky Broadcasting in partial repayment of loans.
There was also a strong contribution from Thames Television with an
operating profit of Pounds 10.4m - its first contribution to a Pearson first
half year - and earnings from Extel, the electronic information business.
Newspapers led the way in profit growth with a 66 per cent increase in
operating profit to Pounds 36.8m. The Financial Times was up 91 per cent at
Pounds 22.5m, although an associate company Les Echos faced a difficult
market in France.
The book division came under pressure, particularly in the school and
college market in the US and operating profit at Longman fell by 82 per cent
from Pounds 6m to Pounds 1.1m. Despite record deliveries of Penguin books,
the division had an overall loss of Pounds 7m compared with a Pounds 1.7m
profit in the 1993 first half. Most profits from book publishing are earned
in the second half.
Profits from visitor attractions such as Tussauds Group more than doubled to
Pounds 5.5m but attributable profit from investment banking fell from Pounds
16.4m to Pounds 13.7m mainly because of pressure on New York business.
Mr Frank Barlow, Pearson managing director, confirmed that the company would
launch two channels of satellite television with the BBC in Europe early
next year and was looking at other ventures with the Corporation. He also
confirmed that talks to buy a 10 per cent stake in TVB, the Hong Kong
broadcaster, had broken down on price some weeks ago. Lord Blakenham said
organic growth and acquisitions would be supplemented by a series of
alliances with other companies.
Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at Kleinwort Benson, maintained his
full-year pre-tax profits forecast at Pounds 235m.

The announcement of the departure of Mr Tony Isaac, finance director of Arjo
Wiggins Appleton, the Anglo-French paper company, sounded warning bells in
the City yesterday causing the company's shares to lose 10p to 265p.
City analysts feared that a boardroom split of the sort that emerged a year
ago between Mr Isaac and the predominantly French board of directors over
dividend policy had precipitated the move. The announcement comes just days
before the release of Arjo's interim results next Thursday.
While there were some indications that Mr Isaac had not enjoyed an amicable
relationship with Mr Alain Soulas, chief executive, the company denied any
differences of opinion over the results.
'There is nothing to fear in the figures. I can say there are no nasty
surprises at all,' said Mr Cob Stenham, chairman.
Mr Isaac's departure for the position of finance director at BOC group,
leaves Mr Stenham as the only British executive director on the nine-member
board.
In addition, Mr Isaac was well respected in the City and his departure will
dent the company's credibility with investment analysts. His departure is
the latest in a spate of executive resignations following that of Mr Gordon
Bond, director in charge of the printing and writing divisions, last
December.
Mr Stenham said the company had a reasonable balance of non-executive
directors, but would be looking with interest for a successor to Mr Isaac.

FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Protests grow over Body Shop article
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A member of the advisory board of US magazine Business Ethics has resigned
in protest over the magazine's decision to publish an article critical of
Body Shop International, the UK-based 'green' cosmetics group.
Mr Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben and Jerry's, the socially-responsible
ice-cream maker previously described by Body Shop as 'like a brother
company', said he had warned the magazine he would resign if it went ahead
with the story.
News of his resignation came as Body Shop issued a further rebuttal of the
article's contents.
Mr Cohen called the article, by Mr Jon Entine, an investigative journalist,
a 'diatribe' which he said 'reputable media outlets' had refused to publish.
'This unbalanced questionable piece of journalism does not advance a
constructive dialogue about social responsibility. Business Ethics should
not have run it,' he said.
Ms Marjorie Kelly, publisher and editor in chief of Business Ethics, said Mr
Cohen had resigned before he read the article, after a conversation with
Body Shop.
Thursday's article questioned Body Shop's treatment of franchisees, its
third world trade and animal testing policies, and its product ingredients.
Body Shop said yesterday it was still considering legal action over the
story.
In a 12-page statement, Body Shop called the article a 'poorly-researched
piece . . . riddled with errors and grossly unfair to Body Shop and its
founders'.
The company defended its products, saying research had shown consumers
considered these to be very high quality.
Body Shop said more than 95 per cent of its franchisees had written it an
'extraordinary letter of support' after hearing the allegations. It added
that of 22 sources named in the article, 10 were disgruntled former
employees or franchisees, current competitors, or disappointed bidders for
its business. Four more either denied their quotes or claimed they were
unfairly used.
Ms Kelly stood by the story: 'We spent months working with Jon (Entine) on
this story and the facts are solid. He is an excellent reporter. His
credentials are sterling.'

FT  03 SEP 94 / Chips can't (yet) do everything: The world chess champion
lost to a computer, but man still has the upper hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a chip chopped a chess champ this week, commentators were quick to
proclaim another famous victory for computers in their long struggle for
mental superiority over the human brain.
By knocking Garry Kasparov, the world champion, out of the Intel Grand Prix
in London, the Pentium micro-processor certainly shocked the chess world -
and saddened some people who thought its triumph would remove the game's
intellectual mystique.
Although computers have been beating good players for several years, few
people expected their first serious victory at the highest level to come so
soon.
'A lot of people thought there was a qualitative difference between most
grandmasters and the elite handful of potential world champions,' says Manny
Rainer, formerly an international chess player and now an artificial
intelligence specialist with SRI, the Cambridge research consultancy.
'I'm beginning to think now that there might not be such a gap after all.'
But Kasparov's defeat will have less psychological impact on artificial
intelligence research than on the world of chess. In computing's pioneering
era in the 1950s and 1960s, researchers learned a lot of important
programming techniques by teaching computers to play chess. Things are very
different today.
Chess computers have become a minor sideshow with little relevance to
mainstream research. Scientists trying to mimic human intelligence in
machines now prefer to work on problems related to the everyday world, such
as translating between languages, enabling a robot to steer around obstacles
or assessing the creditworthiness of bank customers.
For all its reputation as the queen of intellectual pursuits, chess is a
self-contained small world with little scope for surprises - in other words,
ideally suited to computing.
The personal computer that beat Kasparov - containing Intel's latest Pentium
processor and running a Genius 2 chess program - costs only Pounds 2,000 but
it can carry out 166m calculations and analyse 100,000 possible moves every
second. And that is fast enough to out-think a human player.
'Kasparov has relied on his experience and his strategic thinking, and
that's no longer enough,' says Professor Bill O'Riordan, head of advanced
research for ICL, the UK-based computer company. 'It comes to all of us - he
is just too slow.'
'Watching the human being becoming more and more distraught, while the
computer remained as impassive as ever, was strangely unsettling,' says
Andrew Finan, a tournament official. 'Kasparov is feeling very very sore -
he has gone underground and is not giving any interviews.'
The Intel Grand Prix is admittedly 'speed chess'; each player has 25 minutes
to make all his moves. Fast calculating is at less of a premium in a normal
tournament, when 40 moves have to be completed every two hours.
However no one doubts that, with the processing power of silicon chips
doubling every two years, cheap computers will soon be able to beat the best
human players under those conditions too.
O'Riordan does not agree, however, that chess will be diminished as a game.
'On the contrary,' he says, 'once we realise that men will never again beat
the machine, we should feel liberated and treat chess as a pure sport
again.'
In draughts (or checkers, as it is known in the US) the champions have also
succumbed to the power of computers. But there are other intellectual games
in which the human brain still reigns supreme. One is Go, which originated
in east Asia 4,000 years ago, making it more than twice as old as chess.
The rules of Go are simpler than those of chess but it has a larger board
and more potential moves at every stage. As a result, the balance between
long-term strategic thinking, which is the forte of the human player, and
short-term tactics, at which the computer excels, is tilted in favour of the
former. Good Go players need not fear defeat by a computer for many years.
Chess and Go are 'games of perfect information'; nothing is hidden from the
players. Computers are less successful at card games such as bridge, where
the course of play is less predictable and psychological factors are more
important.
'The best bridge computers today are not even up to good amateur standard,'
Rainer says.
'The kind of skills you need for chess are not very useful for anything else
 -developing a good bridge program would be much more useful for good
artificial intelligence research.
'Bridge is a trickier game all round for the computer, because you have to
reason about probabilities rather than certainties and you have to think
about what your partner is thinking the whole time.'
If machines are ever to become bridge champions, they may not be created by
programmers dedicated to producing a bridge-playing equivalent of the Genius
2 chess computer. Instead, they may emerge from more general research into
intelligent machines capable of learning human behaviour.
The most ambitious research of this sort is in progress at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology's artificial intelligence laboratory. Scientists
there are creating Cog, a humanoid robot which Daniel Dennett, one of the
team, says will be able to 'interact with human beings in a robust and
versatile manner in real time, take care of itself and tell its designers
things about its condition that would otherwise be extremely difficult if
not impossible to determine by examination'.
If Cog can play bridge, this will be a by-product of its general learning
skills, not its main raison d'etre. And unlike today's chess computers, it
will be physically capable of making its own moves. Cog will have eyes to
see the cards, arms to play them, ears to hear the bidding and a voice to
speak itself.
Although a primitive first-generation Cog exists, it will probably be
several decades before the robot develops sufficient understanding and
adaptability to play bridge with people.
By then the thought of a human chess champion playing a computer will seem
as ridiculous as it would be today for a sprinter to race against a Formula
1 car.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Money, kids and family rows: Debate at the UN's population
summit is about how, not whether, to curb growth in numbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the past two years Dr Nafis Sadik has travelled to more than 150
countries, some more than once, while preparing to chair the United Nations'
conference on population and development which begins in Cairo on Monday.
Her grandson, she says, assumes she must have a tyrannical boss who orders
her to travel constantly. Dr Sadik is amused by the irony, as the
conference's aim - and the target of bitter attacks from governments and
religious groups - is to give women more control over their lives.
This weekend, as more than 10,000 delegates, lobbyists and journalists from
170 countries gather in the African continent's most populous city, battle
lines have been drawn. In an unlikely alliance against the UN's draft policy
document, Pope John Paul II has accused the conference of promoting abortion
as a means of contraception, while Egypt's Al-Azhar University mosque,
influential in the Moslem world, has criticised the draft agenda for
condoning homosexuality, pre-marital and adolescent sex.
Apparently moved by such concerns, Saudi Arabia and Sudan, both Moslem
countries, have announced they are boycotting the conference. The decision
of Turkey's prime minister, Tancu Ciller, and Bangladesh's prime minister,
Ms Begum Khaleda Zia, not to attend may also have been influenced by the
mounting religious opposition.
Such reactions are unsurprising: the issues bring to the fore the sorest
divisions between governments, cultures and religions. Two years ago,
Britain's Prince Charles accused the Rio Earth Summit of ducking population
control and contraception issues because of their contentiousness, despite
their relevance to environmental concerns.
Yet Cairo opens with a greater level of international consensus on the
desirability of lower birth rates than was imaginable 10 years ago at the
UN's last population conference in Mexico. This partly reflects a new
recognition of the scale of the problem. The UNFPA - the UN population fund,
of which Dr Sadik is executive director - estimates the world's population
will nearly double to 10bn from 5.7bn by the middle of next century.
In the light of such projections, many African countries, which appeared
uninterested in curbing population growth a decade ago, have undergone a sea
change in attitude. Part of the reason has been the impact of rapid
population growth on over-stretched health and education plans. Moreover,
some such as Dr Fred Sai, Ghanaian president of the International Planned
Parenthood Federation, which promotes family planning services around the
world, argue overcrowding has been a factor in Rwanda's turmoil.
But the greater consensus also reflects a new confidence among countries
that family planning can work. That optimism is based on the sharp falls in
fertility rates - the average number of children borne by a woman - in most
developing countries since the Mexico conference. To demographers' surprise,
rates have fallen even where economic development has been slow, confounding
conventional wisdom. Easy access to contraception (see chart) is one of the
most important factors leading to smaller families, experts now argue.
Countries which have not shown such declines in fertility rates and are
still ambivalent or sceptical about family planning tend to be relatively
affluent with small populations, particularly Moslem countries in north
Africa and the Gulf. But even Pakistan, which for years made little attempt
to curb high fertility rates, has recently begun to promote family planning
programmes vigorously.
Despite the new agreement on goals, however, there is still wide
disagreement about how to get there. Cairo delegates expect fierce debate on
two fronts: the final wording of the UNFPA's policy guidelines on family
planning; and its proposal that financial support for family planning should
treble to Dollars 17bn a year by the year 2000. The UNFPA wants at least a
quarter of this funding to be supplied as international aid, the rest via
national programmes.
In the countdown to Cairo, the noisiest criticism has centred on how the
final text will view abortion. Dr Sadik, who calls the row a 'red herring',
believes the Vatican is using the issue of abortion to rally support for its
opposition to any contraception. She points out the draft agenda mentions
abortion only as a threat to women's health; the UNFPA estimates 250,000
women a year die from badly-performed operations. The UNFPA is currently
barred from promoting abortion or helping doctors perform the operation,
even where a lack of medical skill endangers women's lives.
She says the conference 'should accommodate the Vatican only as one state
which speaks for 800 people, not for the 1bn Catholics of the world, most of
whom are not behind their church on contraception'.
Behind that headline-grabbing row, however, many religious groups as well as
governments have begun to show a wider unease about the agenda's proposals
for improving sex education for teenagers, and for more general education
for women and girls. The Iranian Health Minister, Mr Ali Reza Marandi, has
criticised the conference for 'ignoring Islamic values' and promoting
'sexual liberty'. According to Dr Sadik, 'in the preparatory committee
meetings, every government wholeheartedly endorsed empowerment of women,
outdoing even the language of women's groups. But now they are starting to
recognise what it means'.
As well as trying to settle such controversial points, governments will have
to tackle the funding question. It will hardly be plain sailing. Some
developing countries are wary of having to adopt western values to receive
international aid. Others are concerned that some of the western
contribution to total funding will be taken out of other aid budgets.
According to Dr Sadik: 'I will not count it as failure if we don't get it
(the Dollars 17bn), but I will be very disappointed.'
But however stormy next week's debate becomes, it is population growth, not
the Cairo agenda, which presents governments with difficult choices. On the
one hand, if they tolerate present fertility rates, they face the threat of
social disruption: strains on natural resources will increase and people
will leave the countryside in search of jobs in crowded cities. If they need
any reminder of those threats, China provides a graphic example: even though
the Beijing government has taken tough measures to bring down family size, a
projection two weeks ago estimated half of its population would be living in
cities by 2010, against less than a third today.
On the other hand, if governments promote easier access to contraception,
they can expect big changes in women's social role. Those are, notably for
conservative countries, uncomfortable options. But however many amendments
are made to the Cairo agenda, demographers' arithmetic shows governments
cannot expect their societies to stay the same.

<TEXT>
Sir, You have an intriguing way of announcing the news that Sir Julius Chan
was voted in as prime minister of Papua New Guinea by the national
parliament - 'Australia puts faith in new PNG prime minister' (August 31).
And might it not be worth reporting the views of the Papua New Guineans who
have enjoyed independence for a generation?
Your report became even more eccentric in its first paragraph, locating PNG
as 'a resource-rich nation adjoining Indonesia's Irian Jaya'. Well, up to a
point. Australia's world view (and its obsession with Indonesia) is
interesting in its own right, but PNG - by far the largest South Pacific
country - merits separate treatment, please.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Legislation is only course to ensure
companies meet specified payment periods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr S A MENDHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with disappointment your editorial on the subject of late
payment of debt ('Venturing capital', August 31).
We all understand the reluctance to legislate but in order to achieve a
level playing field legislation is sometimes the only approach. The
enforceability of contracts is the cornerstone of an efficient market
economy. At present there is no effective redress against the customer who
chooses to pay late, typically by 30 or 40 days. The sums outstanding are
vast. We estimate them at Pounds 20bn - equivalent to small business
overdraft borrowing. This has a significant impact on the economy and
voluntary measures have not worked.
After all, it has to be remembered that David Trippier, the then small
business minister in 1986, said: 'If these voluntary measures do not help to
improve the late payment of the debt situation in this country, then we will
not shy away from legislation'. Eight years later we are being told the same
thing by Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary.
It has to be recognised that if legislation were introduced companies may
initially extend specified payment periods. However, in general this would
merely reflect existing actual payment periods. It is better to know when
you will be paid than leave it to the whim of recalcitrant customers.
Finally, the Forum of Private Business has been investigating this issue for
10 years. Our claim is that the vast majority of business owners will not be
aware of a statutory right to interest but payment periods will improve.

Sir, May I offer a simple solution to the signalmen's dispute (and indeed to
all such differences). Under pendulum arbitration, an arbitrator is
appointed whose task is to find for one side or another, but not to
negotiate any further compromise. It is incumbent therefore upon each side
to put forward their most reasonable claim, and one which they believe an
independent third party will favour.
This has the effect of bringing both sides quite close to each other, and
removing the issue of loss of face. I commend it to RMT and Railtrack.

Triangle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY WRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The blatant elitism portrayed by Michael Thompson-Noel ('The English
coast and its holidays from hell', August 27) is a perfect illustration of
the class prejudice which continues to inhibit economic growth in the UK.
His damning attack on English seaside resorts as 'clapped-out and working
class whose fate is to play host to the poorest and least sophisticated of
Britain's stay-at-home holidaymakers', is a slur on resorts and an insult to
a vast sector of society.
Far from being a fate, a resort such as Great Yarmouth prides itself in
providing a range of facilities, attractions, entertainments, heritage
appeal and surrounding countryside enjoyed by 2.6m visitors each year. We
all know there are changes in holiday patterns, but the more enlightened
resorts such as Great Yarmouth are responding to them and the seaside
remains the core of domestic tourism.
Perhaps when Mr Thompson-Noel is exploring his 'fave' Sarawak or sunning
himself on a beach in Penang he will spare a thought for those poor
unfortunates who cannot afford to join him and have to put up with their
version of the Far East on the Norfolk coast.
As our local newspaper, the Eastern Daily Press, put it, incredulous at the
tenor of the article, maybe next year dear Michael should try a sailing
holiday in the Bermuda Triangle]

FT  03 SEP 94 / Girls just wanna be number one: John Authers on why the
female of the species is top of the class in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North London Collegiate, the girls' school whose pupils this year scored
better in GCSE exams than any other independent school's, was once proud of
its cookery and needlework lessons. Not any more. Its old cookery room has
been converted for craft, design and technology.
The move highlights a transformation in the aspirations and confidence of
girls' schools. Not only are more girls studying traditional boys' subjects
 -they are beating them across the board. 'Girls overtook boys at GCSE level
(the main exams for 16-year-olds in England and Wales) a few years ago, and
it would not surprise me if they've now overtaken at A-level as well,' says
Mrs Joan Clanchy, headmistress at North London Collegiate.
The figures support her claim. League tables, which rank schools by exam
performance, have shown girls' schools persistently matching and even
beating better resourced boys' schools.
Complete figures for the state sector's performance in this year's public
exams will not be available until November. But yesterday's GCSE rankings
for independent schools showed girls' schools occupying 18 of the top 20
places. At North London Collegiate, 81.5 per cent of all the GCSEs taken
resulted in the top 'A' or 'A-star' grades.
Similarly, last week's A-level result league tables for independent schools
showed sharp improvements by girls' schools - notably boarding schools.
Malvern Girls' College rose to 13th, from an average over the past five
years of 42nd, while Roedean improved to 27th from 96th.
League table rankings such as these are helping girls' schools beat off
fresh competition for pupils from the many boys' schools that opened their
doors to girls in the 1980s.
Mrs Ann Longley, headmistress of Roedean, said: 'The facts show single-sex
girls' schools are doing an excellent job. Girls would not choose to stay if
they were not enjoying the single-sex environment and feeling fulfilled.'
Single-sex education is coming back into vogue and is even being
reintroduced in some schools. From this autumn, for example, Shenfield High,
a mixed school in Essex, is responding to parents' demands by teaching its
boys and girls in separate classes. Other state schools are considering
doing the same.
But this league table evidence may not be the vindication of single-sex
education for girls it at first seems to be. Girls appear to be doing better
whatever school they attend. Over the past decade, girls' examination
results have improved far faster than boys' at all levels of education from
the age of 16.
According to the Department for Education, in 1992, 45 per cent of girls
passed five GCSEs at grade C or above (equivalent to a pass in the old
O-level), while 38 per cent of boys reached the same standard. That suggests
girls' schools may do best in league tables simply because they have more
girls.
The disparity between the two sexes has been widening for the past decade.
The introduction of GCSEs in 1988, with a greater emphasis on coursework
than O-levels, may have benefited girls who, educationists agree, tend to be
more disciplined in their study than boys at the age of 16.
Mr Vivian Anthony, secretary of the Headmasters' Conference, which
represents the most prestigious boys and co-educational schools, says that
at GCSE level boys 'are much more likely than girls to decide they don't
care'.
A more profound reason for girls' growing success from 16 is that they have
become more ambitious in the past two decades about careers. Government
estimates suggest that 40.1 per cent of 18-year-old girls will attempt 'A'
levels next year, against about 33.6 per cent of boys. That represents a
wider disparity than in 1992, when the respective figures were 31 per cent
and 26 per cent; 10 years ago the equivalent figures were 22.3 per cent and
21.1 per cent.
More women are also going to university. Government figures this week showed
women accounted for 49.5 per cent of higher education graduates last year,
up from 43 per cent a decade ago.
Female graduates even tend to be more employable than men, with only 8.2 per
cent of them unemployed by the end of their year of graduation, against
12.25 per cent of men.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, education secretary, says the increase in the number
of women in higher education has helped 'ensure that the potential of over
half the population is fully realised'.
According to the Equal Opportunities Commission, the figures are indicative
of how women's aspirations and expectations of themselves at last equal
those of men.
Mrs Clanchy, of North London Collegiate, believes girls lack the complacency
of boys. Her experience is that boys with a GCSE in French will describe
themselves as 'fluent', while girls will say they have 'a little French'.
The rise of the female in Britain's schools has not, however, been uniform.
Science and technology continue to be perceived as feminine 'no-go areas'.
Women are outnumbered by five to one in university engineering and
technology courses, and by four to one in mathematics degrees.
Girls' schools, which used to reinforce gender stereotypes by teaching
cooking, now see their role as challenging them by encouraging girls to take
an interest in these 'masculine preserves'.
Mr Declan O'Neill, development director of Malvern Girls' College, says:
'There was a time when there was a stereotyped image of girls' boarding
schools as qualified finishing or art schools. I'm glad to say league tables
have disproved that. Now parents are most interested if they think their
daughter can do well in science.'

<TEXT>
Sir, Re your editorial ('England's local shambles', August 25), I feel some
issues need addressing to prevent your readers from being misled. As I
understand it, the Local Government Commission's brief was to devise
structures which were based on identifiable communities, cost-effectiveness
and what people want. Having kept a watchful eye over the debate and
developments affecting reorganisation in Cleveland, I feel there is no doubt
the commission has scored highly on all three counts.
Indeed, the commission's decision to abolish the two-tier system and replace
it with four districts will improve accountability, bring services closer to
the people and enable the real needs of our local communities to be better
met.
On cost, the commission has indicated that the move to single tier councils
in Cleveland will produce savings of between Pounds 6m and Pounds 11m a
year, assuming services are maintained at their existing levels. Based on
this calculation, reorganisation will pay for itself within three years.

FT  03 SEP 94 / The struggle to hold on to peace: The IRA's ceasefire
represents only the first stage on a perilous road to lasting stability in
Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps, after two and a half decades of stomach-churning attrition, this
week's IRA ceasefire means the people of Northern Ireland can start burying
their differences instead of their dead. Perhaps not.
Whichever direction Ulster takes from what the high command of the
provisional IRA calls an 'historic crossroads', it will be too late for Mr
Sean McDermott, the 37-year-old Catholic shot dead by loyalist gunmen just
12 hours before the midnight ceasefire began.
But, for the baby boy born to Lisa Stewart in Belfast's city hospital six
hours and six minutes into the peace, there is the chance of a life free of
the troubles which began the year his mother was born.
Whether the province is finally awakening from a 25-year nightmare, which by
last night had claimed 3,170 lives, or is preparing for something worse,
will now begin to unfold, fitfully and unpredictably, over the next weeks
and months.
The rows over the calculated decision of the IRA not to commit itself to the
'permanent' ceasefire demanded by London and Dublin and on the untimely
return to Ulster jails of four republican prisoners, which hinted at
secretly agreed concessions by London, will not be the last. They will
appear trifling compared with what lies ahead, and the leadership qualities
and goodwill of everyone involved will be severely tested.
The timing of a breakthrough delivered by the republican movement came as a
surprise after nearly nine months of private prevarication and public
point-scoring on the contents of last December's Downing Street declaration
 -London and Dublin's best shot at establishing an universally acceptable
blueprint for a lasting political settlement for Ulster.
Though the announcement came suddenly, the underlying shift in attitudes has
been more gradual.
Upbeat predictions had been made before in the land of false dawns, but this
time they reflected a perceptible change in attitudes within the community.
Under the leadership of Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein - the IRA's political arm
 -has been pursuing for seven years its own Irish peace initiative. Its
efforts - against a background of dwindling public support and a growing
recognition that consent, not coercion, was the only strategy supported in
both north and south - have been met from outside with contempt.
But Mr Adams has managed to cultivate within republican ranks a culture of
debate and the notion of political negotiation as an alternative to the
Armalite. The leadership of Sinn Fein and the IRA appear to understand that
the ability to kill has not brought much progress towards British withdrawal
and a united Ireland.
While there is no deviation from its ultimate objective of a 32-county Irish
republic, it is prepared to try an alternative route. According to Mr Adams:
'Irish nationalism has sufficient political confidence, weight and support
to bring about the changes essential for a just and lasting peace.'
While the IRA and Sinn Fein have made the running - manipulating and
sometimes winning the propaganda battle with London - the unionists have
seemed to be outflanked and at risk of being swept along by events.
Twenty years ago, hardliners in the Protestant community were able to
combine forces to bring down the newly established power-sharing executive,
demonstrating a unity and resolve which is no longer evident. Now, the broad
body of unionists face a stark choice.
They can try to wreck any new political initiatives to preserve a status quo
no longer acceptable in London, or they can help forge a compromise package
of political and constitutional change. Confronting them as they choose will
be a formidable coalition stretching from Washington to west Belfast.
Whatever happens Protestants intend to keep a tight grip on the rock which
guarantees Ulster a place in the United Kingdom for as long as the majority
wishes.
For Mr John Major, maintaining the unionists' trust will be of paramount
concern - hence reports of a prime minister 'livid' over the return to
Ulster of IRA prisoners. Hence, too the fact that it was Mr James Molyneaux,
the patient, profoundly sceptical leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, who
was first into Downing Street after the ceasefire announcement.
So far, Mr Molyneaux remains on board and behind a Downing Street
declaration he once dismissed as 'a dead Christmas tree'. And he will be
called on to try contain the loyalist paramilitary threat to further
progress. Yesterday, hopes were rising that, while further revenge attacks
by loyalist extremists cannot be ruled out, they might suspend violence if
reassured about Ulster's right to self-determination.
Mr Major, whose bold, joint initiative with Dublin has brought republicans
to the negotiating ante-room, will be less concerned about the continuing
self-exclusion from any future talks of the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic
Unionist Party. The hope is that, eventually, his still-potent voice will be
undermined by political momentum.
Provided the IRA ceasefire holds, Downing Street is unlikely to delay much
longer recognition that the IRA action is intended to be permanent. This
would mean that initial, exploratory contact between British government
officials and Sinn Fein could take place before Christmas.
Sinn Fein dialogue with the Dublin government will begin earlier, with Mr
Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, anxious to embrace northern republicans
in his proposed north-south Irish Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. The
forum could be operational by October.
Mr Adams, on a path perhaps even more dangerous than Mr Major's, will need
rapid evidence that the ceasefire is paying dividends to keep his supporters
behind him. The UK government is likely to oblige with an early end to the
broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein.
Equally important for British ministers will be success in their joint
efforts with the Irish government to piece together the pivotal framework
document on which political and constitutional progress can be based. The
document could be finalised next month, and will include a power-sharing
Ulster assembly and a number of cross-border institutions.
It will also incorporate changes to the Irish constitution, possibly
involving a referendum, renouncing Ireland's territorial claim on the north.
In return, Britain will amend the 1920 Government of Ireland Act which gives
Westminster 'supreme authority' over Northern Ireland. The gesture is seen
by Britain as largely symbolic, given subsequent legislation enshrining the
principle of majority consent for changes in Ulster's constitutional
position.
The format for planned bilateral exploratory talks between Sinn Fein and
British government officials is undecided. But secret discussions between
the two sides in 1993 envisaged exchanges involving three representatives
from each side.
These talks will enter totally uncharted waters and could easily expose the
obstacles that cause the peace process to come unstuck. Under the heading
'practical consequences of ending violence', will come the intensely emotive
and complex question of all-round demilitarisation, without which further
progress will be impossible.
Any hope of bringing all parties to round-table talks will stand or fall on
the removal of terrorist weaponry and the threat that it could be used
again. Sinn Fein and the IRA will be equally adamant in demanding a
comparable de-escalation of British military and security forces, including
a withdrawal of British troops initially to barracks and ultimately back to
the mainland.
The issue of IRA prisoners will prove as intractable. 'Our prisoners come
first and last. If they are not released, you can forget the whole thing,' a
senior republican source says. Downing Street has rejected a general
amnesty, and unionists intend to keep Mr Major to his word.
Only when the matters of weaponry and prisoners have been resolved can the
crucial constitutional issues be addressed in wider talks aimed at securing
a comprehensive, negotiated political settlement.
At their heart is the issue of self-determination and what Sinn Fein calls
the loyalist 'veto' over moves towards a united Ireland. The going here will
be no easier.
Republicans have now embraced the principle of unionist consent, but only in
the context of the right to self-determination of the Irish people as a
whole. In other words, Ulster can have its referendum but only the decision
of all the people of Ireland will count.
Mr Adams also insists that Britain has a responsibility to persuade
unionists that their best interests lie in 'the creation of an agreed and
stable Ireland'. Mr Major, however, will not join the persuaders or withdraw
safeguards for unionists. A shift on either could see him destroyed at the
hands of Westminster's Ulster unionists and unhappy Tory MPs.
The agenda for agreement looks impossibly daunting but then, until recently,
the prospect of any progress between two historically and diametrically
opposed forces appeared fanciful.
If the politicians have their doubts, an Ulster opinion poll yesterday
showed only 9 per cent of Protestants and 58 per cent of Catholics believe
the ceasefire will last.
Suspicions are held equally deeply on both sides; those of Ulster's
Protestant community who can contemplate negotiation with those they
consider mass murdererers do so only because the prize of peace is
desperately sought.
There are understandable suspicions that the IRA's gesture is a sham, and
that the organisation is only intent upon further destabilising the province
before returning to violence when it can justify a resumption.
Republicans believe they have cause to doubt the good intentions of a
British government they say has betrayed them too many times in the past and
which wants to trap them into a peace before replacing Ulster on the
political back-burner. The IRA and Sinn Fein know that the passage of time
would make any return to violence harder to justify and would lose them any
credit recently won from a relieved domestic and international community.
But, as the week ended, there was an unfamiliar, enjoyable peace along the
Shankill and up the Falls, across the Highfield estate to Andersonstown.
Republicans have a gaelic battle cry of Tiochfaidh ar la] - our time will
come - while hardline unionists shout 'No surrender]' The two sides remain
divided by a gulf of historic proportions but the overriding hope is that
the gap may just have started to close.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Division of labour day
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Out of 'votelessness', comes thoughtlessness. Unable to 'put people first'
in Congress, President Clinton would like to see the Federal Reserve take on
the mission instead. The lesson from this world recovery, however, is that
the central bankers who seem all but indifferent to the employment of their
fellow-citizens are best able to deliver the sustainable recovery which, in
the long run at least, is the surest way of producing it.
He ought to know better, but Mr Alan Blinder, the newest vice-president on
the Fed, recently backed up Mr Clinton's demands for more personable
monetary policy-making, by suggesting that the Fed should focus more on
employment growth for the next couple of years. The attractions for the
president are obvious. So far this year, the Fed has delivered on its
mandate rather more effectively than the White House: why not broaden it to
include more jobs, as well as stable prices?
There are (at least) two reasons why not. One practical difficulty, which
would face any central banker who adopted a more explicit employment target,
would be deciding what such a target might be. Today's complex mix of labour
market trends and broader economic conditions in the world's main industrial
economies give little clue as to what the best objective might be. The
second, more timeless, reason why an additional employment target should be
ruled out is that a multiplicity of aims, even if they could all be applied
in practice, has proved inconsistent with monetary policy success.
Mr Blinder's comments conflict with remarks by his chairman, Mr Alan
Greenspan, who last week warned that addressing monetary policy to the task
of reducing unemployment would bring only instability in financial markets.
At first glance, however, the US economic data released last week do add
weight to Mr Blinder's case.
Sustainable pace
The revised real growth rate in US gross domestic product in the second
quarter, at 3.8 per cent, was only 0.1 percentage points higher than
previously thought, a considerably smaller revision than many had expected.
Coupled with other subdued data, this adds to the impression that the five
interest rate increases since the beginning of the year may be slowing the
economy to a more sustainable pace. Given yesterday's news of an
unexpectedly small 179,000 increase in non-farm payrolls for August, less
dour observers than Mr Greenspan might argue that further monetary
tightening should be delayed.
Yet even Mr Blinder would not argue that a US unemployment rate of 6.1 per
cent provides much room for non-inflationary stimuli to job growth. The most
optimistic estimates of a rate of unemployment consistent with stable prices
would not be much lower than 5 1/2 per cent. This year's household survey
and labour department statistics have been sending contradictory signals on
employment. But the difficulties in deciphering the data merely suggest that
the Federal Reserve should avoid adjusting its interest rate policy in light
of short term employment trends.
German unemployment
The Bundesbank is certainly not one for doing so. This week's Council
meeting once again decided against lowering interest rates, despite the fact
that pan-German unemployment continues to rise. With official German
unemployment set to peak at about 10 per cent, the Bundesbank's
determination to maintain monetary restraint seems downright perverse to the
Americans. Yet Germany's economic recovery, though considerably younger than
that of the US, already seems rather more 'voteful' for Chancellor Kohl than
it has been for Mr Clinton.
The difference in the two leaders' positions can be traced to political
factors as well as economic ones. But a part of the spring in Mr Kohl's
step, as he enters the last stage of his campaign for re-election, can be
traced to the way the Bundesbank's tough stance on inflation has already
produced low long-term interest rates. These, in turn, have enabled the
German recovery to proceed more quickly than many had expected after such a
prolonged downturn. The signs are that GDP in the second quarter rose about
2.3 per cent from 1993, considerably higher than expected a few months ago.
Monetary policy can never be as finely tuned as many politicians would like.
Estimating the effect of a given change in direction, let alone the time lag
with which it operates, will always be a matter of educated surmise.
But the same uncertainty need not, and should not, apply to the declared
goals of its practitioners. Presidents have to juggle conflicting objectives
and satisfy multifarious constituencies. Central bankers, by contrast, are
best employed in sticking to the overriding objective of monetary stability.
To judge by his recent Congressional travails, Mr Clinton too would benefit
from showing a bit of single-mindedness. He should certainly resist the
temptation to pressure the Fed to imitate his own often excessive desire to
please.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Men in the News: Elderly boss keeps colleagues in place -
Dieter Bock and Tiny Rowland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever it is that Tiny Rowland takes to keep himself going at the age of
76, it does not come from Body Shop. This week he confronted an incipient
boardroom coup at Lonrho, the international conglomerate, and emerged
triumphantly unscathed, like some ageing tyrannosaurus crashing through the
corporate under-growth.
The lesser species who had sought to unseat him, including his fellow joint
chief executive Dieter Bock, were simply outmanoeuvred. Thus it ever was at
Lonrho, where the choice for Tiny's fellow directors has usually lain
between total subservience and total war. The middle ground has always, in
the end, turned out to be illusory.
The chief casus belli in this instance was the Pounds 5.5m a year that
Rowland is said to cost Lonrho in salary and expenses. Along with a basic
salary of Pounds 1.2m he receives numerous payments towards the cost of his
homes in Belgravia and Buckinghamshire, his domestic staff and even the
education fees of dependants of African politicians and business contacts.
There is much at stake, it seems, for the public school system in the
outcome of the Lonrho succession.
The most extraordinary feature of this latest twist in the Lonrho saga is
that it so closely resembles the earlier, notorious boardroom row in 1973.
That was when Edward Heath, the then prime minister, pronounced anathemas on
Rowland by referring to the unacceptable face of capitalism. There, too,
part of the argument turned on pay and expenses. And in a subtly managed
campaign Rowland routed the so-called 'straight eight' directors who were
seeking to throw him out.
Much water has passed under the bridge since then, but not a great deal
else. In the 20 years after the row turnover increased from Pounds 274m to
Pounds 3.9bn, while earnings per share ran the whole gamut from A to B, with
a rise from 6.0p to 6.4p. Last year finally saw alphabetic progress in the
shape of a jump to 15.1p, but this was levitation. Most of the money was
earned in discontinued operations which were shed to bolster Lonrho's cash
position. In real terms the share price languishes at around one-fifth of
the level it reached at its peak in the bull market of 1968.
The one thing that generated a consistent and rising cash flow for most of
that time was the dividend policy, which helps explain why Lonrho has always
lived on the edge of a never-ending cash crisis.
Nor was this at the urging of greedy institutional shareholders. The big
insurance companies and pension funds had boycotted Lonrho since 1973,
thereby ensuring that Rowland could tyrannise over the tiny stakes of
impotent small shareholders, who supported him for longer than anyone else
would have thought humanly possible. The chief beneficiary of these
over-generous payouts, until Bock arrived on the scene, was of course the
biggest shareholder: Rowland himself.
Another extraordinary feature of this week's events is the apparent belief
of some Lonrho directors that there is a civilised alternative to a damaging
row. In any company which was being damaged to the tune of Pounds 5.5m of
potentially controversial expenditure a year that premise would be
questionable.
At Lonrho, where all history indicates that the only way to remove Rowland
from the boardroom is with a crowbar, the notion is absurd. The fearsome
septuagenarian entrepreneur has too much at stake, starting with the annual
Pounds 5.5m and ending with an emotional attachment to Lonrho that is both
real and fierce.
What is needed for the task is the will - and indeed the skill, since no one
is more adept at removing other people's crowbars than Rowland. On the basis
of this week's form, Bock would appear to have been rather easily mugged.
Nor is it wholly clear that this German businessman is the right man to take
Lonrho forward.
Whoever runs Lonrho over the next year or two can hardly avoid doing well.
As a global ragbag of more than 600 businesses, which are mainly passive
hostages to economic cycles and fluctuating commodity prices, Lonrho is an
obvious beneficiary of the recovery that is spreading inexorably across the
world. With many of its operations in developing countries it can also
benefit, in its disposals programme, from the enthusiasm for emerging
markets.
Bock claims to be a sophisticated investor who has dealt successfully in
property and hotels. He should thus know how to shuffle the pack to good
advantage. Yet the key to a sustainable long-term strategy at Lonrho lies in
managing the assets rather than shuffling them.
Last year Lonrho's motor and equipment distribution business and its
manufacturing interests had a combined turnover of more than Pounds 900m
from which they extracted no profit at all.
More than Pounds 500m worth of hotel property generated pre-tax profits of
only Pounds 12m. In Britain, where turnover topped Pounds 700m, the pre-tax
profit was a mere Pounds 4m. This litany of under-performance could be
extended ad nauseam.
Bock's past does not suggest that he is the man to address that particular
gargantuan task. And from the point of view of outside investors he may
appear a mixed blessing in another sense. He maintains business interests
outside Lonrho which involve him in potential conflicts of interest. An
obvious case in point relates to property, where his participation in a big
City of London office development with Lord Palumbo is being undertaken
through his private interests. Yet Lonrho is no stranger to property.
No doubt the German could argue that the financial commitment would be
inappropriate for Lonrho in its present condition. But much of the taint
that has afflicted the company over the years, and which prompted the
original Department of Trade investigation into its affairs, goes back to
the potential conflict between Rowland's private and public interests. Once
again history appears to be repeating itself in an uncanny way.
Last October Rowland said of his adversary, in a characteristic outburst:
'I'm still waiting for some performance from him. So far he hasn't delivered
a stroke of business. Frankly, he hasn't a clue.' Maybe or maybe not. But
Bock does have more than 18 per cent of the capital of Lonrho, together with
a right to acquire most of the remaining 6 per cent or so owned by Rowland.
Meantime two long-standing Rowland supporters on the board, chairman Rene
Leclezio and deputy chairman Robert Dunlop, are due to retire.
This suggests that Bock will in due course feel able to rise to the
challenge. But before he takes a new crowbar to the greatest carnivore in
British business he would do well to prepare the ground with more care.
An excellent precautionary move would be to feed the vegetarians in the
Lonrho boardroom with a steady diet of good red meat. In the country of the
bland, even a 76-year-old tyrannosaurus stays king.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Fishermen turn ones that got away into profit: New markets
are allowing fleets to expand their capacity despite government efforts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This summer's 'tuna wars' in the Bay of Biscay have left an impression of a
struggling British fishing fleet being forced to fight for new markets to
stay afloat.
The Royal Navy's arrest yesterday of a British-owned but Spanish-based
trawler suspected of exceeding its quota was the latest skirmish in an
increasingly bitter battle.
Declining fish stocks and tight quotas imposed under the European Union's
Common Fisheries Policy have restricted supplies in traditional waters and
driven fishermen to new species in hostile territory.
But the image of an industry in terminal decline is far from representative
of the UK fleet. Fleet capacity has grown by 1 per cent to 2 per cent a year
in two years, and fishermen in some regions are benefiting from lucrative
new markets.
When the government launched a Pounds 25m three-year decommissioning
programme last year it attracted most interest from north-east and
north-west England and northern Ireland. An official said: 'That's probably
a good indicator of where the industry is really being squeezed.'
Higher bids for grants, which the government rejected, came mainly from
Scotland and south-west England. These more buoyant fleets are exploiting
new outlets in continental Europe.
Spanish fishermen may be objects of hate in Cornish fishing villages, but
the Spanish taste for monkfish and megrim, a flatfish, has proved a godsend
for Scottish fishermen in the past few years. Mr Ian MacSween, chief
executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Organisation, a body which promotes
the interests of the fishing community, said fishermen off the west coast of
Scotland would have been 'wiped out' if they had to rely on traditional
catches.
Monkfish used to be thrown back, or turned into scampi. 'Now the monkfish
are worth more than the scampi.'
The tuna caught in the Bay of Biscay go mainly to France and Spain. Mr
MacSween believes the real cause of Spanish resentment at Cornish boats is
that they are catching tuna for sale in Spain and undermining prices because
the Spanish drift nets mark the fish and reduce their value.
Scotland is Europe's biggest producer of langoustine, yet they are caught
for export and most Britons are unaware of the delicacy on their doorstep.
These new markets have enabled the best-placed fishermen to invest in more
powerful boats and tackle, which they need to exploit more distant waters.
Financial imperative then drives them harder. A new boat can cost as much as
Pounds 300,000 and weekly running costs are Pounds 1,000 or more.
But technological advances in fishing also threaten the stocks the fishermen
depend on. Mr MacSween said: 'We're getting better at catching the fish, but
they're not getting more efficient at breeding.'
The fleet's staying power is causing problems for the government, which
seems unlikely to be able to keep its pledge to cut fleet capacity by nearly
a fifth by the end of 1996 as part of a European Union drive to conserve
fish.
Part of the problem is that quotas are broken. Officials say there are not
enough fish to provide a decent living for the UK's 10,000 vessels. But
estimates of the number of so-called 'black' fish - caught over and above
quota - range as high as 50 per cent of the legitimate catch.
In a further blow to its efforts, the government was forced to suspend its
controversial plan to limit days at sea after a High Court challenge by
fishermen last year. That leaves it having to mop up capacity through
tighter licensing of vessels, decommissioning and the possible introduction
of bigger mesh sizes and closed fishing zones, to allow immature or breeding
fish to escape capture.
Officials say the trend towards increased capacity appears to be reversing,
but they admit that the fleet remains obstinately resistant to
restructuring.
There has been little concentration of ownership in the past decade and the
number of vessels has remained fairly constant, with most still owned and
run by individuals.
Mr MacSween believes market forces will fail to drive fishermen out of the
industry, in spite of overcapacity.
'As long as you're getting a marginal return on your investment, it's better
to keep going than to scrap your boat,' he said. 'There's no demand for a
redundant fishing vessel.'

FT  03 SEP 94 / Ferry ban 'may cost farmers Pounds 200m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British farmers could face lost sales of up to Pounds 200m a year as ferry
companies impose a ban on carrying live animals destined for slaughter to
the Continent, according to Mr Richard Beale, chairman of the Association of
Livestock Exporters.
He said: 'If the trade doesn't continue, we really are in a terrible
pickle.'
A ban by Stena Sealink on live animal exports came into force on Thursday.
Brittany Ferries had already said it would stop transporting animals to
Continental slaughter houses and Peninsular and Oriental said it would
impose a ban on October 1. There is no alternative to shipping - livestock
is banned from the Channel tunnel.
Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, will hold urgent
talks with the ferry companies on Monday to try to avert the ban. The
livestock industry is negotiating a new code of practice for transporting
animals, and farmers hope that will defuse the situation.
The effects of the ferry companies' action are already being felt in the
livestock markets. Mr John Astley, a sheep farmer on Anglesey in north
Wales, said he tried to sell 50 lambs yesterday in his local market of
Gaerwen, but could only sell 30. He said: 'It's the first time in the season
when I've found no buyers.'
September and October are the peak sales months for many hill and marginal
farmers, who sell their lambs for further fattening before they are
slaughtered.
About 20 per cent of these lambs, or 20m sheep a year, would usually be
exported live to France and Spain. But public complaints about the way
animals are treated en route have led to the ferry companies's curbs.
Mr Tim Bennett, a Welsh farmer who chairs the hill farmers' committee at the
NFU, said: 'This has come at the worst possible time of year. If farmers
lose their ability to move large numbers of stock now it will have a
considerable effect on the domestic market price.'
Mr Astley said that prices at his local market had already fallen 15p a
kilogramme to 80p for lambs. 'That's getting to a serious level, below that
it doesn't really pay to market the lambs,' he said.
Farmers are trying to develop trade in animal carcasses to compensate for
live animal deliveries, but French consumers are keen to buy fresh meat
slaughtered locally. British farmers fear that if they are prevented from
filling orders animals from eastern European or elsewhere will fill the gap.
Sir David urged caution on farmers who threatened to blockade ferry ports.
He said: 'Confrontational action of this sort will only alienate public
support.'

FT  03 SEP 94 / Fall in house price index points to fragile recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
House prices fell 0.7 per cent last month, figures published yesterday by
Halifax Building Society show, emphasising the fragile nature of the housing
market recovery.
The monthly fall means that prices have fallen 0.3 per cent in the previous
12 months, the country's biggest mortgage lender said. Prices had remained
broadly stable since the end of last year and small monthly falls and rises
were to be expected in the current market, it added.
New house prices, in contrast to overall figures, rose by 2.2 per cent last
month compared with July and by 2.6 per cent in the previous 12 months.
Halifax said: 'Any further speculation about rises in interest rates in the
coming months could have damaging consequences for what is already a very
fragile housing market.'
The general weakness in the housing market was also reflected in lower than
expected levels of mortgage lending and numbers of house purchases.
Nationwide, the country's second-largest building society, reported on
Thursday that prices rose 0.6 per cent last month compared with July, taking
the year-on-year increase to 2.6 per cent, only slightly ahead of general
inflation.
The societies agree that the confidence of potential purchasers remains
weak. The Halifax house prices are seasonally adjusted, unlike Nationwide's
survey. Halifax also uses a larger sample of mortgage loans.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Senior Tory MP quits political consultancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee and a member
of the Commons committee investigating the so-called 'cash-for-questions'
affair, is stepping down from the board of one of Britain's leading
political consultancies.
He is one of four MPs who will cease to be directors of Westminster
Communications this month.
The other three are Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, Mr Menzies
Campbell, Liberal Democrat foreign affairs and defence spokesman, and Sir
Keith Speed, Conservative MP for Ashford.
The four will also sever their financial links with the company. It is
understood that Mr Campbell has been paid Pounds 5,000 a year for his
services.
The move is significant because it comes when the outside interests which
many MPs use to supplement their salaries are coming under increasing
scrutiny amid calls for a fundamental reassessment.
Many expect one result of the current probe will be to make it harder for
MPs to serve as directors or consultants of professional lobbying companies
and public affairs consultancies. The move by the four MPs will reinforce
such expectations.
If the committee did decide to recommend such a move it could have a serious
effect on the overall earnings of some MPs, who continue to act as directors
or consultants to PR and lobbying companies.
In January, when the latest register of MPs' interests was published, these
included Mr Michael Jopling, the former agriculture minister, Sir Peter Fry,
the Tory MP for Wellingborough, Dame Angela Rumbold, former Home Office
minister, and Mr Paul Tyler, Liberal Democrat MP for Cornwall North.
The departure as directors of the four MPs has been necessitated by an
application by Westminster Communications to join the Association of
Professional Political Consultants.
The APPC does not allow members to 'place themselves in a position of
potential conflict of interest' by appointing any MP to their board or by
paying 'any retainer or commission to an MP'.
Mr Andrew Gifford, chairman of the association, said last month he thought
it was 'difficult to see how you could very easily have MPs on the board or
retained and not have some perceived conflict of interest'.
Sir Marcus, who lists seven directorships and three consultancies in the
current register, was selected in July by Labour leftwingers as a token
target in their failed attempt to ensure that the privileges committee
inquiry was conducted solely by MPs with no outside interests.
The inquiry was triggered by the action of two Conservative MPs - Mr Graham
Riddick and Mr David Tredinnick - in agreeing to accept payments of Pounds
1,000 to table parliamentary questions.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Pounds 72,000 awarded to RSI sufferer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An industrial radiographer who suffered repetitive strain injury as a result
of his work has been awarded Pounds 72,000 by the Court of Session in
Edinburgh in the second highest compensation pay-ment to a sufferer in the
UK.
Mr Victor Hunter, 48, of Bridge of Weir, Renfrewshire, sustained the injury
while helping to check castings. His job with Clyde Shaw, a steelmaker of
Motherwell, near Glasgow, which is now in liquidation, involved making
repeated adjustments to a turntable carrying heavy metal components while
they were X-rayed.
Mr Frank Maguire, of solicitors Robin Thompson and Partners who handled the
case, said yesterday's judgment made it clear Mr Hunter's injuries were
caused by the excessive, repeated force of movements he had to make in the
course of his work. The defence claim that his condition was not
work-related was rejected.
Mr Hunter said his pain started with a 'small niggle in my elbows' which
grew progressively more severe and led to his absence from work for six
months. He started his legal battle, backed by the MSF technical union,
three years ago when the company made him redundant.
The case is one of several which have recently placed RSI squarely in the
category of industrial injury after an English High Court case less than a
year ago cast doubt on the condition. In rejecting a claim at the time,
Judge John Prosser said RSI was 'meaningless and had no place in medical
books'.
Since then a number of cases have contradicted that ruling and employers
appear increasingly to be seeking to settle claims out of court.
The highest UK RSI award was Pounds 79,000 to an Inland Revenue typist in
January.

FT  03 SEP 94 / RPI statistics go private
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first private-sector contract for the collection of official government
statistics was awarded yesterday.
Research International, the UK's fourth-largest market research group, has
won a five-year contract to collect data for the retail prices index, the
Central Statistical Office announced.
The collection, processing and validation of about 140,000 prices a month in
180 areas throughout the country was previously performed by the Department
of Employment. The CSO will continue to put the data together for government
and public use.
The CSO said yesterday: 'More rigorous statistical sampling techniques will
be used to make the selection of both retail outlets and items more
representative of how the public spend their money.'
More random regional sampling would be incorporated into the series, along
with a broader range of shops, the CSO said. Data collectors would use
hand-held computers to collect the data, in place of the traditional
clip-boards.
If trials prove satisfactory, Research International's first data will be
for February next year.
Earlier this year the contract for the publication and marketing of
government statistics was awarded to the private-sector market research
group Taylor Nelson AG.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Manx ministry shake-up urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Isle of Man government said in a report yesterday that responsibility
for financial services should be split off from its treasury into a new
department, and the island's industry and tourism departments should be
merged in a new trade and industry department.
The financial sector is the largest contributor to the island's economy, but
the government does not have a department responsible solely for its
affairs.
The report on economic strategy, compiled by the Central Economic Strategy
Unit under the chairmanship of Mr Terry Groves, a member of the House of
Keys - the lower of the island's two parliamentary chambers - produced 71
recommendations. They included setting up a companies division in the
island's High Court and appointing an experienced deemster (judge) for it.
The island, a self-governing Crown dependency of the UK, is financially
self-sufficient and, under its agreement with the UK, cannot go into budget
deficit.
Financial services and associated businesses and professions produce more
than a third of the island's income. There has been dissatisfaction in the
industry over the lack of government resources devoted to the sector.
The industry deals with the Manx government through the island's treasury
and regulatory bodies, which are supervised by the treasury.
The report proposes the establishment of an economic development committee
comprising ministers from the four revenue-raising departments: treasury,
financial services, agriculture and trade and industry.
Mr Miles Walker, the island's chief minister, said yesterday that the
government had already formed the committee. He said restructuring to create
new departments would take about two years.
The report was the first commissioned by the island's government to include
extensive private-sector involvement. Its recommendations include:
Negotiating double taxation agreements for the growing ship management
industry.
Negotiating bilateral agreements with European Union states for the sale of
Manx financial products.
Enacting clearer trust legislation.
Enhancing and focusing government marketing strategies.
Enacting more legislation in the island, rather than taking legislation
directly from the UK. Priority would be given to commercial legislation.
Examining ways to ensure better use of the workforce, such as retraining,
provision of childcare and incentives for businesses providing home work
schemes.
On residency the report says: 'It is not possible that growth and
development of the economy could be achieved without an increased labour
force and therefore a higher population level. But the ultimate objective is
for maximum national income at the minimum level of population.'
It recommended replacing the existing work permit system with identity
cards, which would be issued to residents who fulfil criteria - such as
long-term residence, birthright and key-worker status - which would be
varied according to the island's needs.

AA Insurance yesterday announced the closure of its processing office in
Cheadle, Cheshire, with the loss of up to 550 jobs. The work is being
transferred to Newcastle and Cardiff.
Mr Sean Keating, national secretary of the GMB general union, said: 'This
will be a devastating blow but we hope that some of the staff might be
redeployed.' He said that insurance industry restructuring driven by the
growth of direct sales was the reason for the redundancies.
The company, a subsidiary of the Automobile Association, said that a
reassessment of its work had been announced in May to ensure that the
company retained its position as the 'premier personal-lines intermediary in
the UK'.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Rail workers call more strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three more days of rail signal workers' strikes were called yesterday as
their union leaders reacted angrily to reports of Railtrack plans to sack
workers, David Goodhart writes.
The RMT transport union said a 48-hour stoppage would cover the whole of
Tuesday and Wednesday September 14 and 15 and a 24-hour strike the whole of
Friday September 23. They will follow a 24-hour strike called for next
Thursday.
Mr David Armstrong, human resources director of Railtrack, said he was
appalled at the announcement of more stoppages. He said: 'Every striker has
lost over Pounds 1,000. Railtrack's losses stand at over Pounds 100m. And
for what? The RMT would rather indulge in a futile show of strength than
negotiate a package that has been on the table since June 28 and would
benefit every signal worker.'
Reports of the Railtrack plan to dismiss striking workers and offer them new
contracts drew an angry response from Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary.
He insisted that a Railtrack policy of hoping to scare people back to work
was 'doomed to failure'.
He said: 'Railtrack should abandon their macho management stance and get
back to genuine negotiations on RMT's claim. That is the only way this
dispute is going to be resolved.'
Railtrack said more than 53 per cent of trains ran during this week's
48-hour strike, the highest number so far.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Years of debate fuel compromise: Tim Coone on Sinn Fein
negotiation and the development of its 'unarmed strategy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA's decision this week to call an end to its 25-year military campaign
comes after well over three years' intense debate in the republican movement
about how its aims might be achieved by an 'unarmed strategy'.
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, was given responsibility for
developing that strategy in a resolution passed at its 1991 party
conference.
While developing its strategy it has been overhauling its party structure
and organisation. It has reorganised in the Irish Republic on a constituency
basis rather than a county one - it was already organised on a constituency
basis in the north.
In the north it has performed strongly since losing its one parliamentary
seat - Belfast West - in the 1992 general election. In May's local elections
it took 23.2 per cent of the vote in Belfast, the biggest share for any
party. Across the province its vote rose 1.5 percentage points to 12.5 per
cent, taking 51 council seats out of the 582 total.
In the European elections its support in Northern Ireland advanced by 1
percentage point to 10 per cent.
In the June local elections in the republic this year Sinn Fein won a series
of council seats in areas it had not contested before, finishing ahead of
the conservative Progressive Democrats party.
The discussion document of the party's national executive - Towards a
Lasting Peace in Ireland - unveiled at the 1992 annual conference, said a
permanent peace 'must involve at some future date the removal of British
interference from the political equation in Ireland. There is an onus on
those who proclaim that the armed struggle is counter-productive to advance
a credible alternative. The development of such an alternative would be
welcomed by Sinn Fein'.
Since the launch of the document it would appear that alternative has
emerged to the satisfaction of the republican leadership, in spite of the
fact that the British government has not made the ending of partition a
policy goal, as the document argued it must.
That fact is perhaps the most significant and surprising in the IRA
ceasefire decision, and indicative of the distance its has gone in
reassessing the value of continuing the 'armed struggle'.
Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, emphasised at a press conference in
Dublin yesterday that the party's goal remained 'an end to British
jurisdiction in Ireland and an end to partition'. But this should be
achieved through negotiation and lead to an agreement 'which recognises and
encourages the diversity of Irish people and which will earn their
allegiance and respect'.
Significantly, he said: 'That is how we would like to see the situation
develop. Others may have different agendas and views. How it is concluded is
a matter for agreement.'
He emphasised that agreement would not be achieved without unionist
participation in discussions.
In effect, the IRA and Sinn Fein have acknowledged publicly that
continuation of the military struggle is not the way forward, and that an
all-inclusive negotiation process involving compromise might lead to
something less than a united Ireland.
Mr Adams yesterday laid out what he saw as the next steps in the process:
The UK should lift the Sinn Fein broadcasting ban, as the Republic of
Ireland did eight months ago.
A monitoring procedure for the ceasefire should be established.
The demilitarisation process should start immediately.
Full protection should be provided for republicans who have been targeted by
loyalists.
All republican prisoners in the UK should be transferred to their home
regions.
Raids, searches and arrests in nationalist areas should stop.
Closed border roads should be opened.
'Political' prisoners should be released - Mr Adams said this included both
republican and loyalist prisoners 'and the small handful of British Army and
RUC prisoners' who have been charged with offences. He said this 'might take
time'.
Dublin plans to set up its Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which will
involve Sinn Fein, by the end of October. A meeting between Mr Albert
Reynolds, the Irish prime minister and Mr Adams is likely in the next two
weeks.
Mr Tom Hartley, Sinn Fein's general secretary said: 'The ceasefire has
created a great momentum. I envisage a series of developments resulting from
that. This could take as much as one, maybe two years. Each one of those may
create a crisis but they will be dealt with and we will move on.'

FT  03 SEP 94 / Archer named in client details for Anglia share deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stockbroking account set up by Lord Archer for dealing in Anglia
Television shares days before the takeover bid from MAI contained his own
name as part of the client reference details.
The former Conservative party deputy chairman told Department of Trade and
Industry inspectors investigating allegations of insider dealing that he
placed the share orders on behalf of a Mr Broosk Saib.
It emerged yesterday that the account used by Lord Archer at brokers Charles
Stanley for dealing in the Anglia shares was set up in the name of 'B Saib
Esq, c/o J Archer, Alembic House'. Lord Archer has a penthouse in Alembic
House.
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's spokesman on the City, said this disclosure
reinforced his party's case that the DTI should publish the report into
alleged insider trading, so that the public could judge what really
happened. At the end of July Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, decided not to take any further action against Lord Archer
The DTI investigation focused on two orders placed by Lord Archer for the
purchase of 50,000 shares in Anglia, whose directors include his wife Lady
Archer. The first was placed on January 13, the day after Anglia's board had
been given details of the price MAI was prepared to pay for the television
company's shares in a takeover bid.
At around 10am, Lord Archer called Mr Simon Wharmby at Charles Stanley. He
had never before dealt through Charles Stanley but had used Mr Wharmby's
services at his previous stockbroking firms.
He asked Mr Wharmby about the availability of Anglia shares. Mr Wharmby
found out that a parcel of 80,000 shares was available.
Lord Archer said that the price being asked was too great, and placed an
order to purchase 25,000 shares at around 486p. Mr Wharmby then spoke again
to Charles Stanley's dealers, who clinched a deal with a market marker, or
wholesaler of shares.
According to Stock Exchange records, the deal was done at 10.25am. Mr
Wharmby then telephoned Lord Archer and told him the deal had been
completed.
He had assumed that Lord Archer was dealing for himself. However, Lord
Archer said the shares should be booked in the name of Mr Saib.
Lord Archer also told Mr Wharmby he would be interested in buying more
shares if they became available at a similar price. As a result, the
following day Mr Wharmby telephoned him and offered him a second parcel of
25,000 shares, which Lord Archer agreed to buy, again on behalf of Mr Saib.
The deal was done at 2pm.
Both deals were completed in such a way that they counted as falling into
the next trading account, which meant no money had to change hands at that
stage. The following Tuesday, January 18, MAI announced its Pounds 292m
takeover bid very early in the morning.
At 10am, after the share price had soared by about 160p, Lord Archer
telephoned Mr Wharmby and sold the shares, netting a profit after commission
of just over Pounds 77,000.
An 'account payee only' cheque for this amount, made out to Mr Saib, was
sent on February 4 to Lord Archer's London address.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Part-time ruling yields first pay-offs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nine former cleaners at Imperial Chemical Industries' plant at Wilton on
Teesside yesterday became the first beneficiaries of a House of Lords ruling
that part-time workers are eligible for redundancy pay on the same basis as
full-time employees.
The women, who lost their jobs last November, learnt yesterday that their
claim for redundancy pay two months ago had been successful. It is believed
to be the first claim of its kind since the Lords decision in March.
The women, members of the TGWU general union, were employed by Initial
Contract Services.
The industrial tribunal at Newcastle upon Tyne ruled that workers should be
paid redundancy money on a retrospective basis as the UK domestic law was
not in line with European Union legislation.
Mr Tim Bush, TGWU district officer, said: 'We have proved the principle that
part-time workers made redundant, who have completed more than two years'
employment with a company before the House of Lords decision, can claim
retrospective redundancy payments.'
Before the Lords' decision part-time workers had to work for five years
before enjoying the rights gained by full-time employees after two years.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Independent girls' schools dominate GCSE results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Girls' schools dominate this year's performance in GCSE examinations by
independent schools.
When schools were ranked by the proportion of GCSEs - the main examinations
for 16-year-olds in England and Wales - resulting in a pass at grades A to C
(equivalent to an old O-level pass), 18 of the top 20 schools were for girls
only. When ranked according to their proportion of A-grades, girls' schools
were similarly dominant, accounting for 17 of the top 20.
A total of 47.7 per cent of entries in girls' schools scored an A grade,
compared with 39.6 per cent for independent schools as a whole.
They enjoyed even greater success in the starred-A grade, introduced this
year to recognise outstanding achievement. It was awarded to 2.9 per cent of
all GCSE entries nationally, including the state sector, but to 9.9 per cent
of entries from independent schools. At Withington Girls' School in
Manchester 44.5 per cent of GCSEs entered resulted in a starred-A.
Mrs Margaret Kenyon, headmistress of Withington Girls' and president of the
Girls' Schools Association, said: 'Girls flourish in girls' schools.'
Overall, the disparity between GCSE performance in independent and
state-sector schools appears to have widened since last year. In private
schools, according to figures provided by the Independent Schools
Information Service (Isis), 39.6 per cent of entries were graded A or
better, up from 37.8 per cent last year. The figure for all schools is 13.2
per cent, up from 12.7 per cent last year.
Independent school pupils enjoyed more success in gaining at least a
C-grade, with 89.4 per cent of entries achieving this level, compared with
53.1 per cent for the nation as a whole. Isis also revealed that candidates
had taken an average of 9.1 subjects each, rebutting allegations that
schools were stopping pupils from entering in their weaker subjects to boost
their league table standings.
Mr Vivian Anthony, secretary of the Headmasters' Conference, which
represents the most prestigious independent boys' and mixed schools, said
the results showed girls performed much better academically than boys at 16.
He suggested, however, that the figures did not prove that girls performed
better in a single-sex environment. He pointed out that boys' performance
was roughly equal to that of girls at A-level, which most pupils in the
independent sector regard as more important than GCSEs because they are used
to determine university places.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Adams set to meet Irish PM: Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE, DAVID OWEN and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'It is a total anathema to us that anyone would consider taking any sort of
retaliation for the deeds of a few people within the unionist community'
Martin McGuinness Sinn Fein executive member
Sinn Fein may be poised to take another big step towards recognition as a
fully legitimate democratic party with a meeting between Mr Gerry Adams and
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, within two weeks, Dublin
officials indicated last night.
Word of the meeting - which would be the first ever between a Provisional
Sinn Fein leader and an Irish premier - came as Mr Adams extended his list
of demands by calling in Dublin for the withdrawal of British troops from
nationalist areas.
In Washington senior members of the US Congress warned that no extra money
was likely to be available this year to help smooth the way to peace in
Northern Ireland.
But Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said after a meeting with
President Bill Clinton in the holiday resort of Martha's Vineyard that he
hoped 'substantial' sums would be forthcoming.
As Downing Street continued to voice doubts about the permanency of the IRA
ceasefire, republican leaders rejected the possibility of a violent reaction
to the killing by loyalist paramilitaries of a Roman Catholic man on
Thursday.
Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's governing executive, said it
was 'a total anathema to us that anyone would consider taking any sort of
retaliation for the deeds of a few people within the unionist community'.
Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, responded to Thursday's
loyalist attacks by pledging that the government would 'continue to pursue
those who commit crimes of this sort'.
Mr Reynolds met yesterday with Mr John Alderdice, leader of the
non-sectarian Alliance party, to discuss the setting up of the Irish
government's Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which is intended to
include Sinn Fein for the first time in round-table talks with other
political parties.
Dublin hopes to establish the forum - which unionist parties are expected to
boycott - before the end of October.
Officials said Mr Reynolds would be anxious to 'get things moving' before
departing on a visit to Australia in two weeks' time. They said a meeting
with Mr Adams was 'inevitable' before he leaves.
In the US, Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate appropriations
committee which controls overseas aid, said money to smooth the peace
process was already in the pipeline for next year, in the form of the US's
Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.3m) contribution to the International Fund for
Ireland.
Mr Clinton said the US was 'prepared to take some steps to do whatever we
can to help'.
In London, Downing Street said Mr John Major would study the report he had
demanded into the transfer on Thursday of four republican prisoners from the
mainland to jails in Northern Ireland over the weekend.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Pro-unionist MPs flex their muscles: Tory right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the moment they are mainly content to keep a watchful and suspicious eye
on the progress of the UK-Irish peace initiative. But if events turn sour -
as many of them fear they will - their misgivings could burst damagingly
into the open.
The large pro-unionist contingent in Conservative ranks will continue to
exert a strong influence over Mr John Major in the aftermath of this week's
open-ended IRA ceasefire.
The need to ensure their tacit acceptance of the direction of government
policy will be among the main factors shaping the prime minister's words and
deeds in coming weeks.
One area in which the views of the pro-unionist grouping could quickly
influence the government's strategy is the vexed issue of whether the IRA
ceasefire is permanent.
Mr Jim Cran, Tory MP for Beverley, yesterday urged the government to take a
hard line, saying ministers should insist that Sinn Fein uses the phrase 'a
permanent renunciation of violence' in its amplifications of the IRA
statement. 'All we have . . . is a sort of armistice,' Mr Cran added.
In practice most Conservatives would probably fall into line once Mr James
Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, let it be known that he was
satisfied that the cessation of IRA violence was for good.
Many pro-unionists still hold profound reservations about the prospect of
government officials holding bilateral talks with Sinn Fein representatives.
Earlier this week Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, said in a
pamphlet written before the ceasefire that the country 'should be spared the
sight of ministers of the Crown or their representatives sitting around the
same table as men who until three months before were bombing our fellow
countrymen'.
Mr Lamont is expected to return to the subject of Ulster in a newspaper
article this weekend.
Ms Lisl Biggs-Davison, trustee of the Friends of the Union under whose
imprimatur Mr Lamont's pamphlet appeared, said she would be 'terribly
reluctant' for the government to talk with Sinn Fein. 'I want to know what
will happen to the people who have carried out those terrible crimes,' she
said.
If pro-unionists do decide to make public their reservations about the
course of events, next month's Conservative party conference will provide
the perfect opportunity.
Not only is there a debate on Northern Ireland, but a series of events is
planned on the conference fringe. One pro-unionist said this week that
Northern Ireland was destined to be 'the big issue in Bournemouth'.
The expectation among most Tories is that unless the peace initiative goes
badly off the rails Mr Major and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland
secretary, are set to be applauded to the rafters for trying to end the
violence.
But the strength of the Tory pro-unionist faction should not be
underestimated.
The backbench Northern Ireland committee is firmly in pro-unionist hands,
under the low-key but effective chairmanship of Mr Andrew Hunter, the MP for
Basingstoke.
Its influence in cabinet has also increased markedly with the promotion of
Viscount Cranborne, leader of the Lords, and Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief
Treasury secretary, in the recent reshuffle.

FT  03 SEP 94 / 'Peace bond' plan urged to boost aid: New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Hevesi, comptroller (treasurer) of New York city, has called for an
issue of 'peace bonds' to be launched in the US to help support Northern
Ireland's economic development once peace is established in the province.
Repeating statements he made in Northern Ireland early in July, Mr Hevesi
said Irish Americans would be willing buyers of such bonds, just as Jewish
Americans have bought substantial amounts of Israeli bonds.
'A constructive peace process will have a major effect on investment in
Ireland, north and south,' he said.
The comptroller has used his position as a custodian of New York's
public-employee retirement fund to justify his statements on Irish affairs.
The fund has Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) invested in companies which have
business interests in Northern Ireland.
Mr Hevesi said he wanted to encourage these companies to adopt employment
practices worldwide which reflected the so-called McBride Principles adopted
by New York. These are designed to give minorities improved access to jobs.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Court ruling exposes Taiwan's financial flaws: Executives at
Tatung found guilty of running an illegal deposit scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KAOHSIUNG, TAIWAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senior executives at Tatung, a leading listed Taiwanese electronics company,
are to appeal against a court ruling which found them guilty of violating
domestic banking laws by taking deposits to finance expansion, writes Laura
Tyson in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.
The company's chairman, Mr Lin Ting-sheng, and its finance manager, Mr Liu
Hong-tsai, are unhappy with the verdict in a case that reveals both the
shortcomings of Taiwan's state-dominated banking system and the country's
historically less-than-rigid enforcement and observance of law.
A Taipei district court on Thursday handed down suspended 16-month prison
sentences to the two executives for running an illegal deposit scheme
through the company. According to 1989 revisions to the Banking Law,
non-bank entities are not permitted to take deposits, undertake trustee
business or offer remittance services. The law stipulates a jail sentence of
between one and seven years.
The two executives, who were charged last December following a three-year
investigation, were convicted of illegally accepting deposits from company
employees, shareholders and nearby residents. Tatung has collected nearly
Dollars 400m (Pounds 258m) since 1957.
Observers said the verdict was intended to 'kill the chicken to warn the
monkey' - that is, to send a strong signal to Taiwan companies regarding a
practice that is widespread and has been largely tolerated by the
authorities.
Taiwan's Central Bank of China even includes in its regularly published
statistics charts showing prevailing interest rates on loans and deposits in
the 'unorganised financial markets'.
'Tatung was singled out not because it's the only company which does this,
but because it was so brazen,' one observer said. 'Most companies just take
deposits from their employees; this is commonly seen as a type of staff
benefit. But Tatung was accepting deposits from the public as well, and
everybody knew they were doing this.'
Mr Lin and Mr Liu contend that they were forced to seek financing from
deposits because the company could not raise enough money from banks to
satisfy its plans for expansion. Taiwan banks generally lend only on the
basis of full collateral, partly because individual loan officers may be
held personally liable in the event of non-payment.
They also plan to argue in their defence that the scheme offered a return
which was fair for both the company and the depositors. While employee
deposit schemes often yield 2 per cent per month, Tatung offered an average
annual interest rate of 8.5 per cent.
Moreover, all of the 13,000-odd depositors participated in the scheme on a
voluntary basis, they said. Interest payments amounted to some NTDollars 2bn
(Pounds 49.4m) a year.
Taiwan's underground financial markets have diminished in scale since their
heyday following a crackdown in the late 1980s, but in-formal financing
schemes and various other murky related activities remain.
In the 1980s, dozens of underground finance companies sprang up and
attracted deposits by offering interest rates as high as 8 per cent a month.
The biggest underground bank, the Hung Yuan group, declared bankruptcy in
1991 after illegally attracting some Dollars 3.6bn from depositors.
Tatung's share price closed at NTDollars 86.5 yesterday against NTDollars 88
on Thursday.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Japanese surplus 'nearing peak'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strong Japanese exports and only moderate growth in domestic demand for
foreign goods produced a 0.9 per cent rise in Japan's current account
surplus in July.
The gap widened to Dollars 11.74bn (Pounds 7.5bn), a record for the month,
from Dollars 11.63bn in July last year, roughly in line with market
forecasts. Finance Ministry officials interpreted the result as further
evidence that the politically sensitive surplus has started to peak as Japan
and the US approach another critical deadline - at the end of the month - in
trade talks.
Adjusting for the rise of the yen against the dollar over the past year, the
current account gap shrank by 7.7 per cent when measured in the Japanese
currency. Stripping out sales of services, Japan's trade surplus rose 4.9
per cent to Dollars 14.45bn, but fell 4.2 per cent in yen terms. Exports
rose 6.6 per cent in dollar terms and imports were up 8.1 per cent against
July 1993.
On average, import volumes had grown by 10 per cent since the turn of the
year, reflecting a gentle pick-up in domestic demand, an official said.
Exports had declined in five of the past seven months in yen terms, he
added.
The surprise in yesterday's figures was a sudden sharp rise in the outflow
of long-term capital, to Dollars 20.85bn in July from Dollars 4.5bn in June.
Mr Robert Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Asia, believes this
is partly due to a surge in bonds issued overseas by Japanese companies, so
that cash will return to Japanese hands rather than being recycled abroad.
July's long-term capital account deficit also includes a record Dollars
8.99bn outflow of funds from foreign investors, who became net sellers of
Japanese shares and bonds for the first time in 13 months. Foreign
investors, previously the sole source of support for the languishing equity
market, had provided a Dollars 6.66bn capital inflow in June. A ministry
official said foreign investors were believed to have taken profits on the
yen's rise and might be worried about the impact of the stronger currency on
companies' export earnings.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Violence tips Algiers toward compromise: Francis Ghiles on
the political and economic turmoil which followed cancelled elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Algerian government is ready to hold talks with Islamic opposition
groups, but only if the violence sweeping the country is halted.
'If we have to talk with the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), we will. The
essential pre-condition is that the FIS must cease all violence. What is
also essential is that the Algerian people take their destiny in their own
hands,' said Mr Mokdad Sifi, Algerian prime minister, in an interview.
The premier claimed the government was not responsible for the country's
political and economic turmoil, or the causes which led to it.
Economic improvements and a more hopeful political future are proving
elusive in the climate of insecurity which has characterised Algeria since
the FIS was denied victory by the cancellation of the 1992 election results
which had seemed certain to sweep the Islamic party to power. Worsening
violence is causing ever-greater damage to the nation's infrastructure, the
death toll is rising remorselessly, while the benefits of a Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 653m) loan agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund in
April may only be felt slowly.
The cost of damage to the country's infrastructure over the past two years
is estimated at more than Dollars 1.3bn. Schools and universities have been
increasingly targeted by the more extreme members of the Islamic Armed Group
(GIA); more than 400 schools have been set on fire in the past 12 months.
Two weeks ago the medical faculty in the eastern provincial capital of
Constantine was reduced to ashes, and fierce fighting in the city left
scores dead. Forest fires this summer, often started by the security forces
to flush out Islamic groups, have caused extensive damage, especially to
olive groves in eastern Algeria. No area of the country today is safe,
violence having spread this summer to the Berber heartland of Kabylia.
The cost in lives, now put at about 11,000, has also been growing. Not only
are the fundamentalists pitted against the army-backed government, but
confrontation is growing between the GIA, which is active around Algiers,
and supporters of the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS) which owes allegiance to
the outlawed FIS.
The GIA has sought to sabotage tentative steps towards a dialogue between
General Liamine Zeroual, the head of state, and some senior FIS leaders. It
has also threatened to 'burn or dynamite' all schools and universities which
open their doors this autumn, and said 'severe sanctions' would be taken
against students and teachers who attended classes.
The deadly competition between the FIS and the GIA is leading to violent
vendettas, and denunciations by elders of the FIS, such as Mr Abdelbaki
Sahraoui, who claim the GIA is acting as an accomplice to the military.
The GIA, which has claimed responsibility for the deaths of most of the 60
foreigners killed during the past 12 months, has repeatedly refused to
contemplate negotiations with an 'un-pious state'.
Gen Zeroual says he wants to start a dialogue, but seems unwilling or unable
to release the leaders of the FIS held since June 1991.
The FIS, which is finding it difficult to control its supporters, says it
would like to begin talks but not until its leaders are released. It has
condemned the killing of foreigners, the burning of schools and the threats
to teachers and students.
Against this background, most of the more promising conditions that Mr Sifi
and his government are seeking to create are most likely to stem from the
IMF agreement and the subsequent rescheduling of part of Algeria's Dollars
26.7bn foreign debt, thus reducing the cost of servicing this year from
Dollars 9.4bn to Dollars 5.06bn. This should allow last year's 1.8 per cent
decline in real gross domestic product to be reversed, and provide growth in
1994 of about 2 per cent.
Capital goods investment in industry should rise from Dollars 7.99bn to just
above Dollars 9bn and help boost activity in myriad state and private
companies which have been starved of imports over the past two years as the
debt service ratio has risen to absorb 86.4 per cent of total exports in
1993.
Three factors explain why the quick benefits the IMF agreements were
supposed to bring will materialise only slowly. First, the shortage of
foreign currency alone is not the root cause of Algeria's economic crisis.
In the words of one senior diplomat: 'Injecting cash into a semi-paralysed
network of state companies will not turn them into athletes overnight.'
Second, in critical areas such as the severe lack of housing it is
unrealistic, according to one senior official, to expect more than 50,000
new units to be built this year, against the estimated requirement of some
1.2m units. Despite the fact that it takes, on average, eight years to
complete an apartment block in Algiers, private builders remain hostile to
importing pre-fabricated units. The increasing unwillingness of foreign
governments and companies to send representatives to Algeria is also slowing
decision-making in all fields.
Third, this year's severe drought has cut farming output and will force
Algeria to import more than 90 per cent of its cereal requirements, compared
with a 70-75 per cent average in better years.
Foreign embassies, meanwhile, are closing down or reducing their staff
dramatically. The daring and precision of the GIA's attack on the French
diplomatic compound at Ain Allah in early August, which cost the lives of
three gendarmes and two consular officials, has sent shivers through the
diplomatic community. Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Austria, Holland and
Switzerland have now closed their embassies, albeit temporarily.
More than at any time since the suspension of elections it appears that only
some form of compromise between the army and the FIS will avert a fully
fledged civil war.

FT  03 SEP 94 / China quits Korea war commission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
China said yesterday that it would withdraw from the Korean war armistice
commission, in an apparent show of support for North Korea.
In April North Korea withdrew from the body that supervises the Korean war
truce in an attempt to persuade the US to sign a formal peace treaty ending
the 1950-53 conflict, which could eventually lead to the US removing its
troops from South Korea.
Pyongyang is likely to press for the peace treaty if diplomatic relations
are established with Washington as part of a wider deal to end the
international dispute over North Korea's nuclear programme.
The withdrawal of North Korea's closest ally is largely symbolic as the
armistice commission has not met since 1991, when North Korea began
boycotting the meetings in protest over the appointment of a South Korean
officer as head of the United Nations side.
China made its announcement following talks with Mr Song Ho-kyong, the North
Korean vice-foreign minister and the first envoy from Pyongyang to visit
Beijing since the death of President Kim Il-sung in July. Beijing's action
is causing concern in Seoul, already worried about being left out of North
Korean-US talks on the nuclear issue and feeling increasingly isolated from
accelerated diplomatic negotiations concerning the future of the Korean
peninsula.
The Chinese announcement would appear to endorse North Korea's proposal for
a peace treaty with the US to replace the armistice, while also excluding
South Korea. Pyongyang does not recognise South Korea as a party to a future
peace treaty since Seoul refused to sign the 1953 armistice agreement, which
was concluded between North Korea, China and US-led UN forces.
Pyongyang cited these grounds for its boycott of the truce meetings.
Meetings to supervise the armistice are now conducted on a lower level
between UN and North Korean military officials.

FT  03 SEP 94 / BAe chief sees more mergers to counter US threat: FT
Conferences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European aerospace industry was warned yesterday that it will have to
reduce its costs by about 40 per cent over the next few years and close down
a significant number of surplus facilities to remain competitive, reports
Paul Betts, Aerospace Correspondent.
The warning, ahead of next week's Farnborough Air Show, came from Mr Dick
Evans, chairman of British Aerospace, at a Financial Times aerospace
conference.
Mr Evans said more consolidation was inevitable in the European aerospace
industry especially in the wake of the shake-up taking place in the US
defence sector.
In the commercial aircraft market, Mr Evans said, the European industry
would eventually be polarised around the European Airbus consortium in the
large airliner sector and another consortium in the smaller regional
aircraft market.
He also believed there would ultimately be only one significant defence
producer in Europe, although consolidation in the sector would hinge on
government polices because of their huge procurement power.
'We need a clear definition of strategy from governments if we are to go
down the inevitable road towards greater consolidation,' he told the
conference.
Mr Evans said that in the regional aircraft market the most rational outcome
would be a combination of UK, German and French aircraft activities into a
grouping similar to the Airbus consortium.
Although BAe has held extensive discussions over recent months with both
Aerospatiale of France and Deutsche Aerospace, the German company
controlling the Dutch Fokker regional aircraft manufacturer, the talks have
so far failed to produce tangible results.
Speculation had also been rife of a possible combination of BAe and the UK
General Electric Company (GEC) to create a large UK defence contractor in
the wake of the Lockheed-Martin Marietta defence merger in the US. However,
it is understood there are no talks at this stage between BAe and GEC over
the possibility of the companies forging a strategic link.
The difficulties of forging cross-border defence mergers in Europe have also
been highlighted by the slow pace of negotiations between BAe and Matra of
France to combine their respective guided weapons activities. The
negotiations have been dragging on for two years.
Mr Arthur Zussman, president of Hughes Europe, told the conference that, if
defence companies wanted to survive, they had to 'do something spectacular'.
He said industry experts were forecasting that up to 80 per cent of the top
100 defence companies could disappear by the turn of the century.
Although air travel was picking up and airlines were beginning to make money
again, Mr Richard Turner, Rolls-Royce's marketing director and president of
the Society of British Aerospace Companies, said the industry was not viable
as currently structured.
Mr Robert Dryden, executive vice-president of Boeing, the world's biggest
aircraft manufacturer, said the company had committed itself to reducing its
production cycle times by more than half in three years.
'The target is to have a six-month cycle time by the end of 1996 for the
Boeing 737 and 757, and eight months for the 767 and 747 and eventually the
new 777.'

FT  03 SEP 94 / Gatt chief warns on accord delay: Uruguay Round ratified so
far by only 26 of 125 signatories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, yesterday launched a strong appeal to the leading trading powers
to ratify the Uruguay Round global trade accords without delay. The accords,
including the establishment of a World Trade Organisation, are due to take
effect on January 1 next year.
Addressing a business audience in Italy, he said the biggest
trade-liberalising package in history - worth Dollars 755bn (Pounds 487bn) a
year in extra merchandise trade - was 'little more than an uncashed cheque'
until ratified and implemented. 'Any delay in the entry into force of the
WTO and the agreements it encompasses will cost real people everywhere real
money,' he said.
Only 26 of the 125 countries taking part have so far ratified or otherwise
approved the Uruguay Round agreements signed in Marrakesh in April. Most are
waiting for ratification by the three biggest traders - the US, the European
Union and Japan - whose participation is essential.
While Mr Sutherland expressed concern over procedural delays in the EU and
Japan, he is most alarmed at the confused situation in the US. The Clinton
administration is still wrangling with Congress over details of the
implementing legislation and there is a strong current of congressional
opposition to ratification this year.
The Gatt chief said the window of opportunity, from the time Congress
resumes on September 12 to early October when it adjourns ahead of mid-term
elections, was a narrow one. 'If it is missed, the risks of a long delay are
serious.'
In addition to intensifying personal contacts with key participants, Mr
Sutherland plans a multilateral review on implementation which would enable
the September 22 meeting of the WTO preparatory committee to identify
recalcitrants.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Pace of US job creation slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Job creation slowed sharply in the US last month, but the unemployment rate
stayed unchanged at 6.1 per cent with an estimated 8.02m people out of work.
The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment grew by only 179,000
in August to a seasonally adjusted total of 113.76m, the slowest pace of job
growth so far this year.
Ms Katharine Abraham, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said
most of the growth in employment came in the service sector, especially in
the business services and health industries.
The average working week in the manufacturing sector lengthened in August to
42 hours, and average overtime rose to a record high of 4.8 hours.
Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the White House's chief economic adviser, said job
creation was still healthy, and the August rate was consistent with the
gradual moderation in economic growth the administration has forecast. She
noted an increase of 32,000 in the number of manufacturing jobs, a sector
where employment growth has been sluggish.
Some Wall Street economists, however, said the sharp increase in
manufacturing employment, at a time when industries were operating at close
to full capacity, could signal more inflationary pressure and prompt the
Federal Reserve Board to raise short term interest rates once again.
This idea helped pull bond prices back down after they had risen sharply
immediately after the announcement of slower overall job creation, and the
dollar, too, fell.
Ms Tyson dismissed the suggestion, noting that unit labour costs had risen
over the last 12 months at their slowest rate for 29 years.
Other Wall Street economists agreed.
'Wage pressures remain completely absent. Wages are up just 2.5 per cent
from a year ago and have risen at a scant 1.5 per cent rate during the past
three months,' said an economist with Merrill Lynch, the New York
stockbroking giant.
Ms Tyson said most economic forecasts, including the administration's,
foresaw continued expansion coupled with modest inflation.
Wall Street analysts, however, believe members of the Fed's policy-making
Open Markets Committee pay considerable attention to high rates of
industrial capacity utilisation and to the concept of a 'natural rate of
unemployment' in the region of 6.0 to 6.5 per cent, below which labour
becomes more scarce and wage inflation begins to rise.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Bulgaria's 'government of technocrats' to quit: Parliament
must resolve crisis, says premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SOFIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bulgaria's non-party 'government of technocrats', which has ruled since the
end of 1992, said yesterday it had decided to resign.
Mr Lyuben Berov, the prime minister, who has been incapacitated for months
by a heart attack, said on television that parliament was so hamstrung by
contradictory opinions that he believed new elections were the only
solution.
'In these circumstances, the government doesn't want to take the
responsibility for postponing early elections,' he said. 'Simple political
ethics require the government to re-tire. . . and make way for the
parliament to resolve. . . the political crisis in the country.'
President Zhelyu Zhelev said in a statement that the parliament now must
decide whether to call early elections.
Parliament may be divided over the wisdom of dissolving parliament and
calling early elections. The alternative would be to reshuffle the existing
government, possibly under a new prime minister, although the 68-year-old Mr
Berov is recovering.
The government, which is sustained by the votes of the powerful Bulgarian
Socialist Party (BSP) and the Movement for Rights and Freedom, a largely
ethnic Turk party, narrowly won a no-confidence vote in May. There was
widespread reluctance to create a political vacuum when Bulgaria was in the
midst of complex foreign debt negotiations. But agreement was reached with
London Club commercial bank creditors on June 30. The deal provided for a 47
per cent reduction in Bulgaria's hard currency debt of more than Dollars
8bn. The agreement triggered a raft of IMF, World Bank and other loans
required to finance the agreement and boost reserves.
Recent opinion polls indicate that the BSP, heir to the defunct communist
party, would emerge from elections as the largest single party, reflecting a
pattern already seen in Poland and Hungary, which returned socialist parties
to power earlier this year. But the BSP is internally divided into old-style
former communists and western-style social democratic factions and is
unenthusiastic about running for elections before resolving its internal
conflicts.
It is a similar story in the United Democratic Front (UDF), a loose umbrella
grouping of over a dozen 'democratic' parties formed after the collapse of
Soviet domination.
The UDF won the 1991 elections after the socialist party, which took over
power from the deposed communist dictator, Mr Todor Zhivkov, was attacked
for its close links with the old regime. But the UDF government led by Mr
Philip Dimitrov split and lost power a year later. This created a vacuum
which President Zhelu Zhelyev, one of the founders of the UDF, filled by
appointing the Berov-led government of technocrats which the votes of the
BSP helped keep in power.
The economy, which was badly hit by the collapse of Comecon markets and the
UN trade embargo against neighbouring Serbia, is recovering slowly. Nearly
half Bulgaria's foreign trade is now with the west, compared with only 9 per
cent four years ago.
Reuter adds from Sofia: The chief of staff of the Bulgarian army was
replaced yesterday after he opposed a government plan to retire 300
colonels. The cabinet asked President Zhelev, who is supreme commander of
the armed forces, to dismiss Lyuben Petrov after a closed session at which
it discussed a rift between him and Defence Minister Valentin Alexandrov.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Wall Street's whizkids seek solace in poetry: Bronwen Maddox
on why the high rollers of the 1980s are going back to college for
'creative' studies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From Wall Street to Walt Whitman: the high rollers of the 1980s financial
boom are now beating a path back to college to sign up for courses in poetry
and literature. Columbia University in New York City, opening its doors for
the start of the autumn term, has found that many of its new intake of
postgraduates are fleeing the worlds of commerce, law and finance.
According to Mr Grafton Nunes, associate dean of Columbia's School of Arts,
which runs courses on creative writing, visual arts and film, many of those
stepping aside from lucrative careers have concluded that 'my soul is dying
 -I'm good at this but I am not fulfilled'. Then, he says, 'they ask
themselves: 'dare I dream to do something different?''
Columbia, like many of the most prestigious US universities, has seen
interest in postgraduate courses such as arts, politics and history rise
steadily since the second half of the 1980s. Applications to its Graduate
School of Arts and Sciences, which encompasses art history, history,
literature and political science, were only 3,400 in 1986, the year before
the Wall Street crash, but reached 4,300 in 1990, and 6,200 in 1994.
This year, Columbia has received 10 applications for every postgraduate
place in painting and sculpture, even though it had not formally advertised
the course. For the first time in years it has filled the 15 places for
poetry writing.
Some of the demand comes from undergraduates, many of whom are prolonging
academic life through postgraduate study rather than enter the fierce
competition for jobs outside. But recession has also given those in
established careers ranging from stockbroking to psychiatry a new reason to
go back to school, faculty members say.
Ms Suzanne Fox, administrator of the creative writing course, and a former
Wall Street high flyer, says that 'the glory days of the mid-1980s have
gone. People now feel that there is no practical use to climbing the
corporate ladder'. Faculty members talk of a 'glut of lawyers' on the job
market.
Lowered expectations of salaries and promotion mean that people are more
prepared to make the financial sacrifice of returning to academia, Ms Fox
says, although the decision is hardly made lightly, as completing a
postgraduate course can cost some Dollars 35,000 (Pounds 22,650).
Part of the rise in applications, admissions officers suggest, is that the
current generation of parents, who themselves were at college in the 1960s,
are willing to help pay for arts courses, where parents a decade ago would
have steered their offspring towards law or medicine. 'Being a doctor does
not have the same aura it used to have,' says Mr Nunes.
But what happens when these graduates leave? According to Ms Fox, many
should consider returning to their previous professions. 'Wise people are
not looking for vocational change,' she says. 'They understand there are no
day jobs for painters or literary writers.'
A few may succeed in staying in academia: Mr David Damrosch, Columbia's
director of graduate studies of English literature, suggests that graduates
have their eyes on an improvement in the academic job market in the late
1990s, when a wave of retirements is expected.
For writers and theatre producers, however, the booming studios of Hollywood
offer the chance to cash in their new learning for considerable material
rewards. According to Mr Nunes, himself a former film producer: 'Television
has become such an important part of our communication that there has been
an explosion of those jobs.'
Technology is now capable of delivering hundreds of television channels to
each house, and the US media industry, currently convulsed in multi-billion
dollar takeover bids, is scrambling for more programmes to show. Would-be
poets may find that lessons learned on Wall Street have not, then, been
entirely wasted.

Lesotho's King Letsie and ousted prime minister Ntsu Mokhehle reached an
accord on their power struggle yesterday - and the premier said his
government would be reinstated. The king sparked a constitutional crisis in
the tiny southern African mountain state on August 17 when he dissolved Mr
Mokhehle's government, saying it no longer enjoyed popular support. The
ousting of Lesotho's first democratically elected government in two decades
drew widespread condemnation abroad. Three regional neighbours - South
Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe - gave the king until September 5 to rescind
his decision. South Africa completely surrounds Lesotho and has a
stranglehold on its economy. 'It was agreed the process of restoring the
government should start immediately,' Mr Mokhehle said after a meeting with
the king.

Mr Lau San-Ching, a Hong Kong resident who has spent much of the past 10
years as a political prisoner in China, yesterday failed in his attempt to
challenge Hong Kong's residency requirements for the forthcoming elections.
A High Court judge ruled against lifting his disqualification from standing
in this month's district board elections because he had not been 'ordinarily
resident' in the colony for the last 10 years. Justice Mayo said Mr Lau's
appeal for judicial review of his case was inappropriate and he should
submit an 'election petition' under Hong Kong's election law. This could not
be heard until after the election, meaning that Mr Lau would not be able to
stand until after 1997, when Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong might mean
he is still ineligible for office. Mr Lau said he was very disappointed with
the judgment, and he could not afford an election petition as it did not
qualify for legal aid.

The Thai government yesterday detained the leader of the messianic Al-Arqam
Islamic movement, indicating that he would be expelled to Malaysia, which
has sought to have the sect banned throughout South-East Asia. Police
stopped Mr Ashaari Muhammad and his followers as they travelled to Chiang
Mai, where the religious leader has been in self-imposed exile for six
years, according to Mr Jailani Jasmani, Mr Ashaari's press secretary. Mr
Ashaari was told he was now an illegal visitor because he was one of 10 sect
members who had their passports cancelled by the Malaysian authorities. A
Thai foreign ministry official said: 'We have had requests from the
Malaysian government, which does not want these people here. We gain nothing
by allowing him to stay in the face of the requests.' The Al-Arqam movement
is not banned in Thailand, a mainly Buddhist country.

Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company, plans to
lift investment in China to Dollars 250m (Pounds 162m) with establishment of
new joint ventures. Dr Alex Krauer, chairman of Ciba, said in Beijing some
12 ventures among 30 under discussion had been inaugurated or were in an
advanced planning stage. The Swiss company expects initially to make its
heaviest investment in the production of industrial products such as dyes
and additives, with Dollars 160m earmarked for this purpose. It plans to
spend some Dollars 60m in the agriculture sphere in production of such items
as pesticides, and Dollars 30m on health products. Ciba's drive into China
matches that of its main competitors, including Zeneca of the UK and Du Pont
of the US.

<TEXT>
The US has barred aircraft from nine countries in Africa and Latin America
from landing at US airports because it found their governments' supervision
of air safety inadequate. Mr Federico Pena, the transportation secretary,
said aircraft from Belize, the Dominican Republic, Gambia, Ghana, Honduras,
Nicaragua, Paraguay, Uruguay and Zaire were banned, while aircraft from
Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala and the Dutch Antilles had only conditional
approval. Some of the banned countries have dropped air links with the US,
while others have had to lease aircraft from other countries. The ban has
been in place for some time but Mr Pena released the list only yesterday,
after pressure from consumer groups to make the information available to
travellers. Some countries, including Russia and Nigeria, have yet to be
assessed.

<TEXT>
The Christian Social Union, Bavarian sister party of Germany's Christian
Democratic Union, yesterday launched its election campaigning, vowing to
make its voice heard in a future CDU/CSU federal government. 'The Bavarian
lion must go on roaring,' Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, told about
1,000 CSU delegates in Munich. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, speaking at the
rally, accused the opposition Social Democratic party of being willing to
accept support from the Party of Democratic Socialism, successor to the East
German Communist party.
Bavarians go to the polls on September 25 to elect a new state parliament
and again on October 16 for Germany's federal elections. The CSU has been
rocked by scandals which gave rise to predictions that the party would lose
its majority in state parliament. However, Mr Waigel and Mr Edmund Stoiber,
the Bavarian state premier, appear to have overcome the problems. Mr Waigel
predicted the party would secure an absolute majority in the state
elections.

<TEXT>
Opposition forces in the Russian North Caucasian republic of Chechnya are
moving closer to the capital, Grozny - and are calling for the overthrow of
the republic's president, General Dzhokar Dudayev. According to spokesmen
for the various forces now opposing Gen Dudayev, four regions are under
their control and highways to Grozny have been cut a few kilometres from the
city. The Chechen provisional council, the main opposition group, said that
presidential forces were repulsed on Thursday as they attempted to regain
control of one region, Urus-Martan.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the former speaker of the Russian parliament, has
emerged as a main focus of the opposition - in uneasy alliance with forces
of Mr Ruslan Labazanov and Mr Umar Avturkhanov, two warlords who control
different areas of the republic. Russia has threatened intervention but
seems likely to stay on the sidelines. Mr Alexander Shokhin, a Russian
deputy prime minister, said yesterday: 'We must use political means in
Chechnya.'
Gen Dudayev's military spokesman claimed that an opposition tank column
backed by Russian helicopter gunships was advancing on a village about 30km
north of Grozny. The gunships had fired on government positions, he claimed.
But the defence ministry in Moscow denied any Russian role in the fighting.

FT  03 SEP 94 / France revives Nato link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time in 28 years France is to attend a meeting of Nato defence
ministers, reflecting further rapprochement by Paris towards the military
activities of the Atlantic alliance.
But French officials stressed yesterday that Mr Francois Leotard, France's
defence minister, would go to the September 29-30 meeting in Spain because
it was an informal gathering, in contrast to the twice-yearly formal
sessions of Nato defence ministers.
Since 1966 when it quit Nato's integrated military command, France has been
represented only at alliance summits or meetings of foreign ministers that
constitute Nato's political wing.
The meeting in Seville will be the second such informal gathering of Nato
defence ministers, following a similar meeting in Germany last autumn that
Mr Leotard did not attend. At the intervening Nato summit last January
France said it would in future send its defence minister to meetings that
had an agenda of special interest to Paris, such as Nato peacekeeping
operations in Bosnia.
'The Seville agenda suits us,' a French official said. It includes Bosnia,
the Mediterranean, including Algeria, and reform of the alliance.
In its defence white paper earlier this year, France ruled out rejoining
Nato's integrated military command. But, reciprocating President Bill
Clinton's more relaxed, even encouraging, attitude towards European defence
efforts, France's position towards Nato is still clearly evolving.
Earlier this week Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, called on his
European Union partners to join France in drafting a white paper to define
EU security interests and how these could be protected 'in conjunction with
Nato'.
The nomination of a successor to the late Manfred Worner as Nato
secretary-general may also be discussed at Seville.
French officials say that 'by definition' Paris is not fielding a candidate,
but has told the UK that it could support a British contender for the job.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, has indicated he wants to stay in
national politics, but Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, has apparently
not foreclosed the option.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Russia plans big shake-up of tax system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia yesterday announced a new tax structure to try to beat massive tax
evasion and to maintain government revenue in the face of falling
production.
Mr Sergei Aleksashenko, deputy finance minister, said tax revenues to July
were only half the forecast amount and were expected to reach less than 45
per cent of forecasts for the year as a whole.
At the same time, a report on Russia's short-term financial outlook, by Mr
Sergei Dubinin, the acting finance minister, showed that government
expenditure was slashed in the first half of the year.
Spending on law enforcement agencies was cut by 8 per cent, defence spending
by 25 per cent, capital investment by 35 per cent and support for the
northern (Arctic) territories cut by nearly half.
Mr Aleksashenko said tax evasion, numerous ad hoc tax privileges and falling
industrial production had all contributed to the tax shortfall.
Gross national product had stabilised, because of the sharp rise in the
output of the services sector - which has seen services output outstrip
industrial production.
But industrial production was running at 76 per cent of last year's levels
for the first six months of the year, he said, and the bulk of tax revenue
has traditionally come from industry.
In an effort to raise tax income, the government intends to raise those
taxes which are more effectively governed, and ease the tax burden on
industry.
The finance ministry proposes to cut profit tax from 38 to 34 per cent and
VAT on staple items from 20 to 10 per cent.
It also plans to raise the top rate of income tax on 'super incomes' from 30
to 40 per cent, introduce a new federal income tax of 5 per cent and raise
the property tax paid by businesses from 2 to 3 per cent.
These measures will be put to the parliament in the next two weeks.
However, almost a third of the shortfall was due to the much more rapid fall
in inflation than the government had forecast at the beginning of the year,
said Mr Aleksashenko.
Nonetheless, the government plans to continue its squeeze on inflation next
year, said Mr Dubinin's report. It aims to cut inflation to 5 per cent a
month by the middle of 1995 and to 2.5-3 per cent a month by the end of the
year - even at the cost of a forecast 7 per cent fall in next year's GNP.
The report predicts that the fall in output should stabilise by the end of
1995, however, and that a 'significant rise in private domestic and foreign
investment in the Russian economy should take place'.
The government also announced yesterday that new bank regulations had been
put in place this week by Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman,
which would allow the bank to assign an administrator to commercial banks,
or other financial institutions, deemed to be trading illegally or in a
'hopeless' financial situation.
The new measures follow widespread anxiety over the lack of effective
regulation of financial institutions following the collapse of the MMM
financial empire - built up through the promotion of high yielding 'shares'
apparently backed only by continued new purchases.

Brazil's Workers' Party (PT), whose candidate Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva
is trailing in polls for next month's presidential elections, yesterday
accused the government and media of giving unfair backing to his main rival,
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The PT alleged that the government and
state-owned companies were approving spending projects in areas likely to
benefit Mr Cardoso. It also said Brazil's latest economic plan and the new
Real currency were being used for electoral ends. Mr Cardoso, former finance
minister, left the government to contest the elections. 'We believe these
actions are electoral crime and a crime against democracy in a plan to elect
the candidate of the right at any cost,' the PT said. Mr da Silva has 23 per
cent support in opinion polls, compared to Mr Cardoso's 45 per cent, and the
PT is desperate to find a way to fight back.

<TEXT>
A new constitutional debate has broken out in Europe on the future pace of
political and economic integration. Fears voiced yesterday in Italy and
Spain indicated that the wrangling could prove as divisive as that over the
Maastricht treaty.
Concern has been aroused in countries that would be excluded from a 'hard
core' of five nations - as defined by leaders in France and Germany - in a
multi-speed European Union.
Italy, one of those to be left out of the 'inner circle', openly attacked
the idea yesterday. If it was put into practice, 'we would evidently risk a
break-up of Europe, which is completely unacceptable', the Italian Foreign
Ministry said in a statement.
A senior official in Spain, another country to be relegated from the 'inner
circle', also expressed fears at the prospect of being left behind within
the EU. 'All countries are happy with a hard core, as long as they are in
it,' the official said.
In Brussels, a senior EU official said that plans for a multi-speed Europe,
floated in France by Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, and in Germany
by Mr Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary leader of the Christian Democrats,
might prove virtually impossible to implement.
However, the British Foreign Office said the vision of a multi-speed Europe
was preferable to a 'monolithic' concept of all countries travelling on the
same lines. But pro-European British MPs expressed fears that the UK would
be relegated to Europe's slow lane.
Constitutional debate on the future of Europe has been in suspension after
the arduous ratification last year of the Maastricht treaty, which struck a
balance between Community-wide obligations and looser co-operation among
governments.
Many observers thought that a truce would hold until the inter-governmental
conference to review the Maastricht treaty opened in 1996. But debate has
broken out as France and Germany, the traditional motor behind European
integration, have sought to reconcile Bonn's demand to embrace the former
communist countries of eastern Europe with Paris's interest in preserving
its political influence in a strong Union.
In Germany the Christian Democrats, leaders of the coalition government,
this week published a policy document proposing a future flexible Europe
with expanded membership to the east, built around the core Franco-German
alliance.
Their vision of 'variable geometry' - apparently blessed by the party
leader, Chancellor Helmut Kohl - would be configured around only five of the
six founding members: France and Germany, as well as Belgium, Luxembourg and
the Netherlands. Italy, a founder member, as well as Britain and Spain,
would be excluded in the initial phase.
The German paper appeared a day after Mr Balladur sketched his vision of a
three-tier Europe with France and Germany at the core. A second concentric
circle would include weaker or less integrationist-minded states such as the
UK, while an outer group would take in the nations of eastern Europe which
could not hope to meet the criteria of EU membership for some time.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Mackie flotation will test confidence in Ulster: Province's
business optimism 'may be bouncing back'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mackie International, the precision engineering company that straddles the
peace line between Protestants and Catholics in Belfast, will provide an
early test of business confidence in Ulster's future after this week's
ceasefire.
Mackie is to be floated as a public company, and plans to come to the
Unlisted Securities Market via a placing this month. It will have a market
capitalisation of about Pounds 20m and hopes by the end of the year to have
moved to a full listing on the London Stock Exchange.
Ulster's business leaders believe Mackie's flotation is very significant,
coming just after the IRA began its ceasefire on Thursday. 'It is the first
indication that business confidence could be bouncing back,' one said.
Mackie is one of Northern Ireland's best known companies. Its headquarters
are sandwiched between the Roman Catholic Falls Road and the Protestant
Shankill Road. While 70 per cent of its 380 workers are Protestants it is
run and owned by a Catholic, Mr Pat Dougan, the company's chief executive.
'This is the first opportunity the City of London has had post the cessation
of violence to show its confidence in Ulster,' Mr Dougan said yesterday.
'This company could become the flagship of west Belfast. If we can
demonstrate to American and overseas investors that there is a work ethic
here, this will allow us to develop the skills of the community.'
Flotation will enable the company to eliminate debts totalling Pounds 14.3m,
incurred while the company was under US ownership. Mr Dougan said it would
also 'assist in the financing of a capital expenditure programme and the
provision of working capital to finance the company's substantially
increased levels of turnover'.
Three years ago Mr Dougan was brought in by the Northern Ireland office to
help rescue Mackie. Sales had fallen to Pounds 6.1m in 1991 but are
predicted to top Pounds 19m with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2m this year.
The company specialises in designing, manufacturing and installing textile
machinery for a worldwide market. Its new environmental division recently
won a Pounds 25m contract with the Argentine water sanitation authority.
Mr Dougan's 66 per cent ownership of the company will fall to just under 21
per cent after flotation. The workforce will collectively own about 8 per
cent of the share capital.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Thyssen steps in to save Three Graces for Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNALENA MCAFEE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An eleventh-hour intervention by Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, the
Dutch-born industrialist and art collector, has saved the Three Graces
sculpture for Britain.
Speaking from his summer house on the Spanish coast, the 73-year-old baron
pledged the final Pounds 800,000 needed to save Antonio Canova's marble
sculpture of Jove's daughters from export to the Getty Museum in Malibu.
'I thought it was idiotic to let this thing go to California for a little
amount of money so I decided to help,' the baron said. 'It's an important
neoclassical piece and it would be a big shame for all of Europe if it was
lost to America.'
Mr Tim Clifford, director of the National Gallery of Scotland, which will
share the sculpture with the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, described
the offer as 'wonderfully generous'.
It will conclude a saga that stretches back to the early 1980s when the
Marquess of Tavistock first put the Three Graces - originally commissioned
for Woburn Abbey in 1815 - up for sale.
The Getty Museum subsequently bought it for Pounds 7.6m, but successive arts
and heritage ministers have delayed the granting of an export licence in the
hope that UK museums and galleries could match the sum.
Mr John Walsh, director of the California museum, said last night that,
regardless of the new developments, he planned to press ahead with legal
action against the British government over the delays.
Three weeks ago Mr John Paul Getty II, the reclusive anglophile billionaire,
made a surprise donation of Pounds 1m to the fund to keep the sculpture in
the UK and, in effect, out of his late father's museum.
Mr Clifford was forced to apologise publicly after stating that Mr Getty
Jr's offer had been prompted by a grudge against his father. The campaigners
had until November 5 to raise the remaining money before an export licence
was due to be granted to the Getty Museum. 'The deadline was looming,' Mr
Clifford said. 'We were going to have to raise Pounds 100,000 a week. I
didn't think we were going to make it.'
After the embarrassment of his apology, the Thyssen-Bornemisza donation
represents a vindication for Mr Clifford, who will be announcing full
details of the offer today. It is unlikely that he will choose this occasion
to speculate about the baron's relationship with his father.
Patience, passion and the baron, Weekend XVII

FT  03 SEP 94 / Adams poised for his first meeting with Irish premier
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sinn Fein may be poised to take another big step towards recognition as a
fully legitimate democratic party with a meeting between Mr Gerry Adams and
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, within two weeks, Dublin
officials indicated last night.
Word of the meeting - which would be the first between a Provisional Sinn
Fein leader and an Irish premier - came as Mr Adams extended his list of
demands by calling in Dublin for the withdrawal of British troops from
nationalist areas.
There were also hopes last night that the outlawed Irish National Liberation
Army was on the brink of announcing a ceasefire.
Meanwhile in Washington, senior members of the US Congress warned that no
extra money was likely to be available this year to help smooth the way to
peace in Ulster. But Irish foreign minister Dick Spring said after meeting
President Bill Clinton in the holiday resort of Martha's Vineyard that he
hoped 'substantial' sums would be forthcoming.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Child Support Agency chief quits post early
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Ros Hepplewhite resigned yesterday as chief executive of the bitterly
criticised Child Support Agency, more than 18 months before her contract was
due to expire.
Speculation had been growing through the summer over whether Mrs Hepplewhite
would survive until April 1996 to complete her contract in charge of the
agency, set up last year to ensure that absent parents took financial
responsibility for their children.
In July she was forced to admit, both in her first annual report and in an
appearance before the Commons social security committee, that in its first
year the agency had failed by a wide margin to meet government-set targets.
In her resignation letter to Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, she
said: 'I am hopeful that the new arrangements will in time benefit many
families and be more widely recognised as an important and necessary
innovation.'
The agency was set up with considerable all-party support, but few MPs can
have been prepared for the avalanche of complaints they have received from
constituents since it began operating in April, 1993.
Many have concerned the agency's decisions, with criticisms that it was
interfering with 'clean break' settlements and undermining the stability of
second families by making excessive financial demands. Another large group
of complaints, however, has been about the agency's poor efficiency.
In her first annual report, Mrs Hepplewhite was forced to apologise to those
with whom the agency came in contact for difficulties they had experienced.
She admitted that the agency's performance had 'not always measured up to
the high standards we set out to achieve'.
Financially it fell Pounds 112m short of its government target of raising
Pounds 530m in benefit savings last year, while MPs on the social security
committee claim it managed to collect only Pounds 15m in new money.
Mrs Hepplewhite was recruited to run the agency from the mental health
charity Mind, where she was director. Her resignation coincides with
political anger over Thursday's transfer of Republican prisoners to Northern
Ireland by the Prison Service, headed by Mr Derek Lewis, a former television
executive. The two events may revive concern among some MPs about the
appropriateness of recruiting people without Whitehall experience to run
public agencies.
Mrs Hepplewhite's successor, Miss Ann Chant, is a career civil servant with
31 years' experience who has been chief executive of the Contributions
Agency since it was formed in 1991.
Mr Lilley, replying to Mrs Hepplewhite's resignation letter, paid tribute to
her 'courage and dedication' in introducing reforms under pressure.
Ministers hope that an improvement in the agency's efficiency may defuse
criticism of the wider child support policy. Critics say only a considerably
more flexible approach to pursuing maintenance payments will achieve that.

FT  03 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks recede after brief
upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
After a brief upturn, US stocks back-pedalled yesterday amid conflicting
interpretations of August employment data which seemed favourable at first
glance, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 15.86 lower at 3,885.88, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 2.18 at 470.99.
The secondary indices managed to hold on to slim gains, with the American SE
composite up 1.52 at 455.54 and the Nasdaq composite adding 0.28 to 759.23.
With the approach of the long Labor Day weekend, volume was light, with only
211m shares traded on the Big Board. The thin trading conditions were also
partly reflected in the market's unsure response to the day's economic news.
The headline figure was clearly positive for equities. The Labor Department
reported that non-farm payrolls had increased by 179,000, much less than
analysts had anticipated. The slow growth reinforced the view that monetary
policy was on hold at least until November. As a result, stocks made solid
progress in the early going.
But the tide quickly turned as a nit-picking bond market focused on elements
of the reports which suggested growing constraints on manufacturing
capacity, which could lead to inflation.
A weaker dollar was no help, either. Soon bonds reversed their early gains
and slipped into negative territory.
Equity investors needed no further excuse to lock in profits after the
market's recent surge. Blue chip stocks were showing shallow losses by early
afternoon, but the damage worsened in the final hours. Caterpillar fared
badly, retreating Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 113 1/4 .
IBM slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 67 while the rest of the technology
sector attempted to regroup after a broad-based pull-back the previous
session.
The hardest-hit issues improved marginally. AST Research, which had
triggered the sell-off with a profits warning, inched Dollars  3/16 ahead to
Dollars 13 1/4 .
Compaq Computer regained Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 35 1/8 after dropping
sharply on Thursday on suggestions that it was reducing orders from its
suppliers.
In semiconductors, Applied Materials bounced back on the Nasdaq, gaining
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 49 1/4 , but Texas Instruments dropped Dollars 1 to
Dollars 75 3/4 . Most software stocks floundered. Microsoft receded Dollars
 1/16 to Dollars 56.
Nextel dropped a further Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 22 1/2 . The downturn
followed a decision by MCI to withdraw from talks aimed at resurrecting a
plan to develop a national wireless communications network. Motorola, a
third company involved in the scheme, lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 51 3/4 . But
MCI added Dollars  1/4 to close at Dollars 24 1/4 .
Canada
Toronto prices closed little changed in moderate dealings ahead of the Labor
Day long weekend. The TSE-300 composite index fell 0.12 points to close at
4,344.22.
Advancing issues outnumbered declines 382 to 315. Volume was 62.46m shares
down from 76.40m, and trading value fell to CDollars 640.3m from CDollars
862.3m.
On the week, the index rose about 40 points.
Taiga Forest Products jumped CDollars 1 3/8 to CDollars 10 3/4 . The company
said Berjaya Group (Cayman) Ltd. offered to purchase up to 60 per cent of
Taiga's shares for CDollars 13.50 a share.
Cott Corp. jumped another CDollars 2 3/8 to CDollars 19 1/8 , after a rise
of CDollars 1 7/8 yesterday. The stock has been on the rise since Donaldson
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities issued an initial rating of 'buy' on the stock
early yesterday.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Leyland Trucks to invest Pounds
25m in new range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dutch and UK truck companies created out of the collapse of the Daf group
last year are increasing their profits and making a first significant
investment in a new range.
Leyland Trucks Manufacturing, the UK truck maker rescued by a management
buy-out last year, says it will spend Pounds 25m (Dollars 38.25m) to design
and develop a medium-sized truck range to be built at its Leyland,
Lancashire, headquarters.
Most of the new vehicles will be for delivery to Daf Trucks, the Dutch truck
maker also revived - with Dutch and Belgian government finance - from the
Daf collapse.
The UK company has a long-term contract with the revived Dutch manufacturer
under which Daf Trucks sells and services all Leyland-produced trucks in
Europe.
The new truck range, to be called the 55 Series, will replace the
Dutch-built Daf 1300 and 1700 vehicles, providing Leyland with its
first-ever continental sales in the medium, 11-15 tonnes sector of the
European truck market.
The announcement came as Daf Trucks reported a net profit for the first half
of Fl 39.2m (Dollars 22m) on turnover of Fl 924.2m. Daf in March reported a
net profit of only Fl 10.8m in a truncated first financial year.
Mr Cor Baan, Daf chairman, told a meeting of the company's 3,654 employees
in Eindhoven that the results 'are in accordance with the general lines of
the business plan and they also reflect the growing confidence in the
company'.
About a week ago Leyland Trucks' chief executive, Mr John Gilchrist, also
reported that the UK company had made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.4m for
its first 11 months to end-April on a turnover of Pounds 148.6m.
Daf delivered 7,282 trucks in the first half of the year; 4,607 from the
Eindhoven plant and 2,675 comprising 45 Series vehicles from Leyland. Mr
Baan said Daf had marginally increased its share of the European truck
market over 6 tonnes to 6.8 per cent.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Volvo to take over German bus
maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo, the Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, is taking over
Drogmoller, the German bus manufacturer, in a move which accelerates the
rapid concentration of the European bus industry.
Mr Bjorn Larsson, president of Volvo Bus, said the takeover of Drogmoller, a
maker of luxury tourist coaches with a turnover last year of DM56m (Dollars
36m) and a workforce of 250, was an important step in the Swedish group's
effort to break into the German market, which is dominated by Mercedes-Benz
and MAN, the domestic German commercial vehicle makers.
The big European truck and bus makers are moving quickly to consolidate
their hold on the small, and hitherto independent, bus and coach body
builders in Europe, in order to guarantee the outlets for their chassis and
drivelines (engines and gearboxes).
The Volvo acquisition is the latest in a flurry of recent deals, most
notably Mercedes-Benz's takeover of Kassbohrer, the German coach maker which
markets its products under the Setra brandname.
In recent days Scania, the Swedish truck and bus maker, has taken over DAB,
a Danish body builder, while Volvo agreed the takeover of Aabenraa, another
Danish bus body builder, from Kassbohrer, shortly before the German group
was itself acquired by Mercedes-Benz. Separately Berkhof, the Dutch bus and
coach maker has taken over its smaller, troubled Belgian rival Jonckheere.
Volvo had tried for two years to break into the German coach market, using
Berkhof bodies on its own chassis but with little success, said Mr Larsson.
Drogmoller was the last independent German coach builder and offered the
last acquisition opportunity.
Volvo was aiming to increase its share of the German bus and coach market to
more than 5 per cent in the next two to three years from less than 1 per
cent at present, said Mr Larsson.

VA Technologie, the Austrian plant engineering group privatised and floated
in May, has reported first-half net income of Sch286m (Dollars 26m), up 68
per cent year-on-year.
Pre-tax profit was 50 per cent higher at Sch307m on sales of Sch10.2bn, up
40 per cent. New orders were 10 per cent ahead to Sch17.1bn and the order
backlog at end-June stood at Sch56.8bn, 5 per cent higher.
The group said the largest part of its turnover would be achieved in the
second half, and forecast higher full-year profits. 'This will enable a
shareholder-friendly dividend policy,' it said.
The Austrian government sold 51 per cent of the shares in VA Tech, formerly
part of the Austrian Industries combine, in May, raising Sch6.9bn.

<TEXT>
Montedison, the Italian industrial conglomerate, plans to take direct
control of Eridania Beghin-Say, its agro-industrial subsidiary, by absorbing
Finanziaria Agroindustriale, the vehicle for the group's Eridania shares.
The merger will further simplify the structure of the sprawling empire
inherited by the new board of Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), Montedison's
parent, following last year's near-collapse of the group. The structure
contains some 1,800 companies, many of them dormant investment vehicles.
Finagro is quoted on the Milan stock exchange, but nearly 95 per cent of its
shares are owned by Montedison or Ferfin. It controls just under 50 per cent
of Eridania, which is quoted in France and Italy, but some 63 per cent of
the voting rights.
If the operation is approved at a special Montedison shareholder meeting in
October, Finagro's few remaining shareholders will be offered Montedison
shares in exchange for their holdings. Montedison also plans to absorb four
tiny financial subsidiaries which house part of the group's Finagro stake.

Ares-Serono, the Geneva-based biotechnology drugs group, has reported
another sharp fall in profits in the second quarter. Net income from
continuing operations fell 39 per cent to Dollars 14.4m.
The group, which develops hormones for stimulating human fertility and beta
interferon-based drugs for multiple sclerosis and other diseases, has
continued to step up its research and development spending in spite of
weaker overall sales.
Sales in the second quarter were down 3 per cent to Dollars 168.2m, as a 50
per cent slide in sales in Italy offset substantial gains elsewhere. Italy
accounts for about a fifth of group sales, and a few important Ares products
have been removed from the list of those the government will pay for.
Meanwhile, R&amp;D spending jumped 38.6 per cent in the second quarter to
Dollars 37.3m.
In the first half, sales were down 5 per cent to Dollars 314.7m and net
income from continuing operations tumbled a third to Dollars 28.05m. The
group took a Dollars 9.6m charge on the sale of its diagnostics division in
the second quarter.

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Great-West Life are believed top

The successful bidder was expected to be announced by Confederation's
liquidator Peat Marwick Thorne. Confederation's domestic group business
generated premium income of CDollars 1bn (USDollars 700) last year and could
fetch up to CDollars 100m.
Metropolitan Life was also a bidder, but industry sources said it was not
likely to win.
Great-West, controlled by Power Corp of Canada, bought Confederation's US

FT  02 SEP 94 / World stock prices fall on worries over interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pessimism on the future direction of interest rates affected world financial
markets yesterday, in the wake of poor price data in the US, strong output
figures from Germany and a Bundesbank decision to leave official rates
unchanged.
Bond and equity prices fell in Germany, while in the US, long Treasury bond
prices and the Dow Jones Industrial Average drifted lower in early trading.
In London, the FT-SE 100 Index closed 34.8 points down at 3,216.5.
Equity markets started 1994 in bullish mood with many investors believing
that interest rates had further to fall, particularly in Europe. But the
Federal Reserve's five increases in interest rates, allied to the
unexpectedly strong rebound in European economies, has gradually made
investors less optimistic about the scope for further European cuts.
Some countries, such as Sweden and Italy, have been forced to raise rates
and in others, such as Britain, it is clear that the next move in rates will
be upwards.
Most analysts had expected the Bundesbank council at its fortnightly meeting
yesterday to leave official rates, including the repo rate, unchanged.
Nevertheless, figures showing that German industrial production had risen by
a monthly 2.2 per cent in July reinforced the views of those who believe
that German rates are very close to their bottom.
The Frankfurt Dax equity market index closed only 12.05 points down at
2,200.80, but dropped further in after-hours trading once the August US
National Association of Purchasing Management data were released. Although
those showed a fall in the overall index, indicating some slowing of the
pace of economic growth, the prices component rose to its highest level
since August 1988. Any sign of future US inflation raises fears that the
Federal Reserve will push for further increases in interest rates.
By 1pm New York time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 10.69 to
3,902.73. Combined with a fall in Treasury bond prices, the result was
downward pressure on the dollar, which fell against both the yen and the
D-Mark in European trading.
The early fall in the Dow also depressed European stock markets, with the
CAC 40 index closing 34.17 points lower at 2,034.91. The French market is
still suffering from the decision by four French banks this week to increase
their lending rates.

FT  02 SEP 94 / UAE clampdown clears shops of pirate videos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBAI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shops in the United Arab Emirates pulled pirated videos and cassettes off
the shelves to abide by the UAE's first copyright law which took effect
yesterday, Reuter reports from Dubai.
Merchants selling fake cassette tapes, videos and software had until
yesterday to abide by the law which says they must sell or rent only
copyrighted products. Goods which do not have proper copyright certificates
must be destroyed.
'From the first (of the month) onwards we can send out inspectors to look
for these kinds of irregularities. . . for copyright violations,' a Dubai
Department of Economy official said.
Penalties include confiscation of goods, jail terms and fines of up to
10,000 dirhams (Dollars 2,700).
One Ministry of Information official said inspectors had been sent out to
check that shops were not selling pirated goods but he did not say how many
were visited.
The UAE in March became a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, which has provisions to prevent the sale and trade of counterfeit
goods.
It has also came under pressure from its western trading partners to protect
trademarks and patents. The US estimates lost revenue of Dollars 156m a year
in the UAE due to copyright violations.
One video shop worker, Ali Haider, said ministry inspectors visited the shop
with a warning when the law was promulgated in March. Shops were given a
grace period until Thursday.
'Unfortunately we removed all the English films from the racks and are
selling only Hindi films,' he said, adding they were stored in a back room
but they might be re-exported.
One worker at a major supermarket in Abu Dhabi said the store re-exported
more than 100,000 tapes for which it did not own copyrights. He said they
were currently displaying only seven original titles but more were expected
next week.
'This is the last day you can buy the fake ones. . . at 15 dirhams (Dollars
4). The originals are 50 dirhams (Dollars 14),' he said.
At another branch of the same supermarket a supervisor said officials
cleared the shop of 50,000 dirhams worth of videos on Wednesday in
preparation for the new law.
It is intended to prevent unauthorised reproduction of works of literature,
art, films, video and audio tapes and software.
Juma Nabooda, Dubai's Chamber of Commerce president, said in a statement on
Wednesday that the UAE would start implementing Gatt articles yesterday to
coincide with the copyright law.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Control of Angola beyond Savimbi's grasp: But both sides may
have reason not to sign a peace accord now
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS SHAXSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The refugees now occupying Luanda's ruined Hotel Turismo can stand on its
rocket-shattered upper floors and view the nearby headquarters of Sonangol,
Angola's state oil company and the government's main financial support
against the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(Unita).
The Turismo used to house senior Unita rebel officers following a May 1991
peace agreement with the ruling MPLA government. But its shattered walls now
testify to the collapse of that peace. Unita's leader, Mr Jonas Savimbi, who
rejected defeat in UN-sponsored elections in late 1992, led his followers
back to war, leaving many of his officials stationed at the Turismo to die
in the ensuing MPLA onslaught.
More than nine months of peace talks in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, have
since aimed at ending Africa's longest-running war, which started soon after
Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975. For more than six months, UN
mediator Alioune Blondin Beye has been saying the two sides are close to a
deal.
Yet some observers in Luanda dismiss the talks as nothing more than a show
aimed at heading off tightened UN sanctions and at obscuring events on the
battlefield.
Both sides may have reason not to sign an accord now. Government generals,
advancing on the ground, could win back more land, while Unita's demands to
control the governorship of Huambo, their capital, have not been met.
The government's capture last month of key diamond areas around the
north-eastern town of Cafunfo dealt a powerful blow to the rebels, who use
diamonds to buy weapons. Last year some Dollars 250m (Pounds 166m) worth of
diamonds came out of Angola, mostly from the Cafunfo area.
The loss will not cut off all of Mr Savimbi's funds. The diamond fields are
huge and lawless; they swarm with small-time but well-armed diggers, many of
whom will remain loyal to the Unita cause.
But the defeats around Cafunfo, the loss of the northern provincial capital
of Ndalatando in early May, and other government victories underline the
rebels' weakness. The government thrusts into the north have been led by
freshly trained Angolan counter-insurgency commandos, with help from South
African and other mercenaries.
The besieged government garrison in the central highlands town of Cuito, in
the heart of traditional Unita territory, surrounded, starved and pounded by
heavy artillery for a year and a half, last month blasted rebel forces from
positions in the town centre and scattered them into the hills.
Mr Savimbi's western cold-war supporters have now gone home. The collapsed
1991 accords were part of a wider regional deal which linked the departure
of 50,000 Cuban troops, who had fought alongside the MPLA since 1975, with
the withdrawal of South African forces from Namibia, Angola's southern
neighbour. South Africa and Namibia are now ruled by traditional MPLA
allies.
The government produces more than 500,000 barrels a day of oil, last year
worth some Dollars 2.75bn, more than 60 per cent of which has gone directly
into the defence budget. Arms shipments from Spain, Israel, Brazil and the
former Soviet Union are being unloaded openly at Luanda's airport while
military units press gang teenagers onto army trucks in the streets of the
capital.
Unita's representative to the UN, Mr Gardo Muekalia, last week said he
expected a government offensive on Soyo, Angola's second-most productive oil
town which produced some 35,000 b/d before Unita captured it last year.
Yet Huambo still remains the key diplomatic and military prize. Unita refers
to Huambo as its 'Jerusalem' and sees control of the city as the key to any
peace agreement. But the government says its refusal to accept a Unita
governor in Huambo is 'not negotiable'.
Mr Savimbi appears unwilling, or unable, to concede what is demanded of him.
To be denied governorship of Huambo, after nearly 20 years of civil war, may
be impossible for him to sell to his generals and to his people.
He also knows the battle to control all Angola, by military or by electoral
means, is beyond his grasp. He may thus think his best hope is to carve out
a kingdom of his own centred on Huambo, its borders frozen in place by UN
peacekeepers called in, should a peace agreement be signed.
But the Luanda government and the outside world, afraid of a de facto
partition of Angola, want to avoid such Unita control at Huambo. UN
sanctions already ban supplies of fuel and arms to the rebels and they also
threaten to close down Unita bank accounts and offices abroad if the rebel
group does not give up demands to install its own governor in Huambo.
Mr Savimbi has said new sanctions will scotch the talks and the UN has
repeatedly backed down from applying them. The clear knowledge on both sides
that the war is unwinnable may prove enough incentive to find peace. The
government knows Mr Savimbi cannot be fully defeated. Even on a shoestring
budget his rebels can continue to make the countryside ungovernable.
But diplomats in Luanda also believe an agreement in Lusaka could be one of
the smaller hurdles on the road to a lasting peace in Angola.
The UN is trying to work out a formula for peace involving revival of the
1991 accords. But the extent of mistrust stirred up by the disaster of those
very accords has severely damaged chances of real peace. When Mr Savimbi
lost elections in 1992, he used stockpiles of weapons hidden in the bush to
storm back across much of Angola, overwhelming the largely demobilised
government forces in town after town. Neither side will find it easy to
disarm this time.
Many Unita soldiers who were in the Hotel Turismo and other parts of Luanda
when the war broke out again were hunted down and killed. 'They shot me in
my office,' Unita general Mukumba Gato, who escaped from Luanda with a
bullet in his arm, said in Huambo earlier this year. 'I am afraid to go
back.'

FT  02 SEP 94 / Climate talks end without accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Representatives from more than 150 nations will today end a two-week meeting
on the UN climate change treaty with no agreement on proposals to toughen
curbs on emissions of greenhouse gases.
This is despite a widespread acceptance by governments that existing curbs
are inadequate to prevent a dangerous atmospheric build-up of carbon dioxide
and other gases that cause global warming. 'It is clear that (present)
commitments are not adequate,' Mr Raul Estrada-Oyuela of Argentina, the
meeting chairman, said yesterday.
The 1992 climate change convention, now ratified by 93 nations, requires
developed countries to bring carbon dioxide emissions back to 1990 levels by
the year 2000. But no pledges are required for post-2000, nor do developing
countries yet have any obligations to cut emissions.
One group, led by Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, has been lobbying
for a new protocol to be adopted at the first conference of the parties to
the convention in Berlin next spring.
Germany's environment minister, Mr Klaus Topfer, this week proposed a 15-20
per cent cut in carbon dioxide emissions of industrialised nations by 2005.
But for a protocol to be adopted in Berlin, drafts must be circulated by
September 28, six months ahead. Conference officials said the US, Britain,
China, India and the petroleum-exporting countries were among those dragging
their heels.
Britain and the US are said to be holding out for a satisfactory deal on
'joint implementation', enabling them to meet part of their obligations by
financing projects to reduce third world emissions.
The Berlin meeting must decide on the permanent home of the convention
secretariat, provisionally based in Geneva. Geneva, Bonn and Montevideo have
made formal offers to host the secretariat, which will have a staff of 50
and an annual budget of Dollars 10m-Dollars 15m.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Iran presses Gulf states for tough security pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iran yesterday called for a 'defensive security' pact among Gulf countries,
which would include an accord to curb the build-up of conventional arms in
the region and the outlawing of weapons of mass destruction.
The proposal, the most detailed Iran has yet put forward, came in a speech
to the United Nations Disarmament Conference by Mr Ali Akbar Velayati,
foreign minister. However, it is likely to get a cool reception from Iran's
Arab neighbours who distrust Tehran's brand of Islamic radicalism and its
perceived ambitions for regional superpower status.
Yesterday's initiative reflects Tehran's concern at its exclusion from
existing Gulf security arrangements since the defeat of Iraq in 1991 and its
desire to reduce US influence in the region.
Iran, which has been seeking to rebuild its armed forces since the
devastating eight-year war with Iraq ended in 1988, has viewed with disquiet
the heavy armaments spending by Gulf states aimed at deterring Tehran's
territorial claims and meeting any threat from Iraq.
Mr Velayati said more than Dollars 40bn (Pounds 25.8bn) worth of armaments
was flowing into the Arab Gulf states, the highest rate of arms purchase in
the world.
'Something must be done to stop this senseless arms race,' he said.
The first step towards a defensive security pact would be the creation of a
regional security forum where 'threat perceptions and security concerns'
could be aired openly and confidence-building measures discussed.
To pave the way for a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction all
states in the region should renew their commitment to renouncing nuclear
weapons, join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and ratify the United
Nations convention which outlaws chemical weapons.
More controversially, Mr Velayati urged 'regional provisions' to guard
against cheating on nuclear, chemical and biological arms.
On conventional arms, the proposal was more tentative. Mr Velayati said
possible measures included an exchange of information on weapons stocks,
agreement to cut military spending and a ceiling on arms imports.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Mexico high-level drug claim denied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The office of Mexico's attorney-general has dismissed allegations by one of
its former high-ranking employees that senior government and party officials
are involved with drug traffickers.
Mr Eduardo Valle, until earlier this year a senior aide in the office, has
alleged that a cabinet minister has links with the powerful Gulf of Mexico
drug cartel.
Mr Valle's accusations appear to be based on at least one meeting which the
minister is known to have had with a 31-year-old Mexican woman.
Some investigators see an involvement by Mr Juan Garca Abrego, one of the
most powerful of Mexico's drug barons.
Mr Valle, who resigned from the attorney-general's office after claiming
that his efforts to investigate the cartel were being blocked by other
police officials, has further alleged that the security team of Mr Luis
Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's presidential candidate who was
assassinated this year, had been infiltrated by the Gulf cartel. Mr Valle
believes that the cartel may have ordered the assassination.
Mr Valle has also criticised the new attorney-general for appointing drug
enforcement agents who, in Mr Valle's opinion, are protectors of drug
traffickers.
The attorney-general's office interviewed Mr Valle last week in Washington,
where he is now living. It then stated there was a 'lack of evidence to
determine any responsibility of public servants mentioned by Mr Eduardo
Valle in whatever activity connected with the so-called Gulf Cartel.'
It said there was no evidence to suggest Mr Colosio's security team had been
infiltrated by drug traffickers.
Mr Valle had been hired by Mr Jorge Carpizo, a former attorney-general and
now the interior minister. Mr Valle is a former leftist student leader and
politician, and officials have sought to discredit him as unreliable and
possibly unstable.
His accusations have generated wide publicity in Mexico's independent press
but state-controlled radio and television have been instructed to keep him
off the air. A prominent radio host was recently fired for interviewing Mr
Valle.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (30): A test for control systems - A
look at the implications of Asia Pacific's surge in air travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In June, Singapore Airlines (SIA) announced one of the world's biggest
aircraft orders. The national carrier would buy 22 Boeing 747-400 Megatops
and 30 Airbus A340-300E aircraft, with a total price-tag of Dollars 10.3bn.
SIA said the aircraft were needed because of expected passenger growth of
between 8 and 10 per cent a year in the coming decade. Mr Cheong Choong
Kong, SIA's managing director, described the order as 'an expression of our
faith in the long-term health of the aviation industry and the promising
future of SIA.'
Airlines throughout the Asia Pacific region are expanding to meet surging
passenger demand. The International Air Transport Association (Iata)
predicts that passenger numbers in the region will double between now and
2000.
While passenger traffic is growing by 5 per cent a year in North America and
under 4 per cent a year in Europe, in Asia the figure is closer to 9 per
cent. Asian markets now account for about 25 per cent of world air travel.
By early next century that figure is likely to exceed 40 per cent.
Several factors have caused the upsurge. The main stimulus has been the
economic growth of most countries in the area. China's economy has been
expanding by more than 12 per cent a year. Singapore's grew by nearly 10 per
cent last year. The economies of Malaysia and Thailand have expanded by more
than 8 per cent in each of the last five years.
Economic growth means more business activity and more business travel. It
also means rising income levels, with people having greater opportunity to
travel. In China alone air traffic increased by 35 per cent in 1992, and by
more than 20 per cent last year.
Another factor influencing traffic levels has been the lifting of various
travel restrictions in many countries: citizens of Taiwan, South Korea and
perhaps most significantly China no longer face severe curtailments on
movement outside their countries. Business people travelling in the region
face fewer immigration barriers. Intra-Asia tourism is now one of the
region's key growth industries.
Vietnam Airlines, the state carrier, reports that it carried 320,000 foreign
passengers during the first six months of this year - more than the total
carried in 1992.
Most of the region's carriers have ambitious expansion programmes. However,
they have not been immune to the problems that have faced airlines
elsewhere. Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific reported a 24 per cent drop in net
earnings last year. Malaysia Airlines' pre-tax profits for the year to March
1994 fell by 90 per cent. Over the same period, pre-tax profits at Singapore
Airlines, consistently one of the world's most profitable carriers, dipped
7.7 per cent to Dollars 555m.
The profits slump was blamed on a combination of recession in western
markets, plus intense competition and adverse currency factors. Many
carriers now realise that their passenger forecasts and consequent expansion
plans of a few years ago were too optimistic.
Officials at Malaysia Airlines privately admit that a Dollars 10.6bn
aircraft purchase programme, which started in the early 1990s, has put
severe financial strain on the company. Malaysia Airlines, Thai Airways,
Philippine Airlines and Garuda, Indonesia's national carrier, have all had
to defer or cancel some aircraft deliveries.
Asia's carriers have met increasing competition from outside the region.
Faced with tough conditions at home, carriers from the US, and to a lesser
extent from Europe, have turned to the lucrative Asia market. Asia's big
state-controlled carriers have also been hurt by competition from the
region's new airlines, such as Eva in Taiwan and Asiana in South Korea.
In partial response to the growth in competition, the region's larger
carriers have improved levels of service and introduced frequent flyer
programmes. Passengers who have long complained that Asia has some of the
most expensive air routes in the world are relieved to find carriers
undercutting ticket costs.
Other problems haunt the Asia Pacific's carriers. Thomas S. Windmuller,
assistant director of the Air Transport Action Group, believes the region's
airline industry is in danger of 'strangling on its own success'. Mr
Windmuller says that forecasts for passenger growth in the region are based
on the assumption that there will be sufficient airspace systems and
airports capable of handling the upsurge in traffic.
However, there is an urgent need for Asia Pacific governments to standardise
aerospace regulations and co-ordinate traffic-control systems. Once in the
air, the passenger may be able to sit back and enjoy the service for which
Asia's airlines are known. But facilities in the air are not matched by
infrastructure on the ground.
Iata says only two of the main air-traffic hubs in the region - Singapore
and Taipei - are capable of coping with expected passenger growth. Many
countries in the region are either expanding existing airport facilities or
building entirely new ones. However, until these are opened there is likely
to be more congestion - and more frustration among passengers.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (29): Indonesia points the way - Asia
Pacific is a bright spot for the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The past few years have been tough ones for the aerospace industry. The
commercial market has been languishing, with airlines forced to cut back on
aircraft deliveries due to lower-than-anticipated passenger growth. The end
of the cold war has led to wholesale cuts in defence expenditure - and in
the purchase of military aircraft.
The bright spot among the gloom has been the Asia Pacific region. Aerospace
executives realised long ago that the region was the area of growth:
according to latest forecasts by Boeing, Asian airlines are expected to
acquire up to 3,000 aircraft, valued at Dollars 245bn, between now and 2010.
It is expected that, by the end of the century, Asia will surpass the US as
the world's largest commercial jet market.
At the same time, many countries in the region - particularly in south-east
Asia - are strengthening their defence forces and making big expenditures on
military aircraft. 'This region is the salvation of our industry,' said a
Singapore-based aerospace executive. 'If an aerospace company is not selling
into this region, then its future has to be bleak.'
Countries in the region have realised that their increased purchasing power
has given them considerable influence over the world's aerospace companies.
Many countries have ambitions to develop their own aerospace industries.
Purchases - whether of commercial or military aircraft - are linked
increasingly to technology transfer and so-called 'offset' arrangements,
which guarantee that purchasing countries can participate in various stages
of aircraft manufacture.
A recent report by the US general accounting office, carried out for the
Congressional committee on science, space and technology, found that, though
countries in Asia are likely to be dependent on western aeronautics
technology for some years, the region is developing a strong industry which
could pose future problems for US manufacturers such as Boeing and McDonnell
Douglas.
'Once acquired, these technologies can be honed and improved upon,' says the
report. 'Consequently, what starts as a subcontract to produce latches on
cargo doors, for instance, develops over time to fuselage, wing and avionics
manufacturing.'
Indonesia's Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN) is the only company in
south-east Asia at present producing its own aircraft. It already
manufactures the CN235 transport aircraft in co-operation with Casa of
Spain. Later this year, the 70-seat CN250 is due to be rolled out of IPTN's
giant complex at Bandung, on Java. The CN250 will be the first commercial
aircraft to be designed and built entirely in Indonesia.
The Indonesian economy is rapidly expanding. The country, the world's third
most populous, stretching across an area wider than the US coast to coast,
has a growing appetite for aircraft.
Mr Bacharuddin Habibie, Indonesia's minister of research and technology and
the driving force behind the growth of IPTN, is known in the aerospace
industry as 'Mr Offset'. Mr Habibie, who has many critics, both within and
outside Indonesia, for the way he has poured millions into high-technology
projects, has established a wide range of collaborative agreements with
foreign companies, and is demanding increasing amounts of technology
transfer. He is also determined to take on the western companies.
'I have tried to sell IPTN aircraft in the US,' says Mr Habibie. 'The US
says it's an open market, but it has so many built-in regulations that I can
never sell an aircraft there. This is why I have to set up a company in the
US to produce, assemble and sell our aircraft there.'
Both Malaysia and Thailand are rapidly upgrading their aerospace industries.
Increasing amounts of commercial aircraft repair and maintenance can now be
carried out in either Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur. Again, both countries have
insisted that, if they are going to buy commercial and military aircraft,
aerospace companies must, in return, establish local training and
manufacturing centres.
Recently McDonnell Douglas entered into a wide-ranging agreement to help
Malaysia develop its aerospace industry. Last year, Malaysia placed orders
for eight F/A-18D fighter jets from the US company, as part of its
modernisation programme. Malaysia has also reached collaborative
manufacturing, maintenance and technology-transfer agreements with the
Russians as a result of purchasing 18 MiG-29s.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has been stressing the need
to develop an aerospace industry. Malaysia plans to manufacture initially
two small two-seater aircraft and a 14-seater amphibious aircraft. 'These
are undoubtedly small beginnings,' says Dr Mahathir, 'but in a century's
time we may have our Boeing and McDonnell Douglas counterpart. . . A
beginning has to be made.'
Singapore was the first country in south-east Asia to develop an aerospace
industry. More than 50 companies are involved in what is now a highly
sophisticated aerospace sector. According to the government's economic
development board (EDB), the aerospace industry grew by 6.2 per cent last
year with a total output of SDollars 1.25bn (Dollars 800m).
The facilities provided at Changi - consistently rated as one of the world's
most efficient airports - plus the availability of a highly skilled
workforce - have been essential elements in making Singapore into one of the
key aircraft overhaul and maintenance centres in the Asia Pacific region.
While Singapore does not have ambitions to produce its own aircraft, it has
achieved some notable manufacturing successes. For example, Airbus A320
cabin doors, A340 engine mounts and landing-gear doors for the new Boeing
777 are now manufactured on the island.
However, Singapore faces constraints on manpower and space. Many airlines
and aerospace companies locating regional operations in Indonesia, Malaysia
or China, where wages are considerably lower.
Moreover, competition does not come only from the region. 'European
companies are very, very hungry and are slashing prices to rock-bottom,'
says an executive at one of Singapore's biggest aerospace companies. 'At the
end of the day, it will be a case of who can give the best in price,
turnaround time and quality.'
Singapore's industrial planners have a dual response to the challenges their
aerospace industry faces. One way to combat the competition is to go into
increasingly sophisticated high-tech areas of the industry. The other is to
go regional - forming joint ventures with other countries and companies,
particularly in labour-intensive areas.
Such ventures have already been formed in India. Late last year, Singapore
Engineering, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, took a 10
per cent stake in a Dollars 63m aircraft repair and maintenance facility in
China. Not only does this give the Singapore company the advantage of being
able to recruit workers at less than two thirds the rates in the island
republic; it will also give Singapore important access to the world's
fastest growing aerospace market.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (25): Important vote of confidence -
Germany: A look at positive moves to revive the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For an industry undergoing its most severe crisis since the 1960s, the
appointment of Jurgen Schrempp as the next chief executive of Daimler-Benz
amounts to a considerable vote of confidence.
He is the man who, as head of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the dominant force
in the German aerospace industry, has been responsible for the radical
reorganisation of much of the sector into one of Daimler's most important
subsidiaries. And now, in the past 18 months, he has been the man forced to
embark on sweeping and painful cuts in that same operation to cope with the
downturn, drawing up plans to close six plants and lay off 16,000 workers.
The truth is that the success or failure of Mr Schrempp's overhaul is still
in the balance, but Daimler, Germany's mightiest industrial empire, has
clearly decided that the job has been well done.
Dasa, which includes Deutsche Aerospace Airbus, the German part of the
Airbus Industrie consortium, and a half share in the Eurocopter consortium,
as well as famous names such as Messerschmidt-Bolkow-Blohm (MBB), the
country's main military aircraft contractor, a majority stake in Dornier,
manufacturer of medium-range turboprop aircraft, Fokker, its Dutch
counterpart, and Motoren und Turbinen Union (MTU), the aircraft engine
manufacturer, will remain an essential part of the empire and its boss, Mr
Schrempp, will succeed Edzard Reuter next year at its helm.
The decision of the Daimler-Benz supervisory board in June coincided with
the successful conclusion of Mr Schrempp's negotiations with the trade
unions at Dasa to close six of its 16 plants, and cut 10,300 of the 16,000
jobs it needs to shed by 1996. The last year has been traumatic for Dasa, as
it has been for the rest of the aerospace sector.
Overall employment in the sector stood at 78,500 on December 31, 1992, and
fewer than 72,900 by the end of last year. At least 10 per cent more jobs
will have been shed by the end of the present year, according to the
calculations of the BDLI, the German aerospace and defence industry
federation. The sharpest cuts have been in the military sector  - down 13.8
per cent in 1993 - and in the space sector, down 10.3 per cent in the year.
As for turnover in the industry, according to the BDLI figures, it was down
even more sharply, by 18 per cent from DM26.77bn to DM21.95bn in 1992 alone.
The sector was hit, like the industry worldwide, by the coincidence of a
sharp recession in civil aviation and drastic cuts in defence spending, as
governments sought to reap the dividends of the end of the cold war. It has
galvanised a traditionally secretive and somewhat self-satisfied industry in
Germany into urgent public lobbying to protect its position, on the grounds
that the country could lose its access to a vast area of vital high
technology if it allows the aerospace sector to be marginalised once again,
as it was after the second world war.
Mr Schrempp has been one of the most vigorous campaigners for more coherent
and overt government support for the industry, alongside Wolfgang Piller,
his fellow Dasa director and president of the BDLI. Above all, they have
argued that European governments must be prepared to back the industry with
the same level of indirect support - through defence spending, and subsidies
for research and development - as the US government does for its aerospace
manufacturers.
The recent decision by the German government to back a DM1.2bn four-year
research and development programme - to be half financed by the industry -
was described by Mr Piller as a 'first step' in the right direction. But he
pointed out that in the US, the NASA budget for aerospace research had
increased from Dollars 512m in 1991 to more than Dollars 1bn in the current
year, with a target of Dollars 1.4bn by 1998. US Defence department spending
on research and development in aerospace are estimated by the BDLI at around
Dollars 1.4-1.6bn per year. Hitherto, the comparable sums in Germany added
up to just DM16m a year.
Speaking at the Wehrkunde security conference in Munich this year, Mr
Schrempp issued an urgent plea for fairer and more open competition between
Europe and the US in armaments and aerospace industries. 'We do not need a
preference Europeenne, which would eventually cut us off from developments
in top-notch technology outside Europe,' he argued. 'What we need is a level
playing field with our US competitors.'
This meant, he argued, overcoming the national fragmentation of the European
markets in defence and civil aerospace manufacture. And his whole strategy
at Dasa has clearly been focused on that aim.
In each sector, he has actively promoted cross-border co-operation. Not just
in the Airbus consortium, but also in Eurocopter, the Franco-German joint
venture set to start deliveries of its seven-seater, twin-engined light
helicopter, the EC135, in 1996. He has pushed through the takeover of
Fokker, the proudly independent Dutch aircraft manufacturer, to rationalise
production in the turboprop sector, and is now talking of possible
collaboration in satellites and guided missiles, with France's Aerospatiale.
In spite of the painful and costly experience of the Eurofighter project -
still on track in spite of the German government's prevarication - Mr
Schrempp is a vigorous supporter of the plan for a joint European project
for the next generation of military transport aircraft, the so-called Future
Large Aircraft (FLA).
He has used the industrial muscle of Daimler-Benz to force the German
aerospace industry to match its competitors in Britain and France.
Thus within the Airbus consortium, he fought strenuously to raise the German
profile, succeeding in winning the contract for final assembly of the most
recent A321 Airbus model for his own Hamburg plant. Previously all Airbus
aircraft were assembled at Toulouse.
The importance of the move for the German industry was underlined by the
ceremony in January, when Lufthansa, the national carrier, became the first
airline to take delivery of an A321. German manufacturers have been firm
backers of Lufthansa's privatisation, on the grounds that a strong and
profitable national airline is a vital underpinning for a strong national
aerospace industry.
However, Mr Schrempp's strategy at Dasa has also underlined his perception
of the limitations of the European industry. He has pushed through the
alliance between MTU and the US aero-engine giant Pratt and Whitney, in an
effort to compete with the BMW-Rolls-Royce alliance. He was a prime mover
behind the decision to open talks between Airbus and Boeing on joint
development of the next generation of super jumbos. And he has also brought
about an alliance in a key market, by setting up a joint venture in
satellite and space systems manufacture with China.
So far, none of that frantic activity has shown up in the bottom line. Dasa
suffered a record net loss of DM694m in 1993, more than double that of the
previous year. It will still be in the red in the current year. But Mr
Schrempp is adamant that it will be back in the black by 1995.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (28): Breathing space for Fokker - The
Netherlands / The company believes that demand will pick up in 1996 and that
total sales in its segment of the market will reach 2,000 in the next 10
years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, recently secured some financial
breathing space as it awaits the recovery on the international aviation
market which it predicts will emerge in 1996.
In July, Deutsche Aerospace (DASA), the company's German controlling
shareholder, agreed to inject some Fl 600m (Dollars 345m) into Fokker to
shore up its balance sheet.
The Dutch government, which owns a minority stake in Fokker, did not
participate directly in the refinancing, but it did approve a Fl 400m
'sale-and-lease-back' of the company's technology to Rabobank, the big Dutch
co-operative bank.
In all, the Fl 1bn will boost shareholders' equity from just 11 per cent of
Fokker's balance sheet to 27 per cent, enabling the company to cope with the
malaise that continues to affect the industry.
Fokker believes that demand for new aircraft will pick up in 1996 and that
total sales of aircraft in its segment of the market will reach 2,000 over
the next 10 years.
Meanwhile, Fokker, like other international aircraft makers, has been hit by
sluggish demand, fierce price competition and the need to shed employees and
reduce output while the market's weakness continues.
In 1993, these problems sent Fokker into a record net loss of Fl 460m from a
slim profit of Fl 20m the year before, and turnover dropped to Fl 3.7bn from
Fl 4.1bn.
Much of the red ink was caused by a provision of Fl 275m taken to cover the
cost of selling aircraft at reduced prices to cut its stock.
Since then, it has introduced a new policy of completing the assembly of
only those aircraft that have been firmly ordered. The move is part of a
wider project to enhance production efficiency and flexibility at the
company's plant near Amsterdam Schiphol Airport.
Fokker also took a charge of Fl 90m to finance a further round of job cuts
in the first half of 1994.
The company's workforce has fallen to below 10,000 from more than 13,000 at
the beginning of the 1990s.
The trend towards increased leasing, rather than outright sales, of aircraft
has also strained Fokker's balance sheet.
This partly reflects the lack of down payments that used to accompany a firm
order for the purchase of an aircraft.
To meet the challenge of leasing, Fokker hopes to set up a separate leasing
company at arm's length from the company but with the participation of DASA
and a couple of banks.
The Dutch government, which is due to sell its remaining Fokker shares in
less than three years' time, has already said that it will not be a
shareholder of the leasing company.
The July refinancing of Fokker, which must still be approved by DASA's
parent, the Daimler-Benz group, is one of the most significant fruits so far
of the April 1993 deal which brought the Dutch company under German control.
The deal, though contro-versial at the time in the Netherlands, was the
result of the Dutch government's repeated assertion that it could no longer
afford to finance Fokker's future and that the company needed to find itself
a strong industrial partner.
Since then, another important change at the company has been the arrival of
a new chairman, Ben van Schaik, a former executive in Mercedes-Benz's
commercial vehicles business, to replace Erik-Jan Nederkoorn, the original
architect of the German takeover who later became embroiled in a damaging
boardroom row.
At the same time, Fokker pressed ahead with the formal launch of its latest
aircraft, the 79-seat Fokker 70, which joins its two existing aeroplanes,
the Fokker 50 and the Fokker 100.
Given the uncertain conditions prevailing on the aviation market, however,
no decision has yet been taken on Fokker's long-standing wish to develop a
130-seater Fokker 130.
The certification process for the new Fokker 70 is under way.
In July, the first series-produced aircraft had its maiden flight and then
joined the test programme that had already begun with the prototype
aircraft.
The first delivery of a Fokker 70 to launch customer, Sempati Air of
Indonesia, is expected in early 1995. Other orders have also been received
from airlines in the US and Europe.
The Fokker 70 is based largely on the Fokker 100, and the two aircraft are
being built on the same assembly line using tooling equipment and working
areas that make such mixed production possible.
This configuration is designed to increase flexibility. Indeed, in the
second half of next year Fokker's customers ordering either the Fokker 70 or
Fokker 100 can decide which of the two aeroplanes they want until 12 months
before delivery.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (26): Alenia slims its workforce -
Italy: A look at the consequences of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Times are hard in Italian aerospace. Employment figures at Alenia, the
state-controlled business that dominates the national industry, illustrate
the severity of the recession over the past four years.
When Aeritalia, with its predominantly aero activities, merged with Selenia
(mainly electronics and defence) to form Alenia at the end of 1990, the
aggregate workforce was just over 30,000. Alenia now has 26,000 on its
books, of whom 3,000 are currently drawing benefits from the cassa
integrazione guadagni labour lay-off fund and will never return to the
drawing offices and production lines.
'I hope that we have seen the end of traumatic changes and that the 23,000
effective workforce is the floor,' says Fausto Cereti, Alenia's head.
However, he recognises the generalised and continuing downward trend in
jobs. 'Clearly, productivity is more likely to rise than fall. Competitors
do not stand still, and the industry throughout the world is reducing its
workforce.
'We are adapting our organisation and programmes to the enormous changes
that the market is undergoing, both in terms of customers' spending levels
and the entry of new suppliers,' explains Mr Cereti.
He notes that Alenia has been suffering from a recession that has hit civil
and defence activities simultaneously. 'The crisis in civil aviation and the
drop in aircraft orders has not been counter-balanced by an increase in
defence budgets. People have wanted the peace dividend since the fall of the
Berlin Wall,' says Alenia's head. He does not foresee increased defence
spending. 'Improvements on the defence side will come from reductions in
production capacity.'
Yet in February this year, Alenia's Finmeccanica parent, a sub-holding of
the IRI state holding corporation, completed the acquisition of the defence
interests belonging to the bankrupt EFIM state holding corporation. With
Agusta helicopters, Agusta Omi, Oto Melara Officine Galileo and Breda
Meccanica Bresciana now inescapably part of Finmeccanica, scope for further
rationalisation seem greater.
However, the outlook is not completely black. 'The civil market is giving
signs of upturn. The situation is far from brilliant, but it is better than
two years ago,' observes Mr Cereti. He believes that Alenia should start to
see a healthier flow of orders around the beginning of next year.
Much is still expected from its successful ATR joint venture with France's
Aerospatiale. Firm orders for the ATR 42 and ATR 72 regional commuter
aircraft stood at 422 at the end of last year, and further sales have since
been achieved. 'The programme is going very well and is doing better than
break even. The ATR 42 is being quietened by installing a six-bladed
propeller, and we are considering completing the range with a cargo/military
version and an 82-seater,' says Mr Cereti.
Alenia's head executive says that ATR would welcome new partners. 'Italians
would rather dine in the company of 10 than three. It is more congenial,'
remarks Mr Cereti. He adds that ATR is sounding out other aerospace
companies, and that British Aerospace would closely fit the identikit of an
ideal partner.
Although Alenia puts the spotlight on the ATR programme, mundane business
counts for more in money terms. The elderly G222 transporter and maintenance
work provided 14 per cent of aerospace revenues last year, against the ATR's
7 per cent. Manufacture of aircraft components for Boeing, MDD and Airbus
also contributed more to the accounts, with 9 per cent of total aerospace
revenues.
Co-operation with other makers is a characteristic of the Italian state
concern. It is anomalous therefore that its role in Airbus is relatively
small, recent and not risk-sharing.
This is unlikely to change soon. 'Airbus has difficulties in filling the
capacity of its partners. But perhaps there will be space for Alenia in a
new Airbus programme,' says Mr Cereti.
Yet the ATR programme, the G222 transporter, aircraft maintenance and the
manufacture of components together only contribute the same level of
revenues as military aircraft alone. This sector is the biggest contributor
to Alenia's aerospace revenues, with 30 per cent of the total. The business
overall is highly dependent on the AMX light tactical fighter, the Tornado,
the F104 upgrade and, most critical, the Eurofighter.
Alenia is pinning its hopes on EFA, as Mr Cereti makes clear. About 15,000
workers will be employed on the programme when it is under way. He warns
that EFA production must commence next year in order that design,
development and manufacturing capability shall not be put at risk. Alenia
has an urgent need for orders to absorb capacity.
'It is not possible to close facilities and then re-open them when EFA is
ready. But is there willingness to pay the costs of maintaining idle plant?'
asks Mr Cereti.
Moreover, if or when EFA does enter production, Italy's state aerospace
business will be working to a much smaller order book than it expected when
the project started. 'EFA numbers will be fewer than were initially
foreseen. Italy planned to take 180, and this was a minimum. There were
expectations of further purchases. Now Italy says it will take 130, and this
is the maximum,' says Mr Cereti, anticipating further cuts.
What these critical times have done to Alenia's profit and loss account is
unclear. Its last accounts were for 1991, when it reported L56bn (Pounds
23m) post-tax profit on sales of L4,812bn. It has since been merged into its
Finmeccanica parent, which has not disclosed figures for Alenia.
With the consolidated profit and loss account of stock market-quoted
Finmeccanica crashing from L186bn on sales of L11,791bn in 1992 to just
L33bn on sales of L10,772bn last year, its aerospace activities were
probably heavily in deficit. Indeed, Mr Cereti acknowledges that conditions
were much better three or four years ago.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (27): Partners hope for exports -
Sweden: A look at the recovery from the Gripen crash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The frightening spectacle last August of Sweden's new JAS 39 Gripen fighter
aircraft veering crazily out of control over thousands of spectators and
crashing pilotless in Stockholm's inner suburbs could hardly have come at a
worse time for its manufacturers.
The aeroplane that crashed was number 39.102, the first to be delivered to
the Swedish Airforce after a full year's delay and heavy cost overruns in
the development schedule of the fighter. With the vital first export order
still unsecured, the crash appeared to be a disastrous setback for the four
Swedish partners making the JAS - Saab-Scania, Volvo Flygmotor, Ericsson
Radar Electronics and FFV Aerotech, part of the Celsius group.
A year later, however, the consortium believes it has largely put the
effects of the crash behind it. The export breakthrough has still not
occured, but the JAS makers insist its credentials as a high performance,
but relatively low-cost all-purpose fighter can capture a large chunk of the
market for new combat aircraft over the next six years.
An official investigation into the JAS crash - during which the pilot
ejected safely and, miraculously, no one on the ground was hurt - concluded
that it was caused by 'insufficient margins in the flight control system
software' that led to 'a conflict between the pilot's commands and flight
control system signals'. In other words, the aircraft did not do what the
pilot told it to do.
The consortium introduced a new edition of the flight control system
software, and test flights were resumed last December. At the beginning of
this year, a parliamentary commission set up to examine the JAS project gave
it the green light to proceed.
Hans Ahlinder, general manager of Saab Military Aircraft, says those within
the industry in Sweden and abroad accept that the problems have been ironed
out, and that there should be no significant sales fall-out from the crash.
'Everybody has some crashes during aircraft development. There is no bad
will for the JAS 39,' he insists.
The crash did add some SKr100m to the cost of development. But this was not
a large amount in the context of the SKr60.2bn (Pounds 5m) cost of
developing and producing the first batch of 30 of the JAS, of which the
consortium bore almost two thirds and the rest was borne by the state.
The Swedish Air Force ordered a further 110 aircraft in 1992, in a deal
worth SKr18bn. The air force is being extensively restructured and slimmed
to 16 squadrons, but all these are to be equipped with the JAS 39, giving
the consortium the prospect of another 150 domestic orders.
But for the consortium - especially Saab-Scania, easily the biggest partner
 -the key to a significant payback from the JAS project lies in the export
market. Here the ambitious target is to capture up to 500 overseas sales by
the end of the century. Just how ambitious this is can be gauged from the
consortium's own projections, which show original estimates of 3,000
worldwide combat aircraft replacements by the year 2000 falling to as low as
1,500.
Mr Ahlinder believes the 500 target remains realistic. He says the JAS 39
occupies a niche which will make it attractive to air forces looking for a
combination of performance and economy.
The JAS 39 is designed to be fully qualified for attack, fighter and
reconnaissance missions, and is intended to be cheap to run and service. It
is priced below the other new-generation fighters now under development -
the Eurofighter 2000 (a joint German, British, Spanish and Italian project),
the French Rafale and the American F22.
But, as Saab-Scania acknowledged in its latest annual report, it will also
have to compete with upgraded versions of older aircraft such as the F16 and
F18, the French Mirage 2000-5 and the Russian Mig29 and Su27.
To strengthen the vital export push, the consortium has been in talks with
British Aerospace for two years, seeking a deal to use BAe's worldwide
marketing and product support network to help sell the JAS. From BAe's point
of view, the JAS would provide it with a new product to fill the gap before
the Eurofighter is in production. A decision on whether to proceed will be
taken by the year's end, according to Mr Ahlinder. Meanwhile, similar talks
with other manufacturers have also been held, he says.
For Saab-Scania, these are also anxious times for its civilian aircraft
division as it confronts a weak market. The company has carved out a
significant share of the regional aircraft market, winning a near 40 per
cent share of the world market for 20-39 seat airliners with its 35-seater
Saab 340 aircraft. This year it has completed certification in the European
Union and the US of its new 50-58 seater Saab 2000, and is due to make its
first five deliveries of the new airplane - to Switzerland's Crossair.
But last year, deliveries of the 340 fell to 28 from 49 in 1992, and its
share of worldwide deliveries in its segment fell from 49 to 36 per cent.
This year deliveries of both the 340 and 2000 are not expected to exceed 20
 -a long way below the target of a break-even level of 50 sales a year.
Saab-Scania, however, is committed to the long term in the industry,
believing that when the cycle turns, regional airliners will be 'one of the
most expansive segments in the aircraft industry'. It is convinced the 340
and 2000 are 'in pace with the times'.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (24): Hopes for a break in the clouds -
France: Taiwan's order for 60 Mirage jets provides momentary relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French aerospace industry, which has been hit by falling orders during
the past three years, hopes that by 1995-96 turnover will begin to improve.
Some comfort was provided by Taiwan's 1992 order for 60 of Dassault's Mirage
jets and 1,500 of Matra's Mica missiles. But, in general terms, the Taiwan
contract provided only momentary relief, with new aerospace orders booked
last year amounting to only FFr90bn, 19 per cent down on the Taiwan-inflated
figure of 1992 though only 4 per cent down on the 1991 level of new orders.
Turnover fell last year by 8.5 per cent to FFr110bn, (Dollars 21bn) with the
brunt felt in the aero-engine sector (down 12.5 per cent) and by aircraft
and missile makers (down 9.6 per cent), while avionics and equipment
manufacturers escaped relatively lightly (down 4.2 per cent). Almost all
companies are cutting back their work forces, or, as in the case of Airbus,
putting them on short-time working. Serge Dassault, president of the group
that bears his name and head of Gifas, the industry association, estimates
French aerospace will have lost 15,000 jobs over 1992-95.
In profit until 1991, the French aerospace sector has, overall, been in the
red since then. The biggest money losers are state-owned: Aerospatiale,
which cut its 1993 loss to FFr1.42bn (from FFr2.38bn a year earlier) but has
this year had to get a FFr2bn capital injection from the government to help
reduce its debt and fund promotion of its new A340 series; Snecma, the
aero-engine maker whose 1993 loss increased slightly compared with 1992 to
FFr804m on sharply lower turnover; and Thomson-CSF, the defence electronics
specialist. The latter, in fact, made an operating profit of around FFr1bn,
which was wiped out by its unfortunate stake in Credit Lyonnais that
required it to assume losses and bad debt provisions of FFr3bn.
All three companies are slated for privatisation, but the sale of
Aerospatiale and Snecma is some time off. By contrast, private sector
companies, like Matra (part of the Lagardere group) and Dassault have fared
better, partly because of Taiwan contracts.
Bernard Nicolas, Gifas' secretary-general, estimates that this year will see
a similar 8.5 per cent decline in French aerospace turnover, but also a
pick-up in export orders, especially for Airbus and perhaps through possible
missile sales to Sweden and helicopter sales to the UK. But he feels the
French government does not always act in the best interests of its defence
industry. In particular, he is critical of the promise France gave China not
to sell any more offensive weapons to Taiwan. While this may have opened the
door to the Chinese market to French civil contractors, he says salesmen for
companies involved in the Taiwan sale still cannot get visas to visit China.
The French aerospace industry, at least, benefits from the fact that France
is virtually the only country in the west or east which, far from awarding
itself a peace dividend on the end of the Cold War, has decided to maintain
defence spending in real terms. The government's military framework law for
1995-2000 sets a 0.5 per cent real increase in defence equipment spending
for the first three years, and possibly more thereafter, depending on how
the economy performs. And this starts from a 1994 base of FFr100.4bn, which
is higher than in the UK or Germany.
But Mr Nicolas notes that the Balladur government has resorted to a habit of
the previous socialist government by 'freezing' FFr2.5bn of the 1994
equipment budget. The Gifas director also complains that the civil aviation
portion of the 1994 budget only includes money for 're-imbursable advances'
for existing programmes, not for new ones planned by Aerospatiale and
Dassault. France, however, remains a firm believer in this 'transparent'
form of direct aerospace subsidy, and from the bogged-down talks with the
US, it would like to see emerging an extension of the 1992 US-European Union
agreement to cover not just airframes, but also aero engines and equipment.
Space accounts for about 15 per cent of French aerospace turnover, but its
business fell last year by nearly 6 per cent. However, Matra-Marconi Space,
the Anglo-French joint venture, has just boosted its capability by buying
British Aerospace's space business.
Despite recurrent rumours of national mergers, of the kind that produced BAe
or Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), French companies have instead sought to cope
with their industry's present crisis by reaching out to foreign partners.
Aerospatiale is negotiating with Dasa to create in missiles the sort of
joint venture they already have in helicopters; Thomson-CSF has recently
capped its large number of joint ventures and acquisitions with the UK by
announcing two joint ventures with Dasa on 'smart' munitions and missile
propulsion; and Matra is on the verge of completing its long negotiations
for a joint venture with BAe on missiles.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (23): Industry seeks political help -
The UK's position as a global participant is at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK aerospace industry is pressing the government to adopt a new strategic
initiative, to guarantee the future of the industry at a time when it is
continuing to lose market share.
Although companies have continued to restructure and consolidate their
operations through partnerships and alliances with international groups,
they warn that the sector's future will depend on a political consensus
around a clearly stated public policy of support for the industry.
In a written submission to the House of Commons trade and industry select
committee, the Society of British Aerospace Companies (SBAC), the trade
association grouping more than 200 UK aerospace companies, said that the
government, in addition to providing a stable long-term investment climate,
needed to develop with the industry 'a national technological strategy to
make greater progress in maximising the efficient use of investment
resources from private and public sources.'
The call for greater government commitment comes at a time when UK aerospace
companies are continuing to face the effects of the prolonged recession in
the civil aircraft business and the decline in government defence following
the end of the cold war.
Until recently, the UK aerospace industry was second only in size to that of
the US among western economies. But after peaking in 1990, its annual
turnover has declined from Pounds 11.7bn four years ago to around Pounds
10.4bn. The impact of lower defence budgets has led to a marked change in
the civil-military split, with civil activities now accounting for around 50
per cent of total annual turnover compared with only 25 per cent in 1980.
Over the past 12 years, restructuring has led to a decline in employment,
from nearly 230,000 people in 1980 to fewer than 150,000 last year.
Other aerospace industries in Europe have fared better than the UK in terms
of government support. By 1990, the annual turnover of the French industry
had begun to match the UK, with France maintaining a stronger level of
defence spending as well as adopting an active policy of backing what it
considers a strategic industrial sector. The German industry has enjoyed
even greater government support.
Fierce competitive pressures, coupled with the growing costs of research and
product development, have forced the UK industry - which is still second to
chemicals in the UK trade balance league, exporting about 70 per cent of its
turnover - to step up efforts to rationalise by forging new international
partnerships, as well as shedding certain assets to focus on core
activities.
British Aerospace (BAe) has pursued its vigorous rationalisation and
recovery strategy of returning the company to its basic defence and civil
aerospace businesses. On the civil side, BAe is continuing to seek
international partnerships for both its turbopropeller and regional jet
operations.
After failing to form a joint regional jet venture with Taiwan last year,
the UK group has pinned its hopes on forming a regional jet alliance with
Fokker,the Dutch manufacturer now controlled by Deutsche Aerospace of
Germany. In the turbopropeller sector, BAe has also had lengthy discussions
with the Franco-Italian ATR consortium.
Rationalisation has also been intensified in BAe's space and missiles
businesses. The UK company has agreed to sell its space systems division to
Matra-Marconi, a joint venture between the French Matra company and the UK
General Electric Company. BAe has also been negotiating with Matra to merge
their respective guided weapons activities.
BAe's core defence aerospace operations continue to be the company's main
profit centre, on the back of the group's lucrative relationship with Saudi
Arabia and the strong export performance of its Hawk fighter-trainer
aircraft. BAe also expects its 20 per cent stake in the European Airbus
civil aircraft consortium to reap long-term dividends.
But for BAe much will hinge in the future on the controversial Eurofighter
2000 programme, as well as on the company's involvement in the Future Large
Aircraft (FLA) project, a European collaborative venture to build a new
military transport aircraft. The UK has maintained its strong commitment to
Eurofighter, although the programme for the new advanced fighter has been
dogged by controversy in Germany.
While there is broad consensus in the UK over Eurofighter, the FLA project
has created deep divisions both within the government and the industry. The
issue centres on whether Britain should buy the new US Lockheed Hercules
C-130J or the European FLA to replace the Royal Air Force's ageing transport
fleet.
The Lockheed camp has argued that its aircraft will be ready to meet the
RAF's needs by 1996, while the FLA still faces uncertain development costs
and will not be available until the next century. Lockheed has also said
that UK participation in the programme will be worth Pounds 2.2bn and secure
3,500 jobs in Britain.
But BAe and its supporters have warned that the stakes are high, and that
the consequences would be dire if the UK did not participate in the European
FLA project. BAe has warned that its lead in wing design and production in
Europe might be lost to Germany and France if it did not participate in the
FLA programme. There could also be serious implications over BAe's role in
Airbus, since the FLA could be built by the European civil aircraft
consortium extending its activities into the military sector.
In the UK aero-engine industry, the big challenge for Rolls-Royce is the
development of its high-thrust Trent family of engines to power the new
generation of large widebody airliners, which are expected to account for an
increasingly large share of the total aircraft market during the next 20
years. While the Trent programme has been a technical success, the problem
for Rolls-Royce is that it has had to continue investing heavily in the
development of its new high-thrust engines at the same time as rationalising
the company in the face of the industry's downturn and the increasingly
tough competition from its two US rivals, General Electric and Pratt &amp;
Whitney.
Rationalisation has also been a main feature of the UK aerospace components
sector. Lucas has been restructuring its US aerospace operations, while
expanding through joint ventures in the fast growing Asia Pacific market. TI
has absorbed Dowty, which in turn has forged an Anglo French aircraft
landing gear joint venture with Messier Bugatti.
Overall, however, the UK aerospace industry warns that rationalisation,
greater international collaboration and significant productivity
improvements cannot alone guarantee the sector's long-term future.
Unless the government is prepared to match the support in R&amp;D in new
aerospace technologies and materials given by other countries to their
industries, as well as more active export backing, there is a growing danger
that the UK may see its position as a leading global aerospace participant
severely undermined.
As the SBAC put it to the House of Commons select committee: 'Failure to
sustain adequate R&amp;D investment to counter international competition could
mean an inevitable erosion of UK capability - and once lost, the industry's
leading position could not be regained.'

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (21): Anxiety over safety record - China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a Russian-built Tupolev aircraft, of China Northwest Airlines, crashed
near the historic city of Xian in June, it was not only China's worst air
disaster, it also coincided with festering doubts about Beijing's ability to
manage its flourishing aviation sector.
An appalling safety record - more than 500 people have died in air crashes
since 1992 - had turned the spotlight on lax safety standards, poor
maintenance, sloppy cabin service and virtually non-existent airport
security. In the past year or so, there have been no fewer than a dozen
hijackings to Taiwan of Chinese airliners.
Since the appointment late last year of Mr Chen Guangyi as head of the Civil
Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), the country's aviation regulatory
arm, efforts have intensified to improve safety; but foreign airline
representatives say that China has a long way to go before it can hope to
match international standards.
China's aviation sector simply has grown too fast for available resources:
pilot training, for example, is lagging well behind demand. Among the most
critical problems is a lack of experienced pilots.
China is moving to redress the problem, in co-operation with foreign
airlines such as Lufthansa which has agreed to train Chinese pilots at its
facility in Phoenix, Arizona; but demand is such that it will take years to
provide an adequate supply of pilots.
Growth figures for the aviation sector are staggering. Passenger numbers are
rising at an average of 20 per cent annually, and this is expected to
continue for the next few years; although a credit squeeze slowed the
increase last year to 16.8 per cent from 33 per cent the year before.
Projected Chinese purchases of passenger aircraft should be enough to keep
Airbus Industries and Boeing in business well into next century. In a study,
for an Air Finance conference Chase Manhattan Bank predicts China's
passenger fleet of 350 aircraft will increase fivefold by 2010. This would
require the purchase of 1,200 new aircraft worth USDollars 90bn.
Chase's prediction compares with less optimistic forecasts by, among others,
Boeing which predicts purchases of 800 aircraft and expenditure of UDollars
40bn. Airbus expects China to purchase 620 new aircraft in the next 15
years.
Regardless of who is correct, numbers of aircraft and amounts of money
involved are colossal. Growth in the civil aviation fleet since China began
opening to the world in the late 1970s has been spectacular. In 1974, China
had just 12 passenger aircraft, compared with the 350 today.
Boeing, followed by Airbus and McDonnell Douglas, have been the chief
beneficiaries. Boeing delivered 46 airliners to China last year - 14 per
cent of its production. This year, it expects to deliver 36, or 14 per cent
of a lower production. Negotiations are also well advanced for the purchase
of a further 50 Boeings, including the new 777 two-engined widebody, at a
cost of about UDollars 5bn.
Airbus, too, is making a stronger showing in the China market. The European
consortium secured orders last year worth UDollars 1.2bn. Three airlines -
China Eastern in Shanghai, China Northwest in Xian and China Northern in
Shenyang - are now operating Airbus.
Other suppliers of aviation equipment are also benefiting from China's
aviation expansion. Rolls-Royce, for example, is supplying 42 of its
RB211-535 engines for Boeing 757s on order by Chinese airlines and is
expecting further orders.
While China is spending billions of dollars on the purchase of new
top-of-the-range aircraft, it is far from maximising returns on investment.
The Chase Manhattan study reported that China's average aircraft utilisation
rate was 5.2 hours a day in 1992, up from 4.7 the year before. This compares
with 11 for Singapore Airlines.
Among factors curtailing utilisation is the primitive state of Chinese
infrastructure, including airports and air traffic control systems. Only 40
of China's airports have instrument-landing systems, which means that bad
weather often causes delays, and thus disruption to the entire network.
A striking feature has been the proliferation of new regional operators.
China now has more than 30 airlines. This regionalisation of the aviation
sector has placed a huge burden on CAAC's overstretched regulatory
abilities. On the other hand, the growth of regional carriers has added a
dynamic to the sector which would not have been possible if the CAAC
monopoly had been maintained.
The regional airlines are also spreading their wings beyond China, opening
routes to international destinations such as Singapore and Thailand. Several
are seeking capital abroad, to fund ambitious expansion plans. China
Southern, based in Guangzhou, and China Eastern are among 22 Chinese
companies approved for listing on overseas stock markets.
In its efforts to secure expertise and capital, China recently announced it
was opening its airline industry to foreign investment, though foreign
involvement in a mainland airline would be restric - ted to 35 per cent with
voting rights capped at 25 per cent.
Foreign investors were also being urged to invest in airport facilities such
as terminals, ground-handling and aircraft maintenance. Indeed, foreign
carriers are already becoming more involved.
British Airways recently formed a joint engineering venture with China
Southern; Lufthansa has a joint venture maintenance facility in Beijing with
Air China; and Singapore Airlines has concluded a joint-venture agreement
with the Beijing Airport Authority for inflight kitchen services and ground
handling facilities.
China's aviation sector is in flux, and the learning curve is proving to be

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (20): Taking the partnership route -
Japan: A look at the importance of the YSX project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Officials, researchers and financiers of the Japanese aerospace industry
were today gathering for a meeting that has become an annual ceremony - to
discuss whether the country should once again seek a place in the world
commercial aircraft industry.
At issue will be a plan to build a small passenger aeroplane, the YSX, which
the industry and its guardians at Miti - the ministry of international trade
and industry - have been nurturing for the past five years. Although still
just a vision in the eyes of planners and manufacturers, the YSX has already
caught the Japanese public's imagination.
The interest shown in the aircraft is understandable, given the traditional
Japanese fondness for national projects and symbols of industrial might. But
the YSX is not just a symbol of Japan's resolve to establish its credibility
within the industry. It is the third attempt by some of the country's most
highly regarded manufacturers to build and market an aircraft on a
commercial basis; and the stakes are high.
For the bureaucrats at Miti who are backing the project, it is not just a
question of pride, although that, too, is important. Unlike some of the more
shining examples of Japan's manufacturing prowess, the aerospace industry,
despite good intentions and recognised skills, has been something of a
blemish on the country's industrial record.
The ministry, more famous for its successes in industrial planning than its
failures, is expected to increase the amount of money available to the
project next year to Y1.1bn, which will cover the costs of a feasibility
study that has been carried out since 1989. The increase, from Y550m this
year, at a time when government coffers have been reduced by one of the
longest recessions since the war, represents a strengthened commitment to a
project that could lose millions and create another blemish on its record.
For the five leading Japanese aerospace manufacturers participating in the
YSX programme, the risks are also daunting.
'The initial development costs for commercial aircraft are extremely high,
and it takes about 10 years to make profits, so we have to be cautious,'
emphasises Mr Yutaka Hineno, general manager of MHI's aerospace and special
vehicle headquarters. 'It is not going to be easy.'
In the past, the industry has had little joy in its attempts to develop and
market commercial aircraft. The only two designed and built in Japan - a
64-seat twin-propeller airliner called the YS-11 and a short take-off and
landing plane called Asuka - have been embarrassing commercial failures.
Manufacturers, however, claim that it is not for lack of technical ability
that the industry has lagged behind those in the US and Europe. Japanese
technical capabilities have been tested through the substantial amount of
subcontracting work they have done for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, and on
joint development projects with Boeing, such as the 777 and 767.
The latter, in particular, provided Japanese companies with experience in
building the aircraft's body. 'At first, Japanese companies did not have any
speciality, but after the Boeing 767, Japanese companies are probably good
at body work,' claims Mr Hineno.
He believes that the real stumbling blocks to the growth of Japan's
aerospace industry have been a domestic market that is too small to support
a leading industry, and the ban on Japanese exports of defence products.
But additionally, there is the bitter truth which the YS-11 fiasco - it went
out of production in 1972 after 12 years, because it was unprofitable -
taught both the industry and Miti: the Japanese industry lacks the marketing
expertise and the credibility needed to sell commercial aircraft globally.
Although the YS-11 was actually respected as an aircraft, industry officials
explain, nobody was willing to take the risk of buying expensive planes from
Japanese manufacturers, which had no established record.
To avoid the same mistake, the industry and Miti have consented to have a
western partner on their next endeavour, the YSX. 'We have to team up with
an established partner, like Boeing or Airbus, to sell the plane, because we
don't have the marketing ability and need to provide after-sales services,'
concedes Mr Hineno.
The latest indications are that the preferred partner is Boeing, with which
the Japanese aerospace industry has a long relationship. But the question
facing the industry then would be whether it could shed the junior-partner
role it has always been relegated to in its dealings with the US company.
The inability of Japanese aerospace companies to win more than
medium-technology work from Boeing - such as wing-flaps - has earned the
industry a reputation as a permanent subcontractor to the US company. An
attempt was made to play a more prominent role in the development of
Boeing's 777 jet by taking a 21 per cent stake in the project. However, even
MHI, the leading Japanese company in the industry, admits that there is a
long way to go before the industry can claim partnership with Boeing.
'We see it as joint development, but others say it is subcontracting,'
concedes Mr Hineno. 'Japanese companies will only be able to increase their
share of a project by improving their labour capabilities, facilities and
technology.'
For example, Boeing has always kept work on the main wings largely to
itself. Wing work needs large-scale manufacturing capacity, which does not
exist in Japan, he explains.
Even if the Japanese industry manages to take the lead in a commercial
venture, it is likely to face fierce competition on the global market, where
there are several other projects to develop a small passenger jet.
For the industry, and for Miti, there are few options. 'The project is
unlikely to go ahead if it appears that it won't be profitable,' says an
official at the ministry.
Yet the country's defence budget, where the industry derives 75 per cent of
sales, is shrinking; and industry and government agree that aerospace
manufacturing must be retained for the technological skills that it
generates for a variety of industries.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (22): The pains of privatisation -
Russia: morale is low and the outlook bleak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a difficult year of adjustment to market economics, the future looks
bleak for Russia's aerospace and airline industries.
Despite having some of the best design capacity in the world, manufacturers
are finding it difficult to raise the finance they need to produce and sell
aircraft in world markets. The once-monolithic Russian airline industry,
having split up into some 300 mini-carriers, has been hit by two serious
accidents, which have dented already shaky international confidence in it.
After prolonged indecision over the future of Russian International Airlines
 -the international rump of the former monopoly, which continues to use the
Aeroflot name - the government decided in June to sell 49 per cent to the
airline's employees.
In this first stage of privatisation, employees will be barred for an
unspecified period from re-selling their stock, which they will be offered
at a discount. The government does not plan to sell off any of its remaining
51 per cent stake for at least three years.
'In the next stage, I think conditions for foreign capital to invest will be
created,' Mr Igor Desyatnichenko, deputy director for finance, was quoted as
saying in a recent interview. In the meantime, the government has promised
to give the dividends of its 51 per cent stake to the airline, to help it
acquire new aircraft.
But a question-mark remains over whether it will remain a single airline,
following the decision to allow four of its subsidiaries the option of
breaking away as separate companies. This decision coincided with a change
of chairman at Russian International Airlines, with the replacement of Mr
Vladimir Potapov, who had struggled to keep the airline whole, by one of his
deputies, Mr Vladimir Tikhonov.
The declared purpose of privatisation is to make the industry more
efficient. But the collapse of the Soviet Union, in December 1991, only
complicated its adjustment to market reforms launched just over two years
ago. Newly-independent republics, as well as restless regions and even
cities, seized control of locally-based fleets. But despite the lifting of
controls on ticket prices, as part of the reforms, most of the so-called
'baby Aeroflots' lack the muscle and expertise to achieve international
standards and re-equip ageing fleets.
In January, a Tupolev aircraft operated by a tiny Siberian offshoot of the
former Aeroflot crashed en route from the Siberian city of Irkutsk to
Moscow, killing all 120 people on board. Morale and discipline have also
suffered across the board. In March, 75 people died when an Airbus leased by
Russian International Airlines crashed on a flight from Moscow to Hong Kong.
Unofficial reports released at the time suggested that the pilot had been
teaching his children how to fly. But publication of the results of an
official inquiry have been postponed several times, fuelling suspicions of
an attempted cover-up.
A bright spot amid the chaos is the development of a few privately-funded
airlines, such as Transaero, which offers western-style service at a small
premium to that of its state-owned rivals.
Pending state-owned airlines' inevitable restructuring as bigger companies,
the government this spring made a start with privatisation when it auctioned
part of Vnukovo Airlines, based at Moscow's domestic Vnukovo airport.
Until July 1, privatisation of state-owned assets had been conducted through
the free distribution of vouchers to the population. However, future
privatisation, including that of Russian International Airlines, will be for
cash only, with 51 per cent of the proceeds due to be ploughed back into
companies.
Lack of finance to re-equip fleets is the main problem facing Russian
airlines, and is likely to remain so even after privatisation. It is also an
obstacle for aircraft manufacturers, which were previously run and financed
by the state.
Even those airlines which have some money are finding it easier to lease or
buy western aircraft, because of the favourable financing terms offered by
western manufacturers. A cash-strapped government has yet to implement a
long-promised industrial policy of selective support for its most promising
industries, such as airframe manufacturing.
In the meantime, two engine-manufacturers have teamed up with two leading
Russian aircraft manufacturers in an attempt to mass-produce Russian
aircraft with western engines and avionics. The most advanced project is an
alliance between Russia's Ilyushin and Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US. Their
long-haul Il-96-M aircraft is currently undergoing tests for certification
in Russia and the west. A similar aircraft, with Russian engines, the
Il-96-300, is already being operated by Russian International Airlines on
routes to the US.
A separate alliance, between Russia's Tupolev, and Rolls-Royce of the UK,
wants to produce the medium-haul Tu-204 with western engines and avionics.
But it is still said to be seeking finance for certification procedures.
According to Mr John Sharman, executive director of Spectrum Capital, the UK
venture capital company, the Russian authorities have approached the British
government for help in raising Dollars 20m for this purpose, on the grounds
that this will help Rolls-Royce to sell engines.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (18): Hopes for stability - World
Markets / The recovery in the US is tentative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the end of July, McDonnell Douglas, the world's largest manufacturer of
military aircraft, put its competitors on notice that it had no intention of
leaving the commercial end of the business, despite its withering share of a
shrinking market.
The St Louis-based company announced that it would offer its customers a new
100-seat passenger jet known as the MD-95, taking the first step towards
full-scale production of the short-haul jetliner. By diversifying its
civilian product range, McDonnell Douglas hopes to begin reversing a decline
that has seen its commercial production rate shrivel by 75 per cent in just
three years.
The decision to proceed with the MD-95 is a good illustration of how the US
aerospace industry as a whole is struggling to cope with a severe cyclical
downturn which began in 1990. Last year, the net rate of orders for all
manufacturers - defined as new orders minus cancellations - reached a
20-year low, while the US industry's total workforce sank 32 per cent below
its peak of 1.33m, reached in 1989.
In terms of orders, a tentative recovery appears to be under way. In terms
of deliveries, the numbers are only now touching bottom. In 1995, production
is expected to stabilise at this year's projected level of 465 aircraft -
down from 844 three years ago, according to Moody's Investors Service.
Boeing, which still commands a dominant 63 per cent of the commercial
market, projects its 1993 deliveries at 260, well below its 1992 level of
442.
McDonnell Douglas, the US aerospace group hardest hit by the contraction, is
well aware that it can no longer count on the Pentagon to help offset
downcycles on the civilian side.
The easing of international tensions in the 1990s, coupled with stepped-up
political pressure to cut the massive US budget deficit, have all but
assured that the bounty reaped during the Reagan military build-up will
never return.
Indeed, the Clinton administration has accelerated the timetable for a
downsizing process which began at the end of the cold war. It projects the
Defense Department's outlays at Dollars 233.7bn in fiscal 1997, nearly 21
per cent lower than the high-water mark reached in fiscal 1989. By contrast,
the final Bush projection for fiscal 1997 was a relatively hefty Dollars
273.7bn.
The response of the aerospace industry to this unprecedented challenge is
well documented. A wave of market-driven consolidation has swept over the
industry since 1991, forcing companies either to seek a leading position in
a particular segment through acquisitions, or to sell off their marginal
operations to a competitor seeking to do the same.
Some companies, such as Lockheed and Martin Marietta, have become aggressive
buyers, while General Dynamics, General Electric and others have sought to
limit their exposures to shrinking military allocations.
The latest twist in the industry's reshaping came in April, when Northrop
won a month-long bidding war with Martin Marietta to acquire Grumann, a Long
Island group specialising in defence electronics. The move, which carried a
Dollars 2.17bn price-tag, was seen as a last-ditch effort by Northrop to
thwart the possibility of its own takeover.
By and large, defence contractors assured their continued profitability by
reshuffling the business portfolios. McDonnell Douglas, which has stayed out
of the fray, is an exception. Still, its defence business remains on solid
footing. The division, which makes the F/A-18 and F-15 fighter jets, as well
as the controversial C-17 transport, recently posted record operating
earnings for the three months to the end of June.
On the commercial side, its position is decidedly more precarious, with
production plunging to 48 aircraft last year, from 169 in 1991. Prudent
cost-cutting has enabled the business to remain marginally profitable,
however.
The announcement of a Dollars 2bn order from Saudia, the state-run carrier
of Saudia Arabia, this spring was timely. Its factories at Long Beach,
California, are steadily whittling down the backlog of unfilled orders for
its larger three-engine MD-11 jetliner and modern versions of its venerable
DC-9. (The lion's share of the Saudi order - 46 aircraft worth Dollars 4bn -
went to Boeing.)
The new MC-95 is a variant which fits into a crucial market niche. With US
carriers emulating the success of Southwest Airlines and other profitable
operators, many of them are likely to scrap their hub-and-spoke flight
networks in favour of point-to-point flying. It is a strategy sure to
accelerate orders of smaller aircraft, with 100 seats or less.
The conundrum facing McDonnell, however, is that the market has been flooded
with new aircraft over the past five years, at a time when world air
capacity has expanded twice as fast as traffic. The result is a huge
stockpile of used aircraft waiting to be put back into service when demand
picks up. To make matters worse, air traffic is expected to recover more
slowly than in past cycles, with slow economic growth forecast for the late
1990s.
As a consequence, Moody's expects a 22 per cent increase in annual aircraft
deliveries from 1993 to 2002. Though that level of growth appears to be
sufficient, an unprecedented number of aircraft programs will compete for a
piece of the pie.
The most promising - and most risky - of these programmes is Boeing's B-777,
the largest twin-engine airplane ever built. The 400-seat wide-body, which
cost Dollars 4.5bn to develop, is scheduled to begin commercial flights next
May.
'The question is, will everything go as planned,' says Mr Jack Modzelewski,
an analyst with PaineWebber, the New York securities house. 'If the planes
don't ship, Boeing may have a few billion dollars worth of inventories
stacking up very fast.'
About 145 of the flying behemoths, at Dollars 135m each, are already on the
order books, but the Seattle aerospace giant needs twice as many to recoup
its investment. To encourage demand, Boeing has requested US regulators to
allow the aircraft, which initially will have a range of 4,600 miles, to fly
over the oceans immediately, without the normal trial period over land. The
waiver has raised heated opposition.
The world's biggest aerospace group can ill afford a setback. Net income in
the second quarter was down 48 per cent from the 1993 period, and would have
come in lower if not for an unexpected tax break. For the year, revenues are
expected to reach Dollars 21bn, about a third of the 1992 level. Mr
Modzelewski, among others, doubts whether its annual orders will return to
the 400-plane level before the turn of the century.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (19): Unprecedented turmoil - Fare wars
blight the scene for airlines in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 15 years have passed since deregulation opened the skies above the
US to the unrestrained forces of enterprise and competition. By now, the
airline industry should have settled down into some kind of equilibrium.
Instead, it is in unprecedented turmoil.
Barely a week passes without news of another fare war breaking out, an
airline delivering a warning of impending losses, or thousands of jobs being
cut. In the past four years, the US airline industry has lost nearly Dollars
13bn - more than all the money it has ever made since the invention of
powered flight.
So what has gone wrong? It is not as though the airlines are short of
passengers: last year the number of people carried by US airlines on
domestic and international flights rose by 2.6 per cent to a record 487.2m.
The trouble is, the big airlines cannot charge a fare high enough to carry
them at a profit - and that is because a new breed of low-cost airlines has
emerged.
Competition from upstart operators is nothing new to the US. When air
deregulation came in 1978, many entrepreneurs thought they saw an
opportunity to make a profit by starting new services or undercutting fares
on existing routes. But almost as many were wrong: as the big carriers
fought back and the competition intensified, scores of airlines went
bankrupt, most of them small.
The economic boom of the late 1980s brought respite for the industry, but it
was not to last. With the onset of the Gulf War at the beginning of 1991,
passenger demand sagged, and airlines were burdened with surplus capacity.
This provided entrepreneurs with an opportunity to pick up assets and staff
on the cheap and make another onslaught on the established carriers.
This time, however, the entrepreneurs were better prepared. For one thing,
they had learned from the mistakes of their predecessors; for another, many
were experienced airline employees pensioned off by the big carriers. Still
more important, they had a successful model from which to work - that of
Southwest Airlines, the phenomenally successful Texas-based carrier.
Today, Southwest is by far the most profitable airline in the US and the one
that all carriers, big and small, seek to emulate. It succeeds because its
costs are so much lower than those of the established airlines. The result
is that it can charge permanently low fares on every flight and win more
passengers - not just from other airlines, but by encouraging people to fly
instead of driving, and by generating demand for travel that would not
otherwise exist.
How does Southwest do it? Unlike the big airlines with their hub-and-spoke
operations, Southwest specialises in short-haul, point-to-point services
with frequent flights and fast turnarounds that make intensive use of its
staff and aircraft. Its hard-working and enthusiastic employees are much
more flexible than those working for the big carriers: flight attendants,
for example, clean the passenger cabin while people disembark. And there are
few frills: accommodation is all economy class, there are no pre-assigned
seats, and the in-flight meal is a soft drink and a bag of nuts.
Translated into financial terms, the result is that Southwest, and airlines
like it, have operating costs of little more than 7 cents per available seat
mile, while the big carriers have operating costs averaging rather more than
9 cents a seat mile - nearly 30 per cent higher. So when the big carriers
have to lower fares to compete with smaller carriers muscling in on their
routes, they lose money.
Faced with the certainty that the small carriers are not going to go away,
the big carriers have been left with no choice but to bring their own cost
structures down. The effect has been a rash of radical restructurings.
Perhaps the most spectacular is the one now being implemented by United
Airlines, the biggest US carrier. In July, its shareholders voted to accept
a plan thrashed out by its management and workforce under which employees
will be given a 55 per cent controlling stake in the airline in exchange for
wage cuts and changes in working practices worth Dollars 4.9bn to the
company over the next 12 years.
United is not the only big US airline to have offered employees a stake in
the company in return for labour concessions. Northwest Airlines narrowly
avoided bankruptcy in the middle of last year by persuading employees to
yield Dollars 886m worth of concessions over three years in return for 33
per cent of its equity (now 26 per cent following a stock offering in
March). And last year Trans World Airlines emerged from bankruptcy after
trading 45 per cent of its shares for Dollars 660m worth of employee
concessions over three years.
The advantage of employee buy-outs like these is that, in heavily unionised
airlines, they produce labour savings without the strife that might
accompany swingeing job cuts. The largely non-union Delta Air Lines,
however, has adopted a different strategy: in April it announced that it was
cutting up to 15,000 jobs from its world-wide workforce of 73,000 as part of
a plan to cut Dollars 2bn a year from operating costs by mid-1997.
Soon after Delta's announcement, USAir announced that it was seeking to cut
costs by Dollars 1bn a year over the next three years, with half the costs
coming from efficiency improvements and the other half coming out of labour
costs. USAir, however, is unionised, and it is still in talks with its
unions about how the labour cost savings are to be achieved.
Meanwhile, Continental Airlines, which last year emerged from its second
bankruptcy with a largely non-union workforce, has reacted to the
competition by setting up its own low-cost, low-fare operation - nicknamed
CALite within the industry. United, with its new cost structure now in
place, is planning to do the same with the launch of United Shuttle next
month.
If one thing is certain about these changes, it is that they not over yet.
Indeed, it seems probable that worse is to come. The big carriers cannot
continue indefinitely to absorb the losses they are suffering in the fare
wars afflicting the market. As the competitive pressures intensify, only
those that succeed in adapting to the low-cost environment will survive.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (15): The sky's the limit - A look at
satellite navigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Transatlantic navigation has come a long way since Alcock and Brown
crash-landed in an Irish bog after pioneering the route from Newfoundland to
Europe in 1919. Passengers on a wide-bodied jet are confident about
precisely where and when they will arrive. But the huge fuel costs involved
in long-haul aviation make any saving on time worthwhile. Airlines jostle
for slots across the lucrative north Atlantic routes while pilots seek
tailwinds that can chop precious minutes off the journey.
The objective is to boost profits by chipping away at fuel consumption
figures. But the volume of traffic on this route means that aircraft must
maintain a strict separation. Without radar coverage crews rely on time to
keep flights well apart. Safety dictates a 10-minute margin between
aircraft. This prevents collisions but frustrates economy measures and extra
flight slots.
Enter Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS). This project aims to provide
an air traffic picture for the north Atlantic by mimicking radar data.
Satellites are the key, taking signals from airliners and bouncing them back
to a terrestrial control centre.
British Airways (BA) has been experimenting with satellite navigation since
September 1992, using a Boeing 747 kitted out for ADS. This relies on
Inmarsat navigation satellites to relay information to and from ground
stations. Air traffic control (ATC) gets the exact position of the 747
within 12 seconds.
Radio contact with ATC entails a delay of up to 15 minutes before an
aircraft is cleared to change its slot in pursuit of a favourable tailwind
or to exit turbulence. ADS cuts this to 30 seconds. Dramatic cost benefits
have been claimed on Pacific routes, where United and NorthWest Airlines use
ADS. NorthWest reckons annual savings of Dollars 500,000 for each of its 50
Boeing 747s are attainable. United has the nickname Stealth Airline because
its crews make so little use of radio signals.
Inmarsat's Fintan Ryan is adamant the ADS price tag of Dollars 150,000 per
aircraft is soon recouped. 'The savings are proven on the Pacific route. ADS
means the aircraft takes off and flies only the course that optimises
costs,' he says.
Over the north Atlantic ADS promises to halve the separation between
flights, doubling the slots available. These developments offer improved
exploitation of airspace. In the final approach, as the aircraft lines up to
land, an international battle has broken out between satellite-based and
terrestrial navigation aids.
Global positioning system (GPS) relies on a constellation of 24 satellites
to measure the distance between the GPS receiver and the satellite. With
three satellite signals it is possible to locate the position of the
receiver anywhere on earth. GPS was originally developed for the US military
and has spread rapidly throughout the civil sector. It offers a very cheap
means of satellite navigation, with yachtsman's GPS sets now available for
as little as Pounds 350.
The GPS lobby claim their system is the answer to air navigation over
developing countries and remote regions. However, pilots with leading
carriers are happy with existing gyroscopes and laser-based navigation
systems.
For landing, civil aircraft switch to Instrument Landing System (ILS) to
co-ordinate their final approach to an airport. ILS relies on radio signals
to guide the aircraft in. But encroaching signals from FM commercial radio
stations mean that ILS's days are numbered. The maker of GPS satellites and
receivers, US avionics giant Rockwell, have spotted an opportunity.
'You see these massive markets in Russia and China opening up. They don't
have a huge radar infrastructure. With GPS there is a tremendous advantage
to be gained,' says Ken Medlin, a Rockwell vice-president. There is also a
lot of money on the table. The US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has
commissioned a Dollars 500m project to convert ILS approaches to GPS.
Mr Medlin and his colleagues argue that since GPS does not require a huge
terrestrial infrastructure it is a cheap option. Unfortunately GPS is not
yet suited to landing an aircraft in the worst weather conditions, known to
pilots as Category 3. And Category 3 is a familiar state to crews landing in
Europe. The UK Civil Aviation Authority has thrown its weight behind
Microwave Landing Systems (MLS) to replace ILS by 1998. MLS uses proven
microwave beam technology to guide an aircraft down in fog. Despite the US
FAA's endorsement, the CAA rejects GPS as 'not yet fully proven' for
precision guidance.
Suspicions about the reliability of GPS are compounded by the fact that GPS
satellites are controlled by the Pentagon. By contrast, Inmarsat answers to
a 74-nation consortium. An accord between the US military and the FAA over
civil use of GPS has failed to quell European suspicions.
Even if the military agree not to scramble or break signals in time of
conflict, how can operators be sure of future tariffs? Satellites have a
finite life, and European airlines are convinced that the GPS community will
seize on a chance to recoup the vast military investment.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (17): Down-to-earth research - A look at
new materials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID FISHLOCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Daniel Goldin, administrator of the US National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, interviewed last spring by the FT, stressed that
aeronautics, and spin-off from space research for the civil aircraft
industry, would be given greater emphasis in Nasa's Dollars 14.5bn research
and development budget.
Aeronautics, although named first, has played the subsidiary role ever since
cancellation of research funds for the titanium Supersonic Transport (SST)
nearly quarter of a century ago. Now, Nasa has joint programmes with the US
aircraft industry on both supersonic and advanced subsonic airliners
expected to enter service early in the next century. New materials are one
of the main R&amp;D goals.
Nasa's European counterpart, the European Space Agency, is no less concerned
to bring more of its technology nearer the ground. Its technology transfer
initiative, run by Spacelink Europe, a consortium of technology brokers, has
identified no fewer than 170 opportunities for transfer, among them advanced
materials for heat resistance, lubrication, sensors and stiff lightweight
structures.
Earlier this year, one of Europe's most spectacular packages of advanced
materials, the Rolls-Royce Trent engine for Airbus A330, was certified on
schedule. The Trent is the most powerful engine Rolls-Royce has ever built.
Its makers claim it is significantly lighter than competing US engines and
runs at lower peak temperatures, while they remain confident it can be
pushed to 100,000 lbs thrust.
But Rolls-Royce has been at the forefront of those urging government to
recognise the profound importance of advanced engineering materials to
Britain as a manufacturing nation. The US subsidises aerospace materials
development through both Nasa and the Department of Defense. Germany, in
July, announced a new Pounds 500m subsidy for research to help its aerospace
industry meet US and Japanese competition. The Japanese have long supported
national programmes in such sectors as engineering ceramics, where many
believe they lead the world.
For Britain, the real purpose of the now-defunct Hotol project was as a
test-bed demonstrator for advanced materials development that would push
engines way beyond the Trent. Not only have UK engineers lost this
opportunity, but they face further cuts in materials R&amp;D through the
undertaking to axe defence R&amp;D by another Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m a year.
Moreover, two major UK sources of carbon fibre composites and other advanced
aerospace materials, ICI and Courtaulds, have both abandoned the field.
A more positive step is the appointment of an internationally renowned
materials scientist as chief executive of the new Engineering and Physical
Sciences Research Council. Richard Brook was Cookson Professor of materials
science and head of Oxford University's department of materials science. His
speciality is engineering ceramics.
Recognition that better materials are the key to higher performance in every
sector of engineering has slowly been gaining ground among decision-makers.
A report from the the UK government's Advisory Council on Science and
Technology (Acost) in 1992, reviewing advanced engineering materials,
concluded that 'with a few notable exceptions, the UK science and technology
base in these materials is weak. The level of R&amp;D is low, and the effort is
spread too thinly.' Among Acost's recommendations were that the government
should consider launching 'substantial demonstrator programmes' -
particularly in the aerospace and automotive sectors.
Prof Brook believes that, over the past two decades, R&amp;D has yielded
'enormous advances' in the properties of engineering ceramics. If harnessed,
such advances should translate into lighter engines that can be run at
higher temperatures. So far, they have not, and Prof Brook identifies three
reasons:
1. Engineering ceramics are still too costly, and although it is believed
that economies of scale would cut their costs the question remains: who is
to pay for the build-up in scale?
2. The vigour with which established materials - such as superalloys - react
to any threat from competing materials; and
3. 'The residual distaste of engineers for brittle behaviour', plus the fact
that the fracture toughness of ceramic materials can still be a problem for
many potential users.
As a result, 'research progress has not always brought the rewards that were
foreseen,' says Prof Brook.
Nevertheless, he identifies another three factors that give him considerable
encouragement:
1. An excellent base has now been established for systematic advance. He
cites the way the Japanese are using this base as the launchpad for their
synergy ceramics R&amp;D programme, a 10-year commitment involving Y100bn.
2. He sees merit in focusing on applications, where ceramics 'can deliver a
function that simply cannot be provided by other materials,' such as the
newly-discovered 'high-temperature' superconductors, where success would
drag other applications along in its wake.
3. Those who have been least successful in their pursuit of advanced ceramic
materials have been the loudest critics lately. 'The fact remains that a
modern industrial nation looking for technological advance will be better
placed if it can operate with full competence over the entire portfolio of
materials - ceramics, metals and polymers.'

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (16): Big spenders await the rush -
Airport development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DONNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With world air passenger traffic rising by 5 per cent a year, the current
annual passenger total of 1.25bn is expected to double by the early years of
the next century.
The air transport industry is gearing itself to meet this growth. Airlines
are gradually restructuring to improve their operational and financial
performance; manufacturers are building ever-larger aircraft; and airports
are increasing their own capacity.
More than 200 substantial airport modernisation and expansion schemes are
under way. They include new airports on land reclaimed from the sea, as at
Kansai, in Osaka Bay, Japan, and at Chek Lap Kok, off Lantau Island, Hong
Kong; the near-Pounds 1bn proposed Terminal Five at London's Heathrow; and
the comparatively simple but nonetheless vital smaller restructurings, such
as the Pounds 21m redevelopment at Southampton Eastleigh, also in the UK.
The International Civil Aviation Organisation, the aviation agency of the
United Nations, suggests that the cost of all this work is likely to be
Dollars 240bn over the next 10 years.
But this covers only the direct airport development costs - work being done
inside airport boundaries on terminals, runways and associated roads, and
items of internal equipment such as information systems, security systems,
passenger amenities and fire and rescue equipment.
It does not include the massive associated infrastructure costs outside,
which are just as necessary to enable airports to function smoothly. These
include road and rail links with adjacent cities (for example, the Pounds
300m direct rail link between Paddington station in central London and
Heathrow airport), and the big investments needed in air traffic control
(ATC) facilities (such as the Pounds 350m new en route ATC centre being
built at Fareham, Hampshire, by the Civil Aviation Authority for the UK
National Air Traffic Services).
If these outlays are also included, overall airport and associated
infrastructure costs over the next decade could rise to at least Dollars
400bn.
Oris Dunham, director-general of Airports Council International, an
independent non-profit body representing more than 420 international
airports in 139 countries, points out that keeping up the momentum of
airport development will require the co-operation of all elements of the air
transport system.
He suggests that there are four principal challenges: finding physical space
for the developments; finding the money; political considerations; and
increasing environmental concerns.
The first is already serious: breaking out of existing airport boundaries to
undertake new terminal or runway development is difficult for many reasons,
especially environmental constraints; and most airport authorities find they
have to squeeze new terminals out of existing space, meeting the increased
pressures by improved operational procedures. This is why some authorities -
in Japan, Hong Kong and Macao - have opted for the offshore airport
approach, although such solutions are available in few places.
The financial problem is just as difficult. While some of the money can be
derived from an airport's own activities - such as the expanding retailing
ventures by the British Airports Authority - in many cases, it must come
from either governments or the capital markets. An improvement in financial
management and operational efficiency by airport authorities can do much to
help secure outside investors' funds, without risking counter-productive
increases in tariffs for airlines and passengers.
The political problems stem from governments' need to recognise that the air
transport industry is a generator of economic growth, and not to be regarded
as a cash-cow for national treasuries and subjected to penal taxation.
The international Air Transport Action Group, representing airlines,
aircraft manufacturers, tourist bodies and other organisations involved in
air transport, is already doing much to stimulate governments to do more for
aviation. It points out that every 1m passengers passing through an airport
generate between 2,500 and 8,000 jobs, (depending upon airport size) and a
financial benefit to the local and national economy of between Dollars 130m
and Dollars 1.6bn.
In other words, growth in air transport drives economic progress, and in
turn benefits from it. Taxing air transport (such as through passenger
departure taxes) can only be acceptable to the industry if the money is fed
back into the development of the air transport infrastructure, but not if it
is used as just another means of raising revenues for non-aviation purposes.
The environmental challenge is likely to become even more severe. Much has
already been done to reduce aircraft noise and emission levels, but it seems
likely that more stringent regulations will be imposed in the next few
years. It also seems certain that existing night-noise curfews will in most
places become more restrictive, so that the burden of an increasing number
of flights will have to be met by increased efficiency in handling during
daylight.
This will in turn affect other elements of the overall system - with
pressure for faster handling of passengers through airports, improved access
to airports by road and rail, the use of larger aircraft, and tougher air
traffic controls.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (13): Satellites the top priority - A
look at spaceflight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Sunday, July 20, 1969, US astronaut Neil Armstrong, commander of the
spacecraft Apollo 11, became the first man to set foot on the moon. As he
took his momentous first step he said: 'That's one small step for man, one
giant leap for mankind.'
But 25 years later, the dizzy excitement of space exploration fuelled by the
race in space between the US and Russia has been replaced by the more
mundane worries of an industry fighting like many others for continued
public and government support to help fund its future development and
challenges.
Space has become a commercial enterprise, albeit a high-risk one, and many
of its remarkable technological achievements are now taken for granted by a
population more concerned about jobs and welfare than by new scientific
discoveries and the prospect of human beings living and working in space one
day.
'I find it rather sad to see around here a relatively small crowd of people.
When I've been here in the past it was jam-packed,' said a senior executive
of the Anglo-French Matra Marconi Space group. He was speaking moments
before the launch in July at Cape Kennedy in Florida of the US shuttle
Columbia carrying an international space laboratory inside its cargo bay.
The launch was spectacular and successful. The shuttle was blasted into
orbit in a great cloud of smoke for a 14-day mission when its seven crew,
including Japan's first woman astronaut, conducted life science and other
scientific microgravity experiments inside the Dollars 1bn laboratory.
But it made little impact in the news. In the US, the big stories were the
trial of a famous American football star, floods in Georgia, unemployment
figures and the death of the North Korean leader. If the American newspapers
relegated the mission to the inside pages of their newspapers, it was lucky
to find even the briefest of mentions in the European press. Only the
Japanese covered the story in full, reflecting the presence on board the
shuttle of the first Japanese woman in space and the determination of Japan
to build up a strong presence in the space sector.
In Japan, the government space budget is continuing to rise while it is
declining elsewhere. The latest victim of budgetary reappraisals in Europe
is the Hermes project to build a European manned space vehicle. In the US,
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is having to fight
for funds every year and many of its space projects, especially the Dollars
30bn space station due to be completed by 2002 and involving broad
international collaboration, are living on a budgetary knife-edge.
With the emphasis now being placed increasingly on the commercial
opportunities offered by space, governments, space agencies and
manufacturers of space equipment have been concentrating on the satellite
business, in particular for earth observation, meteorology and
communications. Governments have also continued to show growing interest in
satellites for military applications. The role played by satellites in the
Gulf war has further boosted this interest.
In turn, competition in the satellite and satellite launch business has
intensified. The commercial battle has essentially pitted the US against
Europe. In the commercial satellite launch business, Europe has managed to
build a leading position during the past 14 years with Arianespace and its
Ariane rockets.
The French-led Ariane programme has done for the European space industry
what the Airbus consortium has achieved in the civil aircraft field: the
establishment of a credible competitor to the US dominance of commercial
aerospace markets that lasted until the early 1980s. But although Ariane has
now taken a share of more than 50 per cent of the commercial satellite
launch market, it is facing tough competition not only from US launchers but
also from Russia, China and Japan, all seeking to penetrate the western
market.
With a finite market of around 20 commercial satellite launches a year, the
battle for market share has provoked increasing international trade tensions
mirroring those in the commercial aircraft market between the US and Europe.
The US have accused the Europeans of subsidising its rocket launcher
industry, while the Europeans have accused the Americans of
cross-subsidising commercial launch operations with their large military
satellite market, which to all intents remains closed to international
competitors. And both the US and Europe have campaigned against price
dumping for satellite launches by the Russians and the Chinese and sought to
negotiate trade agreements with these countries.
Competition has been equally fierce in the satellite manufacturing side of
the business. It has forced leading manufacturers to seek wider partnerships
and has led to increasing consolidation in the industry. In Europe, two big
transnational groups are being established to create the economies of scale
necessary to compete in a tight market.
The French Matra group has already merged its satellite activities with
those of the UK General Electric Company into a joint venture called
Matra-Marconi Space, which is 51 per cent held by the French concern.
Matra-Marconi Space is now acquiring the space systems division of British
Aerospace in a deal which would create a European space group with annual
sales of more than Dollars 1bn. At the same time, Deutsche Aerospace, the
aerospace arm of the Daimler-Benz car group, is negotiating to merge its
space operations with those of Aerospatiale, the French state-controlled
aerospace company.
But if the prospects for the satellite business remain secure, even though
it is likely to face increasingly competitive pressures, the future of
manned space flights continues to be clouded with uncertainty. NASA
officials concede that the fate of the US space shuttle will hinge on
whether the US-led programme to build an international space station will
survive or suffer from government budgetary cuts.
The Dollars 30bn project is designed to create a permanent orbiting science
institute in space capable of performing long-term research in materials and
life sciences in a gravity-free environment. NASA says that this fundamental
research will accelerate breakthroughs in technology and engineering that
will have practical applications on earth.
'What governments must decide is whether you should continue supporting
long-term fundamental scientific research and space exploration or simply go
for short-term commercial pay backs,' said one senior US space industry
official.
The issue is now taking on, once again, an international political
dimension. But in contrast to the race between the US and Russia 25 years
ago when the two superpowers were competing to outmanoeuvre each other to
take the leadership in space, they are now working increasingly together.
NASA recently signed a Dollars 400m contract with the Russian space agency
to support a joint programme involving the US space shuttle and the Russian
Mir space station. The contract also covers co-operation in the planned
international space station.
This collaboration, which both sides see as consolidating the new post Cold
War era, could prove to be the main driving force to keep alive the
long-term ambitions of the international space industry.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (14): Paper aeroplanes are looking dated
 -Computers and teamwork cut development costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is no surprise that spending by aerospace companies on computer-aided
design, manufacturing and engineering software is such an important part of
their capital investment, as it addresses key issues for the industry's
future - 'time to market' and global competitiveness.
The trend towards 'paperless aircraft' and more efficient links with
component suppliers is being driven by a need to reduce product development
times through concurrent or simultaneous engineering. This requires a much
greater sense of teamwork among different functions, and between suppliers
and customers, supported by computers. Behind all this is the relentless
drive to cut development costs.
According to Dataquest, the US-based market research concern, worldwide
spending on Cad/Cam/Cae and GIS (Geographical Information Systems) software
by the aerospace/missiles/and space vehicles sector was Dollars 422.1m in
1992, accounting for 8.5 per cent of the total spent by industry.
The relevance of such software can be seen in programmes at all the main
airframe manufacturers, civil or military. At McDonnell Douglas, which is
one of the largest users of EDS Unigraphics software, the most modern
fighter aircraft in the world, the F/A 18-E/F, is being designed using all
the collaborative elements offered by a process called Electronic Product
Development.
Unigraphics says that Northrop in California, GE Aircraft Engines in
Cincinnati and McDonnell Douglas in St Louis are able to work as one team,
sharing data, reviewing designs and programme plans on-line, while building
a 3D model that can be verified and tested on screen, then manufactured in
the knowledge that parts will fit.
Expensive physical mock-ups are therefore eliminated. Unigraphics says its
target now is to allow airframe and engine manufacturers to handle a digital
model of up to 10,000 components effectively.
Where a 'real' part is needed, the aerospace industry has taken quickly to
the concept of 'rapid prototyping'. A process known as stereolithography is
used to create a full-scale part, normally made out of plastic resin, from a
three-dimension Cad file. This saves weeks or even months on the traditional
pattern-making process.
At the other end of the line, with the customers in the airline industry,
there are programmes such as Intergraph's Veramis (Vehicle Repair and
Maintenance Information System), used by KLM and Virgin Atlantic Airways.
This enables complete aircraft and aircraft sections to be visualised as
intelligent three-dimensional computer images, and is said to be up to five
times faster than manual repair registration systems.
A report about to be published by Dataquest* analyses some of the trends
influencing the purchase of Cad/Cam/Cae software, and the extent to which
the aerospace industry has moved towards paperless design and production.
Among them are:
The need to interchange information with suppliers and subcontractors. The
capital cost and scale of operation involved with the design and manufacture
of a complete new aircraft is prohibitive, it says, resulting in relatively
few large organisations supplying a few customers using a high percentage of
subcontracted parts.
'Changes to an aircraft design at any stage can ripple through the supply
chain, causing many changes in the lower levels,' says Dataquest. 'Minor
changes at lower levels can cause major problems with designs at higher
levels. It is vital that information flow, even if restricted, is accurate.'
Methods for information interchange. Low-level subcontractors providing
sub-assemblies to a rigid specification provide electronic information to
their customers, usually on magnetic media. High-level companies require
certification of design and sign-offs for designs. At present, these must
usually be in paper format, forming legal documentation, backed up with
electronic data.
The problems of security and the need for legal acceptance of designs are
the key reasons for the continued use of paper-based information transfer.
Electronic interchange is typically used for prototypes, working designs and
intermittent information.
Importance of Cad for the design activity. The use of Cad/Cam/Cae tools is
widespread, with high percentages of products being developed using them.
The ability to model assemblies, interactive parts, and to test parts
functionally are invaluable. Many systems can provide the specialist
features and functions required by aerospace manufacturers.
Decision process to purchase new systems. The nature of aerospace
developments has forced the development of customised systems, which must
support many projects that may all be at different stages of their life
cycle, and may be undertaken on an international basis. So in many aerospace
companies, the purchase of design tools is part of a global IT strategy.
Another significant factor, says Dataquest, is the increasing importance of
international consortia and joint development agreements, such as Airbus.
'These approaches force commonality in the purchase of compatible systems
that ripple through the supply chain, influencing the effectiveness and
requirements for integrated product development.'

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (12): SST-2 is still far away - A look
at the successor to Concorde
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DONNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The development of a second-generation supersonic airliner to succeed the
Anglo-French Concorde depends on two factors - satisfactory financing and
production arrangements and solving the outstanding technological
difficulties, especially those affecting the environment.
Few doubt that such an aircraft will eventually emerge, although it is now
accepted that its likely birthdate may be around 2010 to 2015.
By 2000, Concorde will have been in service with British Airways and Air
France for nearly 25 years, so that every year thereafter heightens the
possibility of either a diminution of existing supersonic services as
Concordes age and are 'cannibalised' for spares, or a gap of some years
before a successor emerges.
Despite the aerospace industry's desire to start developing a successor,
there is little enthusiasm for such an aircraft among the world's leading
airlines, faced as they are with their cumulative losses of more than
Dollars 15bn over the past four years. They are more inclined to spend their
available cash on airliners that are more likely to meet mass market
demands, help reduce congestion and generate profits, than on
second-generation supersonic transports. As a result, they are far more
interested in a new subsonic 500-plus seater, the so-called megajumbo, than
a second-generation supersonic transport.
Moreover, the airlines remain suspicious about the financial and
environmental acceptability of an SST-2.
The two airlines flying Concordes, British Airways and Air France, have made
it clear that while they may be interested in the long-term in any SST-2,
they want to be absolutely sure that such an aircraft is profitable to buy
and fly from the start, and totally acceptable in every way to the
communities it will serve. They are keenly aware that government-imposed
environmental constraints upon the airlines and aerospace industries are
likely to become even more stringent in the next century, and such an
aircraft, may well face environmental constraints that have not yet even
been defined.
The SST-2 research so far has been concentrated on an aircraft seating 300
passengers (against Concorde's 100), with a range of about 5,600 to 6,000
nautical miles (against Concorde's 3,000), and a speed of around about
1,500mph.
Despite the undeniable advances in research into supersonic transport
technology since Concorde first went into service in 1976, especially in the
reduction of nitrous oxide emissions (N0x), the latter remain a problem.
There is also still no answer to the sonic boom created by large aircraft
flying at twice the speed of sound even at high altitude. This means that
future supersonic services would still be largely restricted to over-ocean
routes, with subsonic flights over land masses. This, in turn, means that
interest in such aircraft is likely to be confined to those airlines with a
substantial number of long-distance over-ocean flights in their overall
operational patterns.
There is also the problem of development cost, likely to be between Dollars
8bn-10bn, or about the same as the cost of any subsonic megajumbo. It is
doubtful whether aerospace industries could finance both developments in
tandem.
Although demand for the megajumbo may be limited - with perhaps only a score
or so airlines likely to support it initially - its ultimate market seems
likely to be significantly larger than that for a second-generation SST. The
airlines believe that the subsonic megajumbo is more likely to improve their
battered balance sheets.
Another reason for airline scepticism about the SST-2 is that while much
technical research is under way, especially in the US through the
government-sponsored National Aeronautics and Space Administration, there is
still no sign of a coherent and practicable design, development, production
and marketing plan for such an aircraft.
While theoretically the airlines might prefer to have competitive designs
from which to choose, industrial and financial logic dictates that one
common design would stand more chance of economic and technological success.
But any kind of agreement on such a formula appears to be a long way off.
There have been wide-ranging international discussions between the US
manufacturers, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, and their European
counterparts, British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Alenia of Italy and DASA of
Germany, with both Russian and Japanese companies also involved, on the
possibilities of an eventual joint venture.
At the same time, however, the US and European companies have also been
pursuing their individual studies.
The balance appears strongly to favour the US at present in terms of
government financial involvement. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been,
and still are being pumped into aeronautical research through NASA's own
high-speed research programme, and by the leading engine and airframe
manufacturers. There is no comparable coherent programme in Europe.
Concerned at this situation, the leading European manufacturers earlier this
summer told their respective governments and the EU that some level of state
and/or community input to help research into a Concorde successor was
essential, so as to ensure that Europe did not fall behind the US. So far,
however, there has been little sign of any such cash support. Any single
SST-2 venture would also probably have to be global anyway, to ensure the
widest spread of costs and the biggest possible market. Whether US
anti-trust laws would permit such an alliance remains a significant query.
Demands for cash to finance the renewal of much of the existing ageing
subsonic fleet are already heavy, and will escalate as traffic grows and
fleet expansion becomes imperative. Lenders other than governments seem more
likely to favour the procurement of a subsonic megajumbo, offering some
guarantee of successful financial returns, than any SST-2 venture.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (11): The race is on to build the big
'un - A look at the industry's next challenge, the super jumbo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The world's two leading commercial aircraft manufacturers - Boeing of the US
and the European Airbus consortium - have been stepping up the pace in their
efforts to meet what they believe will be the next big challenge for the
industry: the development of a new generation of super jumbo airliners
capable of seating 600-800 passengers and possible even more.
For the past two years, Boeing and the four Airbus partner companies
including Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace and
Casa of Spain have been conducting joint studies on how to develop and
market together a Very Large Commercial Transport (VLCT). But the two sides
have also remained deeply suspicious of each other and have continued to
pursue their own studies in the event their ambitious VLCT collaborative
project collapses.
So far only two airlines have said they would be prepared to commit
themselves to buying a super jumbo. Not surprisingly, the two are the
world's most profitable carriers, Singapore Airlines and British Airways.
However, most other international carriers, still struggling under the
burden of financial losses and debt accumulated during the industry's worst
post-war recession, have been reluctant to express anything more than a
vague interest in a large capacity airliner which is likely to cost them
around Dollars 200m a piece.
That has not deterred the two manufacturers on each side of the Atlantic to
pursue their studies. They believe that in the longer term there will be a
requirement for around 300-500 super jumbos in the next century. They see
these extra large aircraft as providing a solution to increasing congestion
at busy international airports and air routes at a time when air travel is
expected to continue showing steady expansion and in some areas in the
Asia-Pacific region vigorous growth.
'We think a big aircraft is necessary to cope with traffic growth and
congestion at airports, especially when you consider that 33 airports alone
account for 50 per cent of world air traffic,' says Claude Terrazzoni, head
of the commercial aircraft division of Aerospatiale, the French Airbus
partner.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, explains that a super jumbo would help
the UK carrier tackle some of the growing congestion problems at its London
base of Heathrow. It would also give BA the opportunity to offer new
services for passengers. BA has already made its own design studies for the
configuration of such an aircraft, including the introduction of inflight
business offices equipped with faxes, telephones and personal computers, a
cinema-style inflight entertainment room, and even a work-out section for
fitness addicts.
'We see the use for such an aircraft on Far East routes, Australasia
services and across the Atlantic,' Sir Colin says. 'And we would be willing
to go forward with a new aircraft of 600 seats offering the same long range
but also 20 per cent lower operating costs than the Boeing 747-400,' he
adds. Jean Pierson, the Airbus chief executive, believes there will be
demand for a very large aircraft by the turn of the century. 'By around
2002, airlines will have to consider replacing their existing 747-400
fleets,' he explains.
But both Boeing and Airbus agree that there is unlikely to be room in the
market for more than one new super jumbo project in view of the programme's
heavy development costs estimated at around Dollars 8bn-Dollars 10bn. This
was the main reason behind the decision of Boeing and the four Airbus
partners to consider collaborating in the same way as US, European and
Japanese manufacturers believe that the eventual development of a next
generation supersonic airliner to replace Concorde will need the broadest
possible international co-operation.
Although Boeing and the Airbus partners have pursued their joint VLCT
studies, there have been growing signs of tensions emerging between the two
sides and strong possibilities that they will ultimately decide to part
ways.
Airbus has become increasingly worried that Boeing is using the joint
studies as a tactic to delay the European consortium's entry into the very
large aircraft market and challenge the US company's traditional monopoly of
this sector with its 747. The Airbus theory is that Boeing is in no hurry to
launch a new large aircraft development programme at a time when its hands
are already full with other projects including its new 777 widebody
twin-engine airliner, the renewal of its 737 family of narrowbody
twin-engine airliners and the development of a cargo version of the 767.
Boeing has clearly been anxious to protect its dominance of the top end of
the market and has maintained close contacts with airline customers. Apart
from the joint studies with the Airbus partners, Boeing has been considering
developing a bigger version of the 747 with a new wing. It has also been
studying the development on its own of a new very large aircraft.
With increasing signs that Boeing's preferred option is to build a bigger
derivative of the 747 and that the Seattle manufacturer is already quite
advanced with its studies, Airbus recently decided to step up its own
efforts to develop a new 500 to 600-seat jumbo, the A3XX.
'You simply cannot afford to be out of such an important segment of the
market if you want to remain a leading aircraft manufacturer,' says a senior
Airbus official. All manufacturers expect the top end of the airliner market
to become increasingly important with aircraft of more than 400 seats
accounting for more than 40 per cent of the value of the civil aircraft
business in the next 20 years.
'We must give Boeing the strongest possible signal that Airbus will develop
its own jumbo if Boeing decided to go it alone with a bigger 747,' adds
Louis Gallois, the Aerospatiale chairman.
This has prompted the Airbus supervisory board to give the consortium the
go-ahead to start marketing in September its new A3XX jumbo to a selected
group of international airlines after the Farnborough Air Show. The Airbus
plans involve an aircraft with two decks running the full length of the
fuselage, powered by four engines and would have a range of 7,000-8,000
nautical miles.
With the probabilities increasing that Boeing and Airbus will ultimately
decide to go their own separate ways in the jumbo market, the race is now on
to build the world's biggest aircraft.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (9): Everyone is aiming to get smart - A
look at the way ahead for manufacturers of missiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Gulf War has coloured thinking in most areas of military doctrine. So
much so that the sales pitch now chanted by all arms dealers is that their
products were vindicated in Operation Desert Storm.
Of those systems which genuinely had their reputations enhanced, stealth
technology, while expensive for most nations, was a worthy runner-up. The
clear winners, however, were guided weapons. Pictures of precision-guided
'smart' munitions not only impressed the watching taxpayer, they also made
an impact on force commanders under pressure to keep casualties at a
minimum.
Some watchers are now so enthusiastic that they think guided weapons will
take over from traditional ordnance. 'The way ahead is definitely with smart
weapons,' says Kent Kresa, chairman of Northrop Grumman. 'Given the desire
to protect troops, I can't see the US ordering any dumb munitions at all as
we develop new technologies.'
Yet, while the idea of using guided missiles is popular, the overall
pressure on all western defence budgets is still making life tough for
missile manufacturers. In the UK there is interest in developing a
long-range conventionally armed air-to-ground missile, but it remains to be
seen how much funding is available for the project.
The US is also keen on advanced technologies and is still pursuing scaled
down 'star wars' anti-missile missiles through its theatre ballistic missile
defences. Projects such as Lockheed's Theatre High Altitude Area Defence
(THAAD) missile have received backing and THAAD has a four-year Dollars 689m
development contract. Yet, even in the US missile manufacturers are having
to adjust as procurement spending falls.
As elsewhere in the defence industry, rationalisation and merger are seen to
be the way to cope with the downturn.
The consolidation seems to be proceeding more smoothly in the US than
Europe. In a typical deal aimed at reaping the full benefits of
rationalisation, Hughes acquired General Dynamics' missile business, and
then consolidated all manufacturing on its own site in Tucson, Arizona, and
closed General Dynamics factories in southern California.
In the US, Raytheon and Hughes lead the pack while Martin Marietta and
Lockheed are still involved as missile manufacturers, but beyond that it is
by no means clear how many groupings will survive. Construction of some
systems is still split between several companies, increasing overheads.
Whether the market can sustain more than two or three mainstream missile
makers is questionable.
In Europe, the outlines of possible mergers are beginning to become clearer,
but progress is still painfully slow. Much collaboration has been on
specific programmes, for example the BAe-Aerospatiale-Deutsche Aerospace
Trigat anti-tank missile. But such collaborative ventures tend to suffer
from many of the disadvantages of high overheads and compromise designs.
Still, since missiles contain some of the highest technology under
development, countries are reluctant to release control for national
security reasons as well as industrial concerns.
There are talks about wholesale mergers, some of which have been mooted for
a long time. British Aerospace's negotiations with Matra continue unabated,
while hints of a merger between Aerospatiale's and Deutsche Aerospace's
missile businesses gather pace. In part, these mergers would help cut out
duplication in research and development, and would cut down on the high
level of cut-throat competition which has hurt profit margins. It may also
be a prelude to a grand missile merger of both groups to form a European
missile giant which could be capable of developing the kind of ballistic
missile defence systems some European countries are starting to covet.
It is more difficult to see how the electronics manufacturers for missile
systems - companies such as GEC-Marconi in the UK and Thomson in France -
fit in to such a grand scheme. It may be that by providing sophisticated
specialised equipment, such as sensors, to a range of missile makers
worldwide, they can gain sufficient scale to remain viable in their current
form. Equally, there may be a horizontal merger between electronics
companies to produce a large sub-system supplier. But the idea that
GEC-Marconi might take over BAe Dynamics, for example, seems to have faded.
Other ways of cutting costs in the hostile environment are also being tried.
Efforts are being made in Europe and in the US to cut costs by transferring
technologies between missile systems. Unfortunately, adapting equipment from
air-to-air missiles for use in ship-to-ship combat is neither as easy nor as
obvious as it might appear. The conditions under which the missiles have to
operate vary so much that a weapon optimised for conditions on the wing of a
Mach-2 fighter may suffer badly when exposed to corrosive sea spray.
As with so many areas, decisions on procurement will determine which
companies gain the upper hand in mergers, and indeed, which can survive in
the missile business. In the UK, there is a need for a long-range stand-off
air-to-ground missile based on the Gulf War experience. A new medium-range
missile is needed for the Eurofighter, and a short-range anti-armour
air-to-ground missile for the Harrier is under consideration. A range of
anti-armour and anti-ship weapons are being developed in continental Europe
and the US is considering a new short-range air-to-air missile.
Unless individual countries are prepared to allow transfer of missile
manufacturing abroad, and it remains one of the most sensitive cutting edge
technologies around, Europe will continue to pay higher prices for fewer
weapons than the US. Rumour suggests that the long-awaited BAe-Matra merger
may be announced at Farnborough, as a 50-50 joint venture and a Frenchman in
the chair. If it happens, it will not be a moment too soon.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (10): Size is the critical factor:
Avionics - A look at the move by companies to restructure operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The twin forces of recession and cuts in defence spending have forced
consolidation and restructuring on the world's avionics and component
suppliers.
The end of the cold war led western governments to reduce military spending.
In civil aviation, the prolonged recession, and the Gulf War not only
decimated the tourist industry sharply reducing passenger numbers, but
coincided with a glut in airliners coming off the production lines. Although
airline traffic has started growing again, several hundred aircraft remain
parked in the desert.
It was thus only a matter of time before manufacturers of components and
avionics, the next tier down in the supply chain, would be forced to share
the burden. Customers have not only been pushing for cost reductions among
the suppliers but have been demanding more sophisticated products and
reducing the number of suppliers with which they have to deal.
The sector's response has been consolidation and restructuring which some
say is similar to one seen in the automotive industry a decade ago.
Much of it has taken the form of mergers and acquisitions though strategic
alliances have not been far behind, bringing together once bitter
competitors, with cost and risk sharing being a prime mover in the drive for
market leadership.
Examples of companies moving in that direction include Smiths Industries of
the UK which formed an alliance with its competitor Rockwell International
Corporation of the US three years ago, to provide full flight integration
system. Some saw this as an attempt by the new group to compete with
Honeywell, the US electronic control systems group which is the market
leader in that field. Honeywell has in turn formed an alliance with two UK
companies; one with Racal on satellite communications systems and another
with the GEC on the fly-by-wire systems.
But not all proposed alliances have been carried through and this year the
biggest disappointment has been the failure of the proposed merger between
France's Sextant-Avionique and Allied Signal of the US. The deal would have
made the combined group number three in its field. But where a merger or
alliance has been successfully carried out, manufacturing improvement
initiatives have been introduced and new technologies developed.
The restructuring in the sector began in the United States, the world's
biggest aerospace market, and the first to face the chill winds of recession
and the first wave of defence cuts.
Deals by prime contractors such as Martin Marietta's acquisition of General
Electric's aerospace division in 1992 and General Dynamic's sale of its
missiles subsidiary to GM Hughes in the same year were cited as the trigger
for a similar shake-up or 're-engineering' among the suppliers.
The search for market leadership has usually been the driving force behind
the consolidation attempts. Companies with product lines in third or even
fourth place in their chosen market place have been forced to either quit
the field or seek an alliance in an attempt to strengthen their market
position.
Mr Paul Saleh, vice-president and treasurer at Honeywell, which is a
supplier to both the military and civil aerospace markets, said: 'What we
have seen over the last few years is a need for each supplier to be a leader
in its specialised field. You have to be a leader in technology with a
reputation for delivery and have the trust of the customer.'
He acknowledges that size has become the critical factor, and says it is not
only useful in terms of economies of scale but also suggests it is the
bigger companies that can afford the ever increasing development costs.
'This is a global market that is becoming more competitive and there is
little room for marginal participants,' he said.
Mr Saleh highlighted a new move in the restructuring process, that of
'out-sourcing' of a complete part of the production process, to the
supplier. This he believes will become increasingly prevalent among
suppliers to the civil sector in which change has been slower than on the
military side, due in part to the small number of big manufacturers,
McDonald Douglas, Airbus, and Boeing.
Earlier this year, Boeing provided the biggest example of 'out-sourcing' to
a supplier with its decision to hand over the complete manufacturing and
integrating of the flight deck system on its new 777 airliner to Honeywell.
The move was not only seen as an attempt to meet customer induced cost cuts
but was hailed as a first in 'working together with the customer' by
suppliers. It is also seen as a possible indicator of the next level of
restructuring as Honeywell attempts to push costs of its suppliers lower.
European companies have been no less ready to meet the challenge of the new
harsh environment and analysts have pointed to possible cost benefits of
between 10 and 20 per cent from restructuring the industry.
Lucas Industries, the automotive components and aerospace group, is cited as
an example of a company that is attempting to become a world leader among
European suppliers.
Mr Frank Turner, managing director of Lucas Aerospace, said: 'We took a look
at what was happening in the industry and at ourselves and decided we had to
do something if we were to remain in the game.'
The company has gone all out to transform itself from a component supplier
to the aerospace industry into a systems integrator. As part of that plan it
paid Pounds 18.9m a year ago to acquire TI Group subsidiary Dowty's fuel
control business and in June signed a joint venture agreement to establish a
repair and overhaul facility for engine and flight control systems in China.
But it is 1993's merger between Dowty and Snecma's Messier Bugatti of France
to form a world leader in landing gear that many have pointed to as the
clearest example of the restructuring that is taking place among component
suppliers in Europe.
Mr Tony Edwards, chief executive of Dowty Aerospace, said: 'We wanted to be
a world player in landing gear so we align ourselves to achieve that goal.
We sold those businesses where we could not be a global player.'
However, analysts say similar deals will be more difficult to achieve. They
point to nationalism - the wish to retain a particular industry in a country
 -and sensitivity to national defence interests as two factors that may act
as a brake on restructuring. Thus alliances, rather than straightforward
mergers, may be the route for European companies wanting to compete with the
giants of the US.
But Mr Paul Compton, aerospace and defence analyst at Credit Lyonnais,
believes joint ventures are of less benefit than full mergers as national
interests tend to intervene especially on decisions such as a reduction in
staff numbers. Thus, he said, the very nature of a joint venture was likely
to create inefficiency.
He concluded: 'The US sector is almost twice the size of that of Europe and
what is more it is homogenous and thus does not suffer from nationalistic
barriers. Europe will have to decide whether its nationalistic differences
can be forgotten in a bid to form global companies or it will be left behind
in a key world industry.'

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (7): Battle is on to design fighter of
the future - A look at the dilemma faced by defence departments and
manufacturers of military aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Times have rarely been tougher for the makers of military aircraft. In
western domestic markets, manufacturers are being relentlessly squeezed by
reduced military spending on the one hand and escalating development costs
for the next generation of equipment on the other. Export markets are also
shrinking, because traditional Gulf states buyers are also short of cash.
What is worse, now the cold war has ended, few western countries have a
clear idea of the threat which the next generation of advanced aircraft will
have to meet. As a result, many aircraft development programmes are being
stretched and there is increasing doubt about whether some aircraft under
development will ever enter service.
Perhaps the safest of all programmes in this shaky situation is the F-22 US
air superiority fighter. The aircraft has been under development for the
past five years by Lockheed and Boeing and is designed to be a Mach-2
radar-evading 'stealth' aircraft which will guarantee the US command of the
air up to 2020. Since air superiority is seen as vital by the US - a view
confirmed by the Gulf War - the F-22 has strong backing from the air force,
the Pentagon, and, crucially, from Congress.
Because dominance of the air is seen by the US as an end in itself, few
question the threat the F-22 will have to counter or the vast Dollars 71bn
cost of producing the 442 air interceptors. Indeed, with plans for a new
naval fighter to replace the F/A-18 scrapped, the department of defence is
considering a carrier-based variant of the F-22 instead. And as the F-111
long-range strike aircraft is being retired early in 1996, the F-22 is one
possibility to undertake that kind of air-to-ground strike mission.
Despite the crash of one of the YF-22 prototypes, development is proceeding
well. Work remains to be done in reducing the aircraft's weight and improve
its stealth, but the programme is progressing smoothly.
Lockheed, which has two-thirds of the project now that it has bought General
Dynamics' tactical aircraft business, has yet to decide whether to
consolidate its operations on one site, or continue development at Fort
Worth in Texas and at Marietta in Georgia. While working on one site might
be more economical, Texas is an important state politically and Georgia is
the home of the leader of the Senate armed services committee. The company
will thus have to balance politics against economics in deciding the future
of the programme.
In Europe, there is less certainty about the future of next generation
fighters. Eurofighter continues to be dogged by worries about German
commitment to the project - worries which are unlikely to be resolved until
after the federal elections this autumn.
If Germany does reduce its order for Eurofighters, there will be some
difficult negotiations about how work in the production phase should be
split between the British, German, Italian and Spanish partners. Germany
would not be entitled to the third of construction work it was originally
allocated if it orders fewer than the 250 Eurofighters it indicated it might
buy or even the 140 recently mooted.
The UK may even strengthen its hand by ordering more than the 250 it
originally signed on for and buy another 100 fighters to replace its Tornado
interceptor fleet. However, transferring the tooling from German factories
to other partners might be uneconomic and an alternative solution may have
to be found.
Potentially more damaging is the worry that uncertainty over the German
position could delay the programme further, increasing costs and, if the
in-service date slips, reducing the Eurofighter's technical edge over
potential rivals. As one US industrialist said, 'Eurofighter is a good
aircraft, but they really must get on and build it before it dates.'
Cost concerns on such collaborative programmes are also worrying
governments. While the partners want to spread the development costs by
working together, duplication of effort and progress at the pace of the
slowest dulls the benefits. A British government official said that he would
be surprised if any of these collaborative programmes had saved money over a
solo development project in the end.
France and Sweden have avoided the pitfalls of collaboration by going it
alone with their Rafale and Grippen fighters, but they have their own
problems. Exports will be difficult for either aircraft since it will be in
service with fewer air forces than the Eurofighter.
If times are tough in fighter aircraft, they are scarcely easy elsewhere.
The US has stopped production of its B-2 stealth bomber at 20, though
Congress has voted Dollars 100m to keep the production line open for another
year.
Northrop-Grumman, the aircraft's manufacturer, has offered to make a further
20 aircraft for a bargain Dollars 595m each. While this is less than the
Dollars 850m which the first 20 cost, it may not be cheap enough to make a
cash-strapped department of defence open its wallet.
Another over-budget Californian aircraft is also in trouble. The C-17
strategic jet transport aircraft has already cost its maker McDonnell
Douglas about Dollars 1bn in cost overruns. The department of defence has
suggested building 40 aircraft and then evaluating its performance with a
view to building the 120 originally planned. But at almost Dollars 300m
each, the aircraft is hideously expensive. The C-17 must pass a month-long
examination next year - including simulated operations under war conditions
 -if it is to secure further funding. However, as California will be a key
state in the 1996 presidential election, President Clinton will have to
think long and hard before scrapping the programme.
In Europe, the debate is over tactical military transport with a consortium
that is likely to come under the Airbus aegis keen to develop a replacement
for the Hercules. The Future Large Aircraft would be able to carry larger
loads than the Hercules and would fly faster, but would also cost more.
Estimates of its development costs run from Pounds 2bn to Pounds 5bn, and
while continental countries are enthusiastically promoting the idea, full
funding is not yet in place.
Perhaps unfortunately, the FLA's first battle is against the new C-130J
Hercules to replace the RAF's existing fleet. With Britain lukewarm about
the project, it is an uphill climb. But with military budgets likely to be
under pressure everywhere for the foreseeable future, it is the kind of
battle that aerospace manufacturers worldwide are going to have to get used
to.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (8): There's a lull in the life of a
cottage industry - A look at the market for helicopters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cottage industry of helicopter manufacture has had as much trouble as
the rest of the aerospace industry in recent years. With three-quarters of
all production destined for the military market the fall in weapons
procurement has taken its toll. Particularly so since the US military, long
the most enthusiastic devotees of the helicopter as transport and weapon,
had filled the bulk of their Apache attack programme and were in any case
headed for a lull.
In the civil market, the recession in Europe and the US has taken its toll
on orders, too. Corporate executives cutting staff can hardly be seen
ordering the new executive aerial runabout.
As a result, the helicopter business, which has persisted as a slightly
quirky specialism running at steady if unspectacular volumes from
traditional sites, has experienced the kind of lull, and inevitable
retrenchment, which it had avoided for many years.
But because almost all manufacturers are owned by large conglomerates, there
has not yet been the rationalisation seen in many other aerospace sectors.
There are still seven principal helicopter makers - Eurocopter, Westland and
Agusta in Europe and Bell Textron, Sikorsky, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas in
the US. Even the one which was put up for sale, McDonnell Douglas's
helicopter operation which produces the very successful AH-64 Apache, was
eventually withdrawn from the market due to lack of interest.
Nor is it at all clear that further consolidation is close. One industry
executive points out that while the businesses are individually small they
mostly occupy separate niches. The only company to change hands, Westland,
lost its independence to GKN, the automotive engineering company, rather
than another helicopter maker. If there is to be consolidation of the number
of manufacturers, that may well be as a result of changes in corporate
strategy by the parent companies, rather than conditions in the helicopter
market.
Nonetheless, conditions in the market mean that parent companies and
governments sponsoring helicopter development face some difficult choices.
In Europe, the development of three helicopters is placing great strain on
government budgets.
The Westland-Agusta EH-101 large helicopter has perhaps the safest future.
It has a production contract for 44 anti-submarine warfare naval variants
from the Royal Navy, and looks certain to get a further order for 25 utility
transport versions from the Royal Air Force later this year. The Italian
government is also due to order some, and interest has come from potential
export markets, notably from Saudi Arabia, which is interested in the ASW
variant.
The other two helicopters being designed by European teams face a more
uncertain fate. The NH-90, being designed by the Franco-German Eurocopter
group in collaboration with Italy and the Netherlands, is a smaller utility
helicopter which would transport about 20 troops. There is a market in
replacing ageing Puma and Sea King transporters, but the development costs
are high, and there are several competitors.
The Tiger attack helicopter also addresses a strong market as more armies
move towards the US doctrine of integrated air-land battle, with helicopters
and tanks working in tandem. However, it too faces strong competition from
the Apache and, for armed forces looking for something a little cheaper, the
revamped Bell Cobra Venom with a new glass cockpit made by GEC-Marconi. With
defence budgets stretched both the NH-90 and the Tiger may not make it into
production.
In the US, Boeing will continue to hold the niche for very large helicopters
with the Chinook, not least because the cost of developing an alternative
would be prohibitive. Bell Textron also look likely to keep their strong
position in light helicopters.
But McDonnell Douglas will have to continue to evolve away from its
dependence on the Apache, and Sikorsky cannot be entirely sure of the future
of the next-generation Comanche reconnaissance and attack helicopter. At
present the Comanche has firm political backing, but if the budget squeeze
gets much worse, the Comanche may come under pressure from the Apache.
The V-22 Osprey helicopter-cum-prop-aircraft also has strong backing, but
the future of several of the helicopters, and the fate of their
manufacturers, will rest on procurement decisions in the next few years. In
particular, the race to replace ageing US marine fleets will be important.
In Europe, too, there are several important procurement decisions pending.
Most prominent, and immediate, is the UK's requirement for a Pounds 2bn
programme of 91 attack helicopters. Here the competition is between the
Apache, which would be manufactured under licence by Westland, the AH-1W
Cobra Venom with the GEC-Marconi glass cockpit, the Tiger with British
Aerospace participation, and the South African Rooivalk.
The Apache has long been the front-running favourite with the British Army,
but it is probably also the most expensive helicopter, both in purchase
price and through-life costs. The Cobra Venom is cheaper and the new cockpit
is a great improvement on the old Vietnam veteran version, but it is only a
twin-bladed machine, and its weapons load is thus limited.
The Tiger is also smaller than the Apache, and while it is the newest
technology, it is also relatively expensive and will struggle to carry the
full weapons compliment specified by the ministry of defence. The Rooivalk
is almost certainly the cheapest option to buy, though its avionics may need
such radical updating that it is not really a viable option.
Because the order is one of the largest to be placed for attack helicopters
in the next few years, it will have a significant impact on the market. If
the Apache wins, McDonnell Douglas will have longer to develop future
alternatives. If the Tiger wins, Eurocopter will have made the breakthrough
it has been looking for. The Bell Cobra would give GEC-Marconi an excellent
opportunity to extend its range of glass cockpit avionics, and the Rooivalk
would give South Africa a huge boost in international arms markets.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (5): A slow flight back into profit -
The pain for airlines is by no means over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world airline industry expects to fly back into profit this year after
suffering four years of record losses totalling Dollars 15.6bn on
international scheduled services alone.
But the pain is by no means over as the industry continues to adapt itself
to profound structural changes caused by increasing liberalisation and
deregulation and the after shocks of the worst slump in the post-war history
of civil aviation.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is now forecasting an
industry profit of around Dollars 1bn this year. 'We are hopeful we have
turned the corner,' says Tom Murphy, senior director of the trade
organisation grouping 224 airlines.
Even if Dollars 1bn is better than nothing, it is still only a tiny fraction
of the industry's total annual revenues of around Dollars 110bn. What is
more, the financial performance of airlines continues to show dramatic
variations. A few, like British Airways and Singapore Airlines, are doing
well; the majority are hovering around break-even point; and about a quarter
are losing a spectacular amount of money.
Pierre Jeanniot, IATA's director-general, blames three factors for the
continuing financial problems of the airline business:
The world economies were denied a 'soft landing' from the boom of the 1980s
and airlines, which had continued to order aircraft in large numbers right
up to 1990, were caught with too much capacity when the recession hit and
was further exacerbated by the impact of the Gulf war on air travel.
The huge level of aircraft orders was financed essentially by borrowing with
the result that airlines now have to make an operating profit of at least
3.7 per cent of revenues just to service their debt.
The increase in competition in the 1980s combined with increased
liberalisation in air transport policy and continuing over-capacity have had
a devastating impact on real passenger yields.
IATA calculates that air fares have dropped by 68 per cent in constant money
in the past 20 years and this trend has been accelerating. Although
passenger traffic is expected to grow by an average annual rate of between
5-6 per cent during the next four years - with much higher growth in the
Asia-Pacific region of around 8 per cent a year - this is unlikely to lead
to any significant improvement in airline yields as has been the case in
past cycles.
'In many markets, air travellers have now become accustomed to paying a
particular fare level; and if fares are increased, they simply don't fly. So
the airlines now have no choice but to find a way to provide a service at
this fare level, rather than as in the past seeking to maximise the fare
charged for providing the service,' explains Adam Brown, head of strategic
planning at the European Airbus aircraft manufacturing consortium.
Airlines are also facing tougher competition in many markets not only
because of the impact of increasing liberalisation, but also from new rival
forms of transport. In Europe, the development of a high-speed rail network
and the opening of the Channel Tunnel will inevitably intensify competition
on shorter routes where rail can provide a fast and more direct service
between city centres.
Low fares and new competitive forces will force airlines to continue
pursuing cost-cutting and other productivity efforts to restore their profit
margins. Considerable progress has been achieved by a number of airlines but
many still have a long way to go to adapt their structures and operations to
the new competitive, liberalised industry environment.
This is particularly the case for state-owned European carriers which are
now facing far tougher rules from the European Commission on government
financial support. The Commission wants to see the phasing out of all state
aid to airlines over the next three years. It has also warned airlines they
will be allowed one last package of substantial aid as long as it is linked
with a large-scale restructuring and cost reduction programme to restore
their competitive position.
While financially troubled European state carriers like Air France, Olympic
of Greece or Alitalia, are wrestling to restructure themselves (Air France
alone is getting FFr20bn (Dollars 3.7bn) in government backing to help it
recover), large US airlines have also been forced to adapt to new
competition from low-cost carriers in their domestic market. The response of
the leading US airlines has been to seek labour concessions and launch
separate new low-cost subsidiaries to compete against the new breed of
domestic US carriers of which Southwest is undoubtedly the most remarkable
phenomenon.
The move towards more 'open skies' has also intensified the trend towards
greater collaboration in an increasingly global industry. British Airways is
one of the airlines to have taken the lead in developing a global network
through alliances and equity partnerships including taking stakes in USAir,
Qantas, the French regional carrier TAT and its new Deutsche BA airline
subsidiary in Germany.
After the failed attempt last year by four medium-sized European airlines
including Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Austrian Airlines and
Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), these European carriers have continued
to seek commercial partnerships to strengthen their competitive position
against the big carriers.
Many airlines have still been reluctant to take the BA route of investing in
equity stakes in other carriers. Instead, they have sought to expand their
international reach through marketing and commercial partnerships. This has
increasingly involved the use of ticket code sharing which enables two
carriers to use their respective ticketing codes to simplify computer
reservations and cut costs.
With the industry's centre of gravity moving east, international airlines
have also been multiplying efforts to form alliances with carriers in fast
growing markets such as China or India anxious to secure western expertise
to develop internationally. Singapore Airlines, for example, is planning to
form a new joint airline venture in India with the country's biggest
industrial group, TATA industries. In China, Singapore Airlines and BA are
actively discussing possible links with Chinese carriers in a civil aviation
market developing at break-neck speed with annual growth averaging 20-30 per
cent in the past few years.
But the industry's problems are not only financial, although as Mr Jeanniot
of IATA emphasises, 'the overwhelmingly urgent issue' remains airline
profitability. Some progress has been made during the past two years on
improving air traffic and airport congestion, and increasing political
awareness on the long-term risks of inadequate infrastructure to support the
continued growth of international air travel.
Without a stepped up commitment from governments to invest in new ground and
air traffic control facilities and technologies, the danger is that not only
will future air travel growth be clipped but competition will continue to be
distorted by preventing new industry entrants from gaining the necessary
access to busy airports and airplanes.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (6): Better times ahead - A look at the
regional industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DONNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past few years, the European regional aircraft manufacturing
industry has been suffering from a severe shortfall in orders as a result of
the recession which has bitten deeply into airline balance sheets.
That, in turn, has led to curtailed aircraft re-equipment programmes,
resulting in reduced aircraft production rates and labour layoffs as a means
of survival.
But while the market remains difficult, and highly competitive, there are
signs of better times ahead. Airlines this year are expected to return to a
collective profit, albeit a slim one of about Dollars 1bn world-wide, which
by no means compensates for the Dollars 15.6bn losses on international
scheduled services alone over the past four years.
Moreover, the long-term forecasts indicate that as the recession fades,
traffic growth is likely to be resumed at an average of around 5 per cent a
year through the next 10 to 20 years.
This, in turn, is likely to result in a renewed demand for regional aircraft
of all types - jets ranging between about 50 and 120 seats, and
turbo-propeller airliners up to about 70-80 seats.
Avro International, the regional jet airliner manufacturing subsidiary of
British Aerospace, is forecasting a demand world-wide for 3,000 jets in the
65-120 seat range over the next twenty years, to 2013. Smaller jets, such as
the Canadair RJ of around 50-plus seats, will also have a share of the
market.
Such a market could be worth in excess of Dollars 60bn.
This forecast is generally agreed by Boeing of the US, which builds the 737
series of short-range twin-engined jets (with more than 3,000 sold to date
in nearly 30 years of service) and is now planning not only a new series of
737s but also a 'new small airplane', now being defined in detail.
These forecasts are based on the fact that many current trends in the air
transport industry provide opportunities for the growth of the regional
aircraft market.
Underneath the main medium-to-long-range trunk-line routes there is a vast
network of complementary 'commuter and feeder' operations linking hundreds
of smaller towns and cities with each other as well as with the major
''hub'' airports in capital cities. These are mostly short-haul flights,
ranging from about 250-300 miles.
The European Union's 'Third Package' of aviation liberalisation measures,
introduced on January 1, 1993, including freedom of market entry and access
to new routes, is still in its comparative infancy (unlimited 'cabotage' -
the right to operate unfettered services in other countries than one's own -
will not become effective until April 1, 1997), but it is clear that as the
recession fades and traffic grows, the larger airlines operating from the
main hub airports will require increasingly frequent regional services to
feed them.
In turn, short-haul regional routes are increasingly being seen as a
specialist operation. Says Avro: 'There is already a significant move
towards large airlines divesting the regional networks to affiliated
carriers operating small regional jets, such as the RJ Avroliner family,
which can provide more efficient and profitable services on the shorter,
thinner routes.
'At the same time, congestion at the major hubs will stimulate traffic
growth at the smaller airports. Hub by-passing services will increase, and
this again will lead to greater demands for regional jet aircraft.
'Older aircraft types with significantly higher maintenance costs, lower
productivity, and inability to meet increasingly stringent noise regulations
will be phased out of the regional routes, even allowing for some
re-engining and 'hush-kitting'. This will lead to an increasing demand for
new and more efficient types.'
Avro says that the largest market for regional jets will continue to be
North America (42 per cent), followed by Europe (21 per cent), and
Asia/Pacific (15 per cent).
However, the big problem confronting all the regional jet and
turbo-propeller aircraft manufacturers is that the supply of available types
is already vast, and far more than the market can really absorb.
This means that the already intense competition among manufacturers will
become fiercer, with some builders perhaps being forced to quit the market,
which no-one really wants to see - the airlines like to have a wide range of
choice in their equipment purchases.
The alternative is for a rationalisation of the manufacturing side, through
new joint ventures supported by mergers or other forms of strategic
alliances in the industry.
Some have already occurred - for example, the 51 per cent stake in Fokker of
Holland acquired by Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) of Germany - and over the
immediate future there may well be further significant realignments in the
industry's overall global structure.
This past summer, Deutsche Aerospace suggested that British Aerospace,
together with Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy, could be offered
stakes in Fokker, as a step towards forming a European regional jet
manufacturing consortium, particularly targeting new projects for the
future.
Such a move would safeguard the continued development of those existing
companies' product lines - the Avro RJ series and the Fokker 100 and smaller
Fokker 70, and the turbo-propeller ventures of BAe (through Jetstream) and
of Aerospatiale and Alenia through Avions de Transport Regional (ATR). It
would also seek to avoid conflict with Airbus (in which DASA, Aerospatiale
and BAe are all partners), which is itself marketing vigorously its own
130-seat A-319, due to enter service in the spring of 1996.
The prime objective of such a new European consortium, were it ever to
materialise, would probably be a new small 110-seat aircraft, called the
Future Advanced Small Airliner (FASA), which would be designed to compete
directly with Boeing's own New Small Airplane (NSA) project.
Boeing has begun detailed studies on the NSA, in co-operation with Japan
Aero Industry (JAI) and China National Aero-Technology Import and Export
Corporation (CATIC), with a view to an eventual joint venture that could
seize especially a significant slice of the rapidly expanding Asia/Pacific
regional jet aircraft market.
Also on the international front, Aerospatiale has offered to join Chinese
and South Korean companies in developing a 100-seat regional jet for the
Asia/Pacific market. At the same time, although earlier talks between Avro
and Taiwan Aerospace on collaboration failed to get off the ground, both
companies remain interested in the rapidly growing Asia Pacific market.
But because of their already strong background in the regional aircraft
markets, the possibility of a significant consortium of European companies
emerging with global competitive capability should be taken seriously,
especially if widened to include other European aircraft manufacturers, such
as CASA of Spain and SAAB of Sweden.
Linked in such a way, the European industry could prove a powerful
competitor for Boeing. The Europeans already have immense experience -
collectively they meet virtually every regional airline need from small
10-seat twin turbo-prop airliners up to 100-plus-seat twin-jet aircraft.
There is no lack of innovation, and many of the companies involved are
looking ahead with new ideas for either product improvements or entirely new
aircraft models.
The problem in setting up any new consortium would be determining not just
the financial contributions, but also to what extent each partner would be
prepared to sacrifice cherished individual concepts in favour of united
ventures.
Many in the European aerospace industry believe that putting together such a
consortium is the only way ahead, and the abandonment of some concepts,
however painful, is to be preferred to a continuation into the next century
of the fragmented activities which could lead to negligible individual
market shares and the likelihood of profits for no-one.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (4): Quest for ever more power - A look
at the manufacture of aero engines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The development of the most powerful commercial jet engines ever built has
continued to dominate the efforts of the world's leading aero-engine
manufacturers.
The stakes are huge. Between them, the big three aero-engine makers are
spending around Dollars 4bn to develop these new power plants which can
deliver more than 100,000lb of thrust. The Trent being developed by
Rolls-Royce of the UK has already been run at 106,000lb of thrust. General
Electric of the US has tested its new GE90 at an even higher rating of
110,000lb, while the other big US manufacturer, Pratt &amp; Whitney, has also
run its more powerful derivative of the PW4000 at more than 100,000lb of
thrust.
When Rolls-Royce first unveiled the Trent programme at the Farnborough Air
Show back in 1988, Sir Frank Whittle, the father of the jet engine, could
hardly disguise his amazement at the extraordinary progress made in engine
technology since the development of his first engine with only 480lb of
thrust.
'The most powerful engine I designed had a thrust of 2500lb. I would have
said something like 10,000lb was as far as we were likely to go. If we
wanted more power for a particular aeroplane, we'd just have had more
engines than, say, two of these enormous, powerful jobs,' he said.
Throughout the history of the commercial aerospace industry, aircraft have
been getting bigger and heavier, and as Russ Sparks, the GE90 programme
manager notes 'the heavier versions of aircraft have traditionally sold
best'.
This trend is showing no sign of abating. Aero-engine makers now expect that
by far the largest portion of all civil aerospace business in the future -
around 50 per cent by value - will be in the large, widebody aircraft sector
requiring a new generation of heavy thrust engines.
At present there is only limited market application for the new big power
plants under development with the new Boeing 777 wide-body twin-engine
airliner, which made its flight debut in June with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines,
the prime contender. At the same time, there is no demand at this stage for
engines with thrusts of more than 100,000lb since Boeing requires thrust
ratings of 76,000lb and 84,000lb for the first two versions of its 312 to
400-seat 777s.
But the engine makers are already anticipating demand for heavier versions
of the aircraft as well as development of other new large airliners. All big
three manufacturers are thus anxious to show airline customers that their
new large commercial engine programmes can meet potential demand for bigger
and heavier derivatives of the 777 as well as super jumbo 600 to 800-seat
airliners under study.
However, the timing of these ambitious and costly programmes could not have
come at a more difficult moment. The battle to power the 'big twins', as it
has become popularly known, has coincided with the worst recession in the
highly cyclical commercial aerospace industry coupled with the decline in
military business following the reduction of government defence budgets in
the wake of the end of the cold war.
The industry has been caught in the classic pincers with research and
development costs running very high at a time when cash flow has been
inhibited by poor trading conditions, which have hit not only new engine
sales but activity in spares, a traditional large source of profit for
engine makers. Moreover, the decline in defence spending, which for the
first time has come simultaneously with the downturn in the civil side, has
had severe implications on the government funded part of company research
and development budgets.
This has forced aero-engine companies to pursue sweeping restructures
including heavy job cuts and plant closures. Rolls-Royce, for example,
closed three plants last year and is closing three more this year to match
the cost-cutting of its US rivals. The UK company has also sought to expand
its activities in the industrial power business to reduce its reliance on
aero-engines. However, unlike its US competitors, which are part of big
diversified industrial groups, the UK company still remains heavily
dependent on aerospace.
The competitive pressures and heavy costs of developing new engines have
also stepped up the pace of consolidation and collaboration in the industry.
All the three big aero-engine makers have forged partnerships with other
international companies in the heavy thrust engine market.
Risk and revenue sharing partners from Japan, Germany, France, Spain, South
Africa as well as the UK have taken almost 20 per cent of Rolls-Royce's
Trent programme. The GE90 has reinforced the collaboration between the US
manufacturer and Snecma, the French state-controlled aero-engine group.
Through their CFM International partnership, GE and Snecma have formed what
many regard as a model of international collaboration which has enabled them
to take a leading position in supplying engines for narrowbody airliners
such as the Airbus A320 as well as for the new long-range four-engine A340.
Pratt &amp; Whitney for its part has entered into a strategic partnership with
MTU, the aero-engine subsidiary of Deutsche Aerospace, and is the principal
partner with Rolls-Royce in the International Aero Engine consortium which
develops the V2500 engines in competition against the GE-Snecma CFM
International partnership.
Collaboration is intensifying at every level of the market and not just at
the top end. This has seen the successful launch of the joint aero-engine
venture between Rolls-Royce and BMW, the German car group, which is
developing the BR700 series of engines to power new long-range business jets
as well as future regional jet aircraft. Deutsche Aerospace has now also
renewed approaches to its German rival to suggest co-operation.
The industry now believes it has probably seen the worst of the current
prolonged recessionary cycle with a recovery in orders starting to pick up
around 1996.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (2): Preparing for tomorrow today - The
worst may be over for the beleaguered commercial aircraft industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some signs have finally emerged that the worst is possibly over for the
beleaguered commercial aircraft industry.
Singapore Airlines this summer placed one of the world's biggest aircraft
orders for 52 US Boeing and European Airbus widebody airliners worth Dollars
10.3bn. Dr Cheong Choong Kong, the airline's managing director, described it
as 'an expression of faith in the long-term health of the aviation
industry'. A few months earlier, Saudi Arabia also announced a jumbo order
for about Dollars 6bn worth of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas airliners.
Although these large deals, once commonplace in the late 1980s before the
industry was plunged into its worst recession during the last four years,
are still the exception rather than the rule, all three main commercial
aircraft manufacturers - Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas - are
beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
'Last year we all sufferred big order cancellations and deferrals from
airlines. At least this year cancellations and deferrals have petered out,'
says Jean Pierson, the Airbus chief executive.
'The airline industry has had a hell of a time but I expect the airline
market to bottom out,' says John McDonnell, chairman of McDonnell Douglas,
the most vulnerable of the three big manufacturers to the industry's
difficulties. 'I do see signs that we are coming out of the depression. I've
been through three cycles. People have speculated that we would go out of
the commercial aircraft business. It hasn't happened yet and it won't happen
in this cycle,' he adds.
And Boeing, the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial jets, is still
forecasting demand for new airliners worth Dollars 980bn in the next 20
years to meet the growth in air travel and the need to replace older jets.
In its latest civil aircraft market outlook, Boeing says that Dollars 731bn
worth of new aircraft will be need to accommodate future air traffic growth
and Dollars 249bn to replace older aircraft.
But the four-year long recession has left deep scars and forced aircraft
manufacturers to adapt rapidly to a fundamental structural change in the
market. Air traffic, a traditional barometer of economic activity, is now
recovering but the passenger yields of airlines continue to remain under
pressure because of low fares. Many airlines as a result continue to be
burdened by financial losses and debts significantly reducing their ability
to acquire new aircraft.
'It is becoming more and more evident that revenue, rather than traffic, is
becoming the key to airline profitability,' says Adam Brown, head of
strategic planning at Airbus. Like other industry experts, Mr Brown believes
low fares are here to stay and airlines will have to rely increasingly for
their profits on cost reductions and operational efficiencies. In turn, they
will seek to fill their fleets with aircraft with both lower operating and
acquisition costs.
These financial pressures coupled with the industry's increasing
concentration has led to a further intensification of competition in the
commercial aircraft market. As Boeing puts it: 'There are only 600 airlines
in the world. Only 125 of these buy new airplanes. And the 20 largest
airlines buy 60 per cent of all new commercial airplanes. In such a
concentrated market, you can't afford to miss a single strategic sale.'
To respond to these new challenges, aircraft manufacturing has been forced
to evolve from a business driven purely by product, research and development
to one where the manufacturing process will make the difference between one
airframe builder and its rivals. 'It is no longer so much what you build but
how you build that will give you the edge over the competition,' explains a
senior Airbus executive.
'We are all having to adapt to this new competitive environment,' says
Claude Terrazzoni, head of the commercial aircraft division of Aerospatiale,
the French partner in the Airbus consortium. 'Boeing is now cutting its
production costs by 25 per cent: either they want to kill us because they
think Airbus can't match such cuts, or they are adapting to the structural
change in the airline industry with low fares; or they are trying to do
both,' he adds.
At the roll-out this spring of its latest airliner - the 400-seat 777
twin-engine widebody - Ron Woodard, the head of the US company's commercial
aircraft operations, said Boeing was committed to drive down costs and the
time to build an aircraft 'to make sure we remain the world's most
competitive manufacturer of commercial jets'.
Boeing has already reduced the order-to-delivery time of its widebody
aircraft such as the 747 and the 767 from as high as 18 months a few years
ago to around 10.5 months and wants to bring it down even further to eight
months. It eventually hopes to achieve the same target for the 777, the
latest member of its aircraft family.
Boeing has already reduced the production cycle time for its narrowbody
aircraft, including the 737 and the 757, to nine months and is planning to
bring it down to six months by 1996.
The way Boeing has developed the 777 is another example of how manufacturers
have adapted their operations to the changes that have taken place in the
civil aircraft business. Boeing describes the 777 as a 'market-driven'
airliner. In the past, the manufacturer felt it knew what was best for its
airline customers. But with the 777, Boeing has encouraged airlines,
suppliers and sub-contractors to participate actively in the design and
planning of the new airliner.
'Not that we did not listen to our customers in the past, but the biggest
lesson we learnt was that we often listened to them late in the programme,'
explains a senior Boeing executive. At all cost, Boeing wanted to avoid the
mistakes made five years ago on the development of the 747-400, the newest
version of its 747 jumbo. After failing to listen properly to its customers,
Boeing was forced to delay delivery for several months to initial customers
because of teething problems and design changes demanded by airlines. This
time, Boeing wanted to make sure it had what it calls a 'service ready'
airliner from the first 777 delivery.
The change in Boeing's manufacturing approach reflects two important
evolutions in the market. The first was the need to adapt to the new
circumstances facing airlines hit by the prolonged slump in civil aviation.
The second, and perhaps even more important factor, was the emergence of
Airbus as Boeing's principal long-term challenger.
The European consortium, which has steadily built market share during the
past 20 years by launching advanced new aircraft programmes and developing a
broad family of airliners, has been making serious inroads into some of
Boeing's traditional customers including in its domestic US market.
With nearly 30 per cent of the world market, Airbus has now overtaken
McDonnell Douglas in the industry's number two slot behind Boeing. The US
company's Douglas commercial aircraft division has been given a big boost by
Saudi Arabia's decision to award a large slice of its new Dollars 6bn order
to the Long Beach, California, group. But Douglas continues to be
handicapped by its limited product range focused on two niche markets with
its MD11 three-engine widebody airliner and its MD-80, MD-90 and the planned
MD-95 narrowbody twin-engine airliners all derived from the original DC-9.
Douglas has not abandoned the idea of forging an international alliance with
foreign partners acquiring up to 49 per cent of the Long Beach concern. A
similar scheme with Taiwan collapsed two years ago. But in the absence of
establishing a strong international alliance, many in the industry expect
Douglas to find it increasingly hard to compete with just two product lines.
'This is simply not a niche business. You need a broad family of aircraft to
compete,' explains one of Douglas's main rivals.
In contrast, Airbus has embraced the 'family concept' with its A320, A319
and A321 narrowbody airliners, its A300 and A310 widebodies, and its latest
widebodies including the A330 twin-engine airliner and its sister aircraft,
the four-engine very long range A340.
From the beginning, Airbus has sought to leap-frog Boeing with its products
by introducing new technological concepts to commercial jets including
fly-by-wire electronic controls. And with the A330 and A340 and plans to
develop the A3XX, a 500 to 600-seater jumbo, Airbus has also increasingly
challenged Boeing's dominance of the large aircraft market.
The reaction at Boeing has been violent. As Mr Woodard put it in Boeing's
staff magazine: 'We decided to prepare for the future today, while we're
number one because number two is unthinkable.' Boeing's cost-cutting drive
has involved 28,000 job reductions in 1993 and 1994. The US company has
stepped up the widespread application of new computer and automated
manufacturing techniques. It has introduced new organisational structures to
improve internal working relations and practices.
All this has now put pressure on Airbus to accelerate its own internal
change to respond to the new competitive challenge from Boeing. Simply put,
the commercial success of Airbus, whose sales topped Dollars 8bn last year
and are expected to reach the same level this year, is in danger of being
undermined by the group's own complex corporate structure and complex
work-sharing production system based in its four partner countries - France,
Germany, the UK and Spain.
But all four Airbus partners now recognise that the challenge for Airbus is
to transform what was initially conceived as a job and wealth creation
consortium to compete against the dominance of the US manufacturers into an
independent company, mature enough to rationalise and restructure, take hard
political and social decisions, and stand on its own two corporate feet.
Airbus says it is confident it can meet Boeing's challenge. It, too, has cut
back on excessive staff with its four partners all launching extensive
restructuring. It is attempting to maximise the big investments made during
the past 20 years in automation and computer-aided manufacturing. It has
also sought to simplify and streamline the consortium's complicated
four-nation manufacturing and assembly processes.
Mr Pierson, the Airbus chief executive, has set production targets for
Airbus airliners similar to those set by its rival Boeing. 'For narrowbody
aircraft we are also aiming at an order-to-delivery target of six months in
1996. Today it is 12 months, next year it will go down to nine,' he says.
For widebody aircraft like the A300, A310, A330 and A340, Airbus has already
reduced production cycle times from 15 months to 12.5 months and plans to go
down to nine months by 1996.
But the task remains a daunting one for Airbus. The European consortium has
started transforming itself, but the process is a slow and politically
difficult one. Unless it steps up the tempo, it will find it hard to keep up
with the pace being set by Boeing. As Philip Condit, Boeing's president, has
put it: 'The race will go to whoever is fastest.'

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (3): Cold comfort after cold war -
Defence contractors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norman Augustine, the chairman and chief executive of Martin Marietta, has
been negotiating some tough deals with the Pentagon recently. When the
company agreed to acquire General Dynamics' Space Systems division in May,
the Department of Defence agreed to pay for some of the rationalisation
costs, and to allow Martin Marietta to keep half of the resulting savings.
Such deals are likely to become more common if the Pentagon has its way, but
it does not herald a sudden outbreak of altruism in Washington. The
Department of Defence thinks that if the defence industry consolidates into
fewer larger manufacturers it will save money. In the case of General
Dynamics Space business, for example, paying Dollars 80m in restructuring
charges may save Dollars 500m on the cost of launch vehicles over the next
10 years.
If incentives from the Department of Defence are the carrots to encourage
industry mergers and rationalisation, there are plenty of sticks, too. As US
defence spending has been cut in the wake of the Reagan arms build-up and
the end of the cold war, weapons procurement has been by far the worst hit
section of the budget. Total defence expenditure is down by a third in real
terms in the past decade, but weapons procurement has fallen by two-thirds.
Since that is what puts bread into the mouth of defence companies, some
people have gone hungry.
The industry has had to respond rapidly to this rising pressure. Since 1990,
employment in the US defence industry has fallen from 1.3m to 800,000. There
has also been a string of deals with companies trading businesses. Yet, so
far there has been no rout, and nor has the game of musical chairs turned
nasty, despite the steadily reducing number of seats.
The first to pull out were the predominantly non-defence companies who
decided to leave the field to professional soldiers. So IBM, Ford and
General Electric have sold their defence interests to the likes of Loral and
Martin Marietta. The other big seller has been Bill Anders, the astronaut
who was chairman of General Dynamics between 1991 and 1993. He sold his F-16
fighter plant to aerospace company Lockheed, his missile business to missile
specialists Hughes Aircraft, his space launch business to Martin Marietta,
and his non-military aircraft business to Textron.
Other deals will follow and Dan Tellup, chairman of Lockheed, thinks that
the US may end up with two combat aircraft manufacturers, two electronics
giants and two missile companies. It is already down to one tank
manufacturer, one submarine yard and one surface warship maker. Some systems
are too expensive for even the US to afford. Strategic bombers may have come
to the end of the line with the Dollars 850m-a-time B2, unless cheaper
production methods are found.
Yet the larger companies, such as Lockheed, Martin Marietta, Raytheon and
McDonnell Douglas, have sufficient backlogs of orders to be relaxed in the
short term. 'We have to be opportunistic' says Dan Tellup, 'because it is
never completely clear where the opportunities will arise.' These companies
have also become strongly cash generative as a result of the job cuts, and
perhaps their biggest immediate fear is that their rising stock market
values may attract cash-hungry predators.
Smaller firms with weaker finances cannot be so relaxed, however. Those
whose programmes are drawing to a close, such as Northrop and Grumman, may
be forced into merger to spread the pain of remaining in the game. Others
will be forced out altogether.
Many US chief executives see the consolidation as a much-overdue
rationalisation which only mimics the cuts in Europe over the past 25 years.
This is a little ironic, since although many of the cottage industry
manufacturers within Europe have been pushed together into larger national
groups, they all have national markets which are in order of magnitude
smaller than the US home base. When looked at from a European perspective,
the European Union still has a smaller total defence market than the US and
it is much more fragmented. Europe is nowhere near achieving the economies
of scale which the US takes for granted.
What is perhaps worse from the European point of view, is that the situation
is unlikely to change rapidly. Some cross-border deals in less sensitive
technologies are being done; for example, a merger between Giat of France
and Royal Ordnance of the UK is being negotiated. Yet even here national
sensitivities are such that the UK is only prepared to be dependent on
French munitions to the extent that France is equally dependent on the UK.
Such cross-border rationalisation of the missiles business, with Matra and
BAe teaming up and Aerospatiale and DASA getting together, are also under
discussion. Still, progress is painfully slow.
The other great European experiment is in collaborative ventures, such as
the Eurofighter. These seek to spread the cost of developing the most
sophisticated systems across several countries with a sufficiently long
production run to make them viable. Even here, the difficulty of
co-ordinating several partners, the delays which politics can cause, the
compromises and disagreements about specification and the spreading of work
among the partners can mean that no-one gets the weapon they want and no-one
saves any money. One national auditor of such projects doubted that any
previous collaboration had actually proved cost-effective.
European governments may be prepared to tolerate the problem, since from
national perspectives, the alternative of common European defence policy and
procurement may be worse. Yet such inefficiency means either Europe pays
more for the same level of defence than the US would, or it settles for less
sophisticated equipment, or possibly both.
With the crunch to get value for money in defence spending growing, however,
there will be increasing pressure to buy off-the-shelf US products rather
than a tailor-made European solution. That problem is seen graphically in
the present UK debate over the replacement of the RAF Hercules fleet, where
a new European design is up against a proven US product. Even if the Future
Large Aircraft were shown to have lower life-cycle costs than Lockheed's new
C130J Hercules, the FLA group would have an uphill task persuading the UK to
fund its share of development costs.
There is also a crunch in export markets. Cost is only one of the issues for
purchasing governments. Traditionally, the effectiveness of weapons systems
and political ties between governments have been more important. But the
culture of value for money is spreading to hard-pressed governments. Unless
the European arms industry starts cross-border consolidation, it may face a
choice between subsidising its arms exports and leaving the field to the US.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (1): Manufacturers prepare for take-off
 -Collaboration, partnerships and joint ventures have all become the rule in
the civil sector
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The mood two years ago at the Farnborough Air Show was one of profound
gloom. The aerospace industry was in the midst of its worst post-war
cyclical downturn hit by the combined and prolonged effects of the slump in
civil aviation and cuts in defence spending following the end of the cold
war.
Senior officials of leading aerospace companies were trying to put on a
brave face inside their corporate chalets at the show. 'I'll offer a case of
the best champagne to the first person who walks in with a real order,' said
one executive of a large European aircraft manufacturing company.
Next week, as the world aerospace industry gathers again en masse at
Farnborough, the atmosphere is likely to be much improved. Not that the
industry is finally out of the woods, but at last it is seeing some light on
the other side of the dark valley.
During the past six months, there have been tangible signs of recovery in
the airline industry. After four years of record losses, world airlines
expect to return to profit this year as passenger and cargo traffic
continues to pick up strongly. In the first half of the year, the 224
airline members of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) saw
their overall traffic grow by 9.3 per cent compared with 7.2 per cent for
the whole of last year.
Although this improvement has yet to translate into a new sustained wave of
orders for aircraft manufacturers from more financially stable airline
customers, the market has begun to stir. 'Deferrals and cancellations of
orders are now slowing down,' said a senior official of the European Airbus
consortium. 'Last year they were the rule: today they are becoming the
exception.'
Singapore Airlines, one of the most profitable carriers, sent a strong
signal to the market in June when it placed one of the biggest new aircraft
orders on record for 52 widebody airliners worth Dollars 10.3bn. The airline
said the deal reflected its confidence in the long-term health of the
aviation industry.
This was in sharp contrast to what its chairman wrote in June 1993 in his
annual statement when he noted that 'aviation analysts surveying the carnage
in the industry are sunk in despair'. In his annual statement this year, he
wrote:'Analysts may be inclined to infer that the downward slide in the
industry remains intact: their melancholy may be misplaced.'
This cautious revival of optimism has also followed two years of a
continuing shake-up in the civil and defence sides of the business. Defence
contractors have had to adapt to what appears to be a lasting reduction in
government military budgets forcing them to accelerate the trend towards
greater consolidation and rationalisation in the industry.
The US has taken the lead with a significant wave of disposals of their
defence activities by some large industrial conglomerates to other groups
that have decided to increase their presence in a shrinking market. European
competitors have been slower to adapt.
But, in the past two years, there has been a growing trend of transnational
mergers and consolidations in Europe. These include negotiations between
British Aerospace and Matra of France to merge their missiles activities;
the planned acquisition by a joint venture between Matra and the UK General
Electric Company of BAe's space systems division; advanced negotiations
between Aerospatiale of France and Deutsche Aerospace to combine their
missiles and space operations in joint companies, similar to the merger of
their helicopter activities into Eurocopter.
Collaboration, partnerships and joint ventures have all become the rule of
the game in the civil sector reflecting the global nature of the aerospace
market as well as the rising costs of developing new products and
technologies and the increasingly long investment pay-back lead times. All
aerospace manufacturers from airframe producers to aero engine makers and
components suppliers now agree that co-operation is the only way forward.
The regional jet and commuter turbopropeller market seems set for
significant consolidation in the coming year as manufacturers desperately
seek to rationalise a sector where too many products are chasing too few
orders. After failing in its efforts to merge its loss-making regional jet
activities with Taiwan Aerospace, BAe is now in talks with the Dutch
manufacturer Fokker which was taken over last year by Deutsche Aerospace. It
is also in discussions with Aerospatiale to create a joint venture in the
turboprop sector.
But even in the bigger end of the airliner market, the three leading
manufacturers - Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the US and the European
Airbus consortium - are seeking risk-sharing partners to collaborate on the
development of new programmes. Boeing and Airbus have also been discussing
during the past two years joint collaboration on a future very large
aircraft with 600-800 seats.
However, these talks have been marred by suspicion with each side worried
that the other is seeking to establish a lead in the future development of a
super jumbo airliner. As a result, both Boeing and Airbus have continued to
pursue separate studies to develop on their own a very large transport which
they believe the market will need by the beginning of the next century.
Continuing trade frictions on government direct and indirect supports for
civil aircraft programmes have not helped collaboration efforts between
Boeing and the Airbus partner companies. Although the trade dispute has
abated following the 1992 agreement between the US and the European Union on
aircraft subsidies, both sides are still anxious to secure new commitments
on this controversial issue. The US wants even tougher restrictions on
direct subsidies to Airbus, while Europe is insisting on stricter controls
on indirect government support from Washington to its aerospace industry.
All three leading aircraft manufacturers are continuing to forecast strong
demand for new aircraft over the next 20 years. Boeing, the world's biggest
manufacturer, expects Dollars 980bn worth of new airliners to be sold in
this period to meet the growth in air travel and the need to replace older
jets.
For the manufacturers, the biggest prize in the short to medium term remains
the Asia-Pacific market which has continued to grow much faster than other
regions with strong demand not only for civil aircraft but also for military
equipment. The Chinese civil aviation market in particular has been growing
at breakneck speed. In contrast, the industry's earlier hopes of seeing the
former Soviet Union emerge as a significant new market opportunity for
western manufacturers have so far failed to materialise.
But the airline industry in general is in no hurry right now to start
ordering new aircraft with the same frenzy as it did in the late 1980s.
Airlines are still struggling to restore their balance sheets, badly dented
by several consecutive years of losses and fare wars that have undermined
their passenger fare yields. In the face of what are likely to be lasting
pressures on yields, airlines have sought to improve their financial
performance by extensive cost-cutting to improve overall productivity.
One of the most interesting recent trends in the airline industry's
cost-cutting drive has been the growth in employee ownership in airlines.
The US has taken the lead and already employees own 26 per cent of Northwest
Airlines, 45 per cent of Trans World Airlines and 55 per cent of United
Airlines. Negotiations are taking place between management and employees at
USAir over restructuring proposals also involving an exchange of equity to
employees for labour concessions. This trend now seems set to spread to
other countries. Already British Airways pilots are interested in increasing
their stake in their airline.
Because airlines are preoccupied with holding down costs, manufacturers have
had to shift their traditional emphasis from pure product research and
development to improving their manufacturing processes. This will enable
them to produce airliners more cost efficiently thus ensuring a return on
investment from airline customers purchasing aircraft with lower operating
and acquisition costs. 'The issue today is not so much what you build but
how you build it,' explained an Airbus executive.

FT  02 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAT wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yield considerations and a surge of optimism over US tobacco sales gave an
early boost to BAT Industries, the international tobacco and insurance
conglomerate.
Initially, buyers responded to a move from US rival Philip Morris which
increased its quarterly dividend by more than expected and announced a share
buy back. The raised dividend follows recent reports of increased cigarette
sales in the US and adds weight to expectations that BAT will report
improved figures for tobacco sales in November.
Several UK securities reiterated their positive stance on the stock at their
morning meetings. SG Warburg, among them, also pointed out that the yield on
the Eagle Star parent had risen to 6.2 per cent against 5.8 per cent for
rival composites. The house believes they should trade at parity and says
the imbalance implies a potential 5 per cent upside in BAT's share price.
BAT were up 8 at best and held out against the broader market's sharp fall
in late trading to close a penny higher at 443p with 5.6m traded. Rothmans
also benefited from the improved tobacco sentiment to close 4 higher at
394p.
Optimism over cyclical recovery potential next year for Hanson, the
internationally traded conglomerate, was offset by some heavy selling in the
US.
A number of brokers have factored in earnings per share growth of around 20
per cent for next year. The stock has held up against the market since going
ex-dividend on Tuesday and yesterday the shares resisted the early fall in
the market to rise 2p. However, Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank,
dealt 1.2m American Depositary Receipts - equivalent to 6m shares - at the
dollar equivalent of 256p and the shares came off the top to close
marginally easier at 255p.
Household products group Reckitt &amp; Colman slid 25 to 627p as the company
announced that first-half profits had fallen to Pounds 123.3m from Pounds
143.6m previously. The company took an exceptional charge of Pounds 56m to
cover reorganisation costs in Europe and gave a disappointing trading
statement.
A two-way programme trade featuring a few sizeable individual deals affected
Reuters and Zeneca. The former slipped a penny to 510p as 600,000 shares
were taken out of the market while Zeneca fell 11 to 828p as the shares felt
the pressure of an additional 700,000 in the market.
Hoare Govett was behind the surge in activity in TSB, with the broker
recommending the shares to its clients on the basis that the bank's profit
margins are being maintained and that the bank retains its high dividend
paying capacity. Hoare's banks team increased its profits forecasts for the
bank, lifting its current year expectation from Pounds 480m to Pounds 500m
and that for next year from Pounds 590m to Pounds 610m.
The broker also highlighted the 11 per cent underperformance of TSB shares
this year. TSB stock closed 2 firmer at 224p, after 226p, with turnover
reaching 9.3m shares, the highest single day's turnover since January this
year.
Abbey National jumped 8 1/2 more to 414 1/2 p as the market absorbed news
that the company had increased rates on its fixed rate mortgages and that
the shares had broken out of their recent range.
The recent institutional buyer of Royal Bank of Scotland reappeared
yesterday, via Credit Lyonnais Laing, and drove RBOS shares up 4 1/2 more to
430 1/2 p.
Strong US buying was again noted in food and drinks group Cadbury-Schweppes.
The shares closed a penny ahead at 491p, on volume of 2.4m.

FT  02 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: SWEB active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The electricity sector fell sharply under the weight of a flurry of
profit-taking but there were suggestions late in the day that one company,
South Western Electricity (SWEB), had instructed its broker, BZW, to move
into the market to buy in stock. Turnover of 2.2m in SWEB was the third
highest on record and indicated that it could have bought just short of 1
per cent of its own shares. SWEB closed only a penny off at 822p.
The rest of the Recs were hit by profit-taking. Some dealers felt, however,
that the steep declines yesterday could have been an attempt by marketmakers
at the big integrated securities houses to flush out stock ahead of
attempted share buy backs.
Buy backs have been on the agenda for many months and analysts expect many
of the companies to to buy in their own stock before the companies enter
their closed seasons starting from the middle of the month. It was pointed
out that Northern has only six trading days to buy in stock, while Midland
has seven and Seeboard, which moved last week to buy its own shares, has
nine days.
Yorkshire Electricity held up well as the market responded to talk that the
shares had responded to the expiry of an OTC, or specially constructed
option in the stock. At the close, Yorkshire were only 4 off at 790p. The
biggest fallers in the sector included East Midlands, 18 off at 764p,
Eastern 29 lower at 813p and Midlands which fell 24 to 814p.
South West Water edged up 3 to 578p after stories that the company will not
seek a reference to the MMC.

FT  02 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Broker caution hits Rolls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO

<TEXT>
Aero-engines group Rolls-Royce came under pressure in heavy trading of 15m
shares as broker's trimmed 1995 forecasts after the group reported interim
figures at the bottom end of expectations.
The shares fell 10 in early trading after the company revealed profits of
Pounds 40m, against a market range of Pounds 40m to Pounds 50m. However,
with analysts on the sector away at other results meetings, bargain hunters
quickly moved into the stock leaving it to trade in positive territory for a
short period mid-session.
The shares eventually closed 8 down at 180p, as analysts digested what many
considered a downbeat presentation from the company chairman. Researchers
were particularly concerned by comments from the company that engine
deliveries for 1995 were at this stage likely to be lower than expected.
Many analysts stuck to their 1994 forecasts of around Pounds 100m but
reduced the following year's figure to reflect the company's comments.
NatWest Securities reduced its figure by Pounds 9m to Pounds 136m, while
Credit Lyonnais downgraded its forecast by Pounds 15m to Pounds 135m.
The shares have outperformed the market for most of the year and general
profit-taking, along with sell recommendations from several brokers earlier
this weak, contributed to the malaise.

FT  02 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wide-ranging setback follows US price
data - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Discomforting economic developments in Europe and the US upset the London
stock market yesterday afternoon, prompting a sharp fall cross the range of
equities. A large sell programme was reported and the market closed in a
negative mood ahead of publication today of the latest US unemployment and
payroll statistics.
The FT-SE 100 Share Index closed 34.8 points off at 3,216.5. Although this
was a shade above the day's low, traders believed that the 3,200 mark could
be challenged today, especially if Wall Street, which was 15 Dow points off
as London went home last night, reacts badly to today's US payroll data.
Markets were upset by the announcement that the pricing index of the US
National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM) had risen sharply in
August to its highest level for six years. This latest hint of inflationary
pressures from the US unsettled European markets already troubled by the
Bundesbank's decision to leave key rates unchanged after a sharp rise in
German industrial production raised concern that the downward trend in
European interest rates might now be over. Analysts are now nervous of a
return of 'stagflation,' when prices continue to rise while the economic
pace slows down.
However, traders were not convinced that yesterday's shakeout in London
represented significant selling pressure from the institutions. The FT-SE
Mid 250 Index, taking in a range of non-Footsie stocks, also fell, closing
22.3 down at 3,794.3.
The big selling programme, not finally disclosed until the market close,
appeared to involve a wide range of front line stocks. But non-Footsie
business made up around 62 per cent of the day's total of 677.2m shares
traded through the Seaq net and several second-line stocks featured in the
lists of active market stocks. Wednesday's session recorded retail business
worth Pounds 1.53bn, well up to the best averages of the past twelve months.
Equity strategists said that confidence remains relatively high in the UK
stock market, and that this week's downward drift represents little more
than a pause in a market now thoroughly underpinned by economic recovery and
by strongly improving corporate profits and dividends.
They believe that these trends will enable UK equities to resist the growing
concern that interest rates may be forced higher sooner rather than later;
some believe that the UK authorities may elect for a pre-emptive strike on
base rates, following the lead shown by the US Federal Reserve.
For the near term, however, company results have provided a less positive
guide. The interim statement from Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine group, failed
to please the market yesterday, as did the statement from Ladbroke, the
leisure and casinos group.
The market was hard hit by the weakness in Wall Street influenced stocks
which followed the opening setback in the Dow. Once again, traders were
happy to take profits in the big name stocks which led the market in the
strong upturn seen towards the end of last week.
With the latest bout of bid excitement, prompted by SmithKline's purchase of
Sterling Health, receding somewhat, there were sharp falls in the drug
leaders. Defence stocks, also alerted this week by the Dollars 10bn merger
of Lockheed Group and Martin Marietta, had a quieter session yesterday.
Oil stocks, also, began to slide away towards the close and BAT Industries
finally provided almost a lone firm spot among the blue chip internationals.
Losses among the consumer and retail issues were fairly modest, although
Kingfisher again gave ground as investors pondered the implications of the
rise in French bank rates for Darty, the group's French subsidiary.

FT  02 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern over inflation continued to dominate the derivatives sector leading
to a sharp decline in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 3,262, early buying attributed to SG Warburg pushed the
September contract on the FT-SE 100 to a high of 3,265 within the first hour
of trading.
But with little follow-through buying, the contract drifted lower on
continued worries on inflation. The decision by the Bundesbank to leave
interest rates unchanged also caused some concern.
In the afternoon it was the US purchasing managers' figures that once again
raised fears on inflation bringing a further retreat in the September
contract which fell to the day's low of 3,244, to test the 3,240 support
level.
Bargain-hunting in the last hour brought some recovery in the September
contract. It closed at 3,221, down 42 on its previous close, and at parity
with its fair value premium to cash of about 5 points. Volume was 15,056
lots.
Rolls-Royce, which reported interim figures at the bottom of expectations
was the outstanding feature in the traded options sector as it traded 5,420
contracts. It was followed by Vodafone Group, among the stock options.
Total volume in the sector was 34,233 lots with the FT-SE 100 option trading
15,014 lots and 4,375 in the Euro FT-SE option.

FT  02 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Earnings fears hit technology
stocks hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices retreated yesterday as the outlook for computer stocks
became clouded, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 11.98 lower at 3,901.44, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 2.33 at 473.17. The setback was
broadly-based, with Big Board declines leading advances by a three-to-two
margin. NYSE volume was moderate, with 282m shares traded by the close.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was off 0.32 at 454.02.
The Nasdaq composite, with its heavy concentration of technology stocks,
suffered more, dropping 6.67 to 758.95.
The day's economic news had a marginal impact on share prices. The National
Association of Purchasing Management revealed that the prices-paid component
of its August survey had risen to its highest level in six years.
With investors on edge ahead of today's employment data, the NAPM data was
more than enough to encourage some profit-taking in cyclical stocks which
led the market's recent rally. Alcoa gave back Dollars 1 to Dollars 83,
Caterpillar Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 114 3/8 and Union Carbide Dollars 1 to
Dollars 33 3/8 .
But the most important cause of yesterday's weakness was a sudden loss of
confidence in the health of the computer industry. The broad sell-off
appeared to have been triggered by AST Research which, a day earlier, had
warned that it would post a loss this quarter. The Nasdaq-listed stock
plunged Dollars 4 15/16 to Dollars 13 as the news prompted at least two Wall
Street securities houses to downgrade the issue.
But the impact of the announcement was felt by a wide range of technology
stocks. Among software developers, Microsoft lost Dollars 2 to Dollars 56
1/8 and Intel Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 64 1/4 . Among the chip suppliers,
Motorola dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 52 5/8 and National Semiconductor
Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 17 1/4 and Advanced Micro Devices Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 27 1/2 .
The big computer manufacturers were not spared, either. Compaq was marked
down Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 34 7/8 with reports that it was trimming
orders from suppliers adding fuel to the fire. Apple dropped Dollars  15/16
to Dollars 35 1/4 and IBM slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 67 7/8 .
Some retailing stocks also came under pressure. The Gap plunged Dollars 4
3/4 to Dollars 38 1/4 after revealing that revenues from stores opened at
least a year had fallen by 5 per cent last month. Dayton Hudson lost Dollars
3 5/8 to Dollars 81 1/8 . Elsewhere, Fingerhut made a rare appearance on the
NYSE's most active list in volume of 3.9m shares. The stock plunged 18 per
cent, or Dollars 5 3/8 to Dollars 23 1/4 on a profits warning.
Canada
Toronto prices closed mixed in busy trading, as a modest afternoon rally
helped offset earlier losses.
The TSE-300 composite index fell 5.16 points, or 0.12 per cent, to close at
4,344.34, but advancing issues outnumbered declines 379 to 323. Volume was
76.40m compared with 66.30m on Wednesday, but trading value fell to CDollars
862.3m from CDollars 895.5m.
Volume was inflated by some large blocks of PWA Corp. shares and warrants.

FT  02 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil rises 2 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sao Paulo closed up 2.02 per cent in moderate trade boosted by a speculative
late rally in oil and mining shares.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares ended up 1,074 at 54,369
points. Volume was RDollars 366m (Dollars 414m).
Brokers said major players bought heavily in the cash market in the
afternoon to carry out speculative day-trade operations in the Bovespa
futures index market.
Prices were also bolstered by two new opinion polls showing Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, the former economy minister, has improved his chances of
winning the presidential election outright in the first round of voting on
October 3.
Mexico
Equities closed down for the sixth successive session on the back of
widespread profit-taking with the market even falling below a key support
level.
The key IPC index closed off 9.12 points at 2,693.61 - a loss of 0.34 per
cent. At the end of 1993, the IPC stood at 2,602.63.
Volume totalled 801.9m new pesos, on 58.1m shares traded. The market has
lost 3.75 per cent in the last six sessions from a post-election high of
2,798 points on August 24.

FT  02 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: European equities turnover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European turnover figures for July were delayed, and reduced by the holiday
season, 18 per cent down on June after falls of 3 per cent for that month
and 8.6 per cent in May. This, says Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities
which produces the figures, was in spite of a 5.2 per cent gain in the
FT-Actuaries Europe index after its 4.1 per cent fall in June. The smallest
falls in turnover were in Spain and in the UK, down by just 1.8 and 2.5 per
cent respectively; the biggest were in France and Belgium, each down by
nearly one-third, followed by the Netherlands and Germany, down 30.3 per
cent and 23 per cent.

FT  02 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Corporate results lose impact
as bourses follow Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The intermittent and very recent ability of bourses to major on corporate
performance was shelved again yesterday as the dollar weakened and Wall
Street lost ground, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS ended little changed in domestic bond markets, but Wall Street's
performance disheartened equity traders in the afternoon and the CAC 40
index ended 34.17, or 1.65 per cent lower at 2,034.91 in turnover of about
FFr2.9bn.
There was some consolation in company results. Elf Aquitaine produced lower
profits but said that good results from chemicals had offset weak oil
prices. The shares fell FF5.40 to FFr410.60 while its Sanofi,
pharmaceuticals to perfumes subsidiary lost only FFr2 at FFr957 when it said
that analysts' forecasts for 1994 were achievable.
Meanwhile, Bouygues fell sharply after the construction group told analysts
that it was still suffering losses from its property interests. The shares
closed FFr26 down at FFr650.
Banks fell after broad gains on Wednesday. CFF lost FFr38, or 3.8 per cent
at FFr957 and BNP FFr8, or 3.2 per cent at FFr242.5. Alcatel Alsthom
extended Wednesday's fall on renewed allegations of corporate misdeeds,
ending FFr19 lower at FFr580. But Alcatel Cable rose FFr29, or 4.6 per cent
to FFr656 on a study by the British Cable Television Association on pending
investments in Europe.
FRANKFURT ended the session with the Dax index 12.05 lower at 2,200.80, in
no way surprised by the Buba decision. The real damage was done in the
afternoon as US equities and bonds, and German bund futures slid on the
latest US inflation data, the Ibis-indicated Dax sliding to 2,185.78.
Turnover fell from DM8.3bn to DM6.4bn. Daimler-Benz, which rose DM3.50 to
DM841 in further appreciation of Wednesday's first half results, succumbed
after hours with a fall to DM831.40.
Simlarly, Metallgesellschaft ended the afternoon down DM12, or 5.6 per cent
at DM203 after a session fall of DM6 to DM205. On Wednesday, the company
extricated itself from expensive links with Castle Energy of the US, but
warned at the same time that existing provisions of around DM1bn would not
be enough to cover its exposure.
ZURICH was unable to maintain early strength and prices turned lower, as
investors were disappointed by the half year statement from Sandoz and
depressed further late in the day by Wall Street's early performance. The
SMI index fell 17.2 to 2,628.4.
Sandoz registered shares were SFr18 lower at SFr673 after the company's
announcement that first half net profit rose by 2 per cent, compared with
expectations of a 5-10 per cent advance.
Roche, still benefiting from switching out of other pharmaceutical issues
saw its certificates surrender SFr20 to SFr6,080. The group is to release
first half results, including a net profit figure, tomorrow.
Against the trend, Schindler climbed SFr150 to SFr7,600 and SMH picked up
SFr3 to SFr169. Both moves were attributed to speculative buying.
AMSTERDAM finished at the day's low after losses in bonds, and weakness in
the London and Frankfurt markets depressed financial issues. The AEX index
fell 3.33 to 416.11.
Against the trend, VNU gained Fl 9.60 or 5.2 per cent to Fl 196.00 in
response to its first half earnings which came along with a forecast of
higher growth for the second half after the market closed on Wednesday.
Boskalis Westminster, the dredging company, dropped 10 cents to Fl 41.90
ahead of its results, which were in line with expectations and which came
after the market closed.
BolsWessanen, the food and beverage group, remained under pressure losing
another 40 cents down to Fl36.50 after its lower-than-expected half year
figures.
MILAN finished lower after a listless session which saw the Comit index lose
4.52 to 686.01, as the market awaited further developments on the budget and
pensions. Investors were also digesting the the latest scrap between the
coalition partners after Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League,
said that the prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, wanted a snap election.
Olivetti, which fell 5 per cent on Wednesday dipped another L8 to L2,115.
However, it picked up from a day's low of L2,090 after the company ruled out
a capital increase to finance a mobile telephones venture and said that
first half turnover had risen by 7 per cent.
MADRID fielded a batch of corporate results, encouraging and otherwise, but
it was unable to ignore Wall Street and high domestic bond yields. The
general index fell 4.90, or 1.6 per cent to 307.12 in turnover of just under
Pta20bn.
Banks did not like the bond yield focus, Argentaria losing Pta160, or 2.9
per cent at Pta5,330 and Bankinter Pta250 at Pta11,920. Among results, a big
rise in profits from Iberdrola left the utility only Pta6 lower at Pta874
although Endesa dropped Pta170 at Pta5,680; but a small decline in half year
profits left Dragados, the construction company, Pta90, or 4.1 per cent
lower at Pta2,115.
STOCKHOLM liked the Astra results which took the shares up SKr7 to SKr183.
Mr Paul Krikler at Goldman Sachs said that the bank had added the stock to
its priority list. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 6.70 to 1,459.20.
WARSAW lost 4.9 per cent after Wednesday's 4.4 per cent drop, the Wig index
closing 546.4 lower at 10,635.0 as brokers continued to hope for a technical
rally.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Interest in telecommunications stocks propped up activity, but the Nikkei
average only saw marginal gains due to profit-taking in popular issues,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index added 14.40 to 20,642.93 after a low of 20,617.52 in
the morning and a high of 20,700.54 during the afternoon session. After
losing ground on selling by corporate investors, brokers tried to support
telecommunications-linked stocks ahead of the Japan Telecom listing, while
overseas investors and banks bought steels.
Volume totalled 354m shares, rising above the 300m level for the first time
since August 17. In spite of the rise in volume, advances in share prices
were capped by arbitrage unwinding and profit-taking ahead of the September
book closing.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 0.48 to 1,639.91 while the
Nikkei 300 declined 0.03 to 299.22. Losers outnumbered gainers by 513 to 412
with 225 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.37 to
1,388.91.
Steels gained ground on heavy buying with Nippon Steel, heading the list,
gaining Y6 to Y381. NKK followed, rising Y7 to Y292 and Kawasaki Steel rose
Y11 to Y434.
Construction companies were higher on reports that July orders for the top
50 construction companies posted the first year on year rise in 18 months.
Shimizu rose Y30 to Y1,060 and Toda added Y29 to Y949.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone closed up Y8,000 at Y920,000 after climbing
to Y14,000 in the morning. DDI, the telecoms operator on the second section,
fell Y30,000 to Y1m on profit-taking.
Banks were lower. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y10 to Y3,010 and Mitsubishi
Bank declined Y30 to Y2,590. Brokers were mixed with Daiwa Securities losing
Y10 to Y1,560 and Nikko Securities up Y10 to Y1,200.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 25.00 to 22,877.05 in volume of 92.5m shares.
Volume rose on selling and buying back of shares by investors realising
profits on their holdings ahead of the interim book closing. Roundup
Regional markets moved in opposite directions.
KUALA LUMPUR made up for its day's holiday, gaining 2.3 per cent as foreign
fund managers increased the weighting of their Malaysian holdings. The
composite index rose 26.33 to 1,156.34, in volume of 374m shares.
Malaysia's biggest bank, Malayan Banking, led the advance with an 80 cent
jump to MDollars 17.20.
SINGAPORE saw a long-awaited run up as euphoria over property stocks and
Malaysian shares spilled over into the rest of the market. The Straits Times
Industrial index closed up 24.13 to 2,336.83.
Cycle &amp; Carriage put on 90 cents to a year's high of SDollars 12.80 amid
rumours of an expensive bid for Caltex House, a prime commercial property.
WELLINGTON finished at a five month high, encouraged by the
better-than-expected results from Fletcher Challenge on Wednesday.
The NZSE-40 Capital Index closed up 18.54 at 2,167.02, having picked up 11.4
per cent since its trough for the year on July 11. Turnover was NZDollars
51.3m. Fletcher Challenge closed up 11 cents at NZDollars 4.29, a high for
the year, after the 13 cent rise on Wednesday.
JAKARTA closed firm in moderate trading following some positive first half
earnings reports and the market index rose 2.45 to 512.71.
Consumer-related issues continued to drive the market with a 6.5 per cent
GDP growth projection this year appearing to indicate more disposable income
for consumption.
Pan Brothers rose Rp150 to Rp1,350 in active trading on good first-half
results.
HONG KONG closed lower on profit-taking, after the cumulative 7.5 per cent
rise over the the previous four days when foreigners were active buyers.
The Hang Seng Index finished 38.49 lower at 9,890.90, having recovered from
the day's low of 9,830.02, in turnover of HKDollars 6.66bn.
The profit-taking was focused on utilities with Hong Kong Telecom falling 30
cents to HKDollars 16.70 and Hong Kong Electric 55 cents lower at HKDollars
26.80.
The H share index jumped 76.48 or 5.9 per cent to 1,369.26 as fund managers
reweighted their China stock holdings, prompted by the visit to China by the
US Commerce Secretary, Mr Ron Brown. Yizheng rose 25 cents to HKDollars
2.83.
SYDNEY saw profit-taking, as some recent corporate reports failed to excite
the market and the All Ordinaries index lost 16.5 to 2,105.5.
Burns Philp eased 9 cents to ADollars 3.75 after reporting a 12 per cent
rise in profits and saying that it planned to focus on integrating
acquisitions.
TAIPEI reversed early gains to close below the 7,000-point resistance level
as profit-taking emerged in late trade on fears the central bank might
tighten liquidity further within the banking system.
The weighted index fell 33.96 points, or 0.48 per cent, to end at 6,974.15,
off an intra-day high of 7,085.80. Turnover was a heavy TDollars 99.61bn.
Plastics, overbought by investment trust companies in previous rallies,
consolidated. China Petrochemical fell TDollars 2.60 to TDollars 42.60.
MANILA was marked lower with leading blue chips absorbing much of the
selling as investors took profits ahead of next week's listing of Petron,
the oil stock.
The composite index slipped 33.44 to 3,079.39 as turnover fell to 1.2bn
pesos from Wednesday's 1.91bn pesos.
BOMBAY was lower on profit-taking after Wednesday's record close and the BSE
30-share index closed down 45.38 at 4,542.78.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Markets Report: No change from Buba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Traders were yesterday left twiddling their thumbs after the Bundesbank
council left all its leading interest rates unchanged, writes Philip Gawith.
The Bank's decision, leaving the discount and lombard rates unchanged at 4
1/2 per cent and 6 per cent respectively, and the repo rate fixed at 4.85
per cent for a further two weeks, was widely expected.
In the US the dollar weakened after the prices component of the August
purchasing manager's index rose to 74.5, the highest level in six years.
This prompted weakness in the bond market, and a fall in the Dow Jones
industrial average below 3,900, which hurt the dollar.
The dollar finished in London at DM1.577 from DM1.5783. Against the yen it
closed at Y99.665 from Y100.175.
The focus has now shifted to the release today of US payrolls data. The
prospect of a long weekend in the US also curbed the market's appetite for
taking large positions and this had a dampening effect on volumes.
In Europe the D-Mark was little changed after the Bundesbank's decision to
leave rates unchanged. Sterling had a very quiet day, with the trade
weighted index unchanged at 79.1.
The response of US markets and the dollar to the purchasing managers' index
was a reminder of the bearish psychology which continues to plague the
dollar. Some analysts had recently predicted that softer than expected data,
which was good for the bond market, might be the catalyst for a dollar
revival. Yesterday's movements suggest that reasoning to be premature.
Analysts said the softness of other parts of the report - such as falls in
new orders, production and the employment index - should have offset the
prices index and prevented the dollar going lower.
Earlier the dollar had received some encouragement from Mr Robert Mcteer,
president of the Dallas Federal Reserve bank, who said the long term outlook
for the dollar was pretty good. He predicted it would be stronger in 6-12
months time.
Analysts said the market's response had been constrained by the release of
the monthly employment report, and the start of a long weekend. Some traders
are expected to start squaring their positions with Labour day and Rosh
Hashanah holidays next week.
The Bank of France left its intervention rate unchanged at 5 per cent,
despite the decision earlier in the week by leading French commercial banks
to raise interest rates by 25 basis points.
Although the franc was fairly firm, analysts warned that trouble may lie
ahead. Economists at Nikko Europe say that unemployment, which fell to 3.07m
in July, will be the main issue in the May 1995 presidential election.
They argue that the economy needs further stimulation, but the commitment to
reduce the budget deficit removes room for fiscal manoeuvre, while the Bank
of France's commitment to a stable Franc/D-Mark rate means French rates are
set in relation to German rates.
The Nikko economists predict that there will probably only be one further
cut in German rates, in late September/early October. 'The French economy
needs more than just one interest rate cut (but) it is not likely to get it.
This is likely to lead to an increased political risk premium in both the
franc and domestic bond yields.'
Elsewhere in Europe the lira, having recovered to L1,000, again fell victim
to profit-taking. The catalyst was a renewed bout of political squabbling,
prompted by comments from Mr Umberto Bossi, the Northern League leader.
Mr Bossi alleged that the prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, had asked
President Scalfaro's permission to call a fresh general election in the hope
that the League would lose much of its vote.
Both the president and prime minister denied this claim, but it served as a
reminder of the fragile nature of Italy's ruling coalition. The episode also
cast doubt on whether the requisite political resolve exists to deal with
difficult issues, like curbing state spending.
The Bundesbank's decision to leave its official rates unchanged, and to fix
the repo rate at 4.85 per cent for a further two weeks, elicited limited
market response. The December Euromark contract traded 27,315 lots to close
at 94.84 from 94.88. The decision was fairly widely predicted.
Scandinavian currencies have recently been surprisingly firm, but Mr Muj
King, global director of forex and money markets at Technical Data in
London, predicted that a correction of 'several big figures' was due. 'This
retreat is especially possible because the Bundesbank is at the end of a
cycle of cuts and thus German interest rates are likely to firm and have an
adverse effect on the Scandinavian bloc.'
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 462m assistance,
at established rates, compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 500m.
Overnight money traded between 3 3/4 per cent and 5 per cent.

Australian smelter

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's largest aluminium smelter, Tomago, is to close down one of its
three potlines on Monday because of a strike, human resources manager Mr
Graham Taylor said yesterday, reports Reuters from Sydney.
Closure of the 160 pots in Potline Two at the smelter near Newcastle in New
South Wales would reduce annual production by 80,000 tonnes to 260,000
tonnes.
'The decision was taken purely on health and welfare considerations for our
staff who are keeping the other two potlines operating during the strike,'
Mr Taylor said.
On August 12 about 700 workers went on strike in support of a demand for an
8 per cent pay rise. Mr Taylor said the striking workers voted at a meeting
yesterday to continue the stoppage indefinitely.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: World timber shortage hitting
British sawmills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A worldwide shortage of timber is pushing up prices for logs in the UK and
leading to supply problems as sawmills struggle to secure their raw
materials.
Many British sawmills are trying to run their plants at double shifts to
cope with the increase in demand, but are having difficulties obtaining
logs.
The Forestry Commission reported a 9 per cent rise in the price of standing
timber in the six months to the end of March as demand picked up when the
economy began to emerge from recession. The commission also said that
softwood log prices increased by 16 per cent in the year to the end of
March.
'We've almost certainly seen prices higher than that in the past five months
 -just judging from the timber we've sold,' said Mr Martin Wilkinson,
forestry operations director at Tilhill Economic Forestry, a division of
Booker, which manages 12 per cent of the UK's private woodland.
The UK, which ranks the eighth largest consumer of wood and wood products in
the world, produces only 14 per cent of its own requirements domestically.
Its import bill for logs from Canada, Scandinavia and Russia among other
suppliers amounts to nearly Pounds 7bn.
But imports are dropping off after reaching a peak in 1989 as environmental
concerns world-wide restrict the harvest of natural forests. The value of
timber imports to the UK has declined from Pounds 10bn in 1989 to Pounds 6bn
in recent years.
In addition, growing consumption of wood in many developing countries has
led to fewer exports.
Mr Ian Mosley, president of the Timber Packaging and Pallet Confederation,
said makers of wooden pallets had seen their wood costs increase by 20 per
cent over the past six months due to shortages.
Pallet makers are in competition with the construction industry and fencing
manufacturers for tight timber supplies. 'Pallets play a vital part in
Britain's export drive. This timber shortage will make the export drive
falter and higher pallet prices could make exporters less competitive in
foreign markets,' Mr Mosley said.
As more British tree plantations reach maturity, the UK is expected to
become more self-sufficient in wood production - it should be able to supply
27 per cent of its needs by 2010.
Mr Wilkinson expects timber output in Britain to reach a peak in 2025 when
production should touch 20m cubic metres a year, but by then demand will
have grown from a current 55m cubic metres to 75m cubic metres.
The government recently introduced a new incentives package for landowners
to plant commercial trees, but Mr Wilkinson believes it is insufficient to
compete land for agriculture - the value of which is buoyed by European
Union subsidies.
'There is a lot of agricultural land which is eminently suited to growing
conifer trees, if farmers were given incentives to plant trees on set-aside
land, we could grow a lot more wood than we do now,' he said.
Trees need to be planted now for harvesting in 30 years or otherwise many
plantations will reach their peak and then output will drop off.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME aluminium prices surge to 3
1/2 -year highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminium prices reached 3 1/2 -year highs at the London Metal Exchange
yesterday as traders anticipated further improvements in the market's
fundamental picture.
Expectations that the multilateral pact agreed earlier this year to cut
output would continue to eat into stocks of the metal, already bolstered by
Wednesday's news of threatened power cuts at Kaiser's Ghanaian smelter, were
given a further fillip by the likelihood of a potline closure at an
Australian plant (see adjacent story).
The news helped the LME's three months delivery price to break through the
resistance area around Dollars 1,550 a tonne to touch Dollars 1,570 before
closing at Dollars 1,564, up Dollars 29.50 on the day and Dollars 51.25 on
the week so far.
'The move on aluminium today was always on the cards considering recent news
of production problems and improving charts,' one dealer told the Reuters
news agency. 'Prices are now set to go higher.'
As cuts under the multilateral pact have worked through LME stocks of
aluminium have declined by more than 200,000 tonnes, or 7.5 per cent, from
the record level reached on June 10. Producer stocks have also shown a
substantial fall in recent months. And with developed economies moving out
of recession demand for aluminium is generally expected to pick up quite
strongly.
'We may be on for levels around Dollars 1,600 soon,' the dealer told
Reuters.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Showpiece diamond mine shares
the market's strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NORTHERN TRANSVAAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Turbulence in the global diamond markets is being felt even here at Venetia,
De Beers' newest diamond mine, 30km from South Africa's borders with
Botswana and Zimbabwe.
Only weeks before the mine came into production in July 1992 at a cost of
USDollars 400m, De Beers' Central Selling Organisation, which controls 80
per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, imposed quotas on its
producer-suppliers because of a flood of gem stones from Angola. For a time
Venetia, the first mine of any sort in South Africa to gain permission for
seven-day working, moved to a five-day week.
This year it has gone back to seven-day working as the quotas were eased so
that the CSO is now accepting 85 per cent of the diamonds it contracted to
take from producers. However, there is still turmoil in the diamond market,
caused by uncertainty about Russian exports following 'leaks' of stones from
that country outside its contract with the CSO.
Consequently, Mr Hans Gastrow, general manager, says that this year Venetia
will process 4.3m tonnes of ore, 6.5 per cent below its capacity. It is also
mining an area of lower grade ore, which has fewer diamonds in each tonne.
Mr Gastrow is giving no forecasts but all this implies that output will be
well below the 5.6m carats a year De Beers predicted Venetia would yield at
full production.
Last year the mine, building up rapidly, more than doubled output and
processed 3.6m tonnes of ore to recover 4.96m carats. About 70 per cent of
Venetia's diamonds are of gem quality and analysts suggest that at Dollars
100 a carat on average the mine is generating annual sales of about Dollars
500m.
Mr Gastrow says that, apart from the imposition of the CSO quota, Venetia
'has made a remarkably smooth transition from construction to production'.
This year will be a time of consolidation.
He insists that the quota is having no impact on employment. Nevertheless,
Venetia originally was to have employed 870 and it now has 764. A mine of
Venetia's size in the past would have employed 2,000. The total has been
kept down here partly by highly automated process plant but also by 'fewer
people employed just to see that other people are doing their jobs',
according to Mr David Gadd-Claxton, ore extraction manager.
Venetia was the first new South African diamond mine for 25 years. It is
also the country's biggest diamond mine and a major contributor of export
earnings.
The mine has also revitalised De Beers' production, as it is accounting for
half the group's output in South Africa and replacing production from its
100-year-old Kimberley mines, which are now fading away.
Venetia's success is strategically important to De Beers because, when its
output is added to that in Botswana and Namibia, it gives the group direct
control over more than 50 per cent of world rough gem diamond output. This
provides a major base for the CSO to work from and gives it a powerful
position from which to negotiate with other producers in the diamond cartel.
And, while Venetia is using conventional methods to mine about 500m tonnes
of waste and to mine and process 100m tonnes of ore over its projected
23-year life, it is trying some highly innovative ideas about labour
relations and environmental issues, at least as far as South Africa is
concerned.
For example, there are no migrant workers at the mine. Employees are bussed
in from nearby towns for 12-hour shifts and then return to their families.
Venetia is also breaking with the De Beers' tradition that, for security
reasons, no equipment leaves the mine but is burried within the top security
area once it is no longer useful. Here worn out equipment will be stockpiled
and sold off when the mine closes. It could be worth millions of dollars.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Big livestock cuts needed' to
meet EU pollution targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Livestock numbers in the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark would have to be
cut dramatically if the European Union was to reach its targets for reducing
nitrate concentrations in drinking water, Mr Bob Crabtree, from the Macaulay
Land Use Research Institute, told a conference in Aberdeen yesterday.
He cited a report from the US Department of Agriculture forecasting that
livestock herds would have to be cut in the Netherlands by 65 per cent, in
Belgium by 28 per cent and in Denmark by 9 per cent over eight years.
The cuts would have to occur if producers, particularly in intensive farming
regions, were unable to dispose of their slurry and animal manure in an
environmentally acceptable way.
'Concern with water pollution from chemicals, nitrates and phosphates has
increased during the last decade, particularly in the more
intensively-farmed areas of Europe,' Mr Crabtree said.
The EU's nitrates directive, which was published in 1991, advocated setting
up nitrate vulnerable zones where restrictions would be placed on the timing
and quantity of organic manure disposal. The Ministry of Agriculture has
proposed 74 zones for the UK.
Mr Crabtree said the creation of the zones would place a heavy and expensive
burden on many livestock farmers. 'Some intensive units will need to invest
in increased storage facilities for slurry and manure while seeking ways to
dispose of waste over a wider area than has been necessary in the past,' he
said.
He also called for increased research into technical solutions to the use of
farm waste, other than the traditional spreading of slurry and manure on the
land.
In countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium, where intensive farming
was more widespread, the impact of the nitrates directive could erode some
competitiveness, Mr Crabtree suggested. But he questions whether that would
be politically feasible.
'There will undoubtedly be an erosion in the competitive position of
designated areas and a progressive transfer of production to less vulnerable
areas as fixed investments depreciate and need replacement,' he said.

FT  02 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices at sales this week continued the rise which has characterised the
1994/95 selling season, with auctions resumed in all primary markets during
the past five weeks. There has also been good demand for Australian
stockpile wool, with disposals far exceeding the present monthly fixed
schedule. Buying interest stretches well forward, with inroads now being
made into the months from January onwards when stockpile sales will be twice
the present rate. The rising wool price trend is also bringing out steady
business in wool textile semi-manufactures, though there is considerable
price resistance and raw wool markets are showing more buoyancy than applies
further down the manufacturing line. The Australian Eastern states market
indicator ended the week at 739c/kg, compared with 728c/kg a week before.

FT  02 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Further downward pressure put on bunds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Although the Bundesbank's decision not to change official interest rates was
widely expected, the news put further downward pressure on German government
bonds, which had already received an early knock from stronger than expected
west German industrial production figures.
The data showed a 2.2 per cent monthly rise in July, compared with market
forecasts of between 0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent and was seen as a further
confirmation that the economy was growing rapidly and the Bundesbank would
have even fewer reasons to cut official interest rates further.
Dealers said the central bank's decision to stick to a fixed rate of 4.85
per cent for its next two securities repurchase tenders added to the
argument that its priority had shifted from further easing to managing
smoothly the trough of the interest rate cycle.
Mr Kit Juckes, of SG Warburg, said the shape of the German yield curve
suggested that the market was still fairly relaxed about the monetary
outlook. 'Bunds are complacently priced given the likelihood that German
rates will start to rise next year,' he said. On Liffe, the September bund
future fell 0.48 points to 91.27 in modest trading.
UK gilts outperformed their continental European counterparts thanks to a
late rally which dealers had difficulty in explaining. Sterling's resilience
in the face of a falling dollar and a newspaper report that 10-year gilt
yields could fall to 7 1/2 per cent were given as possible reasons.
The rise in gilts caused a further narrowing of the yield spread between
gilts and bunds to 132 basis points, which forced more dealers to close
their short positions. 'The bears are being squeezed out of the market,'
said one analyst.
On Liffe, the December long gilt future was  9/32 higher at 101 7/8 in the
late afternoon, below the day's best of 102 1/16 .
Elsewhere, Italian government bonds fell in nervous trading as a result of
renewed infighting in the government. Italian futures fell by nearly a
point. By contrast, French government bonds were steady following an
uneventful monthly auction of OATs.
US Treasury bonds drifted yesterday as traders awaited today's report on
August conditions in the labour market.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1/16 at
100 1/2 , with the yield rising to 7.452 per cent. The two-year note was
unchanged at 100 3/16 to yield 6.132 per cent.
The market was hoping today's employment data would provide it with
clear-cut guidance on the strength of the economy. Beforehand, trading
remained light, though a negative tone was cast over the morning's activity
by fresh evidence of inflationary pressures in the manufacturing sector.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said the prices-paid
component of its August survey had climbed to its highest level in six
years.
However, the overall index of business activity was weaker than expected,
completing a pattern which had emerged in a regional Chicago survey released
on Wednesday.
The net impact on bonds was modest losses across the yield curve. Still,
yesterday's data revealed nothing to change expectations about today's
report. Economists are forecasting an increase in non-farm payrolls of about
225,000, suggesting a moderate pace of economic growth.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Commodities fund launch
delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unexpectedly strong interest from Japanese investors in a commodities fund
which is about to be launched by BZW Investment Management (BZWIM) has
prompted a delay in the publication of the pathfinder prospectus to allow
time for it to get clearance from Japan's ministry of finance.
To tap Japanese demand, BZWIM needs to register the closed-end fund as a
private placement with the MoF. The process includes translating the
document into Japanese and answering MoF queries.
Mr Ronald Gould, the BZWIM managing director in charge of setting up the
Jersey-based investment company, said the prospectus, due to be published
next Monday, would now be released a week later.
The strong economic rebound in the US and parts of Europe, coupled with
signs of a resurgence in inflation, has aroused investor interest in real
assets, such as commodities, because of their characteristics as an
inflation hedge and a play on economic growth.
'You will dampen risk and volatility in a portfolio by introducing
commodities as an asset class,' said Mr Gould.
In his view, an allocation of 3 to 5 per cent of total assets to commodities
would achieve the best results. However, he estimates that in the UK, only a
tiny amount is invested in commodities, while in the US, where investors are
more comfortable with commodities, they only account for 1 per cent of
pension fund assets.
BZWIM, which has around Pounds 50bn under management, will be investing in
the fund, which is expected to attract at least Pounds 100m from
institutional investors.
The benchmark for the fund will be the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index. Mr
Gould hopes to outperform the index by up to 10 per cent by giving a greater
weighting to industrial materials and energy, which should benefit the most
from stronger economic growth.
The fund will use exchange-traded futures contracts to gain exposure to
commodities but they will be re-packaged in the form of notes issued by
highly-rated banks or through swap agreements with banks.
This buffer is designed to counter any discomfort among investors to direct
exposure to futures and to allow institutions that are not able to buy
futures to invest in the fund.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Ten-year issues in Canadian dollars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Canadian dollar market saw two 10-year eurobond offerings yesterday as
borrowers took advantage of the recent revival in the underlying Canadian
government bond market.
BNG launched a CDollars 250m issue, priced to yield 22 basis points over the
6 1/2 per cent Canadian government bond due 1994. Lead managers ABN Amro
reported demand from retail investors in Belgium and Luxembourg but about 60
per cent of the bonds are expected to be taken up by European institutional
investors.
The Canadian dollar market currently offers good swap opportunities,
particularly at the long end, and investors in particular like the spread
against the US market, syndicate managers said.
Ile-de-France launched a CDollars 85m 10-year bond, priced to yield 16 basis
points above the 6 1/2 per cent Canadian government bond due 2004.
The eurobond market also saw a flock of other issues yesterday, mainly
small, short-dated deals aimed at retail investors, including five US dollar
offerings.
'This signifies that the dollar market will be the market of choice in the
fourth quarter rather than more peripheral markets as borrowers go for
safety,' said one syndicate manager.
Ford Credit Europe tapped the US dollar market with a Dollars 200m
three-year offering priced to yield 37 1/2 basis points above the 6 1/2 per
cent 1997 Treasury. Syndicate managers said the deal was a success and lead
manager Goldman Sachs said the bonds were mainly sold to Swiss retail
investors.
Volvo Group Finance Europe also tapped the dollar market, with a Dollars
150m five-year issue priced to yield 56 basis points over the 6 7/8 per cent
Treasury 1999.
Syndicate managers said the pricing was ambitious for an unrated borrower
and that the bonds were pitched at a less popular area of the curve. The
spread widened slightly in later trade. However, lead manager Merrill Lynch
said it saw significant interest from Swiss and Benelux retail investors and
institutional investors.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Canadian bonds top performers
in August
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Canadian government bond market outperformed the rest of the world's
bond markets in August.
JP Morgan's government bond index shows Canadian bonds posted a return of
2.78 per cent, measured in local currency, followed by Australia with a gain
of 1.51 per cent and the UK with 0.79 per cent.
Investors were attracted into the Canadian market 'by favourable inflation
figures, 10-year yields above 9 per cent, and real yields that are among the
highest available in the bond markets', JP Morgan says.
The core European markets of Germany and France gained at the expense of the
higher-yielding markets of Italy, Spain and Sweden. Interest rate rises in
Italy and Sweden were seen by investors as 'portents to rate rises by other
continental European central banks', triggering losses across European
markets.
Sweden, which saw a return of minus 0.93 per cent on the month, also
suffered from investor concern over heightening political tensions ahead of
the general election.
The worst performer in August was the Danish government bond market, with a
return of minus 2.76 per cent in local currency. The average rate of return
across all countries was minus 0.46 per cent.
The UK gilt market was boosted by economic data which pointed to low
inflation, 'banishing fears of an early rise in interest rates'.
US Treasuries posted a gain of 0.13 per cent in August, with unhedged
dollar-based investors benefiting from the dollar's recent decline.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Amcor advances to ADollars
336.9m and increases yearly dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at Amcor, the Australian paper and packaging group, rose to ADollars
336.9m (USDollars 250m) from ADollars 266.9m in the year to end-June, after
tax but before abnormal charges.
The company said the advance reflected improved results across its
operations, and came despite highly competitive markets.
However, bottomline results were marred by abnormal items, which included a
charge of ADollars 80.3m, mainly covering restructuring costs flowing from
the APPM acquisition last year, and goodwill write-offs.
In the previous year, Amcor enjoyed a ADollars 48m abnormal surplus, so
profits after tax and abnormals fell to ADollars 256.6m from ADollars
314.9m.
Sales for the year were up to ADollars 5.55bn from ADollars 4.82bn, and
earnings per share before abnormals and on a fully-diluted basis increased
by 19.7 per cent, to 56.4 cents.
In the containers packaging division, sales were up by 12.3 per cent to
ADollars 1.79bn, while operating profits rose to ADollars 203.9m, from
ADollars 200.8m. Amcor said the result was good, given 'the extensive
rationalisation and other structural changes in the industry sectors in
which containers operate'.
Amcor Fibre Packaging saw sales rise to ADollars 1.78bn from ADollars
1.53bn, while profits were ADollars 141.9m, against ADollars 111.1m last
time.
On the paper side, Amcor Paper Group produced a 9.4 per cent operating
profit gain, at ADollars 177.4m, with sales climbing by 28 per cent to
ADollars 1.15bn.
Interest charges fell to ADollars 63.8m from ADollars 75.1m, and the group's
capital and acquisition expenditure during the year topped ADollars 1.1bn,
compared with ADollars 708m previously.
The dividend for the year is 34 cents, up from 31 cents, with a final of 2
cents higher at 18 cents. Burns Philp, the Sydney-based company which has
been building up its food ingredients business aggressively in recent
months, yesterday announced after-tax profits of ADollars 123m in the year
to end-June, up from ADollars 110.1m last time.
Operating earnings, before interest and tax were 14 per cent higher at
ADollars 219.8m, while sales were ADollars 2.79bn, compared with ADollars
2.68bn previously. Earnings per share, on a fully-diluted basis, increased
by 6 per cent to 27.6 cents.

impressive profits leap

   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bank Bumiputra, Malaysia's second biggest bank which in the past has been
dogged by financial scandal and mismanagement, seems to have put the bad
days firmly behind it with a big leap in profits.
For the year to end-March, Bank Bumiputra recorded a pre-tax profit of
MDollars 450m (USDollars 176m), compared with MDollars 81m in the previous
year. Group income for the year rose almost 90 per cent to MDollars 990m.
Directors said that fee-based income and foreign exchange earnings made up
about half the group's income, while the recovery of bad loans contributed
considerably towards the leap in profitability.
Bank Bumiputra is wholly owned by the Malaysian government. In the
mid-1980s, it was involved in a loans scandal centred on the exposure of its
Bumiputra Merchant Finance subsidiary in the Hong Kong property market.
Later, the bank faced bankruptcy over bad loans, this time in the Malaysian
market. On both occasions Petronas, the Malaysian state oil company, had to
come to the bank's rescue.
The Malaysian government intends to privatise the bank.

FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Evolutionary, not revolutionary,
approach at Elf - Philippe Jaffre has run the oil group for a year, guiding
it through the first stages of privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A tanker cannot turn on a sixpence, and it takes time to steer a new course
at one of the world's leading oil groups.
That is the message from Mr Philippe Jaffre, chairman of Elf Aquitaine,
France's largest industrial concern, after one year at the helm and seven
months after having guided his charge through privatisation.
That is also the message from first-half results, which showed a decline of
10 per cent in net profits to FFr1.2bn (Dollars 222m). A boost from the
company's chemicals activities in the second quarter meant the result was
better than expected after a profits warning in June.
But Elf is still looking at another year of relatively meagre pickings,
compared with the FFr10.6bn at which net profits peaked in 1990.
Part of the explanation for the decline in profits lies in adverse
conditions which have confronted all of the international oil majors - the
fall in the oil price which continued into the first half of the year,
pressure on refining margins and, for non-US groups, the weakness in the
dollar.
But Elf also faces structural problems which have sapped its powers of
resistance. 'When you have any structural problem, it takes time and a lot
of effort to remedy,' says Mr Jaffre.
The problem is the legacy of an expensive and ambitious expansion strategy
in the early 1990s, which included the acquisition of the North Sea assets
of Occidental of the US and stakes in diverse companies such as Bidermann,
the textiles group.
The strategy left Elf with a rising debt burden, which totalled FFr52bn at
the end of last year, increased financial charges and a declining return on
capital, which fell from 13 per cent in 1989 to 4 per cent at the end of
last year.
In an attempt to reverse the trend, Mr Jaffre is pursuing a strategy of debt
reduction, tighter controls on investments and a focus on the group's three
core business areas - oil, chemicals and healthcare.
But he is implementing his strategy through an evolutionary rather than a
revolutionary approach, avoiding announcements of aggressive cost-cutting.
The approach has prompted impatience among some investors. 'I think that a
lot of people who bought shares in Elf when it was privatised were buying
for the upside potential of a big restructuring similar to what has happened
at companies like BP,' says one analyst at a US securities company.
'There is a feeling that Mr Jaffre is moving in the right direction but they
haven't heard much to convince them of a big rationalisation effort.'
Mr Jaffre is aware of such sentiments. 'I know that Anglo-Saxon investors
adore it when big cost-cutting plans are announced,' he says.
However, the Elf chief argues that such an approach is inefficient in the
case of French industry and that the measures being implemented at Elf,
without fanfare, are beginning to bear fruit.
On the first count, Mr Jaffre claims that the best way to prevent a
restructuring plan in a French company is to announce it in advance. 'If I
was to declare a big cost-cutting plan then there would be resistance.'
The Elf chairman argues that French industry has made significant progress
in reducing costs and increasing efficiency in recent years without
high-profile restructuring announcements.
He cites Renault, the automobile group, and Saint Gobain, the glass and
building materials company, as well as Elf's own chemicals opera-tions,
which saw profits treble in the first half of the year.
For Elf as a whole, he argues that significant reforms have also been put in
place over the past nine months, attacking the company's cost base and
improving efficiency.
Investment spending this year is to be reduced by 20 per cent to FFr32bn.
The FFr15bn spent in the first half shows the company is on course to reach
this objective.
Elf's participation in the Leuna refinery project in eastern Germany has
been cut from a majority stake to 43 per cent, after a test of strength with
the Treuhand privatisation agency.
The company has also embarked on an asset sale programme aimed at realising
net receipts of FFr5bn this year. Mr Jaffre says the target is within reach.
Receipts in the first half amounted to FFr1.5bn, including the sale of Elf's
stake in Havas, the media and publishing group.
Another FFr2bn should be realised by the end of this quarter, and a further
FFr3bn or so by the year-end. Against this could be offset about FFr1bn
through an investment in Renault, a close partner of Elf, should the vehicle
group be privatised.
The sale of assets will help ease Elf's debt burden, which Mr Jaffre says
has stabilised and should start to decline from next year. But although he
is a former head of Credit Agricole, one of France's biggest banks, he
denies he is taking a purely financial approach at his new charge.
'I didn't start by saying I must cut debts at the group, which would have
been a bit reductionist. I started by saying that we must re-establish the
profitability of the group and to do this we must concentrate on our core
businesses. As a consequence we can sell assets and reduce debts.'
Financial charges are expected to start falling from 1995, when most
analysts see the potential for a healthy rise in profits. Until then, the
debt burden and the weakness in the dollar will offset, partly at least, the
gains from a higher second-half oil price and stronger profits from
chemicals and healthcare operations.
Measures are also being taken to increase the emphasis on profitability
among the company's 90,000 employees.
Mr Jaffre denies that radical measures are needed to shake up the culture of
the group. 'Elf already has a taste for performance and development which is
shown by the fact that it has gone from nowhere 50 years ago to rank among
the world's 30 biggest companies today.'
However, he says he is seeking to add a bit of 'mustard' to staff attitudes
through expanding employee share ownership and introducing stock options for
senior executives, a scheme which is being discussed by Elf's board.
Such Anglo-Saxon measures, he feels, will sharpen Elf's competitive edge.
For British and US investors, however, it is a trace of mustard at the
bottom line which is awaited.
