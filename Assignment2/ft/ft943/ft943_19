FT  30 AUG 94 / Economic recovery has yet to trigger euphoria: Norwich,
Manchester and Southampton for the elusive feel-good factor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The worst is over. Recovery is under way. Those sentiments are pretty
universal in Manchester, Norwich and Southampton. What is missing, however,
is any sense of euphoria, of a 'feel-good factor'.
Mr David Herman, finance director of the Anglian Group, said: 'Maybe it's
because we were in a recession for so long. People can't believe things are
OK now.' His company, which sells replacement windows, is dependent on
consumer confidence. He says business is 'patchy - not geographically, but
week-on-week'.
Nearly all the economic statistics point in the right direction. The economy
grew at 3.75 per cent in the year to the second quarter. Inflation and
interest rates are at 25-year lows. Unemployment has fallen 340,000 from its
1992 peak.
But in spite of the encouragement given by the statistics, many business
people report that they are seeing a modest rather than spectacular
recovery. Mr Rod Sellers of British Vita, the Middleton-based polymer and
plastics group, said: 'It's a gradual recovery. I don't think it's a boom.'
Mr Terry Goddard of Dimplex, the Southampton-based heating appliance
manufacturer, said: 'We're seeing signs of improvement but no underlying
confidence.'
Mr Peter Beebe, director-general of the Southampton Chamber of Commerce,
said: 'Everywhere I go here, there remains a sense of caution. There has
been a lift-off which has been sustained over the past year but it has not
been a significant lift-off.'
According to Mr Robert Hough, chairman of Manchester Ship Canal and
president of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce: 'People talk of a slow
recovery; the word fragile is frequently used.'
The same picture of modest growth applies to the retail sector. Mr Ken
Hunter, manager of the Arndale shopping centre in Manchester, said things
were better. 'But we don't think it's good enough at this stage to say we're
on a roll.'
The three main influences on consumer confidence are jobs, incomes and the
housing market. In terms of jobs the recovery is yielding, at best, growth
in part-time and short-term employment.
For those in work incomes are growing at a modest nominal rate compared with
the pace of annual wage rises in the early 1980s.
Business people do not seem too concerned about wage pressures. Mr Sellers
of British Vita said: 'Wage increases are under control'. Mr Hough of
Manchester Ship Canal echoed this: 'The wage-cost side is very subdued.
Wages are rising marginally above the rate of inflation.'
In addition to modest wage rises, consumers have had to cope with this
year's tax increases, which at one time were widely expected to derail the
recovery. Official figures show some slowdown in spending, but retailers say
business has been better than feared.
The housing market, which has often been the motor behind recoveries in the
past, is not playing the same role this time. House prices are static or
increasing, but the effect of the late 1980s drop is still apparent in many
areas.
Years of subdued house prices appear to have resulted in a change in
attitude. Ms Gina Matthews of the Nationwide estate agency in Southampton
believes that homeowners are no longer buying houses for short-term
investment gains, but as a place to live for six or seven years.
Mr Herman of Anglian Group said: 'Research before the recession showed that
within two years of moving to a new home occupants would do most of the
major work. Those days are gone. Now people who can't or won't move find
that eventually they have to improve their homes.'
Companies such as Dimplex, which produces heating units, say they are having
to respond to the changed climate by producing more innovative products to
persuade cautious consumers to splash out.
Housing market activity is picking up. Ms Matthews of Nationwide said: 'Last
year we had 20 to 23 viewings before a house sales was agreed. Now it is
down to ten to 12 viewings.'
In Manchester the price of residential land has risen 25 per cent in the
last 12 months, according to chartered surveyors Grimley JR Eve. Mr Robin
Brocklehurst of Grimley said he had 'never been as busy in selling
residential land. Successful builders are cash rich and haven't carried a
land bank for some time'.
The improved climate is gradually making business people more confident.
Mr John McLellan, regional business appraisal manager at National
Westminster Bank, in Southampton said: 'Over the past three months we have
sanctioned more new lending limits than for a very long time. However,
although we've sanctioned new lending limits, companies haven't yet drawn
them down.'
But until the crucial trio of jobs, incomes and housing show more
spectacular growth, the 'feel good' factor may still be absent. Given
Britain's past history of boom and bust, some say that may be no bad thing.
'Perversely, you have to have a slow imperceptible growth in the economy to
make it sustainable,' said Manchester Ship Canal's Mr Hough.

FT  30 AUG 94 / MAI reviews actions by Lady Archer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lady Archer will not be 'precipitately' removed from the Anglia Television
board, following disclosures about share orders placed by her husband, Lord
Archer, according to a director of MAI, the company which bought Anglia in
January.
However MAI is reviewing Lady Archer's actions in the days prior to the
January 18 public announcement of its takeover of Anglia.
Directors want to reassure themselves that she followed normal corporate
procedures, as laid down in Stock Exchange rules and the Companies Act,
relating to spouse's share dealings and the protection of confidential price
sensitive information.
Lord Archer, a former Conservative party deputy chairman, placed orders to
buy 50,000 Anglia shares on January 13 and January 14, netting an Pounds
80,000 profit for an acquaintance, Mr Broosk Saib, when they were sold on
January 18.
On January 12 Lady Archer attended an Anglia board meeting at which details
were given for the first time of MAI's proposed takeover terms - although
the Anglia board did not formally agree to the takeover until January 16.
The MAI director said the company was following normal procedures in
evaluating Lady Archer's actions.
He repudiated any suggestion that the company action's might be politically
motivated, pointing out that the Labour peer, Lord Hollick, had only one
vote on MAI's board.
Lord Archer's share orders were investigated by Department of Trade and
Industry inspectors. After receiving their report the DTI last month decided
to take no action against Lord Archer.
Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade secretary, yesterday wrote to Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, asking him to confirm that 'there
would be no legal barrier to publication of the inspectors' report if Lord
Archer, and others named in the report, were to give their consent to its
release'.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Mobile phone disconnections rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The intensifying battle between mobile phone companies to recruit customers
is leading to a serious rise in fraud and the number of bad debtors,
industry analysts say.
The number of mobile phone users in the UK has nearly doubled, to 2.6m,
since the start of 1993 with one in 20 of the population now owning a
cellular handset.
The rate of disconnections is also rising steadily, however. It is running
at an annual rate equal to about 30 per cent of the number of mobile
subscribers, according to BIS Strategic Decisions, an information technology
consultancy.
The consultancy estimates that about half of all disconnections are caused
by people moving between mobile phone companies or between different types
of usage. The other half are due to a combination of fraud and the inability
of customers to keep up with their bills.
Ms Gail Kirby, an analyst at the consultancy, said: 'It's a big problem, and
it's getting more serious for the network operators as the number of
subscribers rises so dramatically.'
The three months to the end of June saw the number of disconnections rise,
as a proportion of subscribers, for the fourth successive quarter. Vodafone,
the largest cellular operator, was worst hit, with a disconnection rate
equal to 34 per cent of its subscribers over a full year.
Mr Terry Barwick, Vodafone's corporate affairs director, said: 'We have had
problems with fraud, and are tightening our credit-checking system to reduce
it.'
He said some of the fraud appeared to be organised systematically, with some
dealers stealing bonuses paid for new subscribers by means of fake
subscriber names and personal details.
The increase in disconnections also appears to be caused by customers being
attracted to mobile phones by cut-price handset offers. Some cannot then
keep up the monthly payments.
Although handsets can be bought for as little as Pounds 30, monthly
subscriptions can be Pounds 28.75 a month and calls can cost as much as 50p
a minute. Lower monthly charges are available on low-user schemes, but call
charges are then far higher and subscribers who - perhaps inadvertently -
use the phone to make more than a few calls face hefty bills.
One dealer said: 'Many people who buy mobile phones don't have a clue how
much it actually costs to keep a mobile phone going - particularly if you
use it.'

FT  30 AUG 94 / Minister urges more Swans talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roger Freeman, defence procurement minister, yesterday invited the sole
prospective bidder for Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in
receivership, to last-minute talks about its future.
Mr Freeman said he was very disappointed that Constructions Mecaniques de
Normandie had rejected the Ministry of Defence's latest proposals,
concerning the price at which Swans' existing MoD frigates contract would be
transferred to CMN.
The MoD said: 'Mr Freeman hopes that, in the interests of the future of the
yard, CMN will be prepared to meet him shortly.'
Mr Iskandar Safa, principal shareholder in CMN's parent company, Soffia,
said yesterday he was willing to take up Mr Freeman's offer of a meeting but
would first reach a decision on whether to pursue his acquisition of Swans.
'I think it's more logical,' said Mr Safa. 'We will make our position clear
today.'
Receiver Price Waterhouse has set a deadline of tomorrow for CMN to start
paying the wages of Swan Hunter's remaining 100-strong design and technical
team.
If the company does not start doing so the team will be made redundant
immediately. Without them, the yard, which will finish its last vessel this
autumn, will be unable to tender for more work, ending hopes of a sale as a
going concern.
CMN, which insists that it will buy Swans only if the yard has a two-year
workload, has proposed a deal under which it would take on the existing
frigates contract and sub-contract work on the last vessel to the receiver.
It would use the balance to pay the Pounds 200,000 a month wage bill of the
design team until the end of the year in the hope of securing more work.
CMN wants Pounds 57.7m from the MoD for the frigates contract, the price
agreed last month. The MoD, saying that passing time has reduced the risk,
last week offered Pounds 57m, then raised its offer by Pounds 350,000.
Mr Safa yesterday denied that CMN had rejected the compromise deal, but
again said that he believed the frigates contract price should be Pounds
57.7m.
'In this deal we happen to be the purchaser and people shouldn't forget it,'
he said. 'We have to really assess the risk to be taken.'

FT  30 AUG 94 / Hume looks beyond IRA ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour
Party, yesterday called for talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing,
to start as soon as possible after a genuine end to IRA violence.
As speculation continued to mount that the IRA might be about to call a
general ceasefire, the air of optimism was reinforced by Cardinal Cahal
Daly, leader of the Irish Catholic church, who said Northern Ireland could
be on the brink of the best opportunity for peace in 25 years.
But the mood was dampened by unionist leaders who voiced fears that Britain
might be preparing to make concessions in return for a ceasefire.
Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, is likely to raise
such concerns with Mr John Major at a meeting expected to be held in a few
days. Downing Street said last night, however, that there was no guarantee
this meeting would take place this week.
Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Ulster secretary, yesterday warned unionists
against trying to block political progress, saying that they should be
reassured by guarantees in the Downing Street declaration that there would
be no reunification without the consent of the majority in Ulster.
Mr Hume, said from his holiday home in Donegal a day after issuing a joint
statement with Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president: 'If violence has
genuinely stopped, the next step has to be dialogue and I would like to see
that begin as soon as possible.'
He also responded to scathing unionist criticism of his weekend statement
with Mr Adams. He said: 'They don't seem to be listening to what I am
saying. We have said that a new agreement is only viable if it enjoys the
allegiance of the different traditions on this island. Agreement cannot be
achieved without the unionists . . . my objective from day one has been to
achieve a total cessation of violence followed by dialogue.'
Earlier Mr Molyneaux had accused Mr Hume of 'selling his soul to the devil
and joining in a sordid attempt to blackmail the British, American and Irish
governments into giving the Armalite supremacy over the ballot box'.
The British and Irish governments have repeatedly stressed that a total
cessation of violence would be required before Sinn Fein could be admitted
to the all-party talks process.
The Irish government has offered early participation to Sinn Fein in a
'Forum of Peace and Reconciliation', while the British government has said
that a three-month 'quarantine' period would be required before it would
enter into negotiations with Sinn Fein.
London has refused to make clear whether secret contacts with republican
leaders have been resumed, however - although it has pledged that any secret
communications would be consistent with publicly stated policies.
Mr Hume and Mr Adams said in their joint statement that they believed the
'essential ingredients' of a peaceful approach to a political settlement
'may now be available'.
But they said a 'heavy onus' lay on the British government to respond
positively. This was echoed by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister,
who said the British government had a 'heavy responsibility' to bring about
a settlement which included 'an all-round demilitarisation of the situation
and the full participation of all parties, on equal terms, in talks leading
to a comprehensive political settlement'.
Cardinal Daly said it had long been the goal of many to take the gun out of
Irish politics. 'The attainment of that goal may now be very near.'

FT  30 AUG 94 / Spanish vow to banish drift-nets: Fishing disputes have
risen up the diplomatic agenda. FT reporters examine the conflicts worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A thin curtain of drizzle, mist and diesel fumes hung over the wharf at
Bermeo when dawn broke on Friday as the largest fishing fleet on the Basque
coast hoisted from its holds its diminishing catch of Bay of Biscay tuna,
the prized bonito.
The mood was sullen and aggressive. Posters and fly-sheets along the quay,
and lapel badges throughout the Basque Country, proclaimed why: 'Bolantarik
Ez'. No to the drift-nets - used by France's (often French Basque) fleet,
with which the Spanish Basques have been skirmishing at sea since the Biscay
bonito season opened in June.
'If this is not settled soon,' says Mr Jose Manuel Gabantxo, president of
the Bermeo Cofradia or boat-owners association, 'then that's it; we're going
to war. There could well be deaths and sinkings.' Mr Gabantxo forecasts
confrontation in October unless European Union fisheries minister agree to
ban drift-nets at their meeting in Brussels on September 28.
The latest chapter in this six-year old conflict began in mid-July when
trawlers from the Basque Country and Galicia surrounded a French vessel
using a 5.7km drift-net - more than twice the standard EU limit - and forced
it into a Spanish port.
Drift-nets, increasingly banned internationally, are mesh walls up to 20km
long which indiscriminately entrap undersea life in their path. They scoop
up the bonito effectively and cheaply as it migrates into the Biscay gulf in
the second half of each year.
But much of the drift-net catch is undersize, thereby depleting the spawning
stock which renews the shoals; an unquantifiable amount slips dead out of
the nets; and great hauls of other species, including dolphin and blue
shark, come up dead, to be thrown back into the sea.
'If we don't get rid of drift-nets now, the French will have killed off the
fish stocks within four to five years, and this town will die,' says Mr
Gabantxo. But before that, he vows, 'we will burn their lorries for as long
as it takes, and the Spanish authorities know it'.
Drift-nets allow the French to capture three times as much per boat as
Spain's northern fleet, while using half the crew. Spain, meanwhile, is by
far Europe's biggest consumer of fish. And its (mostly Basque) fish
processors provide the main market for the fish caught by drift-nets.
The bonito are caught by rod, using live bait, or by currican, a series of
trawled lines with lures. The fish caught tend to be mature, fresh and
whole, whereas drift-net tuna often lose their skin and turn bland because
of the long churn through the water.
'These are methods which require a lot of people and a lot of
professionalism,' says Mr Leo Belaustegui, a fisherman of 30 years
experience from Motrico, who points out that bonito crews habitually work
18-20 hours a day when at sea.
As a result, France had largely given up on Biscay tuna. But its southern
Atlantic fleet was revived by the drift-net and the access to traditional
Spanish fishing grounds conceded when Spain joined Europe in 1986. Five
years ago, the Spanish Basque fleet landed 23m tonnes of bonito against 14m
tonnes last year; France has in the same period climbed from virtually
nothing to 7m tonnes.
'They're more profitable, but for how long?' asks Mr Gabantxo, whose
Cofradia dates from the 14th century. 'They say we're out of date, but with
our traditional arts we have a future, which is better than exhausting the
stocks in five years. The sea has to have continuity.'
But Mr Belaustegui, recently appointed a full-time union official in the
port of Ondarroa, says: 'The problem is not what method you use, but how you
use it, and in particular how to create better working conditions while you
conserve fishing stocks.' If smaller, modified nets were used more
discriminately, he asks, 'maybe you can catch 20,000 kilos in 10 days
instead of 20. The question then is are you going to be forced to work
another 10 days for another 20,000?'
Support for the fishermen has come from across Spain: from ecologists, fish
markets, housewives groups, neighbourhood and consumer associations, trade
unions, and political parties. ETA, the armed Basque separatist group,
scenting a populist cause it can hijack, wrote to the Cofradias in April
offering to intervene. The Basque autonomous government, Madrid and Brussels
have all had to react.
The main result so far is that from Thursday, tuna caught by traditional
means will have a green aluminium logo clipped on the tail. This could be a
useful marketing ploy. But for the foreseeable future it will not fill the
gap in supply which sucks in imports from France.

Ten Taiwanese fishing vessels impounded by Indonesia, British fishing nets
slashed in the Bay of Biscay, Japanese fishermen shot at by a Russian
gunboat, and an Icelandic trawler and Norwegian coastguard vessel exchanging
fire - in the past month, fish have been prompting diplomatic incidents and
this shows no sign of ending soon.
Fears are growing that over-fishing is depleting even the most abundant
species, while governments have so far failed to agree on ways to halt
disputes. Canada, which has suffered some of the sharpest recent declines in
its fish stocks, told a United Nations conference this month in New York
that the oceans were 'in crisis'. However the conference, attended by more
than 90 governments, ended on Friday night without consensus on how to
conserve the seas' resources.
Nearly 30 separate conflicts have flared in the past year over rights to
fishing. The catalyst for the disputes is that the amounts of fish caught
appear to be declining in the past few years, following four decades of
explosive expansion.
According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, catches have risen
more than fourfold from 1950 to a peak of more than 90m tonnes in 1989. But
although precise figures are hard to establish, there are signs that
worldwide catch levels have since dropped by several per cent.
That halting of the industry's expansion, many fear, reflects the growing
scarcity of many types of fish. Environmental groups paint a vision of the
oceans in the next century as a desert. Western countries may see staples of
the kitchen cupboard such as tuna become expensive delicacies, they warn.
Asian and African governments are also becoming alarmed: fish accounts for
between a fifth and a third of the animal-derived protein in their
countries' diets, UN figures suggest, compared to only several per cent of
those in Western countries.
Scarcity of some species has forced fishermen and consumers to turn to new
types of fish. According to Greenpeace, while catch levels rose by a third
during the 1980s, almost all of that rise came from just five species:
Alaskan pollack, Chilean jack mackerel, Peruvian anchovies, and Japanese and
South American pilchards.
The huge increase in the catch of fish since the 1950s has been driven
partly by new technology. Fishing fleets home in on schools of fish using
sonar and radar. Winches and motors to haul drift nets, which can contain
more than 40,000 pounds of fish, have become more powerful, while nets have
become longer, with the inclusion of nylon fibres which reduce tearing. Nets
now frequently have mouths tens of metres wide, and can stretch for hundreds
of metres.
But environmentalists also attribute some of the increase in catch levels to
the changes in international fishing regulations more than a decade ago. The
1982 Law of the Sea pushed the boundaries of national waters outwards from
12 miles offshore to 200 miles.
The new rules, which brought more than three quarters of the world's fish
within national waters, was followed by a doubling of the size of the
world's fishing fleets, according to the UNFAO. Overcapacity - the total
number of vessels is estimated at some three million - has pushed many parts
of the industry into loss. According to the UNFAO, fishing fleets spent some
Dollars 92bn in 1989. Revenue figures are hard to establish with precision,
but UN figures and industry analysts suggest that they amounted only to some
Dollars 70bn.
Much of the shortfall is plugged by billions of pounds in government
subsidies. European Union countries alone spend nearly Dollars 600m a year,
according to UN estimates. Countries fear that if they surrender national
fishing rights they could lose tens of thousands of jobs. There is no
shortage of examples to fuel their anxiety. At least 20,000 people working
in the traditional cod fisheries of Newfoundland have been put out of work
since the Canadian government banned fishing in 1992 in an attempt to boost
depleted stocks. The government has since paid more than CDollars 1bn
(Pounds 400m) to support these communities.
The bitterest international rows in the past year have focused on
'migrating' fish such as tuna and swordfish which travel thousands of
kilometres through the high seas to feed and spawn. The past year's disputes
have also including rights to 'straddling' fish such as cod, herring and
some types of squid, which migrate between coastal and international waters.
Mr Satya Nandan, Fiji ambassador to the UN and chairman of the conference,
said last week that the required backing of two-thirds of the delegates
should be achievable as 'the overwhelming majority want a binding solution'.
Governments meet again in six months time. If the frequency of conflicts
stays at its present level, they will have every incentive to overcome those
differences.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Falklands rivalry tests quick tempers: Diplomats in Buenos
Aires must learn the mating and migratory habits of squid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina reacted furiously when the UK government last week announced a
seemingly innocuous decision to extend control over a 547 square mile patch
of ocean outside fishery control areas around the Falkland Islands.
The Argentinians declared they would not 'tolerate, accept and much less
consent' to the move.
The UK claimed poachers used this so-called 'Gap' area as a bolt-hole. Even
though the Gap lies within Falklands territorial waters, British officials
say they tried to discuss the issue with Buenos Aires all year. The
Argentinians kept postponing talks and the British decided to act
unilaterally.
President Carlos Menem angrily said he would send patrol ships into the Gap,
even though it lies outside Argentina's 200-mile territorial limit.
Although he played down the issue later in the week, the Falklands remain a
contentious and sensitive issue.
British diplomats posted in Buenos Aires must master the intricacies of
fishing data and develop a thorough understanding of the mating and
migratory habits of Illex squid, the islands' main resource.
The Illex travels through Argentine and Falkland waters, so both sides now
hold talks to share the catch.
They have learned to co-operate over protecting squid, to preserve what has
become a very big industry.
They swap catch data, establish quotas and keep each other posted about the
position of poachers.
Although Falklanders sneer at Argentina's inability to patrol its waters
effectively, the coast guard is notoriously aggressive. Trigger-happy
captains often pepper poachers with gunshot.
Last May, a Taiwanese ship sank after fleeing into Falkland waters when a
coast guard cutter fired on it.
Licence sales are a vital revenue source for the Falklands. This year's fish
licence sales of Pounds 24.1m make up nearly two-thirds of government
revenues. However, this is a far cry from the boom years of the 1980s. In
1989, the islands raked in a record Pounds 28.8m from fisheries. Next year,
the islands do not expect to sell more than Pounds 16.6m worth of licences.
The main reason for this is competition from Argentina which recently
launched a rival licence regime of its own, selling 60 licences this year,
priced to undercut the Falkland licences.
Furthermore, this year's Illex season was exceptionally bad. Ships caught
only 67,000 tonnes in Falklands waters against an historical average of
165,000 tonnes. Both Argentina and the islands closed the Illex season early
to preserve the stocks.
In addition, a fisheries agreement between Argentina and the European Union
has led to a big increase in catches.
The pact allows European vessels to enter Argentine waters once closed to
foreign ships in exchange for grants and privileged access to EU markets.
Brussels wants to find new fishing grounds outside European waters, mainly
to benefit Spain's big fishing fleet.
In 1993, 915,500 tonnes of fish were caught in Argentine waters, 126 per
cent more than five years earlier. Although these statistics are not
reliable, they do indicate a rising trend in fishing effort.
Argentina now exports more fish than beef. Fish export revenues last year
rose 18 per cent to Dollars 660m.
Hake accounted for nearly half Argentina's 1993 catch of 422,000 tonnes, an
increase of 14 per cent over 1992. Squid volumes rose 150 per cent to
194,000 tonnes.
But Mr Julio Torre, the editor of Redes, a fishing trade publication, warns:
'Catches are reaching their limits for several species, especially hake.
Blue whiting and squid are also approaching their limits. For the first
time, this region is reaching its limit.'
Although fishing has become a big earner for Argentina, its under-funded and
overstretched navy, air force and coast guard are unable to prevent
poaching.
It is anyone's guess how much fish is really caught in the South Atlantic.

Claims by environmentalists that New Zealand's valuable deep water fisheries
are being over-exploited has led to a row with the government and fishing
companies over the future of the NZDollars 1.2bn (Pounds 469.5m) export
industry.
Last week, environmental group leaders stormed out of a special conference
called by fisheries minister Mr Doug Kydd on the future of the industry. The
government is trying to put in place a new control mechanism which will give
the fishing companies more say in establishing sustainable quotas.
One of the most prominent issues in the region is the chronic over-fishing
of southern bluefin tuna. Until the late 1960s the fish were plentiful, but
then a global decline became apparent as Japanese companies increased their
presence in the region.
Today, after intensive negotiations, the fishery is managed under a
trilateral quota system between Australia, Japan and New Zealand. Japan pays
an access fee to Australia, allowing it to catch part of its quota in
Australian waters.
A big remaining worry is the rate and price at which the large Asian fishing
nations, notably Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, are harvesting tuna in the
20m square kilometres of ocean controlled by the Pacific island countries.
This area provides around 50 per cent of the Japanese tuna catch. The
Honiara-based Forum Fisheries Agency has calculated that access fees paid by
the big Asian countries under bilateral agreements were only ADollars 74m
(Pounds 35.2m) in 1993, while the market value of tuna taken from Pacific
waters was more than ADollars 2bn.
Given the importance of revenue from fisheries access to some of the island
economies - it accounts for 40 per cent of Kiribati's gross domestic product
for example - deals struck under bilateral arrangements look low. The
problem, moreover, may be compounded by significant under-reporting of
catches from these waters.
Accordingly, there is a push, encouraged by Australia, to get the South
Pacific nations to take a multilateral approach. A communique coming out the
South Pacific Forum, an annual meeting of island nation leaders, approved
the idea in principle this month, and fisheries ministers are due to meet
later this year.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Japanese run gauntlet of Russian bullets
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
When Russian coastguards fired on a Japanese fishing boat this month,
wounding a crew member in their move to impound the vessel, the incident
provided a reminder of a territorial issue unresolved for 49 years.
It also indicated recent problems tempting Japanese fishermen into waters
around the disputed Kurile islands, which they would otherwise avoid. Not
only has Japan's ocean catch been declining, but the stronger yen has made
seafood imports more competitive.
The ship belonged to the main fishing co-operative in Nemuro, north-eastern
Japan, from where the Kurile chain arcs towards Siberia. The four islands
nearest Japan were seized by the Soviet Union as the Pacific war ended.
Mr Yohei Kono and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the countries' foreign ministers, are
expected to discuss the Kuriles when they meet at the UN in late September.
A lower-level Japanese delegation is due next week in Sakhalin, from where
the disputed islands are administered, amid suggestions of a proposed
interim solution to the fishing problem.
This would involve setting up an ostensibly private sector fund, the stated
purpose of which would be environmental: to preserve marine resources in the
region. In reality, it would channel revenue to Russia while allowing the
boats of Nemuro and nearby ports to fish more widely in Kurile waters
without making themselves a target for Russian bullets.
The Sakhalin administration is, however, conducting parallel negotiations
with South Korea which, if Seoul bids higher, could accord its ships
preferential access.
Imports of marine products into Japan have risen 36.2 per cent by volume in
the last five years. Although these include frozen and processed foods, they
were equivalent last year to nearly half the 7.2m tonne Japanese sea catch,
which has fallen 30.8 per cent over the same period.
The Nemuro fishermen's association says the problem centres not so much on
de-stocking of its waters but on cheaper imports, as well as the banning of
certain types of net, and an almost one-third cut over five years in its
salmon and trout quota under one of the few existing agreements with Russia.
Its overall revenues have been halved from their early-1980s peak.
The Nemuro co-op, which runs some 3,000 mostly small vessels, has sought to
compensate by going for higher-value seafood such as crab. As the
crustaceans are less prevalent near its own shores, this means entering
shallower waters around the islands.
While Russia tolerates deep-water fishing within 200 miles of its coastline,
it rigorously enforces a 12-mile territorial zone and made clear this spring
it would clamp down on poaching there.
An infringement of this zone ensnared a Nemuro ship a fortnight ago. One of
its half-dozen crew, who now face trial, had an operation on the bullet
wound. The shooting, which followed a similar incident late last year,
triggered a Japanese embassy protest to the foreign ministry in Moscow.
So far this year Russia has detained 49 Japanese fishermen, up from 43 in
the whole of 1993. Jail terms of a year or more are common.

FT  30 AUG 94 / US phone groups in video victory
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US local telephone companies have won a court victory in their battle to be
allowed to offer video services to their customers.
The US appeals court in Washington has upheld a Federal Communications
Commission policy permitting companies to offer 'video dial tone' services
to their customers without paying a franchise fee to the local government,
as cable TV systems must do. Unlike a cable system, where customers can
receive only a fixed list of channels, a video dial tone system would allow
any programmer to send its signal over the telephone line.
Although not as futuristic as video on demand, where customers could dial up
and ask for a specific film, video dial tone is not yet an operating
service. But the FCC has approved several applications to be allowed to
offer the service and Bell Atlantic, the east coast regional telephone
company, is expected to have a service in operation soon.
Local phone companies would be allowed to offer video dial tone services
without obtaining a franchise in each community under some versions of the
telecommunications legislation under discussion in Congress, so long as they
were open to all programmers. But some industry officials doubt whether that
legislation will be completed before Congress breaks up for the election
campaign.
The legislation would, in any case, require phone companies to wait for a
year after enactment.
Franchise fees paid to local government by cable companies typically amount
to 5 per cent of revenue but can go higher. Telephone company officials said
the appeals court's decision would remove a significant potential deterrent
to investing in the new technology.
The court decision said that the FCC was right in its determination that a
telephone company providing video dial tone would not be engaged in the
'transmission of video programming' as defined in the Cable Act, but was
instead acting as a common carrier, rather like the Post Office.
Cable companies complained that the ruling would put them at a disadvantage,
since they not only have to pay a franchise fee but also have to comply with
regulatory requirements under the Cable Act.

Sir Julius Chan, Papua New Guinea's deputy prime minister, said yesterday
that he was joining forces with opposition politicians in a challenge to Mr
Paias Wingti's grip on the prime minister's job, writes Nikki Tait in
Sydney.
PNG's notoriously volatile political scene erupted after last week's ruling
by the Supreme Court that an overnight resignation and re-election maneouvre
by Mr Wingti last year was invalid, and that he had not been legitimately
reinstalled in the prime minister's post. Parliament, therefore, is required
to vote for a new prime minister today.
Mr Wingti has played down the furore, saying he expects his governing
coalition to re-elect him. But alliances shift fast in PNG, and the outcome
looks highly unpredictable after Sir Julius' defection.

Slower population growth will not be enough to solve the problem of poverty
in developing nations, the World Bank says in a report prepared for next
week's United Nations population conference in Cairo, writes George Graham
in Washington.
Although slowing down the rate of population growth should still be a high
priority for developing countries, the report says, a broader programme
involving investment in education, health and nutrition will be needed to
address poverty.
'We need to combine reproductive health and family planning with better
infant and child health, education of girls and overall improvement in the
status of women,' said Mr Armeane Choksi, the bank's vice-president for
human resource development and operations policy. The bank expects world
population to grow over the next 35 years to around 8.5bn, with almost 90
per cent of the rise occurring in developing countries.

<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia, one of the world's most strictly Islamic states, has decided
not to send a delegation to next week's United Nations Conference on
Population and Development in a move sure to stoke intensifying conservative
Moslem opposition to the Cairo meeting.
A UN spokesman in Cairo confirmed that Saudi Arabia had said it would not
attend, but said Riyadh had not explained why.
Around 20,000 delegates from up to 180 countries are due to attend the
event, which opens next Monday and is billed as an attempt to formulate a
sweeping but consensual world approach to the related issues of population
growth and development. Conference organisers say only Monaco,
Liechtenstein, Eritrea and the small Pacific Island of Nauru had previously
stated they would not participate.
Saudi officials were not available to comment on the decision. However, the
kingdom - whose ruler King Fahd titles himself the 'custodian of the two
holy mosques' of Mecca and Medina - is deeply sensitive both to its role in
the Moslem world and also to powerful conservative Islamic opinion within
the Gulf state.
As a measure of the latter, Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Baz, the kingdom's senior
religious figure, yesterday called on Saudi Arabia to boycott the meeting.
He said a meeting today of the kingdom's most authoritative religious
committee would 'denounce' the Cairo conference as 'incompatible with the
Moslem religion'.
Sheikh bin Baz's comments and Saudi Arabia's decision will further encourage
conservative Islamic critics of the conference, who have grown increasingly
vocal in recent weeks, notably in the host country itself.
Iranian officials have also cast the forthcoming conference in a religious
light, condemning the draft UN text for promoting 'sexual liberty' and
committing Iranian delegates to making the final document compatible with
Islamic law.
Extremist Islamic groups in Egypt joined the fray at the weekend, warning
that all foreign visitors to the conference were 'putting themselves in
dangers' way' by attending what they described as the 'licentiousness
conference'.
Security at hotels, tourist and other sensitive sites has been increased
noticeably in the past few days to safeguard against this threat. The
government is forced to take it with the utmost seriousness despite its
recent successes in quelling militant attacks.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Southern Africa harnesses SADC as engine for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki yesterday handed over the
country's new flag to Southern Africa Development Conference chairman Sir
Ketumile Masire in Gaberone, Botswana, in a gesture that marked the start of
a new era for the entire region.
The formal accession of South Africa to the now 11-member SADC means that
the organisation, originally devoted to reducing its members' links to their
southern neighbour, is now regarded as the vehicle with the best chance of
driving the region towards growth. The shift follows years during which SADC
has been politically opposed to, but dependent on, South Africa.
This spirit of co-operation between South Africa and SADC was by no means
guaranteed. While most of the world rejoiced at the success of South
Africa's elections earlier this year, the broader southern African community
viewed the transition to democracy with mixed feelings.
Although justifiably proud at their contribution to the overthrow of
apartheid, many in the region feared that the African National Congress,
once in power, might forget its debts, while South Africa's re-emergence on
the global stage would divert much-needed aid and investment from its poorer
neighbours.
But, despite such concerns, the new South African government has placed
regional co-operation at the forefront of its emerging foreign policy. In
parliament two weeks ago, Mr Alfred Nzo, foreign minister, made clear that
promoting good relations with other southern African states would be a
priority.
'South Africa will actively encourage the movement to create a new form of
political and economic interaction in southern Africa,' he said, while
stressing his support for a new regional security mechanism that would
complement SADC's economic activities.
The new approach is a marked contrast to South Africa's previous policies.
As the unquestioned regional superpower under former President PW Botha, the
South African regime unabashedly used its economic and military might to
prevent its black-run neighbours from successfully uniting in opposition to
South Africa or helping to provide aid to the liberation movement.
By helping to foment civil wars in Angola and Mozambique and showing little
hesitation in launching cross-border military strikes to try to destroy ANC
bases in other countries, South Africa garnered a well-deserved reputation
as regional bully. It was in response to such activities that South Africa's
neighbours formed SADC's precursor, the Southern African Development
Co-ordination Conference (SADCC), in 1980.
Despite its admirable aims, however, SADCC proved unable to meet its
objective of reducing its members' trade with South Africa. Not only did
nearly all its members actually expand their economic relationship with
South Africa over the past decade; few of the organisation's initiatives to
improve regional infrastructure yielded any fruit.
Now, however, the situation has changed drastically. Recognising the wider
impact of political change in South Africa, the body renamed itself SADC in
1992, changing its primary focus from opposition to South Africa to economic
development. And, with South Africa now a fully integrated member, the
organisation is optimistic that it will finally be able to succeed in its
goals.
Yesterday's SADC summit was preceded by a two-day meeting of regional trade
ministers and it is through trade that the main thrust of economic
development is planned. Recognising the need to establish competitive,
export-oriented industries, SADC intends to devote itself to the
establishment of a regional trade treaty which will ultimately allow the
free movement of goods, services and capital across all member states.
However, most of the region's economies maintain complex trade and tariff
regulations which will take a long time to dismantle. In addition, the
relative size of South Africa - it contributes over 75 per cent to a
regional GDP of around Dollars 125bn (Pounds 80.6bn) - makes other countries
nervous of being flooded with cheaper South African goods should all
restrictions be removed.
Thus many observers feel that any short-term benefits flowing from a
restructured SADC are likely to be political rather than economic. 'I can't
see SADC successfully turning itself into a free trade area in the immediate
future, but there is significant potential for the grouping, under South
African leadership, to play the role of regional peacemaker,' says Mr Chris
Landsberg, a foreign policy specialist at Johannesburg's Centre for Policy
Studies.
Acknowledging this possibility, the Frontline States organisation (a
political grouping comprising all SADC members except Malawi, Lesotho and
Swaziland and also originally designed to thwart South Africa) has decided
to restructure itself into the political and security wing of SADC. It to
play the role of mediator in regional conflicts.
The scope for such activities has been demonstrated over the past week as
SADC members have taken a stand to try to restore democracy to Lesotho after
its king illegally dismissed the elected government. South African President
Nelson Mandela has also played a role in helping to resolve remaining
disagreements ahead of the planned Mozambican elections.
Whether any of these initiatives, political or economic, prove successful
remains to be seen. However the fact remains that, for the first time since
most of SADC's members achieved independence, there is hope that, with South
Africa at the forefront, the region might at last be able to reverse its
economic decline.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Israel breaks pattern with 1.5% interest rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's central bank yesterday departed from its longstanding policy of
minor interest-rate rises by jacking up rates by as much as 1.5 percentage
points to 14 per cent, in an effort to halt a surge in inflation.
The Bank of Israel move, which takes effect on Thursday, was immediately
matched by a 1.5 percentage points increase in prime rates at Israel's
commercial banks.
The central bank had previously sought to slow price rises with a series of
seven minor interest rate increases in the past nine months, to no avail.
Inflation, which the government had predicted would settle at around 8 per
cent for 1994, is now running above 14 per cent. The Bank of Israel's
governor, Prof Ya'acov Frenkel, described yesterday's move as 'a pre-emptive
strike' to ensure it did not spiral out of control. 'Our goal is to return
inflation to single figures,' he said, 'as in the industrialised world.'
Key factors in the inflation surge include: the continuing rise in house
prices - soaring by 20 per cent in some areas despite government efforts to
free more land for building; a number of relatively high public sector wage
settlements; and rising prices in the protected local fruit and vegetable
markets.
Prof Frenkel indicated yesterday that he would have liked to order a sharp
interest rate rise some months ago, but had refrained because of concerns
that Israel's economic growth would be harmed and unemployment rates lifted.
Now, though, he said, there was a national consensus that the fight against
inflation should be made a priority.
Indeed, apart from inflation - which rings particular alarm bells in Israel
given the triple figure inflation blight of a decade ago - the economy is
performing impressively.
Annual growth is running at more than 6 per cent, and jobless totals have
been coming down: figures released last week by the Central Bureau of
Statistics showed unemployment down to 7.8 per cent in the second quarter of
the year, from 8.2 per cent in the January-March quarter.
In a reflection of that robust overall economic performance, the Tel Aviv
stock market yesterday shrugged off the interest rate news, its general
share index closing the day up 3.26 per cent at 179.94. Similarly, last week
the market dipped only briefly following the government's announcement that
it would be introducing a capital gains tax at the exchange, taking 10 per
cent of real profits.
'The one-two punch of a new tax and a large interest rate hike could,
ordinarily, have been expected to bring the market down,' said one analyst.
'But the sense is that the market is pleased to see the government taking
the battle against inflation seriously.'

FT  30 AUG 94 / Inflation forces hand of Chinese leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chinese leaders may not have panicked over recent bad economic news but they
have certainly reacted vigorously to indications that a 12-month-old
programme aimed at curbing an overheating economy was faltering.
Since last week they have re-asserted price controls and announced that
failing state-owned enterprises would be bailed out. Less emphasis is being
placed in government statements on reform than on stabilising an economy
which is proving resistant to attempts to rein it in.
The question for western economists and for business is whether a price
freeze accompanied by 'welfare' payments to state industry marks a backing
away from economic liberalisation, or whether the authorities are simply
putting on the brakes.
Chinese economists scoff at western concerns about possible backsliding in
reform, saying the government has been forced into more decisive measures by
a resurgence of inflation and by signs that an increasing number of
cash-starved state industries are on the verge of collapse.
Professor Dong Fureng, one of China's most senior economists in his role as
director of the Institute of Economics at the Academy of Social Sciences,
said last night that the government was obliged to resort to a more
interventionist approach to slow an economy which was still growing too
fast. The present rate of economic growth was 'unsustainable', he said, and
resources such as power supplies and transportation continued to be
overstretched. This in turn was exacerbating inflation. 'If inflation goes
too high, it will cause chaos,' Prof Dong added.
This is the same message that Mr Li Peng, the Chinese premier, delivered at
the weekend when announcing that for the rest of this year countering
inflation would be the government's leading priority. Mr Li raised the
spectre of social unrest to justify sterner measures.
Official alarm about inflation was heightened by the July urban retail
figures which showed that prices had jumped 24.2 per cent for the 12 months,
reversing a moderating trend. The bad result followed release of capital
spending figures which revealed an astonishing leap of 73 per cent in July
in fixed asset investment compared with the same period last year.
Western economists in Beijing say the government has recognised that the
macro-control measures announced in July 1993, including a credit squeeze,
had not been sufficient to calm an economy which grew by 13 per cent or more
in the past two years. But they worry that deepening alarm about inflation
may cause the authorities to repeat mistakes of the past such as the severe
retrenchment of 1988 which came in response to price rises of 20 per cent
and more.
The abrupt slowdown in economic activity in 1988-89 is cited as a main
reason for the Tiananmen Square disturbances. Chinese leaders will want to
avoid repeating the same mistake but economists worry that avoiding a bumpy
as opposed to a soft landing (retrenchment without too much pain) may be
easier said than done.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Brown's delegation signs China deals
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US trade mission to China, headed by Mr Ron Brown, the Commerce Secretary,
signed contracts yesterday for almost Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m) in power,
telecommunications and computer equipment in what US officials say will be
part of Dollars 3bn in new deals announced this week.
Mr Brown, who has led similar trade campaigns in Latin America and Africa,
said his delegation was vying for more than Dollars 25bn in infrastructure,
aviation, auto-assembly and airport construction projects in China over the
next few years. His entourage includes 24 executives of US companies.
'With almost a quarter of a trillion (thousand billion) dollars in
infrastructure projects in the pipeline, we intend to compete in this market
and we intend to win,' Mr Brown said in a breakfast speech to the American
Chamber of Commerce in Beijing.
During the second day of his week-long visit to China and Hong Kong, Mr
Brown raised trade and economic issues with prime minister Li Peng, setting
the tone for future relations, a US official said. In a briefing for
reporters, the official pledged that the US would become 'increasingly
aggressive' in matching concessionary financing to compete with Germany,
France and Japan for the booming Chinese market.
The delegation includes officials from the US Export-Import Bank, senior
trade officials and the US executive director from the Asian Development
Bank. Mr Brown had suggested that the mission would herald a 'new era in
US-China relations'.
Under a contract valued at Dollars 140m and financed primarily with
government loans, Westinghouse Corporation will provide two 350-megawatts
steam-turbine generators and related equipment for the a power plant in
Jiangsu province, in eastern China.
Pitney Bowes signed a Dollars 20m agreement to sell equipment for
modernising and automating China's network of 55,000 post offices. Pitney
Bowes equipment will be distributed by its Chinese partner Zhongyu, a postal
code and information company, established under the government's postal
system. In a third contract International Business Machines agreed to sell
Dollars 20m in software and hardware for automated teller machines,
electronic data information and global information infrastructure.

<TEXT>
South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers yesterday formally agreed on an
average 9.75 per cent wage settlement for 1994-95 on behalf of 200,000 of
its members , writes Mark Suzman.
The agreement forestalls the possibility of a strike in the industry, the
country's largest. It has been widely praised by government and business
figures as an encouraging sign for renewed economic co-operation with big
business in the light of the high-profile strike by 25,000 workers in the
motor industry, which is now in its fourth week.
The final pay settlements - which wll lead to rises of between 8 and 8.75
per cent in wages for skilled gold miners, 8 to 10 per cent for unskilled
gold workers and 9.75 and 13 per cent for coal miners - are above the
inflation rate, currently at 7.5 per cent. But they are well below the NUM's
original demands for 12-15 per cent increases.
Mr Juri Geldenhuys, president of the Chamber of Mines, said the agreement
was testament to both sides' willingness to compromise.

The Malaysian government has made further moves against an Islamic sect it
accuses of trying to destabilise the country. According to government edicts
published at the weekend, anyone actively involved with Al Arqam, a sect
which claims 100,000 followers in Malaysia and many more in surrounding
countries, is liable to arrest, flogging and imprisonment. Earlier this
month, Malaysia's national Fatwa council, the body that rules on Islamic
orthodoxy, said Al Arqam teachings were deviationist. More than 30 of the
sect's followers were arrested over the weekend. Malaysian non-government
organisations and the country's bar council have expressed concern that the
government's moves violate human rights. Brokers said that a drop of more
than 2 per cent on the Kuala Lumpur stock market on Friday was due to
general nervousness about the government's actions against Al Arqam. The
market was stable yesterday in lacklustre trading.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian current account deficit widened to a seasonally adjusted
ADollars 1.84bn (Pounds 887m) in July, the largest monthly deficit since
March 1993 and at the upper end of market expectations. The revised deficit
for June was ADollars 1.52bn. The figure caused mild concern in financial
markets, where the Australian dollar closed weaker against the US currency.
There have been persistent worries that the country's strong economic
recovery, which has been driven by domestic demand, coupled with the very
slow upturn in business investment, could pose problems on the balance of
payments front. If investment starts to surge all at once, it is argued,
imports of plant and equipment will be sucked in, giving rise to mounting
trade deficits. In addition, some analysts are concerned that the current
drought, affecting parts of Queensland and much of New South Wales, will
depress agricultural exports, compounding this problem. However, Mr Paul
Keating, the prime minister, said yesterday that he believed structural
changes which had made the economy more competitive should prevent a big
current account problem.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine's president Leonid Kuchma this week moved again to fight crime, with
a decree consolidating the country's disparate security services. With crime
heading the domestic political agenda, his latest step addresses public
concern over what he calls the 'mafiaisation of Ukraine', but carries a
potentially high cost in the centralisation of police powers. After
authorising police to detain suspects for 30 days without charge last month,
Mr Kuchma at the weekend said the general prosecutor, the interior ministry
and the security service, heir to the KGB, were to join forces on 'the most
difficult cases of crimes in financial and banking services, trade and those
committed by public servants'. The move aims to stem the spread of organised
crime, but observers are worried that, by centralising investigative efforts
in a manner reminiscent of the Soviet period, corruption could be entrenched
at high levels, including within agencies charged with fighting it.

Albanian prosecutors yesterday demanded jail terms of between seven and nine
years for five ethnic Greeks accused of spying for Athens. If they are
convicted, it could put Albania on a collision course with Athens, which has
already deported thousands of illegal Albanian immigrants from Greece in
retaliation for what it calls a political trial. The five accused, all
members of the ethnic Greek organisation Omonia, based in southern Albania,
were arrested in April following a raid on a military camp close to the
Greek border. Tirana blamed Greece for the raid but Athens denied the
charge. The prosecutor said the men were found in possession of illegal
weapons with the intention of arming the Greek minority 'at a certain time
according to orders'. He alleged: 'They have all committed the crime of
serving the Greek secret service.' The trial has rekindled deep-seated
tensions between Albania and Greece, which accuses Tirana of mistreating its
Greek minority, estimated by Athens at 300,000 and by Tirana at 60,000.

The US Justice Department is investigating whether a worldwide agreement
last January to cut production of aluminium may have led to violations of
anti-trust law by the aluminium industry. The US Aluminum Association said
it had received formal notice of an investigation into possible anti-trust
violations stemming from the agreement to restrict production of primary
aluminium. US aluminium producers have got similar notices.
Ironically, the US government was one of the parties to the January
agreement, which also involved Russia, the European Union, Canada, Norway
and Australia, and was one of the keenest advocates of production
restrictions to deal with a glut of aluminium on the world market. The
agreement came in response to a flood of exports of primary aluminium from
Russia, which had previously used most of its output for domestic military
purposes. At the January meeting Russia agreed to cut production by 500,000
tonnes, or about 15 per cent, for two years, while western producers were
expected to make voluntary cuts totalling around 1m tonnes.

<TEXT>
Polish police yesterday closed down six unlicensed television stations
belonging to a chain controlled by Mr Nicola Grauso, a media owner from
Sardinia. The crackdown on the stations in six cities including Warsaw -
which had been broadcasting on frequencies reserved for the military - came
after Mr Grauso failed to get either a national or regional broadcast
licence in allocations earlier this year.
The Polonia 1 network of 12 regional TV stations had continued to broadcast
a popular diet of soap operas and films in defiance of broadcast legislation
passed last year. A justice ministry official said police closed those
stations broadcasting on frequencies reserved for the military, but stressed
that the others would also be shut down shortly. 'Police officers and
prosecutors visited the illegal stations, ordering that they be closed. . .
and in cases of no compliance they turned the equipment off themselves,' the
official said.
Mr Grauso also owns the Zycie Warszawy daily newspaper and says he has
invested in excess of Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m) in Poland. The network claims
a 30 per cent share of the audience and is favoured by President Lech
Walesa, who sees it as a potential ally in his second-term presidential
campaign due late next year. The president has made no secret of his
opposition to Polsat, the Polish-owned station which has been granted the
country's only national commercial TV licence. This decision is being
contested in the courts by rivals seeking a licence.

<TEXT>
Shortly after the Velvet Revolution of 1989 that ousted communism in the
former Czechoslovakia there was a crisis in Bratislava's supermarkets. They
ran out of yoghurt.
The distribution system, geared to a centrally planned economy, collapsed
and it suddenly became impossible to get domestic products. 'We have very
good yoghurt in Slovakia,' notes Mr Peter Kresanek, mayor of Bratislava.
'But three years ago you couldn't buy Slovak yoghurt, only Austrian.'
Happily, local producers soon got the hang of the market economy and Slovak
yoghurt is now on display again. Ironically, it is now a big hit with the
thousands of Austrian shoppers who stream across the border from Vienna,
just 65km to the west, every weekend to take advantage of the city's lower
prices. With the average Austrian industrial wage of Dollars 3,200 against
Slovakia's Dollars 200 a month, the attractions are obvious.
The crowds of Austrian shoppers testify not just to the geographical
closeness of the two cities, but also to a new business relationship that
has developed since the revolution. It is a two-way relationship. Since
border restrictions were eased thousands of Bratislavans have begun to
travel to the Austrian capital daily to work on construction sites, as
cleaners, or in shops and restaurants.
As a result unemployment in Bratislava, at less than 5 per cent, is far
lower than the Slovak average of nearly 15 per cent, and higher Austrian
wages give Bratislavans more spending power at home.
'The relationship is very good, both on the personal and the economic
level,' Mr Kresanek says. For many Bratislavans the restored links are
symbolised by the close personal and working ties between Mr Kresanek and
his Viennese counterpart, Mr Helmut Zilk.
At the height of the Velvet Revolution Mr Zilk made an unexpected appearance
at an anti-government rally in Bratislava to tell 100,000 cheering Slovaks
that the people of Vienna stood by them in their struggle. The gesture,
remembered with affection by many Bratislavans, is credited with reawakening
links between the two cities. Mr Zilk became an honorary citizen of the
Slovak capital shortly afterwards, and the two men meet regularly.
Austria is by far the biggest foreign investor in Slovakia, accounting for
over a quarter of all foreign investment in the country at the end of June.
About half the total Austrian investment of Dollars 275m (Pounds 177m) in
Slovakia is in Bratislava. Slovak exports to Austria last year were worth
over Dollars 300m, and grew to nearly Dollars 200m in the first half of
1994.
Ambitious plans are on the drawing board to improve road and rail links,
upgrade services on the Danube for tourism and cargo and even revive a
passenger tram line that ran between the two cities from 1914 to 1946,
although the economic cost of the latter is believed to be prohibitive.
The relationship, not surprisingly, is becoming increasingly competitive.
Business people in Bratislava trumpet the city's cost advantages and
well-educated workforce, but admit its drawbacks. 'Bratislava can beat
Vienna on cost, but not on infrastructure,' says Mr L'ubomir Kardos, a
Bratislava businessman who says he wants to expand his stationery business
into Vienna.
Some successes have been noted. Organisers of the annual Bratislava Trade
Fair claim to have won exhibitors away from the Vienna fair by offering
display space at a fifth of the cost. With Vienna airport roughly half way
between the two cities, the Slovaks are counting on their lower costs to
lure more business east.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Germany warned by OECD on privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany was yesterday warned by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) that it needed to privatise more quickly and sweep
aside subsidies which are costing around DM135bn (Pounds 55.7bn) a year,
writes Michael Lindemann. With inflation likely to fall to less than 2 per
cent by the middle of 1995, the OECD annual report also suggested there was
further scope for the Bundesbank to cut interest rates. 'Given the expected
disinflationary pressures and weak demand there is still a certain amount of
room for further interest rate cuts in order to shore up the recovery,' the
report said.
The Bundesbank should also provide a more comprehensive explanation of its
reliance on the broad money supply (M3) as a precursor of inflationary
pressures to avoid any 'erosion of confidence'. Uncharacteristically strong
language was also used to criticise the centralised wage bargaining system,
which effectively sets a minimum wage and keeps unemployment unnecessarily
high, and the government was urged to promote greater wage and working time
flexibility in the public sector. Other indicators suggested that the
economy's revival was making good progress and that only a worldwide rise in
interest rates and the continued strength of the D-Mark, already a thorny
subject with industry, could jeopardise the German recovery.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen yesterday called a general election to
the Folketing for September 21, breaking with tradition by choosing a
Wednesday rather than a Tuesday for the vote.
Mr Rasmussen, leader of the Social Democratic party, made his announcement
despite a Gallup poll yesterday that showed two of the four parties in his
centre-left majority coalition face elimination from the Folketing.
'A Gallup poll is not the same as an election,' he said.
He hoped to be able to continue in office at the head of the present
government, which besides his own party includes the Radical Liberals, the
Centre Democrats and the Christian People's Party.
The latter two parties risk failing to qualify for Folketing seats by
attracting less than 2 per cent of the vote.
If the election result reflects the opinion polls, the next parliament will
be sharply divided into left and right as a result of the weakening small
centre parties.
Mr Rasmussen, however, has a good chance that he can stay at the head of a
minority government of Social Democrats and Radicals, but this government
would have to rely on the support of the left-wing Socialist People's party.
Together, these three parties scored 52 per cent in yesterday's Gallup, with
the Social Democrats at 33.5 per cent compared with 37.4 per cent in the
1991 election, the Radicals at 4.8 per cent compared with 3.5 per cent and
the Socialist People's party moving ahead to 11.1 per cent from 8.3 per
cent.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, leader of the Liberal party and the leading
candidate to become prime minister in a non-Socialist coalition, welcomed
the Gallup. 'People can see the risk they run of getting a red cabinet,' he
said.
The Liberals are heading for a strong result, with Gallup showing them at
23.1 per cent against 15.8 per cent in 1991.
The Liberal party and the Conservative party, led by Mr Hans Engell, the
former minister of justice, hope to form a coalition on the basis of support
from the right-wing populist Progress party.

FT  30 AUG 94 / SPD challenges Kohl with triumvirate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), trailing in opinion
polls, tried to recover lost momentum yesterday by presenting a new
triumvirate which it hopes will derail Chancellor Helmut Kohl's bid for a
fourth term in elections on October 16.
Mr Gerhard Schroder, the high profile state premier of Lower Saxony and a
bitter rival of Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD leader, has been lured back
into the party's 'war cabinet' with the prospect of taking over an enlarged
Economics Ministry, including the present Traffic Ministry.
There are high hopes that Mr Schroder's aggressive campaigning style,
matched with the charisma of Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the Saarland state premier
and the party's deputy leader, will counteract Mr Scharping's lacklustre
style.
At a news conference in Bonn to present a new 16-member SPD line-up, the
genial Mr Schroder promptly found himself fielding almost as many questions
as the party leader, a measure of the hopes riding on his invitation to join
the SPD's inner sanctum.
The SPD's three-man line-up contrasts sharply with the Christian Democratic
Union, which has focused its entire campaign around Mr Kohl, presenting him
as sole guarantor of affluence and stability.
A poll of 2,000 people in the weekly Bild am Sonntag newspaper suggested
that Mr Schroder would score 44 per cent against 34 per cent for Mr Kohl.
The same poll showed Mr Scharping managing only 30 per cent against 41 per
cent for the present chancellor.
The styles of the two men, rivals during last year's contest for the SPD
leadership and often at loggerheads over campaign strategy in recent months,
differed markedly at the press conference.
Mr Schroder was relaxed and confident, relishing the cut and thrust with
over 100 assembled journalists, while Mr Scharping shuffled in his seat and
seemed uneasy.
The SPD line-up has been billed as a shadow cabinet but is likely to see
adjustments if the SPD does enter government after the October elections.
Some recent opinion polls suggest the SPD may be obliged to form a coalition
with the Greens, who are predicted to win about 8 per cent of votes. The SPD
might have to cede two or three ministries to the Greens.
Other reports speculate that an alliance with the Greens might not be enough
to secure a majority and that the Free Democratic party, junior partner in
the present government, could be drawn into a three-party coalition.
Mr Lafontaine, the SPD's unsuccessful candidate for chancellor in the 1990
elections, would become finance minister in an SPD-led government.
Mr Gunter Verheugen, SPD general secretary, would become foreign minister,
while Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, leader of the parliamentary party, would become
defence minister.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Belgrade ignores Bosnian Serb vote

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
With diplomatic efforts under way to broker an agreement on supervision of
Serbia's borders with Bosnia, Serbian leaders yesterday pointedly ignored
the defiant vote of their one-time Bosnian proteges who decided in a weekend
referendum to reject a UN-backed partition of Bosnia.
After a marathon meeting lasting until early yesterday morning with
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign
minister, continued a diplomatic tour of former Yugoslavia, and met leaders
of the Moslem-led Bosnian government.
The Belgrade meeting remained shrouded in secrecy yesterday but diplomats
believe Mr Milosevic was trying to see what concessions he could wring from
Russia and the West in exchange for stationing monitors on the frontier with
Bosnia. Serbia imposed economic sanctions on the Bosnian Serbs earlier this
month for their refusal to endorse a peace plan.
They believe the international community is keen to give the impression that
Mr Milosevic is not under international pressure to put monitors on the
border. This would ease nationalists' charges about betraying their kith and
kin in Bosnia.
The contact group - Russia, the US, Germany, France and the UK - is hoping
that Mr Milosevic will tighten the noose round the Bosnian Serbs. But
reports that he had proposed monitors on Bosnia's frontiers with Croatia too
were dismissed as a 'non-starter'.
The US has threatened to lift its embargo on arms sales to the warring
parties in Bosnia if Bosnian Serbs continue to block the peace plan, but the
Bosnian Moslem government has been bolstering its army with weapons smuggled
through Croatia.
Mr Milosevic's resolve to punish Bosnian Serb leaders may harden after
referendum results from Serb areas in Bosnia yesterday, which showed that
the partition maps proposed by the contact group had been overwhelmingly
rejected.
The results of the poll - dismissed as irrelevant by peace mediators - came
as no surprise. While diplomats admit that the referendum may further
entrench the Bosnian Serb leadership, they say it will have little impact on
the peace process.
More than 90 per cent of Bosnian Serb voters rejected the maps which divide
the war-torn country roughly in half, said Mr Petko Cancar, head of the
referendum commission.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Poland expects debt deal to boost investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Poland expects to see private investment inflows worth 'well over Dollars
1bn (Pounds 600m) a year' in the wake of its commercial debt reduction
agreement due to be completed this month, Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, the country's
deputy premier and finance minister said yesterday.
Mr Kolodko was speaking after Poland had received the final assents needed
from 600 holders of the country's Dollars 14bn of commercial debt for the
agreement to go ahead. 'Last Friday the last major holder agreed to the
buy-back component,' Mr Kolodko said. This meant the debt reduction would
amount to 49.5 per cent of the commercial debt stock.
Overall at the end of April Poland's net foreign debt stood at Dollars 44bn.
The country's debt to western governments grouped in the Paris Club was cut
by 50 per cent in a 1991 agreement.
'We have had an abnormal external credit situation since 1980 when the debt
crisis first hit us and now we are returning to normal financial relations,'
Mr Kolodko said.
The agreement, which is due to be signed in Warsaw on September 14, means
that the country's Dollars 14bn commercial debt will be cut by Dollars 6.6bn
with another Dollars 2.4bn worth being bought back by the Poles at a rate of
41 cents to the dollar. The rest of the debt will be exchanged into 30-year
par and discount bonds worth a total of Dollars 4.6bn.
The bonds are to be secured against the sum of around Dollars 900m deposited
in the US Federal Reserve in US treasury bonds which will be used to redeem
the Polish government paper once it falls due in October 2024.
The Dollars 1.9bn initial cost of the agreement is to be financed by Dollars
1.3bn worth of loans from the IMF and the World Bank with the balance coming
from the NBP, the Polish central bank's reserves. Interest payments next
year will cost Dollars 368m while the agreement, which is more generous to
the Poles than originally thought because of the high buy-back component,
will cost an average of Dollars 450m annually in interest payments over the
next 30 years.
As late as mid-July the Poles only had the assent of 92 per cent of holders
of the debt, while 95 per cent was needed for the key buy-back component to
be implemented. One major creditor, believed to be the Dart family of
Florida in the USA, who holds Dollars 600m or 7 per cent of the debt, was
then refusing to accept the reduction deal.
'We explained to them that they had no option but to join the agreement and
they assented last Friday without any additional conditions,' Mr Krzysztof
Krowacki, the Polish debt negotiator said yesterday, without confirming the
identity of the creditor.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Bangemann in plea for private telecom funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The private sector - not the public sector  - should take the lead in
funding the telecommunications networks of the future, Mr Martin Bangemann,
EU industry commissioner, said yesterday.
In a speech to the 13th World Computer Congress in Hamburg, Mr Bangemann
said there was no need for extra public sector funding; but he warned that
private companies and consortia had to be given the chance to compete on an
equal footing.
This meant breaking up long distance telephone monoplies, and linking
existing networks as fast as possible so as to achieve the lower tariffs
vital for creating the new information society.
'The only way to get lower tariffs is through competition,' he told
delegates.
Mr Bangemann's crusading tone comes amid presssure from Brussels to
liberalise the supply of telecommunications infrastructure across the
European Union, despite continued opposition from national telecoms
operators fighting the loss of their monopolies.
Mobile, satellite and other business-related services are already open to
competition. EU governments have also agreed to set a target date of 1998
for the opening of competition in basic 'voice services' which account for
most of the revenue of telcoms operators.
But the question of competing infrastructure, as permitted in the UK, has
been left for decision in 1995 with no prior commitment to liberalise. Mr
Bangemann's speech yesterday suggests further pressure from the Commission
to bring forward the decision and secure a commitment to infrastructure
competition from member states.
The speech comes as the European Commission is putting final touches to a
new document on EU industrial policy in the 1990s. The document is likely to
be measured against the strategy for industrial policy set out by Mr
Bangemann in 1990. The 1990 paper abandoned 'vertical' policies in favour of
channelling aid to particular sectors. Instead, it promoted 'horizontal'
spending on training, infrastructure and research - the idea being to
bolster competitiveness and benefit the whole European economy rather than
championing individual industries.
In his speech, Mr Bangemann said industrial policy should not only cover the
technological industries of tomorrow. New technologies could - and should -
be adapted to tackle today's problems.
He cited the use of computerised traffic management systems which could
regulate city traffic and introduce fairer tariffs through 'road pricing';
introduction of modern diagnostic equipment which could offer early warning
systems registering air pollution and allergy levels; and use of information
networks such as 'telemedicine' for cheaper, more efficient health care.
Mr Bangemann called for an extension of telecom networks to pave the way for
multi-media services such as teleshopping, telebanking and teleworking. 'We
don't need elegance, we need practical solutions,' he said.

after taxes also rose 0.5 per cent. The increases follow a rise of 0.1 per
cent in June income and disposable income. Personal consumption expenditures
(PCE) increased by 0.2 per cent in July, coming after a revised 0.5 per cent
rise the previous month. The July figures for income and spending were
generally in line with analysts' forecasts and show the economy is growing
at a moderate pace. The savings rate, which represents savings as a
percentage of disposable income, rose to 4.1 per cent in July from 3.7 per
cent in June. Wages and salaries, a component of income closely watched by
the markets for signs of inflationary pressure, also rose 0.5 per cent. The
PCE deflator index, an inflation measure, rose to 129.7 in July from 129.2
in June.

FT  30 AUG 94 / SmithKline in Dollars 2.9bn US deal: Acquisition of Sterling
Health creates world's biggest consumer drugs business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham is creating the world's biggest consumer drugs business
by buying Sterling Health from Eastman Kodak of the US for Dollars 2.925bn
(Pounds 1.88bn).
The deal, announced yesterday, brings Sterling Health's big-selling brands
such as Panadol and Andrews together with SmithKline's Eno and Tums.
It is the largest acquisition yet in over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and
doubles London-based SmithKline's annual OTC sales to more than Dollars 2bn.
SB will pay cash, funding the acquisition through bank borrowings and
commercial paper.
The deal is SB's second multibillion dollar acquisition since Mr Jan Leschly
became chief executive in April. The following month it paid Dollars 2.3bn
for Diversified Pharmaceuticals Services, a US drugs distributor.
SB and Sterling Health, the OTC non-prescription business of Sterling
Winthrop, have fought over markets in painkillers and gastro-intestinal
remedies for many years, largely in the US, the UK and Germany where
SmithKline has 70 per cent of its OTC sales. This deal gives SB a presence
in more than 100 countries.
'We are going to become the major healthcare company in the world,' said Mr
Leschly yesterday.
The healthcare industry has witnessed a series of mergers and takeovers
involving many big players such as Eli Lilly and Merck of the US and
Switzerland's Roche. The industry's consolidation is a response to pressure
from customers - employers who pay health insurance premiums in the US and
governments elsewhere - to cut healthcare costs.
Sterling Health made a profit of Dollars 162.4m on sales of Dollars 1.006bn
in 1993 and had net assets of Dollars 372.1m at the end of last year.
SB's accounts will include a provision of about Pounds 500m to cover the
costs of restructuring and rationalising the combined businesses.
Gearing, net debt as a percentage of shareholders' funds, will rise from
less than 60 per cent to 300 per cent by the end of this year, but should
fall by 1996 as SmithKline sells non-strategic businesses, said Mr Hugh
Collum, finance director.
Kodak could raise almost Dollars 4.6bn from this sale and the planned sale
of Sterling Winthrop's prescription business to Sanofi for nearly Dollars
1.7bn.
The company said it hoped to complete the Sanofi deal early in the third
quarter of 1994, with the SB transaction being closed in the fourth.
The cash will be used to reduce Kodak's Dollars 6.4bn debt. The company is
also in talks about selling L&amp;F Products for an estimated Dollars 2bn. It is
a do-it-yourself products company with sales last year of Dollars 1bn. Kodak
also wants to sell its clinical diagnostics business  - which had 1993 sales
of around Dollars 700m - for which it could expect more than Dollars 1bn.
In New York, shares in SB rose Dollars  1/2 to close at Dollars 31 1/2 and
Eastman Kodak gained Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 50 5/8 .
SB has had intermittent discussions with Eastman Kodak over Sterling Health
for about four years. But it was only in May this year that Eastman Kodak
declared its intention to sell its healthcare operations. The sale to Elf
Sanofi, its European partner, came the following month.
Further deals are likely in the sector. Shares in Marion Merrell Dow, the
drugs company which is 72 per cent owned by Dow Chemical, climbed 8.43 per
cent yesterday to close at Dollars 24 1/8 on news that it had retained
Lehman Brothers to advise it on a number of options, including 'potential
business combinations'.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Mobile phones lead race for new subscribers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mobile phones are enjoying such a boom in the UK that new cellular phone
connections are racing ahead of links to traditional fixed phone networks.
The UK's four cellular networks have about 2.6m subscribers compared with
BT's 26m and about 500,000 for the cable companies. On current trends, the
gap between numbers of subscribers on fixed and mobile networks will narrow,
in spite of sustained growth in the number of fixed-line connections.
Net new connections to mobile networks overtook fixed network connections to
British Telecom and the cable TV companies last December, on a surge of
pre-Christmas mobile phone buying.
Analysts expected the mobile phone tide would ebb after Christmas, but
cellular has stayed ahead every month this year except January in what is
clearly a turning point for the telecommunications industry.
It took the UK's cellular operators eight years from their launch in 1985 to
attract their first 1.4m customers. The number of subscribers has almost
doubled since the start of 1993, with the increase running at more than 50
per cent a year.
The figures reflect the fact that mobile phones are no longer seen as yuppie
playthings. Recent advertising campaigns by mobile operators have been
pitched at mainstream consumers, and one of the four networks  - Mercury
One-2-One - claims to be in direct competition with BT by offering free
local mobile phone calls on its networks in the evenings.
The mobile networks are far more expensive than their fixed counterparts,
when allowance is made for monthly subscriptions of up to Pounds 28.75 and
the high cost of phone calls, handsets and initial connection.
However, mobile prices are falling rapidly, with call charges down by as
much as a third over the past year and handsets widely available for less
than Pounds 100.
Two new networks - Orange and One-2-One - were launched in the past year to
compete with established operators Vodafone and Cellnet.
BT, which has a 60 per cent stake in Cellnet, is now adding new mobile
customers more than two-thirds as fast as it is gaining fixed-line
subscribers.
At nearly five mobile subscribers per 100 people, the UK has a higher
density of mobile phone users than any European country except Scandinavia,
where the figure is about 10 in 100.

FT  30 AUG 94 / Hospitality hire scheme floated for new royal yacht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The royal family will only have a new yacht to replace Britannia if big
companies are prepared to use it for corporate entertaining, according to a
joint letter from the Department of Trade and Industry and the Foreign
Office, which has been leaked to the Financial Times.
The letter, from Mr Ray Mingay, director-general of export promotion at the
DTI, asks the chairmen of big companies whether they would rent a new yacht
for 'promoting your products to potential buyers, receiving potential
foreign buyers and signing ceremonies for prestigious contracts'.
An almost identical letter from another official also explicitly lists
'entertaining foreign business partners and potential partners' as a use.
Mr Mingay continues: 'The president of the Board of Trade (Mr Michael
Heseltine) has asked that assessment of potential demand for a replacement
yacht be kept discreet and be completed quickly.' Replies are requested by
mid-September.
The private sector can currently use Britannia during 'sea days', when the
boat is used as part of government-sponsored export initiatives. But the
letter says any replacement would be run on far more stringent commercial
lines.
Sent on the instructions of Mr Heseltine, it says 'the charge for hiring the
yacht would be required to recoup a proportion of the running costs'. The
letter estimates these running costs at Pounds 5m a year.
Companies would pay less if the boat were moored in the Pool of London than
if they hired it for a 'sailing event' or for sending it to 'an overseas
moored event'.
The government is currently deciding whether to spend an estimated Pounds
60m on buying a new yacht to replace Britannia, which is due to be
decommissioned in 1997.
Though the DTI and the Foreign Office want the government to make the
investment, they are meeting stiff opposition from the Treasury.
Access to the new yacht would be restricted to 'prestigious companies', so
that its 'exclusivity' would be preserved.
The chief executive of one company said: 'I think its a marvellous idea. The
royal yacht would be the glitziest corporate hospitality venue in the
world.'
However, companies contacted by the Financial Times said they could not
predict what their corporate entertaining needs would be in a few years.
'Although Michael Heseltine is not asking for a firm commitment, it is quite
difficult to give even an indication of how much we might use it,' said one
chairman.

The New Zealand energy, construction and forestry group is expected to

NZDollars 165m (Dollars 97m) for the year to June 30, about half of last
year's level. But a string of asset sales, including its methanol interests,
are expected to lead to abnormal profits of around NZDollars 400m. The
company has enjoyed a strong turnaround in earnings from pulp and paper in
recent months. Most analysts are predicting a strong profit recovery in the
present financial year. The company's energy division and building supplies
interests are expected to have performed well over the past year.

Jordan and Turkey yesterday called for an end to United Nations sanctions
against Iraq and urged its return to the international fold, AP reports from
Amman.
In a joint press conference, King Hussein and visiting Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel also said that stability brought by an Arab-Israeli
settlement would lead to an increased co-operation between their countries.
On Iraq, Mr Demirel said: 'We do believe that the sanctions should be lifted
as soon as possible and then Iraq should return to the international
community.
'If Iraq continues to be isolated, its territorial integrity will be hard to
maintain,' he added at the end of a day of talks with King Hussein.
'Certainly, we hope that we will see Iraq once again taking a vital role in
this region,' said King Hussein, who was perceived as pro-Iraqi because of
his refusal to join a US-led coalition that expelled Iraq from Kuwait in
1991. The king advocated a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
In sharp contrast, Ankara gave solid support to the coalition. But economic
and political interests have led Turkey to renew ties with Iraq.
Ankara is the only non-Arab member of the coalition to have reopened its
embassy in Baghdad. Dozens of Turkish businessmen have visited Baghdad and
signed trade contracts.
Turkey and Iraq also have agreed to prepare an oil pipeline to export Iraqi
crude once the embargo against Iraq is lifted. Both countries are hoping to
flush out 12m barrels of Iraqi crude stuck there after borders were closed
during the Gulf crisis.
Mr Demirel said Turkey was negotiating with the UN some technical details,
including who would receive the oil from the pipeline and how it could be
sold off.
The president acknowledged that Turkish businessmen were making deals with
the Iraqis, but emphasised that none of the contracts would be carried out
until the sanctions were lifted.
Mr Demirel said Ankara, which is taking an increasingly influential role in
the Middle East, was ready to take a share in regional development projects.
He declined to elaborate.
Turkey is actively involved in regional peace discussions on energy, the
environment, economic co-operation and water.
Jordanian officials say Turkey, which has abundant water resources, could
contribute to resolving water problems in parched nations like Jordan.

Moroccan newspapers said Morocco's decision to demand entry visas following

FT  29 AUG 94 / Poles win easing of debt position

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
More than 95 per cent of western commercial banks and other holders of
Dollars 13.2bn worth of Polish debt have agreed to a debt buy-back component
in the country's debt reduction agreement, Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, the
country's deputy premier and finance minister said at the weekend.
This means that the value of the debt reduction for Poland will increase to
over 49 per cent from the 42-46 per cent originally mooted because more debt
holders than expected have opted to sell back their paper to the Poles at 41
cents to the dollar.
Further details of the Brady-style arrangement - so-called after a 1989
initiative by the then US Treasury secretary Nicholas Brady - are due to be
revealed today by Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, the chief negotiator of the deal
which is to be signed on September 13.
As late as mid-July the Poles were still a few percentage points short of
the 95 per cent threshold legally required for the buy-back to go ahead.
Some debt holders had been refusing to go along with the agreement,
believing the terms too generous.
Failure to cross the 95 per cent threshold would have meant that the Poles
could have only gone ahead with exchanging debt for par bonds and discount
bonds which the deal values at 55 cents to the dollar and which have proved
to be the most popular option chosen by the debt holders.
The agreement will initially cost the Poles over Dollars 2bn, to be financed
from foreign currency reserves and from loans from the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Russian PM warns on debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Russia's prime minister, has vowed the government
will take a tough line on the problem of inter-enterprise debt, and he
appeared to reject calls for the government to intervene with state funding
In an interview with the Interfax news agency yesterday, Mr Chernomyrdin
described debts between Russian companies as one of the most pressing issues
facing the economy. But he indicated the government would not help ease the
problem by injecting fresh credits into the economy.
Inter-enterprise debt has accumulated as companies have continued to supply
each other with goods and services without securing payment. The failure of
companies to pay their bills has led to a snow-balling of the debt,
paralysing the financial system.
Estimates put the total level of indebtedness at around Rbs90,000bn (Pounds
27bn at the market rate). The government has been under intense pressure
from cash-starved companies to loosen its monetary policy and has partially
relented by granting some cheap credits to the defence sector and heavy
industry. But economists have warned this will only stimulate another surge
of inflation.
Mr Chernomyrdin said the government was working on a package of measures to
force debtors to use their hard currency funds to pay their debts. He also
hinted the government would introduce greater powers of disclosure to find
out the true financial state of particular enterprises.
He even suggested some branches of the economy should introduce price
freezes to help alleviate the debt burden, echoing the views of Mr Alexander
Shokhin, the economics minister.
Mr Chernomyrdin said the railway, coal, iron and steel industries had all
reached an agreement not to raise their tariffs this year. 'I think the next
stage will be when they agree not to raise wages during the same period of
time or, for instance, to keep them at the same level. This is a civilised
market mechanism working all over the world. I think we will get used to
applying it.'
Mr Chernomyrdin said federal intervention to resolve a similar problem in
1992 had been a serious mistake. 'Enterprises can carry out mutual
conciliation of debt at the regional level and within their branch of
industry,' he added.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Heavy turnout reported for Sunday trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporter
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Customers queued outside shops before they opened yesterday, the first
Sunday on which stores were allowed, under the Sunday Trading Act, to sell a
full range of goods.
Marks and Spencer, which yesterday opened 10 stores in England and Wales for
the first time on a Sunday, said people had been knocking on the doors of
its shop in Camberley, Surrey, an hour before it had opened.
Queues formed outside the Lakeside Centre at Thurrock, Essex, long before it
opened. Mr Michael Belt, general manager at Lakeside, said: 'It's been as
busy as an average Saturday, with around 120,000 people shopping here.'
The Marble Arch Retailers' Association, which represents 366 traders in
Edgware Road, west London, reported a 40 per cent increase in sales compared
with weekdays.
Mr James Lindsay, managing director of the Meadowhall retail complex in
Sheffield, said trading there was as busy as on an average Saturday. About
2,000 people were waiting outside before the centre opened. More than 270
stores in the complex opened yesterday compared with 120 on previous
Sundays.
Many customers would find it difficult to notice the difference because some
of the supermarkets, DIY stores and out-of-town retailers have been opening
on Sundays for some time. Only two big retail chains as well as M&amp;S were
open for the first time: House of Fraser and Waitrose, the supermarket arm
of the John Lewis Partnership.
For many people it was a Bank holiday family day out, particularly at
shopping centres where free entertainment and shows were laid on.
Mr Paul Keenan, a spokesman for Gateshead's MetroCentre in Tyne and Wear,
which has spent about Pounds 50,000 on publicity, said: 'It's been very,
very busy and we reckon it could well turn out to be the second-busiest day
of the week after Saturday.'
Trade union concerns about Sunday trading appear to have eased. The chief
fear was that employees might be forced to work on Sunday against their
will, or face the sack.
But all shopworkers, including part-timers and those with less than two
years' service, are protected under the Sunday Trading Act from enforced
Sunday work. The only exceptions are those who contract to work exclusively
on Sundays.
Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, is happy with the act but is advising
shopworkers not to sign agreements to work on Sundays unless satisfied with
the terms and conditions.
But the Keep Sunday Special Campaign said many staff were under pressure to
agree to work on Sundays. 'There are no obligations under the act for
employers to inform their employees of their rights.'

<TEXT>
The Pakistani government said at the weekend it had ordered investigations
into the activities of officials at the country's two large public sector
banks, following allegations that they were involved in fraudulent dealings
related to loans worth up to Rs1bn (Pounds 21.1m) made during the rule of
former prime minister Mr Nawaz Sharif.
Senator Mr Malik Qasim, chairman of the government's federal anti corruption
committee (FACC) announced that Presidents of the Habib Bank  - Pakistan's
largest bank - and the National Bank of Pakistan, had been told to suspend
officials who violated the rules in sanctioning loans under the populist
'self-employment scheme'.
The scheme, Mr Sharif's brain-child, was meant to provide unemployed youth
with up to Rs100,000 to set up small businesses. But officials say that in
many cases the loans did not reach those they were designed for.
'In many cases, the loans were sanctioned to employed people and to those
who were already running established businesses,' said Mr Qasim. 'We want to
know if this was a deliberate attempt to keep many people out, to favour
near and dear ones, or only a case of a poorly managed plan,' said one
official.
Its not yet clear, if the investigation will set back plans for privatising
large banks.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Air-conditioning
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The air enters the cabin from the cabin side walls, above head height
and below the overhead lockers, and is extracted from the side walls at
floor level. There are three air-conditioning units on each 747,
changing the 51,950 cubic feet of air in the entire passenger area
every three minutes and keeping it at a constant temperature of about
70'F (some airlines, it is rumoured, only run two of the three air-con
units at a time in order to save fuel, but at the expense of
freshness). To keep it clean, the air is filtered through paper filters
which are changed every 6,360 flying hours. Cigars, of course, are not
allowed: no air-conditioning unit can cope with the smell.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
These are made of three separate acrylic panes. The outer two are load
carrying, while the inner is simply a protective panel. There is an
air-gap between each pane. Normally, the outer pane carries the full
load of pressurisation. If the outer pane should fail, the middle pane
panes are designed to take at least twice the maximum normal cabin
pressure on their own: equivalent to a load of over a ton on a single
pane. It does not matter if the inner pane is scratched or accidentally
damaged, as it does not take any pressurisation load. Thus the risk of
doing a 'Goldfinger' and being sucked out at 50,000 feet is slim.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pressurisation
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fresh air is drawn into the plane from ducts on the fuselage, heated
and pressurised to around 8 lbs per square inch. This is equivalent
to the air pressure found at the top of an 8,000ft mountain. There is
no risk attached to this, but it does make it difficult to boil water
(as the air pressure drops, so the temperature at which water will boil
rises) and BA flights have been known to carry special cooking units
for passengers who have especially requested boiled eggs.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Baggage hold
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is pressurised, but not usually ventilated (unless livestock is
being carried). Thus, the baggage travels throughout the flight in the
air in which it took off. It is loaded in containers shaped to fit the
contours of the plane, swivelled round on a platform of chrome
ball-bearings which line the floor and then pushed down to the far end
of the hold by rams built into the hold bulkhead. The emergency oxygen
supply cylinders are also located beneath the cabin floor; the oxygen
being piped up into overhead masks in the cabin.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cabin floor
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Inside the cabin, 70 square metres of carpeting are used to cover the
floor of Club World, with the same area of foam underlay (principally to
give passengers the impression they are walking on a thicker pile carpet
then they actually are). The aisle carpets (which receive the heaviest
wear) are replaced every three months; the rest have to make do with
hoovering until the next major redecoration.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Seats
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
There are between 60 and 70 seats in the Club World section of a
747-400, all made of aluminium, with steel used at points of extra
stress. The backs will recline at an angle of up to 38 degrees to the
vertical, they can withstand a 9G static loading and there is no
passenger heavy enough to break them. Moreover, all Club World seats
were recently recovered in 17 miles' worth of wool fabric.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lifejackets
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Each seat has a lifejacket under it. These lifejackets are checked
every 310 flying hours (coinciding with a particular maintenance
check). To date, however, no commercial passenger jet aircraft has had
to ditch into the sea. So no one has ever used the lifejackets in the
circumstances for which they were designed.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Food facts
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Food and drink consumption: The chilled food is heated in the galleys,
using conventionsal fan-assisted ovens, not microwaves. In a typical
year, Club World passengers will ge through 50 tonnes of lobster, 84
tonnes of salmon, 120 tonnes of beef and 2 tonnes of caviar. More
prosaically, they will also use up 30 litres of mustard, 5,000 portions
of cheese biscuits and 1.5m individual chocolate boxes. Club World also
gets through 250,000  bottles of champagne, selected from a number of
different champagne producers. On every flight, there will be nearly
3,000 items packed on to Club World trays; the chinaware is Royal
Doulton.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Entertainment
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The seat backs now carry individual 6in x 7in LCD colour video screens
with a compensation mechanism to allow for variations in the angle of
the seat back relative to the viewer. There are eight video channels,
allowing for 54 hours of video per flight. The cabling for the video
and audio channel control, and for the overhead light switch and call
button, travels up one of the main seat legs and along a tube located
across the bottom of the seat backs.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hand washbasins
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
These do empty out into the air, rather than into a holding tank - the
source of those myths about home counties housewives catching Beri-Beri
from a passing plane. The waste water emerges through two drainpipes
beneath the aircraft - one just ahead of the wings, the other at the
tail. Both drainpipes are kept heated, to prevent them from freezing.
1.3m tablets of soap are used up every year.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Blankets, washbags, headsets etc.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Reflecting the fact that business people are more likely to be male than
female, BA gives out 1,032,500 men's washbags each year; and 462 women's
washbags. 63,000 blankets are used (each being washed several times
before being replaced), as well as 400,000 headsets and 324,000 napkins.
The equivalent  of 20 tonnes of aromatic petals go into the essentce
dupplied in Club amenity bags.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavatories
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
There is one lavatory for every 18.5 passengers, each lavatory serviced
by a tank holding 16 litres of water. On average, one passenger in five
will produce what are known as 'solids' during a flight, approximately a
quarter of a pound's worth. More generally, every passenger can expect
to produce a pound of liquid during a flight, In the unlikely event that
a lavatory should fill up, sensors warn the cabin crew, which then shuts
the lavatory down.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Food storage &amp; preparation
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Food is heavily chilled before loading on to the plane, then kept in
special cold boxes, refigerated with dry ice. On average, a 747
long-haul flight will be loaded with a total of 4.5 tonnes of food and
drink (or 61,000 individual items) before take-off. The food itself is
prepared for BA by its own in-house long-haul catering unit at Heathrow
 -Catering Centre South; the largest kitchen in Europe. The contents of
the basic menu selection change every three months, but at any given
time, there are 180 different menus in circulation, each tailored to
regional differences in language, culture and diet.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Holding tanks
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The waste material is sucked down the lavatory by a vacuum system,
passed along a pipe, and is collected in four holding tanks at the rear
of the plane. Older 747s use 'recirculating toilets' in which the waste
matter is broken down by powerful chemicals and the resulting blue
water is reused to flush the lavatories. At the end of the flight, the
holding tanks are pumped out by a special ground vehicle. To cope with
all this activity, Club World gets through just under 1m rolls of
lavatory paper a year.

Wednesday: The purchasing managers' index for the UK in August will be
published by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. While the
overall level of the index is likely to indicate continuing economic
strength, analysts will be most closely watching the prices component for
further signs of inflationary pressures.
Thursday: The Nationwide and Halifax house price indices have often diverged
in recent months, but neither shows much indication of a housing boom.
Today's Nationwide index for August is likely to show still subdued price
increases, after July's 2.1 per cent annual rise.
Friday: In the US, the non-farm payroll numbers are likely to be the key
economic statistic of the week. After strong consumer confidence and low
initial claims figures, Morgan Grenfell is expecting a 250,000 rise in
employment in August, compared with 259,000 in July.
In the UK, official reserves in August are expected to have declined by
around Dollars 25m, but this statistic has lost much of its significance
following Britain's departure from the exchange rate mechanism.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Sanguine mood could linger on into autumn -
New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Wednesday's surprising 70-point surge by the Dow industrials is still a
mystery on Wall Street. Before Friday, when the Dow added another 51 points,
some analysts were dismissing the jump as a technical aberration.
Most notably, a report in The New York Times traced the initial burst to the
consequences of a single fund manager's options trade. His strategy was said
to have triggered what one analyst earlier described as a 'panic reflow' of
money back into depressed cyclical stocks in the final half-hour of trading.
The plausibility of that explanation hardly seems to matter this morning.
Whatever the cause, Wednesday's events have sparked what may turn out to be
a long upturn in share prices.
It now appears the groundwork was laid earlier in the week, when the market
welcomed an announcement by Deere, the US agricultural equipment maker, that
it was lifting its production schedule in response to higher demand. Later,
technology stocks sprang to life when analysts issued encouraging remarks on
several companies, and IBM decided to follow Compaq's lead in lowering
prices on many of its PCs.
There is little doubt that investors are entering the final week of the
summer with an inclination to accentuate the positive. Four trends seem to
be working in their favour: bonds are up, the dollar has stabilised, the
outlook for corporate earnings has improved and the economy is trotting
along at a manageable pace.
Friday's advance, after a modest retreat the previous session, demonstrated
that buyers were not ready to return to the sidelines after just one outing.
Stocks could well have declined, as the Commerce Department announced an
upward revision of second-quarter economic growth. Instead, investors were
relieved that the revision, from 3.7 per cent to 3.8 per cent, fell well
short of expectations.
The report also lent credence to the theory that inventories had piled up in
the quarter because of soft sales, not stepped-up production. Many analysts
are now betting that the Federal Reserve will delay its next move to tighten
credit until November.
This week, thin trading conditions in the run-up to the long Labor Day
weekend could exaggerate the market's movements in either direction. With
the monthly cycle of government economic data getting under way again, some
volatility is not out of the question.
Nevertheless, most portfolio managers are likely to refrain from making
fresh commitments until the release of August employment data on Friday.
Economists are forecasting a moderate increase in non-farm payrolls of
between 200,000 and 250,000. If the figure falls in that range, the sanguine
mood on Wall Street should carry into the autumn.

China stocks are likely to provide the main focus of trading in Hong Kong
next week, with final results due from Maanshan Iron and Steel today and
Luoyang Glass tomorrow, writes Louise Lucas.
Maanshan Iron and Steel has the biggest capitalisation of the so called H
share companies, and Luoyang Glass is a float glass company which listed
last month.
The H share sector has been rising for the past month and a half, partially
stimulated by the launch of a new H share index, which tracks the
performance of the Hong Kong listed China shares, and latterly by some
strong corporate results.
Trading is otherwise expected to be lacklustre, after a mixed corporate
interim results season, although traders will seek arbitrage opportunities
ahead of the expiry of the Hang Seng futures on Tuesday. The market is
closed today for a public holiday.
Investor activity will also be depressed by the public holiday on Monday.

Investors will be paying close attention to July industrial production
figures, released on Wednesday, writes Emiko Terazono.
Although the government's official forecast has been for a fall in
industrial output, private economists expect the rise in demand due to the
hot summer and an increase in car sales, to support the figure.
Other events scheduled include the announcement of Japan Tobacco's public
offering price on Wednesday and Friday's release of August employment
figures. However, analysts do not expect the announcements to affect
investor confidence unless the data is substantially different from
projections, and the Nikkei index is likely to fluctuate in a narrow band
around the 20,500 level.

A busy week is in store on the corporate results front, starting with
first-half figures from Volvo tomorrow. UBS says first-half results have so
far matched, or in many cases handsomely beaten, already high expectations.
It expects Volvo to continue the trend posting net profits up to SKr8.05bn
from SKr380m in the first half of last year.
Few of Sweden's recovering industrial groups are as well positioned as Volvo
to benefit from the improving US economy, heavy internal restructuring and
product launches, says UBS.

First-half results are expected on Wednesday for Tele Danmark, the large
telecommunications group which came to the market with an IPO in April.
Merrill Lynch expects few surprises, but says the interim results should be
positive with revenue growth of 5 per cent, operating profits up 10 per cent
and pre-tax profits lifted by a restructuring of the balance sheet with the
IPO proceeds and reduced pension contributions, up 30 per cent to DKr1.57bn.
Danish companies tend not to pay interim dividends, says the broker, and
Tele Danmark is no exception.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market will be preoccupied with the Bundesbank's fortnightly central
council meeting on Thursday, the fortunes of the domestic bond market and
the Dax index's ability to hold above resistance at 2,100, according to Mr
Detlev Klug at B. Metzler in Frankfurt.
However, participants will be keeping a keen eye on the release on Wednesday
of the mid-term report of Daimler-Benz, the automotive, aerospace and
industrial group, after shares in Volkswagen, its fellow blue chip, slumped
last week on its disappointing progress report.
Brokers will be particularly interested in any full-year or second-half
forecasts from Daimler after Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, depressed
sentiment last week with his gloomy prediction of stagnant west European car
sales this year.
Other companies in the news include Kaufhof, the retailer, which releases
mid-term results on Tuesday and Deutsche Bank which is holding an analysts'
meeting on Thursday.
MAN, which is expected to report full-year figures this week has warned that
the outcome will be below last year's DM213m.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Privatisations primed for centre stage in
Europe - International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the summer lull ends, governments and companies are preparing to launch
an onslaught of international equity offerings.
'The market will be off and running as soon as September starts - we'll see
issuance back at the levels we had earlier in the year,' says one equity
syndicate manager. The improved tone in most equity markets will improve
prospects for new issues, he says. Moreover, 'there is a lot of
institutional money waiting to be invested, most of which will go into
equities'.
Some traders are less sanguine, arguing that the weight of supply may put
pressure on issuers and lead managers to price deals attractively.
Moreover, politics may cause difficulties in some European countries. Italy
will remain vulnerable to political shocks as the budget debate is resumed,
while Sweden, Austria, France and Germany may be overshadowed by elections.
In Europe, privatisations are expected to take centre stage. 'The corporate
sector will have to be very nimble to manoeuvre around the large
privatisations, which will be the most important transactions,' says Mr
Charles Kirwan-Taylor, managing director of equity capital markets at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
However, some say the market may be overestimating the weight of
privatisations in the remaining four months of the year. 'There may not be
as many deals as most people expect - many of the large privatisations could
occur in 1995,' says Mr John Jensen, managing director, equity capital
markets at Merrill Lynch.
In France, the authorities have yet to decide whether their next
privatisation candidate is Renault or the insurer Assurances Generales de
France. If, as many expect, Renault goes first, the government has still
given little indication as to how much of its 80 per cent stake it wants to
sell.
In Germany, dealers are preparing for the Lufthansa sale, co-ordinated by
Dresdner Bank, which is expected to get under way in September.
The outlook is more cloudy in Italy, with dealers speculating over the
timing of the sale of electricity group Enel, and Stet, the
telecommunications group.
Finland's Kemira is expected to sell a Dollars 200m equivalent of shares via
Merrill Lynch, while traders continue to wait for the sale of Sweden's
Nordbanken, which has been held up by political manoeuvrings.
The eastern Mediterranean region, including Greece, Turkey and Israel, is
also expected to see new supply.
In Greece, the privatisation of telecommunications company OTE is likely to
be revived. Although there has been a heavy supply of telecommunication
stocks, OTE and other telecoms names are expected to be warmly received.
'Telecoms stocks are still generally popular - for one, they are
predictable; also, although there are more of them around, most of them
still offer above-average growth prospects,' notes Mr Kirwan-Taylor.
In Turkey, telecommunications group PTT and other utilities are expected to
issue new shares. In Israel, traders will watch for the Bezek, El Al and
Israel Chemical sell-offs.
Asia is likely to produce, among others, a large offering for Indosat, the
Indonesian telecoms group, and a deal for Taiwan's China Steel, both
expected to be led by Merrill Lynch. In India, a rush of new issues could
clog the market, making a successful comeback difficult for VSNL, the large
telecoms group. Its Dollars 1bn privatisation was pulled in May after it
failed to get the desired price. 'There is a risk that there will be so many
small deals that the market doesn't get a chance to consolidate and absorb
big deals,' warns Mr Kirwan-Taylor.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Construction stocks come under scrutiny -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London market has a day of grace today and can stand by to see whether
New York and the other leading continental European stock markets are
prepared to extend the gains registered ahead of the weekend. The running
order on Friday night, when Wall Street was about 3.3 per cent up on the
week, London 2.2 per cent, Paris about 3 per cent up and Germany less so,
bore out the view taken by London analysts of the latest economic
developments.
Relaxation of interest rate worries in the US following a mild upwards
revision of second-quarter economic growth estimates, has been quickly
reflected in optimism in the London and Paris stock markets, both recently
unsettled by renewed rate anxiety. UK market analysts have been able to
return their attention to the onward flow of corporate earnings and
dividends. S. G. Warburg underpins this increasingly favourable indication
of corporate recovery by pointing to the improving margin expectations in
manufacturing industry extrapolated from the Central Statistical Office
economic data on the first and second quarters of the year.
Not that base rate concerns have vanished. NatWest Markets reminds clients
of the downside aspects of the favourable economic statistics and believes
that a rise in interest rates 'remains on the cards,' perhaps in November.
NatWest's view is that domestic inflation is subdued because the monetary
framework is in place. Base rates of 6 per cent, says NatWest, may be needed
to keep inflation at 3 per cent, or below.
With economic recovery again the stock market's favourite topic, it is no
surprise that analysts are reviewing the housebuilding and construction
stocks. Enthusiasm is restrained, with NatWest Securities expressing faith
in the UK new housebuilding sector while commenting 'contracting remains a
mug's game'.
The uncertainty bedeviling housebuilders is shown by the underperformance of
about 23 per cent against the market over 12 months of George Wimpey, of 9
per cent by Berkeley group, of nearly 6 per cent by Bryant Group, all three
recommended by NatWest.
Credit Lyonnais Laing, in a heavyweight analysis of the private
housebuilding sector, finds it less easy to be charitable, believing that
negative equity and low inflation will constrain recovery. On the firm's own
profits model, it could be 1996 before average price earnings ratios come
down to single figures. Lyonnais Laing recommends a neutral weighting in
housebuilding stocks.
However, it suggests widening institutional portfolios to share NatWest's
approval of Berkeley and Bryant Group and sees hopes of recovery in Crest
Nicholson, Wainhomes and McCarthy and Stone.

The Bundesbank's 'interest rates horizon' - which Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the
bank's president, described in May as 'clear for some time' - is beginning
to look a long way away. There is a growing consensus among Frankfurt
economists that the next discount rate change is unlikely to come until
after the federal elections in October.
There are even suspicions that nothing will happen until early in the new
year. Although much depends on the inflationary heating effect of the
economic recovery and the signals from the 1995 wages negotiations, which
should be well under way by then, the move might even be upwards.
Figures issued last week showed west German inflation nudging back up to 3
per cent last month. Although Mr Otmar Issing, the central bank's chief
economist and Mr Tietmeyer's favoured mouthpiece, was promptly wheeled out
to say that it was a temporary blip, the reversal of the downtrend acted as
a reminder that prices and inflationary expectations still need careful
watching.
Much of the impetus behind the German cost-of-living index is still coming
from housing costs, and although the bank has said this is a
non-inflationary result of supply's failure to meet demand, wage earners are
more likely to see it as a drain on thinning incomes and raise their pay
demands accordingly.

A quiet week for economic statistics, combined with today's August bank
holiday, may allow gilts to hang on to their recent gains.
Gilt prices held up last week, in spite of the rather disappointing price
information in the Confederation of British Industry's August monthly trends
survey, published on Friday. According to Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at
S. G. Warburg Securities, the spread between 10-year gilts and German bunds
has narrowed to less than 150 basis points, compared with 180 points a few
weeks ago.
This week, the gilt market's only statistical point of interest is likely to
be Wednesday's purchasing managers' index, where the prices component will
be closely studied. Recent purchasing managers' numbers have shown sharp
growth in price pressures, and the prices index reached a record high in
July.
Towards the end of the week, the focus is likely to shift towards the next
monthly monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the
exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, on
September 7.
Speculation will inevitably centre on whether the two will agree to an early
base rate rise. However, in the wake of the recent retail price numbers,
most analysts feel an interest rate increase will not occur until November.

Whether the bond market will be able to sustain the upward momentum of the
past few trading sessions will depend upon how investors react to the
economic data due this week.
The most important statistic is the monthly employment data, due on Friday.
Wall Street expects the rate of jobs growth to have dropped in August. The
consensus of forecasts is for a rise in non-farm payrolls of 225,000, below
the 259,000 increase in July and the average monthly increase of 279,000
recorded for the year to date. Little change is expected in the national
unemployment rate, which stood at 6.1 per cent last month.
If the jobs figures come in at, or below, market forecasts, the bond market
could be set for a prolonged period of stability, with a slight bias towards
higher prices.
Any signs of strength, however, and fears of another interest rate increase
by the Federal Reserve will be revived, and last week's gains could
dissipate quickly.
The July personal income and expenditure, leading indicators and
manufacturing orders data are not expected to cause many ripples. However,
the August consumer confidence report from the Conference Board could cause
trouble if analysts' predictions that consumer confidence rose only slightly
this month prove off the mark.

The rise in short-term rates hurt the Japanese government bond last week,
and the yield on the No 164 10-year benchmark closed up 11.5 basis points at
4.685 per cent.
With institutional investors taking profits ahead of the September book
closing, a further rise in yields is likely, while further indications of
economic recovery are also expected to hurt the bond market.
This week, the July industrial production figures, released Wednesday, are
expected show a stronger performance than the original government
projection, due to demand spurred by the hot summer weather.
However, Salomon Brothers in Tokyo sees the technical factor - book-closing
manoeuvres - and the seasonal rise in yields in the summer wearing off in
the near term. As investors turn their attention to economic fundamentals,
the compound yield on the benchmark will move back towards 4.3 per cent,
says the broker.
The argument against higher long-term yields in the near future is that
inflation remains low and private machinery orders are below the troughs of
the previous two economic cycles. Worries over extra bond supply and the
rise in US bond yields seem overdone, due to the lack of correlation of such
factors with Japanese government bond yields in the past.

FT  29 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Retail investors board Coupon Express -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It must be difficult to get a seat on the 'Coupon Express' from Brussels to
Luxembourg, if the recent flood of Luxembourg franc eurobond issuance is
anything to go by.
The train, which leaves the Belgian capital in the morning and arrives in
the Grand Duchy a few hours later, is a favoured route for wealthy Belgians
whenever they need to attend to their financial affairs.
After a good lunch at one of Luxembourg's many restaurants, they can pay a
quick visit to their bank to buy some more bonds or cash their coupons and
be back in Brussels by the evening without the Belgian tax inspector being
any the wiser.
Although in recent years, the eurobond market has become more geared to the
institutional investor with the evolution of large global bond issues, the
Luxembourg franc sector is one of the few remaining bastions of the
old-style retail investors which prosper in the Benelux region.
Mr Frank Reinert, senior manager of origination and syndication at Banque
Internationale a Luxembourg, estimates that about 80 per cent of Luxembourg
franc eurobonds are bought by retail investors.
There are two main attractions: the two currencies have long been linked, so
the foreign exchange risk is minimal; and, unlike Belgium, Luxembourg does
not levy a withholding tax on interest income.
Furthermore, even though there is a liquid primary market in Luxembourg
franc eurobonds, there is virtually no secondary market because the bonds
are invariably held until maturity, says Mr Tom Ineke, syndicate officer at
ABN Amro in Amsterdam. As a result, they rarely react to the volatility
which frequently occurs in the secondary market. 'This means that they are a
pretty safe investment,' says Mr Ineke.
In both 1991 and 1992, Luxembourg franc eurobond issuance topped LFr200bn,
according to IFR Securities Data. But last year issuance fell to just over
LFr150bn as the drop in bond yields to historically low levels prompted
investors to switch out of medium to long-dated bonds into bank deposits,
money-market funds or equities.
'Three-year to five-year deals had yields below 6 per cent and 10-year bonds
just above 6 per cent, and clients did not like that,' says Mr Reinert.
However, since January, the yield on 10-year Belgian government bonds has
jumped from just under 6.5 per cent to almost 8.5 per cent.
As a result, investors have been moving their cash out of deposit accounts,
where they were getting around 4 per cent, back to the long end of the yield
curve where the returns are greater.
So far this year, Luxembourg franc eurobond issuance has reached just over
LFr190bn, and could rise above the levels reached in the early 1990s if the
recent run of offerings continues.
The relatively high redemption flows this year suggest that subscriptions
will remain healthy. According to Mr Reinert, LFr118bn could theoretically
be re-invested in the market this year.
Unlike the rest of the eurobond market, the emphasis in the Luxembourg franc
sector is not on the yield differential against the underlying government
bonds, but on the coupon or yield. 'If you can offer the psychological yield
of 7 per cent or 8 per cent, people will buy it,' says Mr Ineke.
Meanwhile, borrowers have been keen to tap this market because of the
attractive swap opportunities.
The swaps, which are done against the Belgian franc, have enabled issuers
with triple-A rating to achieve funding levels of as much as 20 or 30 basis
points below Libor in recent weeks.
The renewed activity in the sector has been accompanied by an increase in
the size of individual offerings from about LFr500m a few years ago to about
LFr5bn. However, syndicate managers believe that this corner of the eurobond
market will remain the preserve of the retail investor. It is rare to see
anything other than a fixed-rate deal, and the few attempts to diversify
into equity-linked or dual-currency transactions have not had much success.
The lack of a Luxembourg franc swap market has also deterred some borrowers.
Some Luxembourg banks which underwrite the bonds do not run a swap book,
which means that another counterparty has to be brought in to execute this
part of the deal. Although these menages a trois have been harmonious so
far, such an arrangement could easily end in tears.

FT  29 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Clearing the way for a rally in gilts -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While other government bond markets remain beset by inflationary fears and
interest rate uncertainty, sentiment in the gilts market has turned more
positive, with many analysts calling for a modest rally in the fourth
quarter.
Last week, for example, Kleinwort Benson cut its 10-year gilt yield
projection for the year end from 9 1/4 per cent to 8 1/2 per cent, the level
at which the gilt started the year.
The main reasons for the more upbeat appraisal are the better-than-expected
inflation outlook, and the Bank of England's more comfortable funding
position.
The latest inflation data for July showed the underlying rate, excluding
mortgages, has hit a 27-year low, in spite of the fact that the UK is in its
ninth quarter of growth.
The small rise in unit wage costs in particular 'paves the way for very low
RPI inflation data during the next few months,' according to Mr Julian
Callow, European economist at Kleinwort Benson.
However, Mr Callow concedes 'the market will remain fearful of a sudden
up-tick in British inflation' and 'continue to demand a high yield relative
to inflation'.
Meanwhile, the funding pressures on the Bank of England have been subsiding.
If the official forecast of a Pounds 36bn public sector borrowing
requirement is maintained, the Bank needs to sell Pounds 2.5bn of gilts a
month for the rest of the year.
However, analysts now expect that the PSBR could come in lower, at about
Pounds 30bn, reducing the average size of monthly auctions to a relatively
modest Pounds 2bn.
Technically, the gilts market could benefit from a favourable cost of carry,
which means that holders of gilts can earn an attractive margin by funding
their positions at the short end of the market, because of the large
differential between short and long-term rates.
However, although the spread between 10-year gilts and bunds has narrowed to
about 150 basis points, the gilts market has yet to show any sign of a
sustained rally.
'You won't see it in the prices, but the undertone has distinctly improved,'
says Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International.
'The drag on the market is thin trading due to the holiday period and
malaise about other European and US bond markets.'
The bearish conditions afflicting the world's bond markets will hold back
potential gains in the gilts market: if economists have learnt one lesson
this year, it is that economic fundamentals do not necessarily outweigh
strong market trends.
In addition to their concern about the broader outlook for the world's bond
markets, international investors are also nervous about the currency.
'International investors have years of history of being burnt by sterling,
and seeing sterling weakness doesn't help,' says Mr Shepperd.
The pound's weakness has also rekindled uncertainty about the timing of an
interest rate hike, although many analysts still believe that tightening
will not start until next year.
Some analysts, though, remain cautious, noting that 10-year yields have
already fallen below 8 1/2 per cent and warning against pinning hopes on the
latest spate of data.
'I think that the market is attaching a bit too much importance to the
latest inflation statistics,' says Mr David Miles, senior UK economist at
Merrill Lynch, who expects a rate hike before year-end.
Nevertheless, there is a growing expectation that gilts will outperform
other bond markets in the final quarter of 1994.
'We have been warming up to the gilt market over the last couple of weeks
and have done some switching from German bonds to gilts in our global bond
portfolios,' says Mr Nick Henderson, head of fixed interest at Gartmore
Investment Management.
'This is partly to close off a negative posture - but so far this year
German government bonds have outperformed gilts by about 13 per cent and we
feel that it is time to switch back (to gilts).'
So when is a rally likely? One possible spur is the Budget, due to be
presented on November 29, which is widely expected to be positive for the
gilts market.
How far ahead of the Budget - if at all - the market will start discounting
any good news is harder to call.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Lebanon attempts to rebuild markets as
interest returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International finance houses are gearing up for business in Lebanon as the
country's reconstruction programme gets under way, writes James Whittington,
recently in Beirut.
French, British and American merchant banks are looking at its prospects as
a regional capital markets centre in the Middle East.
French banks which include Credit Lyonnais, Paribas and Banque Nationale de
Paris Internationale are well established with offices in Beirut. The
London-based Robert Fleming will join them, together with Merrill Lynch of
the US, with a regional office in the city by the end of this year. Baring
Securities of the UK has just published a book on Lebanon and a British
Invisibles delegation will be visiting Lebanon in October.
The stock market is still in its infancy. There is only one listed company,
Solidere, a Dollars 2.5bn property-development company set-up to rebuild the
centre of Beirut. Trading in its two classes of shares began at the end of
June, but less than half have so far been distributed.
Massive demand and low turnover have fueled a price rise of more than 50 per
cent.
The market is waiting for the rest of the A shares, which are being
allocated to the owners of land and property rights of the land earmarked
for development, to come on to the market by the end of the year.
B shares, issued through a Dollars 650m subscription earlier this year, was
oversubscribed by 42 per cent. The shares are restricted to Arab nationals
and property holders.
Paribas, however, has won approval to buy a stake on the basis of its having
had an office in the city centre before the war. The bank is issuing
warrants, open to all investors, on its holding.
It may be some time before a fully-fledged stock market is set up. A
committee has just been appointed to draw up its regulations and there are
only a few companies ready for listing.
However brokers in London believe the potential is huge in terms of
privatisations, and giving assistance to publicly and family-owned companies
which want to raise capital.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's stockmarket rose a modest 2.4 per cent last week following the
ruling party's easy win in Sunday's presidential election, although the peso
unexpectedly weakened against the dollar, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico
City.
The market reaction was limited largely because investors had already
discounted the victory of Mr Ernesto Zedillo. The leftist opposition's
decision to denounce the election as fraudulent and to hold a protest rally
on Saturday in Mexico City, while expected, appears to have made some
investors nervous.
After strengthening sharply the day after the election, the peso weakened in
the second half of the week after the central bank moved its informal
intervention limit up to 3.25 pesos to the dollar to prevent a sudden
appreciation of the currency.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Credit squeeze leaves China lower - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a burst of activity earlier this month, which sent share prices
rocketing, China's fledgling stock markets have slid back under the weight
of negative economic news and poor interim results for listed companies.
Shanghai's B-share index for foreign investors is down by about 6 per cent
from its month's high, finishing last week at 77.71. A-shares for local
investors have also slipped.
Foreign brokers say that a credit squeeze, imposed last year to calm an
overheating economy, is continuing to have a negative impact on company
earnings, and circumstances seem unlikely to improve in the short term.
Government anti-inflation efforts were set back by a jump in retail prices
in July after the rate of price increases appeared to be slowing. Another
worrying development was a leap in capital spending in July, in spite of
government attempts to restrain investment in fixed assets as part of its
anti-inflation strategy.
While sentiment among foreign investors had improved in recent months, poor
results for the six months to June, combined with uncertainties over the
economy, are certain to be giving fund managers pause for thought.
In Shanghai, Mr Paul Vibert, an analyst at Baring Securities, said the
outlook was still very shaky.
The B-share index - B-shares are denominated in yuan but are traded in US
and Hong Kong dollars - had picked itself off the floor, after falling by
about 40 per cent this year. It is now down by about 22 per cent for the
year.
Brokers had expected B-shares to recover their lost ground by the end of
1994, the index finishing at about 100, where it began the year. This now
seems difficult in the light of faltering performances by many of the 28
listed B-share companies.
Earnings, even allowing for excessively optimistic revenue projections for
newly-listed stocks, were little short of disastrous with a couple of
notable exceptions, including Pilkington Glass, whose performances matched
expectations.
At least half the B-share companies failed to achieve targets, and in a
number of cases, such as Forever Bicycle, earnings were much less than
forecast. The worst performing sectors were textile machinery and other
light industrial equipment.
China's problems with 'triangular debt' - the inability of one faltering
enterprise to pay another for goods and services - have almost certainly
contributed to the poor results.
Underlining a slowdown after this month's almost frenzied burst of activity,
with the A-share index more than doubling after the authorities intervened
to prop-up a collapsing market, is the fall in trading volumes. Last week
volume was down to between Yn3bn and Yn4bn compared with a daily turnover of
Yn10-12bn two weeks ago. In the light of a tricky period ahead for the
government economically, with pressures intensifying for stronger medicine
to curb inflation, stock market activity seems likely to continue to be
subdued.
But brokers believe a melt-down similar to last year's when disappointed
local investors deserted the market, is unlikely, especially if the
authorities continue to extend credit to securities houses and also maintain
a ban on new listings. Heavy buying by local institutions is believed to
have been behind the recent surge in A-shares.
'The A-share market appears to be consolidating a little bit,' said Mr
Vibert. 'Local investors appear to have regained confidence.'
For the B-share market, the picture is different in that external factors
are almost as important for market sentiment as local developments. The
market performance of Hong Kong-listed mainland companies, so-called
H-shares, has a direct bearing on the demand for B-shares.
The perception of China investments is also being guided by the reception
given to a dribble of Chinese listings in New York. The initial reaction
could at best be described as wary.
Both the A and B markets are continuing to be bedevilled by confusion over
the regulation of China's markets. The China Securities Regulatory
Commission is nominally in charge, but other bodies such as the People's
Bank of China, the central bank, and State Council, the cabinet, are also
involved. Co-ordination is poor.
In the absence of a securities law, defining regulatory responsibilities,
uncertainty prevails.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Market watches Bundesbank council -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchanges will focus this week on Thursday's Bundesbank council
meeting which will help investors decide on the outlook for European
interest rates.
The feeling prior to the last meeting on August 18 was that the council, if
it wanted to cut rates, would do so either then, or at this week's meeting
on September 1. Rates were left unchanged after the last meeting.
Elsewhere, the dollar will be closely watched. Last Friday it rose sharply
on the back of a rally in the bond market, helped by reports that
short-term, speculative funds might have started buying the currency. But
most analysts continue to believe that the dollar remains subject to a bear
trend.
The US market will not be short of data, with at least a dozen releases
scheduled. Most important will be the non-farm payroll, which is released on
Friday, but Mr Dave Munro, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics in
New York, said the 'hot button' statistics would be the inflation indices
and retail sales, which come later.
Although market expectations are for a fairly modest payroll number, the
inflation data have the potential to unsettle the bond market, and hence the
dollar. Some analysts are predicting that they will show price pressures
rising, as the output gap closes.
Expectations of a further cut in German rates have dampened recently,
following comments last week from senior Bundesbank officials.
Analysts at IBJ International in London, commented: 'Although domestic
factors should ensure inflation continues to decelerate along with monetary
growth, these arguments in favour of a 4 per cent Discount rate are finely
balanced against the economy's surprisingly buoyant recovery . . . the
desire to avoid any move too close to election dates and disturbing, early
noises ahead of the next pay round.'
The Bundesbank's decision will have important ramifications for other
European currencies. If the perception takes hold that German rates have
bottomed, this will make it more difficult for other European countries to
cut rates and will lend support to the D-Mark.
In the UK, traders will focus on Wednesday's purchasing managers' index for
signs of cost pressures in the economy. Opinion is sharply split as to
whether rates should be left untouched, or whether the Bank is moving too
slowly to combat inflation.
Higher rates would probably help sterling, but for the time being the
currency's fate continues to lie in the hands of the dollar.

Anticipation of the expiry of labour contracts on Wednesday at Falconbridge
of Canada, the second biggest western nickel producer, has been one of the
few constructive factors for the nickel market in recent weeks.
The possibility of supply disruption during renegotiations was one of the
principal factors behind the Dollars 215 rally that lifted the three months
price of the metal at the London Metal Exchange close to Dollars 6,000 a
tonne last week.
With world nickel stocks still at uncomfortably high levels, the prospect of
Falconbridge losing output and the strengthening in the market that would
surely bring about is far from unwelcome to other producers. And having cut
costs to the bone and with prices lan-guishing at around Dollars 2.70 a
pound, the company cannot be expected to be in a generous mood when it
receives the unions' pay and conditions demands.
So metals traders will be watching closely after Wednesday to judge the mood
of negotiators on both sides.
The nickel market could in any case soon be emerging from its recent gloom
if Sumitomo, the Japanese steel maker, is right in its opinion, expressed
last week, that a boom in stainless steel demand is just around the corner.
Stainless steel producers are big users of nickel. There are also hopes that
problems at Norilsk of Russia, the world's biggest nickel producer, could
soon reverse the surge in exports to the west after the break up of the
Soviet Union that played such a large part in the collapse of prices for the
metal.
Other events this week include tomorrow's grain and feed trade fair in
Hamburg and, from Wednesday, a five-day, Metal Bulletin-sponsored Asian
Steel and Raw Materials Conference in Beijing. Wednesday also sees
publication by the UK Home Grown Cereals Authority of first results from its
1994 wheat quality survey and the retirement of Mr Aldo Hofmeister as buffer
stock manager of the International Natural Rubber Organisation.

FT  29 AUG 94 / The Markets: Mismanaging trade policy - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For president Clinton, the chief objectives of foreign policy are economic;
the goal is increased exports; and the benefit of those exports is 'good
jobs'. Along with these simplistic goals goes an equally simple approach.
The administration wants results, above all from Japan. Senator Joseph Biden
has defined the US attitude with disarming candour. 'I don't want to
compete,' he has stated, 'I just want to win.'
This quotation jumps out from the pages of a splendid new pamphlet on the
defects of the US approach to trade with Japan.* The fire of the author,
Douglas Irwin of Chicago University, is directed at what his teacher,
Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University - the economist who has argued most
persuasively against the new results-oriented approach - labels 'voluntary
import expansions' (VIEs), by analogy with voluntary export restraints.
The starting point should be whether a special policy for Japan is justified
at all. Does it matter that Japan has a current account surplus of 3 per
cent of gross domestic product, or that Japan has a bilateral surplus with
the US of some 1 per cent of US GDP?
Exports of surplus savings from a rich country like Japan seem far more
defensible than for the equally rich US to import scarce capital. It is also
quite wrong to argue that current account surpluses mean there must be
protection and vice versa for deficits. On that basis, Japan must be more
protectionist now than when it used to run large deficits. Obviously, it is
not.
The anguish over bilateral deficits is particularly ridiculous. The purpose
of creating a multilateral trading system after the second world war was,
after all, to allow such bilateral deficits and surpluses. Nevertheless, it
is a commonly held view that the Japanese bilateral surplus is gravely
damaging the US economy. As the chart demonstrates, if the US is being
damaged, Singapore and Hong Kong should already be ruined and even Taiwan
should be tottering. Yet these are among the most successful economies on
earth. It seems more plausible, on the evidence, to argue that running a
large bilateral deficit with Japan is the surest route to an economic
miracle.
Then there are all those complaints about Japanese obstacles to imports. As
Professor Irwin notes, the new US results-oriented trade policy rests on two
arguments: that Japan's is an unusually closed market and that 'trade
policies requiring specific, quantitative outcomes are necessary to overcome
or to compensate for hidden barriers'. The first premise is exaggerated and
the second 'altogether inaccurate'.
Japan does import relatively few manufactures in relation to GDP. In 1992
only a half of its imports were manufactures, compared with 82 per cent for
the US and 79 per cent for Germany. But sophisticated econometrics does not
support the belief that its imports are smaller than might reasonably be
expected, given its size and lack of resources. The statement from Mr Mickey
Kantor, US trade representative, that 'Japan's markets are closed by any
measure the US may choose' is, insists Prof Irwin, 'completely absurd'.
Grant, for the moment, that Japan is closed, not because the people prefer
to buy domestic products, which is their business, but because of obstacles
created either by the government or by the structure of Japanese business.
Would results-oriented policy be the right way to proceed?
The answer, argues Prof Irwin, is no. 'VIEs are managed trade in the worst
sense of the word. They do not make economic sense, they detract from the
goal of liberalising the Japanese economy and they undermine the objective
of an open, non-discriminatory world trading system.' They are open to
capture by lobbies and are almost certain to be discriminatory.
The most potent objection, however, is simply that the proposed solution
will make the chief problem worse. Since the principal obstacle to imports
is alleged to be collusion among Japanese companies, the aim must be greater
competition. Yet the only way to make a VIE work is by cartelising an
industry, or putting it under direct government management, or both.
Take, for example, the seminal case of the semi-conductor pact of 1986. The
Japanese government has since discovered that what it recognised as an
expectation by US business - a 20 per cent market share for foreign
producers - is regarded as binding by the US government. In trying to impose
its will on domestic producers, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has also
created such ill-will that it has apparently resolved never to adopt
market-share targets again.
Until now, it has stuck to its guns. But the clock may be running out. By
September 30, a resolution needs to be reached in negotiations on
telecommunications and medical equipment. In the absence of success, the US
may impose sanctions. On that day, the US must also reach a decision on
which areas of Japanese trade policy are to be found 'unfair' under section
super-301 of its trade law.
All this puts a great deal of pressure on the Japanese to concede. What
should they do? Ideally, the entire US-Japan conflict needs to be placed
within the new world trade organisation. If that proves impossible, the
Japanese must at least reiterate the essential point: 'yes, we are prepared
to discuss our policies; but never again will we make commitments on behalf
of private Japanese firms.'

DC: American Enterprise Institute, 1994.

FT  29 AUG 94 / The Markets: What value greater disclosure? - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Who would argue with the proposition that more information is a good thing?
In suggesting that banks should reveal more about their use of volatile
financial instruments, bank regulators and congressmen have struck a popular
chord.
After six months of worrying trading reports from banks, funds and companies
which bear the scars of losses on such instruments, the markets have given a
warm welcome to such proposals. The expanses of newsprint devoted to the
subject also show that the plans have a wider resonance, touching widespread
public suspicion of Wall Street's recklessness.
However, those trying to improve the banks' disclosure of information may
have set themselves an impossible task. There is little sign that the
methods they are considering will prove useful; some may, in fact, prove
counterproductive.
The current clamour has been prompted by the events of this spring, when the
proprietary trading desks of banks were hit hard by the sharp increases in
US and European interest rates. The rises produced heavy losses on many of
the huge range of financial instruments now labelled 'derivatives', the
value of which depends on the movement of an underlying variable such as an
interest rate or currency.
The losses revealed that the banks' use of these instruments had sharply
increased during 1993. In a recent analysis of US banks' current disclosure
practices, Mr Ethan Heisler, analyst at Salomon Brothers, calculates that
'derivative contracts for the eight largest US banks grew by Dollars 3
trillion in 1993 to Dollars 10 trillion', a level some 10 times greater than
the banks' combined assets at the end of 1993.
Banking regulators, including Mr Eugene Ludwig, Comptroller of the Currency,
and Mr William McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
have called for higher standards of disclosure, and Fed officials may
announce preliminary proposals within months. The House of Representatives'
banking committee is studying plans for new disclosure rules, and the US
Financial Accounting Standards Board is also considering new ways to
represent the use of derivatives in trading statements and balance sheets.
There is, in this flurry, an air of compensating for the escape of the horse
by shutting the stable door many times. Regulators believe that since the
Fed began to tighten monetary policy on February 4, banks have sharply
reduced their exposure to further shifts in interest rates. Mr McDonough
commented in an article in the Financial Times earlier this month that 'the
visions of melt-down are overblown'.
The best argument that more should be done lies not in recent experience but
in the principle that the role of the banks in providing liquid deposits and
in administering payments needs to be safeguarded from risky activity which
they may undertake on their own behalf.
Regulators appear to favour proposals that banks should publish accounts of
their outstanding derivatives contracts quarterly, or even monthly. By
establishing a series of such figures for each bank, regulators hope to
compensate for wide variations in accounting practices, particularly in the
choice of the period over which losses or gains are recognised.
That does not, however, overcome the central difficulty: the risk of
exposure to derivatives cannot be represented in conventional ways. The
nominal value of the contract gives no clue to the potential losses if the
fundamental variable moves in an unexpected direction. In contrast, the most
that a bank can lose in extending a loan is the principal sum extended.
Nor do such proposals distinguish between the use of derivatives to reduce
exposure to the volatility of interest rates or currencies and speculative
trading. Neither do they inform the markets about whether the bank is
vulnerable to a rise or to a fall in those variables.
Inclusion of more data in a bank's trading statements could even be
misleading, in that creditors, investors and counterparties may be tempted
to overlook other risks. As Salomon puts it, 'the market's current
derivative obsession will distract attention from potentially riskier
activity' such as banks' renewed taste for developing countries' debt and
for highly-leveraged deals.
A more fruitful route than trying to quantify risk in a bank's trading
statement would be to ask banks to calculate the loss in earnings or asset
value which they would suffer from an adverse change in interest rates or
currencies. Some regional US banks do this to an extent, though given their
much more modest level of activity in the derivatives markets, this has
proved of limited use: Salomon estimates that 'less than 3 per cent of
(regional) banks' earnings would be affected if interest rates moved
adversely by 100 basis points'.
There is, though, an inevitable risk of focusing on the wrong variable;
current concern centres on exposure to shifts in US interest rates, even
though many banks have been caught out less by the Fed's change of policy in
February than by the rise in European rates that followed.
A more radical route would be to insist that banks ring fence deposits from
trading in derivatives on their own account. That would answer many of the
concerns of creditors, although not those of investors in banks' shares or
of counterparties to their trading.
The choice of the best route forward might be clearer if the regulators had
been more forthcoming about the use they themselves might make of better
information. The danger is that they are fashioning a new tool with little
sense of why it is needed or how it will be used. The current anxiety about
derivatives may simply generate a flood of financial data from the banks
that is, on closer inspection, worthless.

TDollars 2.45bn (Dollars 91m) as a result of a TDollars 348m loss on its US
operations, writes Laura Tyson in Taipei.
First-half revenues were up 19 per cent from a year earlier, to TDollars
15.41bn, on steady sales growth, the group said. It added that earnings in
the first half of last year were lifted by TDollars 440m from land sales and
other income.
The company took a loss of TDollars 348m in its US operations.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fonorola, the Canadian telecommunications reseller, plans to turn itself
into Canada's third national long-distance carrier, writes Robert Gibbens.
At present the company leases facilities from the other big carriers,
Stentor and Unitel, at wholesale prices and provides enhanced services to
business customers at prices below the telephone companies' rates.
Now Fonorola has formed a limited partnership with Canadian National
Railways to develop CN's existing 1,500-mile trans-Canada fibre-optic
network running beside its tracks between Montreal and Vancouver.
Fonorola will also get access to other CN private systems in Canada and the
US, as far south as Cincinnati.
It will invest CDollars 15m cash in the partnership and arrange supplier
finance for a CDollars 50m upgrade of the CN fibre-optic network.
Canadian National Railways said its role would be passive but it wanted to
'maximise an under-utilised asset'.
It built the system in the early 1980s to manage its rail network more
efficiently.

CDollars 16.5m, or 32 cents, a year earlier, with better results from the
main Bay department store chain, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Sales were CDollars 520m, up 10.5 per cent, with the Bay division gaining
12.9 per cent and Zellers up 9.8 per cent. Including special items, final
profit in the latest quarter was CDollars 40.9m or 72 cents a share.
First-half profit before special items was CDollars 22.2m, or 39 cents a

FT  29 AUG 94 / International Company News: Oerlikon-Buhrle expects improved
annual earnings
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Oerlikon-Buhrle, the Swiss weapons, engineering and retailing group, has
forecast a 'clearly improved' operating result for the current year and has
held out the prospect of paying a dividend for the first time in nearly a
decade.
Buhrle reported a 44 per cent slide in net income in the first half to SFr6m
(Dollars 4.3m), but this setback was entirely due to the absence of large
extraordinary gains from property sales in the current period.
Operating income rose 62 per cent to SFr59.3m on flat sales of SFr1.36bn,
and the result before taxes and extraordinary items advanced to a profit of
SFr30.4m from a loss of SFr2.9m.
The profit improvement came mainly from the Balzers vacuum engineering
business and the Contraves weapons subsidiary. Balzers, which supplies
surface coating equipment and services, has seen a big growth in demand this
year for its machines, especially those for coating compact discs.
Orders received in the first half were up 17 per cent to SFr242.7m, and its
operating profit more than doubled to SFr14.4m.
The long troubled Contraves division also more than doubled its operating
profit from SFr7.2m to SFr16m in the first half, but Buhrle warned of lower
profits in the full year. It cited budget problems in customer countries and
uncertainties over Swiss policy on military equipment exports.
Sales of the Bally shoes subsidiary were flat at SFr514.5m, but up 4 per
cent excluding currency effects.
Operating profit was down 14 per cent to SFr30.2m. Slight increases in sales
and operating profits are expected in the full year.
Buhrle indicated that it would clear its capital deficit this year.
However, the directors have not yet decided whether to recommend a dividend
for 1994. The last one paid was in respect of 1985.
The group has not yet been able to carry out its DM100m (Dollars 62.5m)
acquisition of the Leybold vacuum engineering company. The US Federal Trade
Commission had not yet given its approval.
The German Cartel Commission has already demanded some disposals from either
Leybold or Balzers.
Buhrle said it still expected to consolidate Leybold retroactively to the
first of the year, and indicated that the German company had returned to
profit this year.

FT  29 AUG 94 / International Company News: De Beers changes terms of
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
De Beers, the world's biggest diamond group, has changed the terms of its
proposed joint venture with two junior Canadian companies after
disappointing results from tests in Canada's Northwest Territories.
Nevertheless, De Beers will continue to explore the so-called Yamba Lake
concession area and, if the group decides to go into production, it will
find financing of up to CDollars 500m (USDollars 357m) for the first mine
and earn a 60 per cent interest in the concession.
However, De Beers no longer has any obligation to take shareholdings in Mill
City Gold and Tanqueray Resources, as it agreed when the joint venture was
first mooted last month.
De Beers said independent testing of a 24.5 tonnes sample from the Torrie
kimberlite pipe at Yamba Lake produced 19 small diamonds weighing in total
less than one carat. The Torrie pipe lies in the 'corridor of hope' runs for
nearly 150 kilometres and where nearly 100 kimberlite pipes - which
sometimes contain diamonds - have been found.
This is the second blow for Canadian junior mining companies. A recent
unexpected announcement of sampling results by Kennecott, a subsidiary of
RTZ of the UK, sent share prices of many of the small companies plummeting.

Murray and Roberts, the South African construction and engineering group,
improved on its forecasts to lift pre-tax earnings 8 per cent to R487m
(Dollars 135m) from R452m for the year ending in June, writes Mark Suzman in
Johannesburg.
Turnover rose 15 per cent to R7.77bn from R6.78bn a year ago.
However, a 22 per cent rise in tax paid, to R111m from R91m, meant that
attributable earnings rose only 2 per cent to R340m from R333m.

FT  29 AUG 94 / International Company News: SA watershed for black business
 -Nail starts trading in Johannesburg today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New Africa Investments Limited (Nail) begins trading on the Johannesburg
stock exchange today. Its arrival marks the most significant achievement of
black business in South Africa to date and highlights the continued weakness
of black economic clout in the country.
The formation of Nail, the brainchild of Dr Nthato Motlana a Soweto-based
medical doctor turned businessman who used to be President Nelson Mandela's
personal physician, is an important initiative by any standards.
Dr Motlana and a group of partners have put together a number of recent
black initiatives and rolled them into a single company. Nail's biggest
asset is a 30 per cent controlling share in Metlife, South Africa's fifth
largest life assurer, and it controls The Sowetan newspaper, the country's
highest circulation daily, and holds a large stake in MTN, a cellular phone
network. Total assets amount to about R7bn (Dollars 1.9bn).
The company's listing marks a watershed for black business but critics
charge that its formation owes more to white desperation to build up a class
of black capitalists than any inherent business acumen on the part of Dr
Motlana and his associates. 'All it does is help establish a new black elite
without providing any real benefits for the masses,' says one cynic.
Some of the charges carry more than a grain of truth. Certainly nearly all
the transactions leading to the formation of Nail have been facilitated by
white conglomerates aware that, given the new political climate, blacks have
to be seen to have a genuine stake in the economy.
The takeover by a black consortium of The Sowetan last year from Argus
Newspapers, former Anglo-American subsidiary, was managed on very generous
terms, while the money for the first 10 per cent of Metlife taken by Dr
Motlana and his partners was provided through a loan, now repaid, from the
state-run Industrial Development Corporation.
Meanwhile, Sankorp, the Afrikaner-run insurance group that used to own
Metlife, will retain 20 per cent of the new company and a seat on the board
of directors, and existing white management is being kept on at both Metlife
and The Sowetan.
However, Sankorp officials deny they will be seeking any managerial role in
the new company and emphasise the decision to sell Metlife was made for
sound business reasons. 'We will fulfil our role in corporate governance,'
notes Mr Attie du Plessis, a Sankorp executive director. 'But we will not
interfere in the day-to-day life of the group. We have faith in the
directors and the underlying companies.'
The fact that ulterior motives might lie behind the conglomerates'
willingness to engineer the necessary deals, makes their generosity good
financial sense in the current climate. 'The black sector of the life
assurance market is growing at 50 per cent a year,' notes one broker.
'Although Metlife's share of the market has dropped from 80 per cent to 40
per cent over the past five years, it's still in a better position to
benefit from the growth than any other company.'
Also, charges that Nail benefits only a tiny core of black investors are not
entirely justified. In addition to having 8,500 individual black
shareholders, the National Council of Trade Unions has taken a 13.7 per cent
share of the new company, and other union groups are likely to take up a
further 20 per cent in the near future.
Sizeable though Nail might be, compared with the bigger life assurers or the
leading banks and mining houses, it is one medium-size black fish in a pond
filled with big white ones.
However, given apartheid's success in preventing blacks from accumulating
capital or skills to build up their own companies, initiatives such as Nail
remain the only viable way of developing large black business in South
Africa.

FT  29 AUG 94 / International Company News: First-half profits dip at Danone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Danone, France's largest food group, has reported a slight drop in
first-half net profit to FFr1.67n (Dollars 298m) from FFr1.8bn in the same
period of 1993. But it said it was still banking on a profit increase for
the year.
The beverage products of Danone, which recently changed its name from BSN,
are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in the weather. This was poor in
Europe until June but then followed a spectacular summer on which Danone is
basing its confidence for a rise in overall earnings for 1994. It said its
beer sales had been artificially swollen in the first half of last year
ahead of a rise in French excise tax.
First-half turnover was FFr37bn, which was a rise of 6 per cent taking into
account new acquisitions and of 2.7 per cent on a comparable basis with the
first six months of last year. The group said its operating income and net
profit declined slightly in the first half, but its cashflow rose marginally
to FFr3.49bn.
According to some reports, Danone is negotiating the sale of its Materne
jam-making division to Hillsdown of the UK, but the French group is refusing
to comment on this.
At Friday's board meeting, Mr Franck Riboud, the 38-year-old son of Mr
Antoine Riboud, president, was named deputy managing director, or number two
to his father. But at the same time, the group's managing inner circle was
widened to include two new assistant managing directors.

gains
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aegon, the Dutch insurer, posted a 10.8 per cent rise in first-half net
profit and predicted a 'clear increase' in operating profit and profit per
share for 1994 as a whole.
Net profit rose to Fl 550.7m (Dollars 306m) from Fl 497m, while operating
profit rose 13.3 per cent to Fl 465.7m from Fl 411.1m. The net profit figure
comprises operating profit plus realised gains on shares and property, which
were virtually unchanged at Fl 85m compared with Fl 86m.
Premium income rose 46 per cent to Fl 7.66bn, with most of the increase due
to the first-time inclusion of results from Scottish Equitable Life
following last year's acquisition. If this factor is excluded, premium
income would have risen by 8.5 per cent.
The company said foreign exchange movements had a modestly positive effect
on first-half results. Aegon added it has hedged its risk against a sharp
decline in the dollar against the guilder.
Aegon said profits grew in the Netherlands, the US and other parts of
Europe. One exception was Aegon Insurance Company (UK), the subsidiary in
London, which produced disappointing results.

FT  29 AUG 94 / International Company News: Austrian insurer in 1m share
debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wiener Stadtische Allgemeine Versicherung, Austria's largest insurance
company, is coming to the Vienna stock exchange in October with an initial
issue of 1m new preference shares.
The Sch100 par value shares would represent just under one-tenth of the
group's existing Sch1.1bn (Dollars 95.6m) nominal capital.
Wiener Stadtische is 91 per cent controlled by a mutual society backed by
the City of Vienna. Bank Austria, which is also controlled indirectly by the
City of Vienna, has 8 per cent.
The all risk insurer had premium income last year of Sch15.4bn, giving it a
13 per cent share of the Austrian market.
Net income, calculated on the Austrian financial analysts' method (OVFA),
jumped to Sch852m from Sch625m in 1992.
Its capital at the year-end stood at Sch6.2bn.
In the first half of 1994, its premium income advanced 4 per cent to
Sch8.5bn, and it is forecasting a 2 per cent rise in the full year to
Sch15.8bn. OVFA net income is forecast to ease to Sch827m.
Wiener Stadtische also leads a group of Austrian insurance companies which
has a combined annual premium income of Sch23.6bn and claims a market share
of about 20 per cent.
The preference shares will be entitled to a minimum 15 per cent dividend
with a guarantee to exceed the ordinary dividend by 5 per cent for three
years. The ordinary dividend for the past two years has been 15 per cent.
Bank Austria, lead manager of the issue, plans to announce the price of the
shares on September 30. The subscription period is from October 3 to 7.

<TEXT>
Nestle, the world's largest food and beverages group, is raising its
indirect stake in the San Pellegrino mineral water company.
The Swiss group said it had enlarged its stake in Compagnie Financiere du
Haut-Rhin (CFHR), a Luxembourg company which has majority control of San
Pellegrino, to 42 per cent from 28 per cent by buying shares from the
Italian Gardini and Malgara families.
It expected to raise its CFHR stake further to 49 per cent through purchases
from the Mentasti family, which controls it.
Nestle, which has been building its mineral water interests rapidly in the
past few years, also has a direct stake in San Pellegrino, believed to be
about 14 per cent.

<TEXT>
British Steel and SSAB, the Swedish steel group, have agreed to take full
control of Norsk Stal, Norway's leading steel distributor.
The two companies, which already hold 48 per cent of Norsk Stal's shares,
are buying the majority stake from Norsk Jern Holding, the largest Norwegian
steel producer, on undisclosed terms.
Norsk Stal, which last year achieved profits of NKr20m (Pounds 1.9m) on
turnover of NKr1.16bn, is already the main distribution outlet for both
British Steel and SSAB in Norway. Its operations include Norsk Stal
Tynnplater, Norway's largest steel service centre with clients in both
Sweden and Norway.
The deal was initiated by Norsk Jern as part of a restructuring which will
focus its operations on Fundia, a producer of long steel products. Terms are
expected to be finalised by the middle of next month but will be subject to
approval from the European Commission and Nordic authorities.
SSAB is Scandinavia's biggest steel producer with a targeted market share of
50 per cent in heavy plate and strip products. It already collaborates with
British Steel through European Electrical Steels, which has operations in
both Sweden and Wales. British Steel owns 75 per cent of the venture.

<TEXT>
Eastern Electricity has taken a 6 per cent stake in the Johnston North Sea
gas field when it agreed to buy Offshore Oil and Gas Development from
Heerema, the Dutch construction group, for an undisclosed sum.
Eastern is the third regional electricity company, after Yorkshire and
Northern, to enter the upstream gas business. It also has one of the biggest
gas supply businesses among the recs.
It has already contracted to buy the output of the Johnston field, which is
expected to be in production later this year and has a life expectancy of
about 11 years. The field is operated by Hamilton Oil.
Mr John Devaney, Eastern's chief executive, said the purchase was part of
the plan for developing an integrated gas business.
OOGD's assets, mainly comprising the 6 per cent stake in Johnston, are
valued at about Pounds 10m. The acquisition is subject to the approval of Mr
Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary.

FT  29 AUG 94 / UK Company News: T&amp;N in talks to acquire German stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;N, the engineering group, is believed to be in talks with
Metallgesellschaft over the potential acquisition of the German company's 47
per cent stake in Kolbenschmidt, the vehicle components maker.
The talks are likely to intensify following reports that
Metallgesellschaft's agreement to sell its stake to Dana Corporation of the
US has run into difficulty.
It is believed that talks between T&amp;N and Metallgesellschaft have been in
progress for about six months, and continued even after the Germany company
came to an agreement with Dana.
T&amp;N said: 'This is speculation and we cannot comment.'
The stake in Kolbenschmidt was put up for sale in January by Mr Kajo
Neukirchen, who was brought in by creditor banks to salvage the ailing
German engineering giant. It had suffered huge losses, totalling more DM1bn
(Pounds 400m) on oil derivatives trading by a US subsidiary.
Last March, Dana agreed in principle to buy the stake, though no price was
put on the deal, which has not been approved by the companies' boards.
Given its financial difficulties, Metallgesellschaft may be under some
pressure to secure a sale of the stake. Kolbenschmidt lost DM123m in the
year to last September and is labouring under heavy borrowings.
T&amp;N's interim pre-tax profits, due to be released on Thursday, are expected
to reach Pounds 51m, helped by an upturn in European car sales and in the US
car industry.

FT  29 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Richards withdraws from printed carpets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Richards fell 5p to 49p on Friday after the Aberdeen-based
textiles company announced its withdrawal from the manufacture of printed
carpet where, it said, it had no long-term competitive advantage.
The carpet manufacturing operations in Northern Ireland would now be closed
with the loss of about 175 jobs. A 'significant write-off' would inevitably
result from the decision.
All non-print carpet manufacture would be concentrated at Cumnock, Ayrshire,
and the remaining carpet business should improve performance substantially
in 1995, directors said. The core spinning operation continued to show
improved results.
For the half year to March 31, pre-tax losses deepened from Pounds 326,000
to Pounds 1.62m after provisions totalling Pounds 1.61m for the period.
Before this there was a swing from operating losses of Pounds 248,000 to
profits of Pounds 220,000 from continuing activities.

FT  29 AUG 94 / UK Company News: New homes favoured by buyers - Andrew
Taylor reports on the latest study of housebuilders' trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK housing market's slow emergence from recession is unlikely to dent
sharp increases in housebuilders' pre-tax profits, according to brokers
Credit Lyonnais Laing.
Its annual study of the housing sector's state of health says that the pace
of recovery is likely to be sluggish, with borrowing costs remaining high.
Potential house buyers are unlikely to be as active as in previous
recoveries because confidence has been sapped by the fall in house prices in
the late 1980s and early 1990s.
This should not, however, prevent housebuilders' profits from rising rapidly
over the next 18 months. New homes this year have been selling faster than
existing properties, where estate agents have complained that the price
expectations of many sellers have remained too high.
Best placed are companies with large land banks which have not been forced
to replenish stocks as land prices have risen sharply since the beginning of
1993.
The Credit Lyonnais study has been published at the start of a busy results
season for construction and building materials companies. Some of these have
already benefited from the rise in new housebuilding in the UK and also in
the US.
Last week Marley, the building materials group, announced that pre-tax
profits had almost doubled to Pounds 26m during the six months to end-June -
its best first-half performance since 1989. Next Wednesday housebuilder
Persimmon and cement group Rugby are both expected to show higher interim
profits.
Credit Lyonnais argues that housebuilders have increased their market share
while the overall housing market has remained sluggish over the summer.
Its profits model, based on the performance of 20 quoted housebuilders,
expects the number of homes built by the companies to increase by 13.5 per
cent this year to 41,534 and by a further 22 per cent next year to 50,630.
Higher house sales for the same fixed overheads will enhance builders'
margins, depending upon how many new sites are started.
But 'the most significant impact on profits this year and perhaps even next
year' is likely to be the elimination of expensive land bought at the peak
of the market.
Builders will have been assisted further by the removal of sales incentives,
accounting for as much as 5 per cent of the sale price of a home, even
though house prices in general have seen little uplift.
Credit Lyonnais believes the recovery will remain slow, with purchasers
likely to move because of need rather than to take advantage of rapidly
rising prices. Capital growth of 1 or 2 per cent a year against long-term
mortgage rates of 9 per cent for 10-year loans will not encourage people to
move.
The main constraint on the market, however, is the continuing impact of
negative equity which 'has not just altered the purchasing power of those
directly affected but has affected the attitudes of potential house
purchasers who, in a more inflationary environment, might now be rushing to
join the housing bandwagon.'
The study concludes: 'In a recovering economy the bull points will win but
the contraints will be of sufficient import to make the recovery a slow
one.'

FT  29 AUG 94 / VW's big hopes for small car: Kevin Done reports on the
German carmaker's efforts to catch up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several thousand Volkswagen dealers from across Europe are converging on a
Paris race course in the Bois de Boulogne this week.
It is not for a flutter on the horses, however, but for the high pressure
launch of the new VW Polo, which the German carmaker hopes its dealers will
soon be selling in sufficient numbers to transform VW from an also-ran in
west Europe's fiercely competitive small car market into a front-runner.
The VW group, which includes Audi, Seat and Skoda, may be Europe's biggest
carmaker, but as an individual brand VW is ranked only third behind the Opel
make (Vauxhall in the UK) of General Motors and Ford.
In the small car segment of the market, VW languished in sixth place with
the old Polo last year. As the car bumped along to the end of its
life-cycle, its sales dropped by 39.8 per cent to only 186,000, according to
Automotive Industry Data, the UK-based analysts. Sales of the market-leading
Ford Fiesta were more than double Polo sales at 452,000.
VW has a lot of ground to make up. Even though it will have the newest car
in the market, it is up against tough opposition with both GM and Fiat
having made launches in the past 18 months in the shape of the Opel/Vauxhall
Corsa and the Fiat Punto.
It is vital for VW to achieve a breakthrough in this segment, where
superminis (Fiesta, Corsa, Punto etc) and minis (Fiat Cinquecento, Fiat
Panda, Renault Twingo etc) account for 31 per cent of all the new cars sold
in Europe.
With the new Polo, VW dealers will be able to meet the competition on a more
level playing field. Its predecessor was long overdue for replacement having
been launched 13 years ago, and VW had never properly met the demands of the
market-place.
VW's UK import subsidiary maintains that with the old model Polo, it could
only cover 29 per cent of the market-place. With the new car it will be able
to cover virtually the entire market and offer for the first time a host of
features common among rival models, such as five doors, automatic
transmission, anti-lock braking, power-assisted steering, driver and
passenger airbags, air conditioning, central locking and electric windows.
Mr Dieter Dahlhoff, director of marketing for the VW brand, says: 'We want
to make the new Polo into a real high volume model and to use it to open
doors to new customers.'
The group is aiming to increase sales of the Polo to at least 350,000 in
1995. Most of the output will come from VW's Spanish plant at Pamplona with
output next year targeted to reach at least 1,040 a day on two shifts with
the ability to rise to 1,200 a day. The car will be built at VW's main plant
at Wolfsburg at the rate of 530 a day.
While ambitious for Volkswagen, these targets appear modest against the aims
of its bitter rival General Motors, with which it is still locked in
controversy over GM allegations of industrial espionage. Opel is raising
Corsa production at its Eisenach plant in eastern Germany to 640 a day on a
three-shift operation. Combined with its main Corsa plant at Zaragoza,
Spain, this will raise total production for the range to 2,400 a day.
The Polo must also help to bring VW down to a lower cost base, so that the
heavily loss-making German group can start to rid itself of its unenviable
position as Europe's high-cost carmaker. Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the
VW management board, claims the hours taken to build the new Polo have been
cut by about 15 per cent (on a comparable basis to the old Polo) to 16 hours
per car.
The new car is also an important element in the group's platform strategy
aimed at cutting costs and simplifying its global manufacturing activities.
It is planning to reduce the number of basic chassis platforms from 16
earlier this year to four by early next decade. The Polo platform will spawn
all other small car models in the VW group for the next decade, including
Seat and Skoda.
According to Mr Ulrich Seiffert, VW group research and development director,
the new Polo shares about 40 per cent of its components, by value, with its
half-sister, the Seat Ibiza, launched early last year. The Ibiza and the
Polo share dashboards, as well as rear axle and suspension, and some engines
and gearboxes.
VW is developing its first mini car, smaller than the Polo, code-named the
EA420 and due for launch in Europe by late 1996. Based on a shortened Polo
platform and to be produced at Wolfsburg, it is supposed to be the car that
proves VW can assemble cars in Germany as cost effectively as any carmaker
in Europe.
It is a big task for a small car, but such rationalisation is crucial as the
VW group seeks to claw its way back into the black following last year's
record losses of DM1.9bn.

The upturn in European vehicle sales and signs of recovery in the US
automotive industry should lift first-half profits by about 30 per cent at
the motor components and engineering group. Interim pre-tax profits - due on
Thursday - are expected to reach Pounds 51m (Pounds 39.4m) as the group
enjoys higher volumes and the benefits of previous reorganisation. Analysts
have warned, however, that investors would be seeking a 'significant
payback' following Pounds 263m of capital expenditure in the past three
years and a 92 per increase in shares in issue since 1989.

companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Interim profits of about Pounds 90m are expected on Thursday. With a hefty
chunk of business dependent of housebuilding, investors will be looking for
signs of some pick-up in underlying trading in both the US and UK. After
April's Pounds 267m rights issue, observers want to see signs that the more
conservative strategy of bolt-on acquisitions is working.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Hint of recovery in construction
sector - Other companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The interim results season for construction and building materials companies
kicks off in earnest on Wednesday when half-year figures are due from
housebuilder Persimmon and Rugby Group, the cement company. The gloss has
gone off construction sector shares during the past 18 months. But Persimmon
is expected to have increased first-half profits to about Pounds 14m (Pounds
9.7m), while some analysts reckon Rugby will have raised profits from Pounds
30.2m to about Pounds 35m.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Housebuilders set for profits surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of UK housebuilders could rise by more than three-quarters
this year and by almost another half in 1995 even though recovery in the
housing market is likely to remain slow according to a study by Credit
Lyonnais Laing.
The broker says margins will improve because housebuilders are selling more
homes on the same overheads, have used up much of the expensive land bought
in the late 1980s and early 1990s and have been able to remove many of the
sales incentives used in the recession.
Longer term, the brokers are concerned about land prices which have risen by
an average of 35 per cent across the country, according to a survey by
Savills estate agents.
Credit Lyonnais says that housebuilders may have to accept reduced returns
on capital if low inflation continues.
This follows warnings from Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England,
who says that industry and commerce risk missing profitable investment
opportunities if they continue to expect high returns.
Land prices started to rise as companies restocked after the recession.
These acquisitions have been financed by large share issues from
construction companies, which since February 1993 have raised more than
Pounds 2bn of which Pounds 650m has been directly identified for
housebuilding.
This is sufficient to build an extra 15,000 homes a year, about 10 per cent
of the annual new build programme, says Credit Lyonnais.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Rough ride gives way to smoother
passage - Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo, Sweden's biggest manufacturer, will make its contribution tomorrow to
a post-recession surge in half-year profits from Swedish companies when it
announces its results for the first six months. Analysts expect a pre-tax
profit - excluding capital gains - of between SKr4-5bn (Pounds 420m) as the
car and truck maker rides a boom in sales, especially in the US, its biggest
market, and Sweden, and cashes in on painful cost-cutting measures taken
over the past three years.
In addition, the pre-tax figure will be doubled thanks to a SKr4bn capital
gain mainly stemming from the disposal in April of Volvo's controlling stake
in Cardo, an investment group sold to Incentive, an industrial arm of the
Wallenberg family empire.
The decision to refocus on its traditional vehicle making followed the
traumatic collapse in December of a plan to merge Volvo cars and trucks with
France's Renault. Investors will be looking to hear more from Volvo on its
plans for the disposal of its two biggest non-core holdings - BCP, a food
and drinks group, and its 28 per cent stake in Pharmacia, the
pharmaceuticals group.
Volvo has yet to answer what models it will develop to extend its car range.
But for the time being it is cruising faster than since the 1980s and
analysts do not expect the present profits spurt to peak until late 1995 or
1996.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Bets may have to be hedged after
DIY downturn - Ladbroke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be a brave gambler that took a bet against Ladbroke announcing its
return to the UK casino business when interim results are announced on
Thursday. Less certain is the extent to which the group will suffer from a
downturn at its DIY chain, Texas Homecare. Ladbroke is expected to announce
a 31 per cent drop in group pre-tax profits before exceptionals to about
Pounds 43m.
Much of the pain from Texas was taken in the second half of last year, when
the group restated its profits. This leaves Ladbroke's 1994 first half
competing against a period when profits were inflated by including potential
rebates from suppliers for unsold goods. Analysts are looking for Texas to
return profits of about Pounds 3.9m, against more than Pounds 15m last time.
The UK hotels business will show some pick up, but depressed trading in
continental Europe may offset that.
Analysts and investors are keeping their fingers crossed for a pleasant
surprise in the betting business. Rumours abound of a sharp upturn in credit
betting during May and June. Expectations are that this will leave the
betting business at least as good as last year's Pounds 40.5m, and perhaps
even better.
While the dividend is likely to come down from 4.9p to 2.5p, this has been
widely expected since the drastic cut at the year-end. Overall, analysts
expect the full-year dividend to be higher than last year's reduced payout
of 6p, down 46 per cent.
The real interest in these results, however, will be the expected
announcement of the purchase of three London casinos for about Pounds 50m.
Ladbroke needs the acquisition if it is to get into the rapidly growing US
gambling market. Approval by the UK authorities, which expelled Ladbrokes 15
years ago, would give the group the credibility it needs in the US and
abroad.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Russians plan gold securities market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government is backing plans to create a domestic securities
market for gold bullion, aiming to establish an internal price for the
precious metal and to raise capital to develop one of the country's most
important but troubled industries.
Following a gold industry conference in Moscow last week, government
departments, banks and mining companies plan to establish a non-commercial
Gold Club to co-ordinate the industry's activities and create a secondary
market for gold. Industry officials say such a market could raise Dollars
1bn (Pounds 649m) for much-needed investment.
Preliminary proposals envisage the creation of a class of securities,
similar to western gold warrants, denominated in grammes of gold and freely
traded by legitimate investors. The market would set the official price of
gold within Russia and would be used by the Central Bank and tax
authorities.
The Gold Club has not yet worked out how this exchange could work in
practice nor how soon. A founding meeting of the club will be held next
month.
Mr Valery Skripchenko, head of administration at the Russian Committee for
Precious Metals and Stones, said there were still 'contradictions between a
state which did not wish to relinquish its control of an important strategic
sector of the economy and alternative investors who would not commit
resources to a sector under a permanent threat of nationalisation'.
Industry figures suggest that a gold securities market might reconcile the
differing priorities of the state and outside investors.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Del Monte seeks European partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglo-American Corporation, South Africa's largest group, hopes to double
the turnover of its Del Monte Food International arm through a merger with a
European foods company.
Anglo, which is heavily dependent on minerals, moved into the global branded
foods market when it paid Dollars 240m (Pounds 150m) for its share of Del
Monte in 1992.
Mr Graham Boustred, Anglo's deputy chairman, says that if the merger, due to
be completed in three months, goes ahead it will double DMFI's annual
turnover to Pounds 1bn. He hopes organic growth will add another Pounds
500m.
Del Monte used to be owned by RJR Nabisco of the US, but was sold off
piecemeal - the fresh fruit business going to Polly Peck, for example. Anglo
and South Africa's Royal Foods acquired DMFI for Pounds 360m from a
management buy-out. Anglo owns 28.5 per cent of Delhold, DMFI's South
African parent.
DMFI cans fruit and beverages in Kenya and the Philippines as well as South
Africa and its strongest markets are Italy and the UK. Mr Boustred says the
potential merger would add strength in Germany and the Benelux countries.
The enlarged DMFI hopes to move into mainland China where Mr Boustred says
there is a growing demand for fresh fruit drinks. It plans to build a
beverage plant in Shanghai with a local partner.
Mr Boustred describes DMFI as a good hedge against the performance of the
financial rand because most of its sales are in Europe. He reckons that the
business is now worth Pounds 100m more than was paid for it even though on
the Johannesburg stock exchange the shares are below the price at which they
were issued.
South Africa's 15 years of political isolation left the Del Monte plant in
the country lagging behind internationally. Mr Carlo Zingaro, an Italian who
has worked for Del Monte since 1965, has been installed as managing director
and brought with him a team of European experts.
Last year R25m (Pounds 3.62m) was spent upgrading the plant at Tulbargh,
which cans 70,000 tonnes of fruit a year. It is South Africa's biggest plant
of its kind, responsible for 40 per cent of the country's canned fruit
exports. Mr Zingaro says another R16m will be needed to continue the
upgrading.

FT  29 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Estate agents
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial institutions still toiling to make a profit in estate agency must
be taking a long hard look at their reasons for persevering. While building
societies hide the operating performance of their agencies within group
figures, evidence from the quoted insurers suggests the going is still
tough. Royal Insurance's 480 offices lost as much in the first half of this
year as in the same period last year; General Accident's chain lost slightly
more.
Neither is the outlook encouraging. The number of house purchases per month
has fallen back steadily since the spring. Total transactions this year now
look likely to be around 1.3m - only a shade higher than in 1993. While that
would be far below the 2.1m peak reached in 1988, it is only around 20 per
cent below the average of the 1980s and there is little reason why turnover
should increase. So long as house prices remain stable, first-time buyers
will not feel under pressure to scramble on to the bottom of the housing
ladder. The prospect of rising interest rates is another reason for caution.
Since house prices have fallen and commissions are under pressure, estate
agents' income has been squeezed harder than the transaction figures
suggest. Unless transactions increase significantly, it is difficult to see
why customers should stop haggling over commissions. Despite the shake-out
through recession - with the number of estate agency offices falling by
perhaps a quarter - overcapacity is at the root of the problem.
Banks and building societies which distribute mortgages through their estate
agencies have a more obvious reason for persevering than insurers. But that
did not dissuade Abbey National from selling out last year or Bristol &amp; West
from shrinking its chain last week. Selling financial products through
estate agencies has been far more difficult than hoped. Widening the range
of financial products on offer might help at the margin. But estate agents
which have not been covering their costs this year should not count on the
housing market for relief.

FT  29 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: US telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the reasons many Baby Bells piled into the UK cable TV industry in
the early 1990s was to gain experience for the time when they would face
competition back home from cable companies. That time has now arrived. The
exact nature of the competition will be influenced by the details of the
telecoms bill that emerges from Congress. But even if Congressional wrangles
over healthcare kick the telecoms bill into touch, competition in the 'local
loop' seems inevitable. Rivals are already able to set up shop in the
biggest markets, including California and New York. Legislation at the
Federal level would merely hurry up the laggards.
So far cable companies have taken only tentative steps into the Dollars
100bn local telephone market. In part, this is from a desire to influence
the pace with which the Bells are allowed to enter their markets. It would
be hard to maintain that the Bells should be kept out of TV if they were
pushing aggressively into telecoms. But the temptation of adding telephone
revenues to their cable subscriptions will eventually be too great to
resist. As the UK cable industry has found, having two revenue streams
transforms its economics.
Similarly, the Bells cannot afford to be left out of cable. True, cable
generates only a quarter as much revenue as local telecoms. But the Bells
are keen to invest in fibre optic networks. And while a gambler might hope
to recoup such investment by providing 'multimedia' services, the inclusion
of more predictable TV revenues would cut the risks. Again what Washington
decides will mainly be a tidying-up job. Two Bells have already won the
right to provide TV.
In the coming fight, the cable companies seem to have the stronger hand. Not
only are they more entrepreneurial. They are also less regulated. But the
Bells have strengths too, most obviously huge financial resources. As the
battle is joined, further mergers between cable companies are likely. More
alliances between Bells and cable groups are also possible. A trend to marry
the two industries ground to a halt early this year when regulators cracked
down on cable charges. But once the regulatory fog clears, the business
reasons for combining forces will look powerful.

FT  29 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Grid's golden shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK electricity sector is charmed. As if a benign set of price caps,
share buy-backs and takeover rumours were not enough, now comes the news
that the regional electricity companies should be able to demerge their
holdings in the National Grid without paying a penny of tax. The government
is, of course, absolutely right not to use its golden share to extract a
hefty tax payment. But many in the market had been expecting the Treasury to
demand its pound of flesh. Now it looks as if the recs will be able to pass
the full Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn value of the grid through to their
shareholders.
The recs could still spoil the picture if they kept the proceeds from the
sale for themselves rather than handing the shares directly to investors.
They could then be liable for capital gains tax. But the recs seem less keen
on hoarding cash than they did in the spring. Moreover, the political row
over the grid reinforces the point that they should transfer value to
investors now. A cash pile would be too easy for an incoming Labour
government to expropriate.
The recs may not have everything going their way on the tax front. It looks
as though the Treasury will profit as share buy-backs gather momentum. Last
week's share purchase in the market by Seeboard will certainly incur tax.
Norweb's plan for an off-market tender would be better for tax-exempt
investors, but authorisation from the Inland Revenue does not appear to be
automatic. While recs could achieve a similar effect by paying
mega-dividends, that would be a red rag to their political critics.
Rec share prices should continue to be underpinned by their ample scope to
cut costs, reshape their balance sheets and deliver value from the grid. The
main risk is that some managements may not pursue these opportunities with
sufficient vigour. That said, high share prices in themselves - as a
reflection of high investor expectations - should help keep them on their
toes. Any slackness would be an invitation to predators.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Cemetery managers call for right to reuse graves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is under growing pressure to empower local authorities to
disinter human remains and reuse graves as part of a national strategy to
cope with the shortage of space in Britain's cemeteries.
Under proposals drawn up by the Institute of Burial and Cremation
Administration, authorities would be allowed to make room for new bodies in
old graves by placing the original occupants' remains in new caskets and
burying them deeper in the ground.
Authorities would be able to do this on plots where 75 years had elapsed
since the last interment. Living relatives would retain the right to renew
their family's rights over the site for a further 75 years.
The association, an organisation representing those responsible for managing
the country's cemeteries and crematoria, plans later this year to research
the public's response to its proposals. If it is favourable, the association
expects to put its plan to government next year.
It is not clear how ministers would react, but the idea has not been ruled
out. Mr Allan Stewart, Scottish office minister, recently said: 'The reuse
of graves would involve the disturbance of remains, which would be
unacceptable to many people, and the implications would need careful and
sensitive consideration.'
According to Mr Ian Hussein, the association's national secretary, ministers
would sooner or later have to face up to the issue of reusing graves because
of a worsening problem with burial space in London and other large cities.
He said three London boroughs were already unable to provide new graves.
Others would run out of space over the next 35 years - a period in which he
said Britain's annual death rate was projected to rise from about 650,000 to
nearer 850,000.
He said the proportion of people choosing burial as opposed to cremation or
other methods had levelled off at about 30 per cent, after falling for many
years.
The proposals are designed to overcome a number of problems associated with
cemeteries becoming full.
If a cemetery stops staging new burials, for example, it loses its primary
source of income. In addition, the less frequently old cemeteries are
visited, the more they tend to become vulnerable to vandalism and
dereliction.
Mr Hussein said that local authority cemeteries in England and Wales already
ran at an annual Pounds 60m deficit - which was funded ultimately out of
local taxation.
The practice of reusing graves is common throughout Europe and in Australia.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Cook steps up pressure to release Archer report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, will today step up
pressure on the government to publish the Department of Trade and Industry
report into allegations of insider dealing involving Lord Archer, the former
Conservative party deputy chairman.
Mr Cook is expected to write to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, asking him to confirm that there would be no 'legal barrier' to
publication of the report if Lord Archer agreed to it being published.
Mr Cook said last night that since Lord Archer had stated publicly that the
report 'exonerated' him, the best-selling novelist should have no difficulty
in giving such permission.
The DTI has never said whether Lord Archer was exonerated. It has only said
only that no further action would be taken against him, following advice
from 'independent counsel'.
The DTI has consistently maintained that it is a 'criminal offence' to
publish reports into alleged insider trading under section 177 of the
Financial Services Act. Lawyers confirm however that publication is possible
if the main protagonists in the affair give their permission.
The report's main subjects - Lord Archer who bought 50,000 shares in Anglia
Television just before the MAI takeover, Lady Archer, a non-executive
director of Anglia Television, and Mr Broosk Saib, an acquaintance of Lord
Archer - have maintained that they behaved properly. The shares were bought
on Mr Saib's behalf, although the cheque for the dealing profit was sent to
Lord Archer's London address.
However, Mr Cook yesterday said that all three had new questions to answer
following disclosure that Lady Archer was present at an Anglia board meeting
on January 12, when directors were given details for the first time of the
takeover price proposed by MAI. That meeting was the day before Lord Archer
placed the first of two orders to buy the shares.
By the evening of January 12, agreement for a takeover was in sight.
However, the Anglia board did not give its formal approval until January 16.
Lord Archer placed an Anglia share purchase order, on January 13, with Mr
Simon Wharmby, a broker who had joined stockbrokers Charles Stanley the
previous October. Lord Archer had never before placed orders through Charles
Stanley, though he had dealt through Mr Wharmby.
The profit from the deal of just more than Pounds 77,000 was sent out by
Charles Stanley in an 'account payee only' cheque on February 4, four days
before the DTI launched its inquiry into the deals. The cheque was deposited
in Mr Saib's UK bank account.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Government to forgo profits from National Grid sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has rejected calls from its backbenchers to take a share of
the profits from next year's sale or demerger of the National Grid.
The electricity transmission company is owned by the 12 regional electricity
companies (recs) of England and Wales, which were given it when they were
privatised in 1989. Analysts estimate the company may be worth Pounds 5bn.
The government owns a golden share in the National Grid which allows it to
demand a share of the profits when it is sold or demerged next spring. Some
Tory MPs have urged ministers to use the golden share to extract up to
Pounds 2bn for the Treasury. However, in a move that will further boost the
electricity companies' profitability, the Treasury has argued it would be an
improper use of its golden share, which it says was only intended to prevent
foreign ownership of the grid.
While ministers are privately angry over the large salaries and share
options awarded to electricity company chiefs, they do not believe the
government should intervene in the running of a private industry.
The government's decision has infuriated some of its own backbenchers as
well as provoking criticism from the Labour party. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow
trade and industry secretary, said: 'I see absolutely no reason why the recs
should milk a fortune out of the National Grid that was built by the nation
and not by them.
'Shareholders in the recs would receive from the sale of the grid almost as
much as it cost them to pay for the whole industry when it was privatised.
If the National Grid is sold, the public must get its share.'
Mr Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield, warned that voters
were losing patience with the privatised utilities. 'For the government to
hand over the grid lock, stock and barrel to the shareholders of electricity
companies is hardly popular capitalism,' he said.
Mr Richard Caborn, Labour's chairman of the Commons' trade and industry
committee, has asked Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
what protection, if any, was given to taxpayers when the National Grid was
handed over to the recs and why they will not be receiving anything from the
flotation or demerger.

Expensive things, these mass exoduses. The Pentagon has done some sums and
calculates that the US taxpayer will need to stump up an extra Dollars 240m
a year to run an expanded refugee camp at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station.
The base sits on 32 acres of Cuban land, leased by the US since 1903 for the
equivalent of fractionally more than Dollars 4,000 annually.
The extra lolly will go towards doubling the capacity of the camp - where
14,500 Haitian refugees are already squatting alongside Cubans - to 40,000.
Heaven only knows what might be the further cost of hosting the hardy
thousands who have actually stepped ashore in Florida; more than 20,000 have
been picked up by the US coastguard in August.
Of course, with Cuba's annual per capita income most recently estimated by
the World Bank at between Dollars 500 and Dollars 1,500, Bill Clinton might
think cash better spent by dropping it over Havana from a low-flying
aircraft.
Better still, why not put Guantanamo's Dollars 4,000 towards cutting the
federal deficit?

Berlusconi joins this elect band thanks to his using 'everything he knew
about television, advertising and public relations to create the charismatic

Marketing gimmicks are going to come in very useful over the next few

Nigerian fraudsters, ever on the lookout for methods by which to separate
businesses from their money, are gaining in sophistication.
This time, the 'Presidential Task Force on Debt Repayment' - no less - has
been contacting UK companies.
The PTFDR fax enjoins addressees to send all financial details within 48
hours, promising their monies will be repaid. Failure to reply will lead to
cancellation of debts.
Needless to say, no such official taskforce exists - but it is a handy way
of obtaining information and signatures and hence, potentially, cash.
Mike Turner, the overseas trade manager of Birmingham's Chamber of Commerce
who has blown the whistle on this and other such wizard scams, reckons that,
if only the schemers had dreamed this one up in the early days, it would
have done very nicely indeed. Back to the drawing board please.

Andre Schiffrin is a worried man. He fears for the future of publishing,
writing, and literary culture in general.
'This is guerrilla warfare,' is how 59-year old Schiffrin refers to the
function he sees for his US publishing house, The New Press. Fed up with
what he sees as the onward march of selling books like soapsuds, he thinks
it time for a riposte.
His father Jacques - a French emigre - co-founded the US publisher Pantheon
in 1942. Pantheon built itself a great name by publishing everything from
Jean-Paul Sartre to Monty Python.
In 1990, when Andre Schiffrin was Pantheon's managing director, its owner,
Random House, put the squeeze on, demanding Schiffrin publish fewer books
with fatter profits.
He walked out, taking a sprinkling of well-known writers - including Studs
Terkel - with him. Schiffrin wasn't against profits; just profit-making as
the only criterion of publishing success.
'Big US publishers now won't touch a book unless they have guaranteed sales
of 20,000 copies, even though they can break-even at 5,000. On that basis
Chomsky or Foucault wouldn't ever have been published,' says Schiffrin.
The New Press, a non-profit organisation backed by several US foundations,
is now four years old. Ironically, some of its titles have proved unexpected
best-sellers, including 50,000 copies sold of May It Please The Court, live
recordings and transcripts of the US Supreme Court. The Court got very cross
about the publication, thereby giving it a market stimulus.
Having now just signed a big distribution deal with UK publisher I B Tauris,
Schiffrin thinks his guerrilla campaign is making headway. 'We might even
break-even this year,' he says with a smile.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Feel the quality, not the quantity: As the UK economic
recovery gathers pace, are manufacturers investing enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Cooper struggles to contain his excitement. 'It's as though there is
no tomorrow. Business is colossal. We can't accept orders until the New
Year.'
The chairman of Cooper Clegg, a Gloucestershire colour printing business,
has not seen anything like it since starting the company 10 years ago. This
year he is spending Pounds 7m on machinery but the company will still not
meet demand. Next year, capital expenditure should double.
'We weren't slow in implementing an investment programme but we
underestimated the strength of the recovery,' Mr Cooper emphasises.
'Big holiday companies wanting 1995 brochures are placing contracts
elsewhere in Europe because there is no capacity here. It's like the bad old
days when the UK lost out because it couldn't cope with demand,' he adds.
Mr Cooper's words will cause concern among those anxious that the vision of
sustained recovery offered by low inflation, cheap money and steady growth
could be under threat. They fear that, with retail sales rising,
manufacturers' stocks falling and spare capacity dwindling, British
industry's failure to spend soon enough and widely enough to replace
capacity lost during the recession could again spoil a nascent upturn.
The nightmare - a depressing replay of Britain's economic record - would be
a manufacturing sector unable to meet demand, mounting supply constraints,
rising inflation and another upsurge in imports.
So far at least, the pressures experienced by Cooper Clegg appear rare. But
given increasingly optimistic growth forecasts for the economy this year
opinion remains divided on whether another boom-bust cycle can be avoided.
Although the government is predicting only a modest 2.75 per cent growth in
GDP this year, GDP in the three months to June was 3.7 higher than the same
period last year.
Mr David Miles, UK economist at Merrill Lynch, says that, given the
accelerating pace of economic growth, investment activity must rise rapidly
in the next two years if industry is to avoid overheating.
But Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Saloman Brothers, is not alone in
identifying an investment pick-up on a scale which should be sufficient to
avoid severe capacity problems. He also makes the point that the more
flexible labour market which now exists might succeed in avoiding a repeat
of past shortages of skilled labour.
Last week's official figures from the Central Statistical Office, which show
a long-awaited rise in manufacturing investment during the second quarter of
1994, mirror other surveys by business organisations indicating an
improvement in companies' investment intentions. This trend has given rise
to some optimism, though the pattern of investment spending remains volatile
and there have been statistical 'false starts' in the two years since the
recovery began.
While the latest Confederation of British Industry industrial trends survey
for the three months to July indicated rising investment optimism within the
motor industry and among building material producers and electronics
companies, the picture was much less buoyant within the aerospace,
chemicals, and food and drink sectors.
Even if a patchy upturn in capital spending is under way - fuelled by
growing confidence, rising profits, low capital costs and increasingly
healthy corporate balance sheets - there is much lost ground to make up.
Since investment in UK manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 per cent
of total UK investment, peaked in 1989 it has fallen by almost one third,
bringing it to its lowest level, as a proportion of gross domestic product,
for more than 30 years.
The collapse in investment may not, however, have been quite as bad as first
appears. Part of the fall may reflect lower prices for plant, machinery and
property. The decrease may also mirror a growing tendency among
manufacturers to contract out work which is then classified as service
industry expenditure.
Yet nobody is making light of the decline. In the machine tools sector,
capital investment 'fell off a cliff' during the recession, according to the
Machine Tool Trades Association. In 1990, UK machine tool makers were
spending a total of Pounds 34m a month on new plant and equipment, a figure
which dropped to Pounds 14m by March 1993. It is now back to only Pounds
20m.
The reluctance of many companies to sanction fresh capital expenditure
follows the mauling they received during the recession and the need to
rebuild balance sheets.
Mr Robert Barrie, UK economist at stockbrokers BZW, points out that much of
the corporate sector remains highly debt conscious and is still repaying
debts incurred in the 1980s. Companies are still reluctant to borrow more
from the banks. But the availability of cash from within increasingly
profitable companies may well help finance a significant expansion in
investment programmes, he added.
Cash, however, is not the only factor. Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank
of England, has repeatedly warned that the refusal by companies to adjust
investment criteria in the face of low inflation and cheaper finance is
frustrating badly needed investment.
A recent CBI survey of investment criteria found that most UK companies were
insisting on pay-back periods of two to three years or a return on capital
of at least 20 per cent - or both. Taken at face value, such expectations
exceed by a wide margin the investment performance required by many of the
UK's manufacturing competitors.
The Bank's criticism of companies' stubborn insistence on high investment
returns is angrily rebutted by much of the corporate sector itself, which
insists that the crucial factor limiting investment is expected demand. But
it is clear that the government faces a difficult task in persuading
companies to share its rosy economic assumptions.
'There is still a great deal of cynicism over whether inflation has been
licked. Living with it has become a way of life and industry will need to
see it stay low for a long time before they change their approach to
investment,' says Lord Weir, chairman of Weir Group, the Glasgow-based
engineering business.
'Who can blame people for not investing? In the paper-making business
they've faced rotten demand and rotten margins and now confront pressures on
raw material prices,' says Mr John Lloyd, managing director of Portals, the
international bank note and specialist paper maker which has bucked the
trend by recently investing Pounds 19m in new machinery to safeguard its
market.
Serious and widespread supply bottlenecks still appear some way off, despite
CBI hints that a few are on the horizon. Many general engineering companies,
in particular, are still reporting under-used capacity. Indeed, current
order books for UK machine tool makers show that while their overseas sales
are rising rapidly as companies expand and update equipment, domestic order
books remain worryingly flat.
While companies such as Weir have maintained investment programmes
throughout the recession, much of the emphasis has been on improving
manufacturing competitiveness and efficiency rather than on additional
capacity.
'It is the quality of investment which is going to matter most,' stresses Mr
Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley. 'It would be much more
desirable to have an increase in investment focused on those industries in
which the UK has a chance of boosting market share than a massive,
across-the-board binge that leads back to another volatile swing in the
business cycle.'
The quality-before-quantity strategy is echoed by other companies like
Devro, the Scottish-based sausage casing manufacturer, which has invested
throughout the recession in high-technology equipment and in research and
development. According to Dr Graeme Alexander, Devro chief executive: 'In
bad times, too many people take too short-term a view and just cut costs.
But you mortgage your future if you cut costs on technological development.'
FKI, the Halifax-based electrical engineering and electronic components
group last year raised its capital spending programme to Pounds 20m and this
year will spend nearly Pounds 27m. Mr Bob Beeston, FKI chief executive, says
raising capacity has not been the priority: 'We have, for example,
introduced computer-aided design equipment to help improve the throughput of
engineering designs onto the shop floor and spent resources on improving
environmental standards.'
Earlier this year, FKI paid nearly Pounds 26m for Rhombus, a German castor
manufacturer which had become vulnerable to takeover in part because of a
big capital spending programme on plant which was heavily under-utilised
during the recession. 'Investing for capacity is not the only game,' Mr
Beeston adds.
But despite occasional strategic errors by German companies, they have
consistently pursued more effective, long-term capital investment programmes
than their UK counterparts, giving them a vital competitive edge over UK
manufacturing in world markets.
In launching the government's drive to improve British industry's
competitiveness earlier this year, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, warned that UK manufacturing productivity was 25 per cent below
that of its main European rivals.
The pattern is repeated when it comes to capital investment. Although
international comparisons are difficult, figures suggest that UK investment,
in relation to GDP, is not only consistently lower than in countries such as
Germany, France and Italy but has been far more erratic.
The performance has been in part responsible for a decline over decades in
Britain's share by volume of world manufacturing exports. It stabilised,
however, during the 1980s at about 6 per cent, less than half that of
Germany.
'An investment recovery is under way but the real concern is the continuing,
chronic problem of low investment, which the cyclical upturn in capital
spending is not going to resolve,' says Mr Ian Thompson, chief economist at
the Engineering Employers' Federation.
'Britain simply does not have a manufacturing capacity of sufficient breadth
and depth to make it fully competitive. The government must take steps
towards changing the anti-investment bias built into corporate taxation.'
The view is shared by organisations such as the British Chambers of
Commerce, which wants investment programmes in excess of five years duration
exempt from capital gains tax. The CBI, too, wants reform of capital gains
tax in the belief that investors would be more inclined to take returns in
the form of capital gains, thereby relieving pressures on companies to pay
high dividends.
The CBI is also calling for a more generous system of capital allowances and
cuts in corporation tax to make available higher levels of retained earnings
for reinvestment.
As Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, assembles his 1994 budget plans, he
will be left in no doubt that extending a helping hand to investment is high
on the wish-list of a manufacturing sector that has to haul itself up into
the first division.
But with such pleadings now part of the perennial, pre-budget lobbying
Treasury ministers will be equally keen to emphasise the role which industry
itself must play in solving its own structural problems. They continue, for
example, to point the finger at high dividend payments as one obstacle to
higher investment.
The CBI is also pursuing its joint initiative with the City to overcome the
short-termism which business says has frustrated long-term investment in
fixed capital, research and development and training.
Mr Nick Kuenssberg, managing director of Dawson International, the knitwear
and clothing group, also wants government help, but of a different kind.
'I would like it to get a grip on itself. If they want the feel good factor
to return they must show they are really in control, that they did plan the
recovery and that they will support the marketplace. We have low inflation
and low inflationary expectations; to even hint of an increase in interest
rates now is completely nuts.'
Like any sensible businessman, FKI's Bob Beeston is not going to reject any
beneficial changes in taxation or capital allowances. But he adds: 'It is,
in the end, up to a company to keep its eye on the ball, look after its
customers, think ahead and make enough profits to invest for the future. It
is the corporate culture that needs changing; Britain has some damn good
manufacturing companies but nothing like enough.'

FT  29 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Global warming
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The threat of global warming presents policymakers with peculiarly difficult
problems. It may take decades to establish whether the scientific hypothesis
 -that rising concentrations of 'greenhouse gases' in the atmosphere will
cause the planet to warm up - is right. But while the probability of severe
climate change seems low, the disruption that could ensue, particularly to
food production, is great. At the Rio Earth Summit two years ago, more than
150 governments felt that the risk justified immediate measures to curb
greenhouse gas emissions.
Representatives of those governments are now meeting in Geneva to debate how
to turn the Rio pledges into a workable plan. The two-week conference lays
the ground for the first formal review of the convention next March in
Berlin, when signatories will decide whether the agreement is adequate to
combat the threat of global warming.
That task is not proving easy. The Rio convention, one of the world's most
ambitious environmental treaties, requires developed countries to make plans
to bring emissions of 'greenhouse gases' back to 1990 levels by 2000. It
also asks developing countries to restrain carbon dioxide emissions by
promoting energy efficiency.
Last week's debate served to highlight the convention's shortcomings. First,
many developed countries are likely to overshoot the 2000 target by at least
several per cent; the European Union is a prominent example. Governments of
industrialised countries appear to have reckoned that recession, together
with some easily-achievable improvements in energy efficiency, would curb
the growth of emissions. But they have found that the recession deterred
investment in energy efficiency, and that growth has now picked up more
quickly than they projected.
Developing countries
Second, the convention largely ducked the question of whether developed
countries should pay developing ones to curb their emissions. Although
governments from industrialised countries have pledged up to Dollars 4bn
over the next three years to the Global Environment Facility, a UN-backed
environmental fund for developing countries, this is insufficient. Third,
and most obviously, the Rio convention is silent on goals beyond 2000.
In developing more effective measures, governments should start with a
co-ordinated removal of subsidies to fossil fuels. Such subsidies are
largest in countries, such as the US and China, which will contribute much
of the world's carbon dioxide emissions in the next few decades.
Nuclear power
Governments should also consider expanding the role of nuclear power.
However the only region now warmly embracing nuclear power is Asia.
Development of civil nuclear programmes has virtually halted in the US and
Germany, and may in the UK.
Another priority is to give support to proposals for 'joint implementation'
 -a formula under which developed countries could fulfil the target's
requirements by helping developing countries curb their emissions. These
plans are controversial. Many developing countries argue that developed
countries have created the threat of global warming, through their past
emissions, and that they should bear the burden of averting it. The plans
have also aroused unease in developed countries, since they imply extensive
transfer of technology, through trade and aid. Their attraction is that they
would help allocate funds efficiently, and could open the way to more
ambitious targets for the next century than would be possible if curbs were
applied in developed countries alone.
These steps, which are necessary if global warming is to be tackled
convincingly, are uncomfortable. That discomfort, however, has one benefit:
it will encourage governments to continue to assess the need for the targets
in the light of emerging scientific evidence.
Environmentalists may see that process as a threat to the hard-won ground of
the Rio convention. This attitude is wrong. Policy made against a backdrop
of scientific uncertainty needs to be refined repeatedly if it is fully to
reflect not only the scale of environmental risks but also the sizeable
costs of combatting them.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Banking on Mr Kohl
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The clouds have started to lift over the German economy during the past six
months, and Mr Helmut Kohl has been making the most of the sunshine. At the
beginning of the year, the chancellor was trailing in the opinion polls.
However, a more vigorous than expected economic recovery and mistakes by the
Opposition have increased the chances that Mr Kohl and his centre-right
coalition will retain power in the October 16 election.
The government now predicts 2.5 per cent growth in Germany this year, a
percentage point better than projected in January. Increased business
optimism is the main reason why the coalition has forged nine percentage
points ahead of the Social Democrats in latest opinion polls.
Mindful that no postwar German chancellor has ever lost his job as the
direct result of a general election, Mr Kohl is exploiting the authority of
12 years in office - but his party should avoid the temptation to campaign
on personality cult rather than policy. He has reasserted his Christian
Democratic Union's hold over the political centre and headed off the
once-acute danger from the far right.
Mr Kohl's SPD challenger Mr Rudolf Scharping is in a less comfortable
position. Mr Scharping has lost credibility since his revelation in March of
proposed tax increases on middle-income earners.
Moreover, Mr Scharping has to contend with two parties to the SPD's left,
the Greens and the Party of Democratic Socialism, the former East German
Communist party. These groupings are not only rivals but also potential
allies of the SPD. Mr Kohl has ruthlessly played on many voters' fears that
a vote for the SPD could be a vote for the far left.
East-west gulf
In view of visceral anti-communism in west Germany, this is an effective
tactic, but it also risks accentuating the gulf between west and east
Germans.
Across united Germany, the Christian Democrats' chief electoral weapon is Mr
Kohl himself. As underlined by the party's manifesto and yesterday's rally
in Dortmund the CDU's campaign will draw heavily on opportunities to portray
the chancellor as a leading international statesman
If re-elected, Mr Kohl will have to turn much attention to international
affairs. A large part of his domestic popularity stems from his commitment
simultaneously to widen and deepen the European Union.
The next German government's main preoccupation will remain the economy.
With real incomes squeezed by unification strains, the recent economic
improvement is mainly due to sharply higher exports. German industry has
regained competitiveness more quickly than expected through heavy
cost-cutting. A negative side-effect is that large-scale structural
unemployment is now starting to look durable.
Tax burden
On the fiscal side, overall taxes and levies in Germany account for about 47
per cent of gross domestic product, higher than any other big industrial
country apart from France. Keeping German fiscal policy on track towards the
Maastricht targets and diminishing the tax burden will be top policy
priorities. Whichever government emerges after October will have to maintain
rigorous public spending control for several years.
These tasks at home and abroad represent an exacting agenda. The Christian
Democrats' reliance on the man who steered through unification is
understandable. But even more than a strong chancellor, Germany needs a
well-balanced government.
Furthering the impression of Mr Kohl's dominance could also detract from the
electoral performance of the Christian Democrats' junior coalition partners,
the Free Democrats. A poor score for the Free Democrats on October 16 could
still force an outcome Mr Kohl and Mr Scharping have both said they wish to
avoid - a grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social
Democrats, which probably would not be in a position to deliver decisive
leadership.
Mr Kohl has broad shoulders, but for the CDU to concentrate its campaign
unduly on his personality would be a mistake. An election where the focus on
a single personality obscures the search for the right policies is not what
Germany needs.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Personal View: Strict agenda for jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIEVE SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The current debate on full employment is in danger of starting off with the
wrong agenda. Full employment cannot be achieved simply by deregulating the
labour market or cutting labour costs.
The basic problem has been the level of demand, not the cost of labour. If
the demand for products were higher most firms could profitably produce more
at the same price and wage levels, either by utilising existing capacity
more fully or by installing new - and more efficient  - capacity.
To restore full employment the first prerequisite is to reverse the
deflationary bias of monetary and fiscal policy, which was the prime cause
of the rise in unemployment in the first place.
The fall in tax receipts and increase in social security costs during the
recession has meant, however, that fiscal policy has become dominated by a
desire to reduce borrowing, irrespective of whether further deflation is
appropriate. This has now reached the point where it is being widely
suggested that the government should cut taxes when recovery is well under
way and revenue is higher, rather than during the recession when the economy
needed a stimulus.
But while higher demand is an essential condition for reducing unemployment,
it is not in itself a sufficient remedy. The deflationary fiscal and
monetary policies which raised unemployment during the 1980s were adopted to
counter inflation. We cannot expect to reverse them without finding
alternative means of avoiding inflation. Post-war experience, in the UK and
elsewhere, shows that to avoid a wage/price spiral with low levels of
unemployment some form of co-ordinated pay bargaining is essential. Only by
taking a national, rather than a purely local, view will the common need to
avoid inflation be taken into account.
Despite the government's optimism about inflation, the increasing
fragmentation of wage bargaining in recent years has made a renewal of the
wage/price spiral more, rather than less, likely as recovery gets hold.
Making pay more sensitive to market conditions may hold down wages when
demand is weak, but it makes them more likely to increase rapidly again when
recovery takes off. Far from being a means of securing full employment,
decentralised and deregulated labour markets make continued mass
unemployment the only means of keeping down inflation.
The wage/price spiral is, however, only one source of inflation. The other
is the danger of running up against shortages of capacity. The prolonged
period of heavy unemployment has left us without sufficient capacity to
employ the available labour force. The need today is for investment in
additional capacity. The experience of the 1980s, however, is bound to make
managers cautious, as the recent CBI and Bank of England surveys of target
rates of return indicate.
A more plentiful supply of equity capital and less reliance on loans and
overdrafts could help smaller companies survive any temporary recessions.
But with larger companies, it is primarily a case of the UK and other
governments being able to demonstrate their determination to follow more
expansionary policies. Only the US has as yet shown any signs of moving in
this direction. As long as any recovery is likely to be halted in mid-stride
for fear of inflation - as talk of higher interest rates suggests -
companies will be reluctant to invest in new capacity.
If the restoration of full employment is to be more than empty rhetoric,
fundamental changes in attitudes are essential, with a greater willingness
to adopt co-operative solutions to economic problems. The CBI and the TUC
could make a big contribution by ignoring pejorative comments about a
'return to corporatism' and by sitting down together to thrash out an
understanding on pay for the private and public sectors. If this is
'politically impossible', then so is full employment.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Tension rises when the chips are down: Louise Kehoe on
increasing fears that world demand for semi-conductors is set to outstrip
manufacturers' capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 150bn dollar question is hanging over the future of the world
semiconductor industry. This is the amount that most industry executives say
must be spent on new chip plants over the next five or six years if
production is to keep pace with projected demand. But there are doubts that
manufacturers will spend it.
Chip makers worldwide are expected to spend a record Dollars 18bn on new
plant and plant expansions this year. Even at this rate of capital
investment, however, the industry is unlikely to achieve its end-of-century
goal, prompting a top executive to predict a serious shortage of
semiconductor chips.
'It is either a lack of resources or a lack of guts' that is holding back
semiconductor industry capital investment, says Dr Gordon Moore, chairman
and co-founder of Intel, the world's largest chip maker. Whatever the
reason, he believes that 'investment is far from that required to sustain
the growth in silicon processing'.
The shortfall has potentially broad economic implications, far beyond the
bounds of the chip industry. Sometimes described as the 'crude oil of the
information age', semiconductor technology fuels the entire Dollars 700bn a
year electronics sector, which includes computers, telecommunications and
consumer electronics. A wide range of industries that rely upon electronics
for factory automation or information processing could also feel the
effects.
'Either the (semiconductor) industry growth will slow, or we are entering a
period of high undercapacity. I see little evidence of the slowing of
growth,' says Dr Moore. His 'Moore's Law', which describes the advance of
chip technology in terms of a doubling of the number of transistors per
silicon chip every 18 months, has held true for more than two decades.
Indeed, world semiconductor sales have grown at an average 16 per cent a
year over the past 20 years, despite cyclical peaks and troughs in the
market. This year, worldwide merchant semiconductor sales (excluding chips
produced by companies for their own use) are expected to top Dollars 100bn.
By 1998, world chip sales are projected to reach Dollars 160bn and industry
revenues are projected to be about Dollars 225bn by 2000, according to
Integrated Circuit Engineering, a semiconductor market research group.
What is harder to predict is where the greatest increases in demand for
chips will be. Today the surge in personal computer sales is driving growth
in the semiconductor industry, and most observers expect that PCs will
continue to be the biggest market for chips for many years. But these tiny
squares of silicon etched with microminiature electronic circuits are now
ubiquitous, hidden within the works of everything from cars to
communications satellites.
Future products that might consume huge quantities of semiconductor devices
include TV 'set top boxes' that link homes to information superhighways and
pocket telephones, which are expected to be as common as blue jeans early
next century.
Even if forecasts for semiconductor demand are optimistic, chip makers will
have to invest more heavily if they are to continue to produce ever more
complex devices. Only the newest, state-of-the-art fabrication plants -
'fabs' in industry jargon - can produce the latest generations of
microprocessors and memory chips.
Already, there is a shortage of 'advanced' chip production capacity, says Mr
Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research, a semiconductor industry
consulting group whose clients include the Clinton administration. 'And
there will continue to be a shortage of capacity for the foreseeable
future,' he says.
Obsolete plant is not being replaced or upgraded sufficiently quickly, says
Mr Hutcheson. It will take 50 years to replace all of the 'fabs' needed for
production at current capital spending rates, he predicts.
The biggest problem facing the chip industry is the rapidly rising cost of
new plant, as equipment becomes more sophisticated to meet ever more
exacting specifications. Since the mid-1970s the cost of building a state of
the art, economically viable new chip 'fab' has risen from about Dollars 20m
to as much as Dollars 1bn. And the cost continues to climb 'almost
exponentially', says Dr Moore. 'We are well on our way to Dollars 2bn
semiconductor plants.'
Intel estimates it will spend about Dollars 5bn to produce its latest
Pentium microprocessors, the brains of powerful PCs, in peak volumes. This
is five times the cost of peak production of the current generation of 486
microprocessors. Mitsubishi, a Japanese chip maker, says it will need a
Dollars 15bn investment in order to be able to produce one gigabit memory
chips (devices that can store 1,000m bits of information) around 2000.
Despite the rising cost of chip production, however, the industry's rate of
capital spending has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years at
about 20 per cent of revenues.
As costs rise, the number of companies that can afford to participate in the
semiconductor industry is dwindling, so limiting the industry's sources of
investment. Only a few 'big spenders' remain. These include Intel, planning
capital expenditure this year of Dollars 2.4bn, and Motorola, the second
largest US chip maker, with a Dollars 1.7bn capital budget. Korean and
Taiwanese semiconductor producers are also rapidly expanding production,
with Samsung, the Korean producer, setting the pace with planned investments
this year of about Dollars 1.1bn.
Lagging the rest of the industry are most Japanese chip makers. After
leading the world in semiconductor capital spending throughout the 1980s,
the Japanese industry halted most of fresh capital investment in 1992 when
its domestic economy went into recession.
'For years, Japanese conglomerates could afford to allow their semiconductor
divisions to spend freely on capital additions, even through downturns in
the semiconductor market,' says Bill McClean of Integrated Circuit
Engineering.
Since 1992, however, the non-semiconductor operations of the Japanese
conglomerates have performed poorly, drying up the source of capital for
their semiconductor operations. Japanese companies are starting to invest
again, and are expected to spend about Y655bn (Dollars 6.5bn) this year on
new plant for chip manufacture, up 17 per cent on last year but still 24 per
cent below 1991 investment levels.
In an ironic reversal of fears in the mid-1980s that Japanese companies
would dominate the semiconductor market, US chip makers now worry that some
Japanese companies will scale back their involvement, creating a void that
may be hard to fill.
For those companies staying in the market, particularly the few that can
afford to build Dollars 1bn plants at the rate of about one each year, the
semiconductor business is becoming increasingly profitable. Intel recorded
pre-tax profits of almost Dollars 2bn, or 36 per cent of revenues, for the
first half of this year, an industry record. Korea's memory chip makers are
also reaping the rewards of their heavy investments in manufacturing
capacity, says Mr Hutcheson, with profit margins on Dynamic Random Access
Memory chips topping 30 per cent.
Dr Moore looks forward to the day when the price of Intel's chips will
reflect their performance and be 'based on the value of the product, rather
than its manufacturing costs'. While price based on product value may not be
unusual in other industries, it is a radical departure from trends in the
semiconductor business.
For as long as anyone can remember, the 'price per bit' - a measure of the
cost of the computing power or storage capacity of a semiconductor chip -
has been declining. Today, the price of a 4 megabit memory chip is about the
same as the 1989 price of a 1 megabit memory chip. In other words, the price
per bit is a quarter of what it was five years ago.
If this trend were to be reversed, it could lead to some big changes in the
computer industry. No longer, for example, would the average selling price
of PCs decline while computing power increased.
'By about 2003 or 2004 we are going to see the real cost of computing power
turn upwards,' Mr Hutcheson predicts. 'We are going to see a massive
increase in chip prices.'
In an industry where one year forecasts are suspect, predictions beyond 2000
must be regarded as speculative. Nonetheless, it appears that unless there
is a significant increase in capital investment in the semiconductor
industry over the next few years, the era of ever cheaper chips may be
drawing to a close.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Blind users of blank tapes object to
levy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I write to refute the point made by Wayne Bickerton of the Music
Copyright Reform Group (Letters: August 24) that blind users of blank tapes
would not be hit by the European Commission's proposals on the introduction
of a blank tape levy.
Access to information is one of the main problems facing the 1m blind and
partially sighted people in the UK - tape often provides the solution. The
importance of tape is increasingly acknowledged by information providers;
and it is vital to encourage further use of tape as a communication medium.
It is clear that the majority of visually impaired people do not infringe
copyright in their use of tape.
The MCRG claims that the proposal will allow member states to exempt or
compensate blind users of tape. The Royal National Institute for the Blind
has consistently opposed the introduction of a blank tape levy because we
are unconvinced that it is possible to create a comprehensive and workable
exemption scheme, due to cost and bureaucracy problems.
RNIB therefore feels that the difficulties of developing an exemption scheme
raise serious questions about the introduction of a blank tape levy. It
believes there can be no justification for a levy when blind people use tape
for the purposes of overcoming disability.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fundamental revision of water
charging is required
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr ALAN HOLMANS and Mrs STEPHANIE HOLMANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professor John Kay (Personal View: 'Clever trick but the cracks
remain', August 16) pointed out that a large part of the water industry's
present investment programme comprises environmental capital expenditure.
Householders are not simply paying for water and sewerage services, as they
are for gas and electricity supplies. They are also paying for purer water
and cleaner rivers and beaches. In this respect water charging is
fundamentally different from gas and electricity pricing.
It is the principal reason why there are 'inflation plus' price limits for
the water companies, as against 'inflation minus' for British Gas and the
regional electricity companies. It is also the main reason for much larger
inter-regional disparities in water charges than in the charges of other
utilities.
Water charges have to cover two separate sets of capital expenditure - to
meet a growing demand and improve security of supply, and to produce
environmental benefits. The former is the normal activity of a utility,
similar to that of the gas and electricity industries. Environmental
benefits, however, are 'public goods' (available to all, whether or not they
have paid for them). Ideally, public goods should be tax-financed. But water
charges contain a large compulsory element, because water is a natural
monopoly with no real substitute and is also a necessity.
If the environmental component of water charges is treated as a de facto tax
it performs poorly in terms of accepted tax principles. There are arbitrary
geographical disparities. Because most domestic water charges still depend
on the former rateable values, their incidence is regressive. Rate rebates
mitigated the regressiveness of domestic rates. There is no similar scheme
for water charges.
When rates were the local tax, the rate support grant system included an
equalisation element to produce equal rate poundages for equal expenditure,
in relation to need, across all authorities. The costs and finances of purer
water and cleaner rivers and beaches should also be equalised nationally.
Present arrangements produce pooling within each water company's territory.
Different geographical and historical factors account for large arbitrary
differences in individual water companies' environmental expenditure and
water charges which are not compatible with principles of equitable
taxation.
Amendments to the 1989 legislation would be needed if water charges were to
be split into two parts. The 'tax' component of water charges should be
based on national equalisation of environmental costs and finances. It
should also be related more closely to the ability to pay, via a rebate
scheme. The charges for water utility services, on the other hand, could
continue to be determined by Ofwat within the existing regulatory framework.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: NVQs and sales professionalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD BERRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report on the professionalism of salespeople, or lack of it,
('Unloved and incompetent', August 25) is, sadly, largely true. The Kinnaird
survey findings are similar to those of the Sales Qualifications Board's
survey, published last year at the launch of the first sales NVQs.
Apart from the self-employed sector, total employment costs, last year, of
the UK's 400,000 salesmen and women, were Pounds 11.8bn - 4 per cent of
their companies' total sales revenue and, in many cases, their largest
overhead. Our survey showed that less than 5 per cent had any recognised
qualification in selling and that none of these qualifications were to any
nationally agreed standard of competence.
The sales NVQs now on offer, have been designed not just to focus training
on the essential competencies required of salespeople in any industry, but
to give salespeople the opportunity to be part of a recognised profession.
More than 300 companies have embarked on the process of becoming assessment
centres for sales NVQs, which shows that the industry does recognise the
problem.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: One other choice for Remploy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From ELAINE CRUIKSHANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was saddened by the statement by Remploy's chief executive that,
while he had known about the UK government's intention to axe the priority
scheme for companies employing disabled workers for more than a year, he had
assumed that he had no choice but to accept the government's plan ('Remploy
chief hits back at Portillo', August 24).
Clearly one can criticise Mr Michael Portillo's action, as Mr Worthey is now
doing. However, it is regrettable that the chief executive of Remploy should
unquestioningly have accepted the words of the UK employment minister,
without having recourse to the European Commission, at whose door the blame
for withdrawal of the scheme is being laid. Had he done so, he might have
learned that the German government is drafting a law based on the UK scheme,
apparently with the European Commission's blessing.
As many companies and organisations with a representation in Brussels can
confirm, the very reason for having independent sources of information is
that government and industry viewpoints on issues will inevitably diverge.
While the easiest and most comfortable methods of keeping abreast of
policies which affect British industry would be through UK government
departments, it pays to remember that political expediency or opportunity
may often direct ministers' policies and actions.
For this reason, Mr Worthey's sad testament should be taken to heart, not
only by Remploy's employees, but also by other British industry
organisations not active in Brussels.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Arts: Lano and Woodley triumph - Perrier Award
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Worries that the Edinburgh Fringe was degenerating into little more than a
comedy festival were relieved this year when a number of consciously
humorous productions registering for the Fringe fell sharply. Even so the
annual Perrier Award for the best comedy act on the Fringe always arouses
interest and creates considerable ripples.
The joy for the winner is not the money - Perrier gets away very lightly
with just Pounds 3,000 and a few guaranteed bookings - but the certainty of
a sharp rise in performance fees, and the near certainty of a television
series. Led by Channel 4, the TV companies have been quick to see the new
generation of comedians as cheap material which might just attract the
elusive youth audience. Frank Skinner, Sean Hughes and Lee Evans are the
most recent Perrier winners to feature prominently on the screens.
On Saturday night, in the unlikely surroundings of the Waverley Shopping
Centre, Lano and Woodley were named 1994 winners of the Perrier.
It was something of a shock. Colin Lane and Frank Wood are Australians and
unknown in the UK. Their victory is the kind of revelatory discovery which
makes the Fringe worthwhile. Perhaps even more encouraging, they are not
stand-ups - a form of egotistical paranoia with only incidental links to the
comic - which thankfully seems to be in decline.
Lano and Woodley are a double act, firmly in the tradition of other comic
acts. Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello and Morecambe and Wise would
instantly welcome them to the brotherhood. Lano is the good-looking one who
(in his own mind at least) ruts all night. Woodley is the screwball, never
able to get a date. They live together in comfortable bickering. The act is
as wholesome and light-hearted as you could wish. It pleases many and
offends none and would comfortably transfer to TV.
Lane and Wood are actors and are able to improvise around the routines.
There is audience participation as Woodley tries to prove that he can
persuade a girl in the audience to kiss him.
After the years of political correctness; full frontal bawdy; and surreal
exhibitionism, the Fringe has finally come up with winners in the musical
hall tradition. Lano and Woodley can be seen at the Lyric Shaftesbury Avenue
in October in a festival of the Perrier short list. Other contestants of the
prize, all stand-up comedians, were Alan Davies, Harry Hill, Jeff Green,
Owen O'Neill and the American Robert Schimmel.

<TEXT>
If you are not keen on either cosy middlebrow nostalgia or the stuff
endlessly extruded these days by Hollywood, then you might be best advised
to ignore television today and opt instead for a restaurant or the cinema.
If cash flow is sticky you could try a nice long bath and lots of radio.
Those with 3 1/2 hours to spare can hear the Glyndebourne 'Don Giovanni' in
BBC Proms 1994 (7.00 Radio 3). Or at 7.45 Radio 4 offers Lillian Hellman's
1935 play The Children's Hour, about accusations of lesbianism in an
American girls' school. If you are keen on cosy middlebrow nostalgia then
you are in clover. Following on from Saturday's tribute to Lew Grade, the
two BBC channels offer a host of old ATV programmes beginning at 5.00 with
episodes from four series: Sir Francis Drake (1962); The Buccaneers (1956)
with Robert Shaw as the reformed pirate Dan Tempest; The Adventures Of
William Tell (1958); and, most successful of them all, The Adventures of
Robin Hood with Richard Greene in the title role. At 10.30 BBC1 screens an
episode of The Saint starring Roger Moore, followed by Jason King, the Peter
Wyngarde series (11.20).

FT  29 AUG 94 / Arts: Wagner - discord and dynasty / Bayreuth, the world's
most celebrated music festival, is the focus of a bitter family struggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This story is better than any soap opera, and it still has a long way to
run. It is about the Wagner clan - a dynasty at loggerheads over an
inheritance. The current head of the clan is Wolfgang, who has just
published his autobiography and celebrates his 75th birthday tomorrow. The
treasure he guards is the Bayreuth Festival, founded by his grandfather in
1876. The supporting cast is a gaggle of next-generation Wagners, hoping to
grab a share of the inheritance when Wolfgang dies.
The festival has long been Wolfgang's personal fief. He chooses the artists,
welcomes visiting dignitaries, holds forth in a thick Franconian accent from
the stage curtain, and is a formidable presence behind the scenes. Together
with his elder brother Wieland, he revived the festival after the second
world war, freeing it of its disastrous association with Nazism. He has run
it alone since Wieland's death in 1966. Bayreuth has been his life.
For all who work at the festival, Wolfgang is an avuncular, silver-haired
figure, who knows his grandfather's operas inside out. To his many critics
and enemies, he is the Bayreuth blockhead: stupid, arrogant, mulish and
greedy. His family liken him to Fafner hoarding the gold in The Ring - a
dragon who will not let them near the treasure.
Wolfgang's autobiography, Acts*, is his attempt to set the record straight -
before his children, nephews and nieces (all aged around 50) publish their
own bitter versions of the truth. It is a catalogue of gossip and
self-justification, a settling of old scores, a pent-up reaction to years of
sniping at him and his second wife Gudrun. He calls it an interim report, a
statement of accounts, 'as one who is still an active and creative
participant'. His own Bayreuth productions may be old hat, but he will
probably carry on working until he dies.
Despite a jumbled narrative and much pedantic detail, Acts is easy to read -
but it is unlikely to enhance Wolfgang's reputation. This is no memoir of a
worldly-wise philosopher who has risen above the fray, nor does it
adequately reflect his vast knowledge and experience. Never having harboured
intellectual pretensions, Wolfgang gives a skimpy analysis of the festival's
artistic development. He was always the Handwerker, the plodding journeyman
more concerned with safeguarding the archives, balancing the books and
consolidating the fabric of the Festspielhaus, than conjuring new artistic
visions in the manner of his elder brother.
The book underlines the long shadow which Wieland has cast over Wolfgang's
life. It opens, perversely, with a detailed description of the atmosphere
and intrigues surrounding Wieland's death. Wolfgang's claim that their
relationship was based on brotherly love carries little conviction. He
scolds Wieland for trying to sell priceless manuscripts in 1945, for
rejecting their English-born mother after the war, for excluding him from
the 'fireside chats' at which Wieland decided artistic policy with his
cronies. Reading between the lines, one senses Wolfgang's resentment: from
their earliest childhood, Wieland was the anointed one.
So the picture of Wieland that emerges is cool and compromised. The only
references that carry weight are when Wolfgang describes his brother as
'incapable of handling financial matters properly', and says Wieland's
affair with the young Anja Silja was sparked by her unerring feel for his
theatrical ideas.
Wolfgang's vituperative attacks on Wieland's wife and children are tame
compared to the hostility he shows towards his late sister Friedelind. Like
the younger-generation Wagners today, her pot-shots from the sidelines were
a constant embarrassment. Wolfgang says he never possessed 'the fabulous
brilliance and absolute predestination characteristic of many other members
of the Wagner family. These qualities seem to preclude their involvement in
subordinate activities, but have often prompted them to lay vehement but
unjustified claim to positions of paramount authority'.
And that is why he has done everything he can to stop the next generation
succeeding him. For Wolfgang, the survival of the festival is more important
than the continuing involvement of the Wagner family. 'The mere statement 'I
am a Wagner' has long ceased to be an open sesame.' In his eyes, none of the
younger Wagners has the necessary training or proved their qualifications
independently - and few observers would disagree. Much of the book seems an
apology for the irrevocable breach in relations with his son Gottfried and
daughter Eva, children of his first wife Ellen. Apart from Gudrun and his
parents, the only member of the family to merit affection is his 16-year old
daughter Katharina.
The book is a poor reflection of Wolfgang's better side - his openness, his
sense of duty, his ability to inspire team spirit - but it does offer some
interesting nuggets. The only time the festival orchestra ever went on
strike was in reaction to an outburst of abuse from Toscanini in 1931. Free
tickets were handed out for some performances in the early 1950s, because
there was insufficient demand from the paying public - a far cry from today.
When asked to stage the centenary Ring, Peter Stein wanted the four parts
condensed to two. Wolfgang also reveals that the 1981 Ponnelle Tristan (for
which he shows little regard) was the most expensive production ever staged
at Bayreuth.
Walter Legge, Peter Hall and Georg Solti ('downright aggressive') are the
target of predictable brickbats. Hitler, who made the first of many visits
to the Wagner household in 1923, is let off lightly. There are good
anecdotes about Knappertsbusch and Karajan, who demanded his own WC and
headed his correspondence from the Festspielhaus with the word 'management'.
The dull account of Bayreuth's recent history is leavened by shafts of
dogged realism: 'If something misfired, the public tended to lay the blame
at my door; if it succeeded, I had no part in its success.'
One of the book's leitmotifs is the unwavering wisdom of Bayreuth's civic
leaders, and their ability to serve the festival's best interests. Most of
Wolfgang's life has been dedicated to that same purpose. When the time comes
to choose a successor, Wolfgang will probably not be around to influence the
decision. Under the statutes of the Richard Wagner Foundation, which
Wolfgang and his mother set up in 1973 to preserve the festival's
independence and protect it from family in-fighting, candidates from the
Wagner family must be considered, but there is ample leeway to appoint an
outsider.
Gudrun, 50, is a possibility - the festival has a history of widows
inheriting the mantle of power. However, most Bayreuth observers reckon she
will not command enough support within the foundation, which is dominated by
public funding bodies. The most likely outcome is that an experienced
intendant will be brought in. The link with the Wagner family will be cut.
It will be the end of Bayreuth as we know it.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Media Futures: Diller warns against industry's stampede -
Raymond Snoddy reports on the QVC chairman's Edinburgh speech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barry Diller, chairman of QVC, the innovative TV home-shopping channel, has
issued a stark warning that major corporations are launching multi-million -
and even multi-billion - dollar experiments in new media convergences
without any understanding of what these convergences are really
about.
Diller's company grew by exploiting television, telecommunications and
computers. But he says there are those in these industries who are doing
'truly stupid things' in anticipation of enormous markets that do not yet
exist.
'Telecom companies, broadcasters, book publishers, silicon chippers and
software companies fear that, if they don't rush helter-skelter into each
other's businesses, the great dance of the next century will pass them by,'
Diller said at the weekend.
He was giving the annual Worldview international lecture at the Edinburgh
International Television Festival. The entertainment executive, who recently
failed in his attempt to merge QVC with CBS, the US broadcasting giant, said
that Hollywood was going to Silicon Valley and vice versa - each thinking
the other would succeed, but not exactly sure at what.
At the same time publishers were spending millions of dollars digitalising
books and magazines, and slapping them on to floppy disks and CD-ROMS, in
the happy belief that all their intellectual properties are naturally
interactive - 'whatever that means'.
The mega-Titans, the telephone and cable companies, were fighting over who
gets into each other's businesses fastest, in the belief that all will be
well if they can just own the content that flows down their wires.
'It's more complicated - and a lot simpler - than that,' said Diller, who
added: 'All these companies' intentions are good, but I think, regrettably,
the networks to multimedia hell are going to be wired with good intentions.'
The crippling mistakes that most people are making is to insist on defining
convergence along the dimensions of technological innovation, and by
defining convergence as a 'natural extension' of their existing businesses.
The result is that the programmers, 'those organisers of the creative
process', are playing the smallest, rather than the largest, role in the
truly radical transformations now under way in the communication industries.
The programmers must be encouraged to play the role 'of the spark, the
ignition to do new things, to make new programmes, to get audiences to
respond in new ways. The aim should not be to turn a personal computer into
a TV set, a book into a personal computer or a video game into into a movie.
'It means having the willingness to subordinate your media expertise,
instead of imposing it. It means treating a new medium on its own terms, not
yours. It means having the patience to relax and follow your curiousity,
instead of hyperventilating and chasing the crowd,' said Diller.
As as example of new thinking, the QVC chairman said the one area where he
invested in research at the home-shopping channel was in creating 'smart
agent technology'. This is software that puts together a profile in great
depth, 'about who you are, what you like and what you are interested in'. It
creates a 'sensitive' duplicate of an individual inside the memory of the
computer. This can then be matched in milli-seconds with a database of goods
and services.
'I think smart agents are going to be the single most important mechanism
for empowering the entire industry. It will finally make mass media fit the
individual.
'When it does, people will change their habits. And when people change their
habits, watch out,' he concluded.

FT  29 AUG 94 / People: Contacts and superstition - . . . were the building
blocks of Thailand's largest hotel chain. Now, founder Chanut Piyaoui plans
to expand abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a woman who says demurely that she knows little about finance or
economics, Khunying Chanut Piyaoui is doing remarkably well. She is the
founder and managing director of the Dusit Thani group, Thailand's largest
hotel chain.
Now aged 72, Chanut (Khunying, roughly equivalent to 'Lady', is a title
bestowed on women by Thai monarchs) built Bangkok's first modern
international hotel 25 years ago. 'I didn't know about finance - I just
wanted the best,' she says.
She went on to establish and manage luxury hotels all over Thailand as
tourism and business travel rapidly increased in the 1970s and 1980s. The
company, which last year made a net profit of Bt 214m (Dollars 8.6m) on
turnover of Bt 1.03bn, also holds the Thai franchise for Best Western, the
US hotel chain.
On the advice of a fellow director - her son, Chanin Donavanik - Dusit has
recently made substantial investments overseas, partly because the growth of
tourism in Thailand has started to slow and hotel profits have fallen.
'I would like to invest overseas, not to make a lot of money, but because I
want to present Thai customs, Thai tradition, Thai art and culture, Thai
food and hospitality.'
This apparent high-mindedness, along with her supposed ignorance of
financial matters is taken with more than a pinch of salt by those who do
business with her. The judgment of one foreign business consultant in
Bangkok is perhaps more revealing: 'She's as tough as nails and knows
everything that is going on.'
Those qualities may become more familiar to foreign hoteliers as her group
embarks on an ambitious plan to internationalise its operations with hotels
in China and Vietnam and in southern Europe.
Like other ethnic Chinese tycoons in Asia, Chanut has fostered an authorised
 -and thoroughly bowdlerised - version of her life story. Her father came
from the Chinese island of Hainan and owned a saw-mill, but he lost his
business when he pledged the property as a loan guarantee for a friend who
subsequently defaulted; her mother owned a rice-mill.
Chanut's education in Bangkok was disrupted by the second world war and the
Japanese occupation of Thailand. Her subsequent attempts to study for a
degree in the US were stymied by her poor English.
She was, however, impressed by American hotels and motels, and she returned
to Bangkok in her mid-twenties to put up a 60-room hotel called 'The
Princess' which opened in 1949. At that time most Thai hotels were regarded
as brothels. The women who ran them were seen as traditional mama-sans, not
hotel managers.
Chanut set out to change all that. She saw the hotel business as a way to
become an independent businesswoman. The venture was not a success, but the
difficulties she faced - and her stays in the Waldorf Astoria in New York
and the Georges V in Paris - gave her the idea of building the five-star
Dusit Thani as 'the landmark of Bangkok'.
The distinctive triangular Japanese-designed hotel, was the tallest building
in the Thai capital when it was built in 1970, remains the centrepiece of
the Dusit Thani chain. It is patronised by the Thai royal family and
aristocracy as well as foreign business executives and tourists.
Chanut's struggle to raise the Dollars 20m that was eventually needed to
open the hotel has become the stuff of Thai business legend. She is all the
more remarkable for being a single woman - a divorcee who calls herself
'chairperson' of the company - in an Asian business world dominated by men.
'It was very difficult at that time, especially as a woman,' she says, 'but
most people were kind, so I was able to make it . . . I didn't have any
collateral and I went to see one of the smallest banks and asked the manager
to help me. I knew him and his family but the money I needed was much higher
than their registered capital, so they asked another bank and they both
guaranteed a loan without collateral.'
It was not the last time that she displayed an instinct for business
opportunities which more than makes up for her lack of formal training. For
example, the Dusit Thani's lobby was enlarged after Chanut saw the 400-seat
jumbo jets being built in Seattle where she was attending a tourism
conference.
She ended a management contract with the Westin group after two years
because the profits she was earning were not high enough to pay off her
debts. That decision enabled Dusit Thani to grow into a hotel management
company in its own right.
The official version of Chanut's career and the growth of the Dusit Thani
chain concentrates on the triumphs rather than the failures. Yet the group
has not been free from controversy. It has been accused more than once of
damaging or trying to profit from what remains of Thailand's natural
environment.
The most notable example is the recently-opened Rayavadee resort in southern
Thailand which is managed by Dusit. Environmentalists say the hotel is
illegally sited in a national park, although Chanut says there is a title
deed that proves otherwise.
The official history of her life is so sparse that it leaves much of her
business activities since the Japanese occupation in the realm of gossip.
Yet one factor in her rise is abundantly clear. Personal relationships are
vital to business in Thailand and Chanut's success reflects the quality of
her connections.
Her friendships with members of the Thai royal family have been crucial,
but, like all royal matters in Thailand, they are not subject to public
scrutiny. Suffice it to say that Princess Galyani, the King's elder sister,
opened Chanut's first hotel in Bangkok four decades ago and many
subsequently. The land for the Dusit Thani was leased from the Crown
Property Bureau.
Political influence and good connections with the Chinese business community
are more important than either luck or financial acumen for commercial
success in Thailand. Chanut has influence in abundance. Asked if she still
relied on personal contacts more than anything else in her business, she
replies 'yes', but quickly changes the subject. How business is really done
is never part of the authorised version in Thailand.
Those contacts will be less useful as the group expands internationally,
especially outside Asia. Nevertheless Chanut has sanctioned an ambitious
drive overseas.
In 1992, Dusit bought a stake in The Melrose in Dallas, Texas, and now
manages the property; it opened its first hotel in Indonesia in June this
year; it is investing in a resort development in Majorca; the first Dusit
resort in Nepal is due to open in 1996; it runs Vietnamese restaurants in
Tokyo and Berne; and further deals are being negotiated in China, Vietnam
and elsewhere.
The Thai name Dusit Thani, Chanut agrees, is not easy to market
internationally, but she is loyal to it. Dusit Thani, the 'City in Heaven',
was the name given to a proposed utopian town by the late King Rama VI.
Chanut prayed to his statue for permission to use it for her first big
hotel.
The belief that the success of her business is wrapped up with divine forces
as well as royal friendships highlights another aspect of her business
style. Chanut, in common with many Chinese entrepreneurs, is superstitious.
Her foreign partners will find she uses a powerful device to determine the
best date for opening a hotel: she consults the Chinese calendar to find a
lucky date.

FT  29 AUG 94 / People (Names in the News): Sprangare - back to the woods?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not many business leaders are courageous enough to describe a strategic
alliance they have masterminded as a 'complete failure,' writes Christopher
Brown-Humes.
Yet Bjorn Sprangare, announcing his resignation last week as the chief
executive of Swedish insurer Trygg-Hansa, was being disarmingly frank about
his performance. Yes, there had been mistakes, he admitted. Yes, the public
had lost confidence in him. And, yes, his departure might make it easier for
Trygg to get the banking licence it has long coveted.
No one deal unseated Sprangare - rather it was a series of investments that
unhappily coincided with the crisis in Sweden's financial sector and brought
the company huge losses. But he had his successes, too; he steered Trygg
through a difficult demutualisation.
The good news for Sprangare's successor (yet to be chosen) is that Trygg's
domestic insurance business is in good shape. The bad news is that the
group's difficulties with its investment in the US insurer, Home, continue.
After Home's initial public offering misfired last year, Trygg now has a
bigger chunk of Home than it wanted. Action is urgent given the heavy losses
which Home inflicted on Trygg's mid-term figures.
In truth, Sprangare always looked slightly uncomfortable in the world of
financial services, given that his previous career was in the pulp and paper
sector. It will be interesting to see whether the call of the woods for this
doctor of forest science, whose favourite hobby is retiring to the woods and
chopping down trees, is strong enough to lure him back to forestry now.

FT  29 AUG 94 / People (Names in the News): Sibley - magic of Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicholas Sibley, the deputy chairman charged with launching the investment
banking joint venture between National Westminster Bank and Wheelock, the
Hong Kong trading house, makes no bones about the primary attraction of his
new role: it's based in the Far East, writes Louise Lucas.
Hong Kong's magic first bit him in 1972, when he became director of Jardine
Fleming, the broking arm which is jointly owned by Robert Fleming - with
which Sibley had spent the previous two years - and Jardine Matheson, the
colony's oldest hong.
Eleven years later he found himself back with parent Robert Fleming in
London, but discovered the city was a very changed place: 'It was the old
problem of relative decline and what happens as a result.'
There was envy to contend with too: 'Everyone rather resented the fact that
you had spent time overseas while they had lived through the Wilson and
Callaghan socialist paradises and had just found themselves getting poorer.'
So in 1986 he joined Barclays de Zoete Wedd, later becoming chairman of the
group's Asia Pacific operation. He joined Wheelock as managing director of
Wheelock CIC in February of this year.
He retains the jovial demeanour and impeccable qualifications of a Jardine
man - educated at Trinity College, Oxford, doing his national service as
second lieutenant with the VIII King's Royal Irish Hussars and training as
an accountant.
But he is finding today's Hong Kong somewhat different from the early 1970s.
There are more strange faces and not so many cocktail parties; instead, work
takes up a lot of his time. He has no problem at all with 1997, viewing it
even as a slight plus: 'We'll get rid of all the political nonsense that's
been developed here over the past couple of years'. (A time span
corresponding to Patten's tenure and introduction of an extended democracy.)
His trips to China are few but illuminating: 'You don't expect to find
yourself suddenly, at the age of 56, in a karaoke bar in Chengdu, but
anything in the pursuit of business.'
His immediate tasks are to recruit a chief executive officer for Wheelock
NatWest, due to be launched around the turn of the year, and then divisional
heads. After so long in the world of investment banking, he is confident he
will know every name on the headhunters' shortlists.

FT  29 AUG 94 / People (Names in the News): Government veteran heads Chicago
Fed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago is a non-banker with
political connections. He has spent more time in Washington in the past
decade than he has on the bank's home turf, a five-state area that includes
Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin, writes Laurie Morse.
Michael Moskow will assume the Chicago Fed's presidency in September. An
economist with a doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania, Moskow
served the Bush Administration as Deputy US Trade Representative, working
for Carla Hills. In that job he was a principal negotiator for both the
North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
A Republican stalwart of 56, he also served for seven years in the
Nixon/Ford administration in various posts, and for a time was Nixon's
undersecretary of labor. When not in government service, Moskow held
executive positions at several corporations in the Chicago area.
Since leaving the Bush White House, Moskow has been teaching strategy and
international management at Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate
School of Management. His appointment to the Chicago Fed brings unusual
experience in international economics and trade to the regional bank, whose
territory includes both rust-belt and grain-belt industries that are the
US's largest exporters.
Moskow will have about a year to become accustomed to bank policy before he
becomes a voting member of the Federal Reserve's policy-making body, the
Federal Open Market Committee. Only five of the 12 regional Fed presidents
get to vote on monetary policy at any one time. It's Chicago's turn next
year.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Media Futures: A fever caused by fear - Victoria Griffith on
the race by US publishers to get on-line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US publications have been racing to go on-line over the last 18 months. The
Chicago Tribune, the San Jose Mercury News, the New York Times and Time
magazine are all now available through personal computer on-line services,
and the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post and Newsweek will be on-line
by the end of the year.
The on-line fever appears to be partly motivated by fear. 'A lot of people
in this sector are afraid,' says John Lux, on-line editor of the Chicago
Tribune. 'We were battered by other technologies such as radio and
television, and people think the information highway might shrink us again.
I think newspapers will be around for a long time. But we also have an
opportunity to embrace this new technology, and put some life into a staid
industry.'
Newspapers and magazines are still feeling their way in the electronic
world. 'We're going to be shaping the service as we go along,' says Victor
Perry, vice president of new business development of the Los Angeles Times.
'This is new to us. We don't pretend to have all the answers, but it's
important to get on the learning curve now. Newspapers without on-line
services will be left behind.'
The first step for most publications is to make their articles available -
usually for a fee - to users of an on-line service. The number of people who
will actually read newspapers on-line, though, is probably very limited.
'It's not an ideal way to browse a newspaper,' says Robert Ingle, president
and executive editor of the San Jose Mercury News. 'The amount you pay to
load the articles into your computer over the telephone is more expensive
than buying a paper, and most people don't enjoy reading text on a computer
screen. For on-line services to take the place of newspapers you need
technology such as a flat panel, an easily portable screen, and wireless
communication.'
Still, some demand for on-line articles exists. Readers often like to access
local newspapers when they are out of town. They also get to read the
articles earlier, since publications usually make material available several
hours - or in the case of Time magazine, one or two days - before the
printed version.
On-line graphics are also improving. More publications are offering
photographs through the wire. The Washington Post plans to introduce a
service which resembles a newspaper layout, complete with headlines,
photographs and captions. Newsweek will include sound in its package.
Because the demand for on-line reading is limited, publications are trying
to lure in customers with other services. Many of the on-line newspapers,
for instance, offer extensive data bases. The Chicago Tribune and the San
Jose Mercury News services allow readers to pull out past articles and
supplementary information. A piece on the crime bill, for instance, would
probably include a detailed history of its struggle through Congress. The
New York Times, Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times also plan to offer
plenty of local interest information, such as restaurant and entertainment
guides. The guides would be coupled with past reviews from the newspapers.
Interactivity - or communication with readers - is also a key selling point
of the services. Almost all the services provide bulletin boards for readers
to post comments and questions on articles they have seen. The New York
Times holds formal, schedules sessions during which readers can 'talk'
on-line to journalists and editors. Time magazine has hosted celebrity
hours, during which readers can communicate electronically with well-known
personalities.
'Interactivity is one of the main reasons people subscribe to a service like
this,' says Richard Duncan, executive editor of Time magazine. 'It's an
important way for journalists, who are usually too much in their own world,
to get in touch with their readers.'
Publications are unsure, though, how far interactivity can be taken. 'It can
quickly get to the point that demands on journalists will become
overwhelming,' says Duncan of Time. 'If journalists answer every inquiry, it
would eventually take up all their time. But if you hire specialists to
answer the letters, it defeats the purpose of the interactivity. The
industry will have to sort this out.'
Other questions remain unresolved. Pricing issues, for instance, will be
essential to the services' success, and advertising will play a key role in
keeping down costs. 'Advertisements are crucial to allow us to provide the
service at a low cost,' says Michael Rogers, managing editor of Newsweek
InterActive. Yet publications are unsure how best to integrate advertising.
Many hope to allow readers to purchase items from advertisers directly
on-line in the near future. The Los Angeles Times also plans to provide
catalogues, and advertising packages on-line. 'For instance, we could run a
What's New at Walt Disney programme as an on-line form of advertisement,'
says Perry, of the Los Angeles Times.
It is also unclear how much updating readers will demand from the on-line
publications. 'We do a certain amount of updating during the day,' says Mark
Potts, director of product development for Digital Ink, the on-line arm of
the Washington Post. 'If our own stories aren't updated, readers can access
updates through the wire services, like Reuters and the Associated Press. We
don't have the resources to update everything, though.'
Despite the uncertainties, on-line services have already established a firm
place in the news industry. Consumers may not cancel their subscriptions for
printed news yet, but many seem ready to plug into electronic information.
For the old-fashioned newspaper and magazine industry, the on-line services
may provide an important impetus to an otherwise slow-growing market.

Tennis
August 29 to September 11, US Open Tennis Championships, Flushing Meadow,
New York
The richest tennis tournament of the year starts today. Record prize money
of Dollars 9.36m is at stake on the unyielding hard courts at the US
National Tennis Center - an arena famed for testing competitors' fitness and
sapping their stamina. That may be a daunting thought for top seed Pete
Sampras as he attempts to become the first man since Jimmy Connors (1974)
and Mats Wilander (1988) to win three Grand Slam titles in the same year.
Sampras is still suffering from the effects of an ankle injury at Wimbledon.
Andre Agassi will be the people's choice. But watch out for back-in-form
Boris Becker, coming off recent tournament wins in Los Angeles and New
Haven.
Motor Racing
August 30, Michael Schumacher appeal in Paris
Schumacher's bid to become the youngest world motor racing champion suffered
a severe blow yesterday when the 25-year-old German was disqualified for a
rules infringement after passing the chequered flag first in the Belgian
Grand Prix. He could face another setback on Tuesday, when he appeals to the
Federation Internationale de l'Automobile's Court of Appeal against the
two-race suspension imposed last month for ignoring a black flag during the
British Grand Prix. He will have in mind the fate of Eddie Irvine who
earlier this year appealed against a one-race ban for his part in a
three-car collision in Brazil. Irvine left Paris with his suspension
increased to three races.
Cricket
September 3, NatWest Trophy Final, Lord's, London
Victory in the NatWest final will be the next step in Warwickshire's bid to
pull off an unprecedented sweep of all four major English cricket
competitions in a season. The county is well placed to take both the County
Championship and the Sunday League. Warwickshire's opponents on Saturday are
Worcestershire, the team they beat in the Benson and Hedges Cup.

The oldest profession in the world makes use of modern mass media to make
its point. An Open Space Special shown at a post-post watershed hour
(Tuesday 11.15-11.55, BBC2) is given over to John Bratherton, 26, a
Cambridge philosophy graduate who has made a career decision to go into
prostitution. The programme begins in shadow, with Bratherton's identity
disguised, but within seconds he's had enough. And that is the point he is
trying to make: that the clandestine, murky view of his world is not
entirely accurate and he wants to balance that picture by appearing on
television. We see Bratherton, punting down the Cam, and there is even an
interview with the other kind of punter - a married man with a family. It's
a brave film to make not least because the Inland Revenue might be watching.
The latest and most dreaded management buzzword - 'upward appraisal' - is
analysed in The Business (Thursday, 7.30-8.00, BBC2). The theory is that if
employees turn the tables on their bosses and anatomise their performance it
will lead to better performance all round. Federal Express has been using it
for over a decade and is zealous about its efficacy - a bad report can
affect a manager's pay, bonuses and long-term survival. WH Smith and BP are
at the early stages of introducing it and the cameras snoop on a
denunciation session where a BP manager is subjected to a critique by his
colleagues.
The programme claims that upward appraisal is a powerful weapon for those
with a grudge against the boss and that in many companies managers are
feeling like marked men. Alas there are no interviews with any of them.
A marked man who is very much in evidence is Colin Firth in a new series of
The Ruth Rendell Mystery (Friday 9.00-10.00, ITV), which begins with Master
of the Moor in which Firth is Stephen Walby, the chief suspect in a murder
hunt. As a child, Stephen dreams that he comes across a corpse on the moors,
and then another, and another. To his horror, his dreams come true and the
police believe that he is the man responsible. Although not as engaging as
the Wexford series, all of which have now been filmed and transmitted, this
will not disappoint Rendell fans. For those for whom only Wexford will do,
the good news is that Rendell is writing another and plans to film it are
already in progress.
Firth's first major TV appearance was in Tumbledown, the Charles Wood play
about a Falkland veteran which created vast controversy. Now Wood has come
up with another play about soldiers, A Breed of Heroes (Sunday 9.30-11.00,
BBC1), which begins a new season of Screen One. Adapted from the novel by
Alan Judd, the piece, set in Belfast in 1971, is a comedy drama in which our
hero, played by Samuel West, has to take over from the battalion press
officer who has shot himself in the foot - literally. The actors were given
several weeks army training, with the officers separated from the other
ranks - and it shows.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Sport: The myth that leads to drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday the Commonwealth Games ended their two-week hold over Victoria,
Canada and BBC television. When I was growing up, this short reign seemed to
have a tremendous importance - second only to that of the Olympics, and cast
in the same grand mould. To win a Commonwealth Games title was highly
impressive and, whatever its colour, a Games medal had true prestige.
Now these titles look like something quaint. Top athletes compete for them
in a spirit of benign patronage, bestowing themselves upon their event
rather as they might visit an ageing great aunt. If by some terrible fluke
their medal is not gold, then it might as well have come out of a cracker
for all the pleasure it gives them to receive it.
Athletics has changed so much since the mid-1980s that it is hard, too, for
the spectator to show the deference of old towards the Commonwealth Games.
Accustomed as one is to seeing world class line-ups at the flick of a
switch, it is impossible to take a proper interest in athletes whom one has
never heard of, and whom one will never lay eyes on again after the race.
Impossible, too, not to feel the absurdity that places nonentities side by
side with superstars, and pits genuine amateurs against amateurs who have
mysteriously earned hundreds of thousands of pounds. Athletes are competing
in the same arena but in two different spheres: that of good club runner and
the other of the world class talent. If an owner were to enter a greyhound
in a 400 metre race against dogs capable of running two seconds faster,
people would think him insane. In athletics however, this seems to be quite
acceptable.
What I love is the way the commentators strive towards egalitarianism.
Moving through the line-up for the race, the degree of quavery respect in
David Coleman's voice will remain the same whether he is introducing Colin
Jackson, or, let us say, Nifty Mwambe in lane eight - 'now 36, was a Zambian
youth champion'. Of course commentators can rightly do nothing else. But
still I like to hear them do it; it seems so mannerly, somehow, like
watching a man be as politely flirtatious with a plain woman as with a
pretty one.
The Commonwealth Games are mannerly. They retain the grace and good humour
that I remember from years ago, and this can be seen in the demeanour of the
athletes - no Dennis Mitchell's here. The superstars seem far happier than
usual; partly, of course, because they are more likely than usual to win,
but also, perhaps, because they are in closer contact than usual with their
club running roots.
It is strange really. In a sense one feels that, despite the vast disparity
between Colin Jackson and Nifty Mwambe, this event brings them together and
suffuses them with the same spirit. In another sense one wonders what the
hell they are doing running against each other. Yes, the superstars are
relaxed, more like real people than the highly-defined images that they have
become to us. But this charming event is not the reality of their lives. The
reality is something much more intense. It is an inescapable part of a much
tougher modern world, and in it they are playing for much higher stakes.
Over the past few years athletes have become, en masse, a phenomenon. They
have come to define an absolute of physicality, which is a quality so
worshipped by our society that the athletes too are worshipped, not merely
for what they do but for what they are: young, fit, dedicated, successful.
Encouraged by the money men, who recognised and exploited this phenomenon,
athletes now act the part for their worshippers. Can you remember how they
used to look, those white shorts flapping like handkerchiefs, those dank
cotton vests, those unselfconscious bodies that never advertised the feats
of which they were capable? Compare them with the glistening peacocks of
today, strutting in their second skin of virulent lycra, and full of the
sense that they are the cynosure of millions of envious eyes. In fact
athletes seem as fascinated by their physicality as we are; together we
collude in forcing the myth that they are almost god-like.
If this myth clings lightly to every athlete, then it positively embraces
the superstars. This is a heavy burden to bear, for all the rewards it
brings. It is very nice to be worshipped. However, when expectations are not
just high but almost unreal, failure assumes an inappropriate significance:
if either Jackson, Christie or Gunnell had lost at the Commonwealth Games,
obituaries of their talent would have been written immediately.
Meanwhile, the mass of unknowns, standing in the lanes around them, yearn
towards their deified image; yearn to leap the cavern that separates
nonentities from superstars. Is it any wonder that there are those within
the world of athletics who will do anything to enhance their abilities?
Probably only if the myth of the god-like athlete were to be exploded would
the problem of drugs disappear.
And, paradoxically, if anything were to explode the myth, it would be the
drug people. The extraordinary recent success of athletics has fed a monster
within it. Watching the Commonwealth Games, one had the oddest sense that
those past and present of athletics were there at the same time; events were
conducted in true, uplifting, amateur spirit, yet who knew if any of the
athletes were what they seemed? One had the sense too, that if athletics
were to have a decent future, free of the taint that now touches both guilty
and innocent, then it would do well to look to its past for guidance.

Those London audiences lucky enough to have seen the Royal Opera's
production of Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg, one of Covent Garden's
unequivocal successes of last season, will enjoy the first-ever digital
recording of one of Wagner's more tuneful works, conducted by the
highly-experienced Wagnerian, Wolfgang Sawallisch on EMI. Excellent
performances by Bernd Weikl as Sachs, Ben Heppner as Walther and Cheryl
Studer as Eva are memorably backed by the Bayerische Staatsoper orchestra
and chorus.
Those latter-day Meistersingers, Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano
Pavarotti, chose a suitably demotic setting, the Dodger Stadium in Los
Angeles, in which to repeat the triumph of their World Cup celebration in
1990. The Three Tenors in Concert 1994 (Teldec) is trailed as a recording of
'the biggest concert in the world', a grandiose claim seemingly untroubled
by the possibility that many of the 1bn television spectators were only
waiting for the real business of the day - the World Cup Final.
Zubin Mehta once again conducts; this time it is the Los Angeles
Philharmonic Orchestra which gets to play all our favourite tunes. Hard to
avoid the feeling, however, that the Three Tenors phenomenon has probably
outlived its artistic usefulness, notwithstanding the tremendous boost it
has given opera since that starry night at the baths of Caracella in Rome.
Since his Genesis days, Peter Gabriel has had a reputation for being among
the most pioneering of all live rock acts; his Peter Gabriel Secret World
Live (Real World/Virgin) was recorded in Modena, Italy from last year's
international tour, and features a predictable selection of favourites.
Best, perhaps, to see the video, directed by Francois (32 Short Films about
Glenn Gould) Girard and featuring a highly theatrical show co-produced by
Gabriel and Robert Le Page.
Eeriest release of the week is Jeff Buckley's intriguing Grace (Columbia),
for the extraordinary similarity he bears to his late father, the much
under-rated and idiosyncratic singer-songwriter Tim. Seven tracks are
self-penned, while there are fascinating cover versions of Benjamin
Britten's Corpus Christie Carol and Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah.

Whenever summer's 'dog days' officially begin and end, they are right with
us now in the cinema. After a warm-up act from the funniest canine of the
year in The Mask - a mini-mutt capable of as many disguises as star Jim
Carrey - we have a show-stealing Great Dane in the French film Le Parfum
D'Yvonne (stylish if languid '50s love story) and Jack Nicholson going
barking mad in Wolf.
Wolves are not dogs, we know. But Nicholson himself plays a jolly dog of a
New York publisher who turns into something hairy and toothy at each full
moon.
Some critics have ventured that Wolf itself is a dog. But if the special
effects disappoint, Nicholson does not. Here are the suave elan, the teasing
cheese-grater voice (supplied with top-class epigrams) and the irresistibly
mobile, satanic eyebrows.
The most powerful 'dog' film of the year, though, contains no dogs at all:
nor any other animals apart from human ones. It is Reservoir Dogs, now back
on wide release. Like its fellow success de scandale of early 1994, Man
Bites Dog, (the motif is inescapable), it gives a new ferocity and a black
wit to movie violence. Half a dozen robbers hole up in a warehouse after a
heist and then proceed, as quarrels multiply, to put holes in each other.
Quentin Tarantino's searingly scripted film makes the words as deadly and
well-targeted as the ammunition. Modern cinema's answer to Jacobean
melodrama.
You can always cool yourself afterwards in the calm waters of Great British
Acting. London's Barbican cinema mounts an Anthony Hopkins retrospective
this week and next, with all the Welsh master's best films on show from The
Lion In Winter and The Elephant Man to The Silence Of The Lambs. And just to
prove that there are some modern movies without an animal in the title,
Hopkins's great performance in The Remains Of The Day can now be seen both
at the Barbican and on video.

FT  29 AUG 94 / This Week: FT guide to US healthcare debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US government has spent months trying to reform the US healthcare
system, but politicians still spend their time saying that the US has the
best medical care in the world. What's wrong with the current system?
There are two main problems: it costs too much - almost twice as much, in
proportion to the size of the economy, as it does in any other developed
country - and it doesn't cover everyone. Most people get health insurance
from their employer as part of their pay. The elderly are covered by a
government programme called Medicare, and military veterans get care in
Veterans Administration hospitals. Another government programme, called
Medicaid, provides some medical cover for the very poor. But that leaves 35m
to 40m people, most of them working for small businesses or in seasonal
jobs, without any insurance, and the number has been growing steadily. At
the same time, medical expenses have been rising twice as fast as the
general rate of inflation. This puts severe pressure not only on companies
who are paying for insurance, but also on the federal budget. The
Congressional Budget Office last week estimated that Medicare and Medicaid
costs, which today amount to 3.7 per cent of gross domestic product, will
make up 6.2 per cent in ten years time.
What are the ideas for dealing with this?
President Bill Clinton's original plan would have extended health insurance
to everyone by requiring employers to provide insurance to their workers,
and pay at least 80 per cent of the cost. That idea is still in the bill now
up for consideration in the House of Representatives, but no-one gives it
much chance of passing. The Senate, meanwhile, is considering a bill which
draws some elements from the original Clinton plan, but sets itself the less
ambitious goal of covering 95 per cent of the population by the year 2000.
It would offer insurance subsidies, particularly to low income families,
pregnant women and children. If that does not bring enough people into the
health insurance net, a commission would recommend additional measures. And
if Congress failed to act on those, a requirement for employers to provide
insurance to their workers - similar to the Clinton plan but making
employers pay only half the cost - would come into effect as a fallback.
Would this get costs under control?
No-one is very keen on the payment limits the Clinton plan would have
imposed, but not many people are confident that market forces alone are
going to bring medical inflation to heel. The Senate bill proposes its own
curb on prices: a 25 per cent tax on high cost health plans which raise
their prices by more than a target rate. At the same time, any significant
reform is going to cost the government more, at least for the first five or
ten years, because of the money it will take to subsidise insurance for
those who now have none.
Don't the Republicans have any ideas?
The Republicans have been just as divided as the Democrats on what to do
about the health system. Some right wingers have been working to block any
reform at all, and most of the party is now on their side. But some
moderates have been working with Democrats at the centre of the party to
build a 'mainstream coalition', and if a bill is to pass, it will probably
be with their help.
Isn't there anything everyone agrees on?
Yes. Virtually every bill includes measures to stop insurance companies from
turning down an applicant because of an existing medical condition, or from
cancelling their cover when they or a family member gets sick. Premiums
would have to be set on the basis of a whole community, not on how healthy
an applicant appears. Almost everyone wants to raise the tax on a packet of
cigarettes by 45 cents, which would help pay for some of the other reforms.
When is Congress actually going to finish this reform?
Possibly never. The Senate is debating some of the more peripheral issues at
numbing length, while the House hasn't even started debate. If both chambers
pass a bill, they would then have to reconcile their two versions and vote
again on the combined bill. Even the Democrats who want reform now fear they
are running out of time to do that before they have to go home to campaign
for the November elections. That leaves two options: start again next year
with a new Congress, or pass a barebones bill that includes some new rules
for health insurance companies but not much else.
Wouldn't Mr Clinton veto a barebones bill that doesn't cover everyone?
That's what he promised earlier this year. His problem is that no-one
believes he will actually do it if Congress passes anything that could
remotely be described as significant reform.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Architecture: Rough guide to English churches - Colin Amery
on one of the best ways to learn about history and architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the season for church calling - a greatly underestimated summer
activity that somehow has the undeserved reputation of being confined to
young fogies, wearing tweed jackets and riding old fashioned bicycles.
Looking at churches, as I have been in Norfolk and Suffolk in the past week,
is a remarkably painless way of studying history and architecture. It helps
in understanding their relationship to the countryside. But how easy is it
to enlarge one's knowledge and understanding when faced with the average
description of a parish church in the typed leaflets provided, or in the
vicar's guidebook?
Take a typical example: 'The church and tower are Perp but traces of Norman
work remain. The south aisle is Dec, while the porch is a fine Perp example
with good flushwork decoration in checkerboard pattern, with two orders of
fleurons at the entrance. The chancel was renewed in 1848 but the stepped
triple lancet window remains Perp. The piscina and sedilia clearly belong to
the mid-13th century, as do the poppy heads on the choir stalls. Much of the
furnishing is very much renewed and considerable damage was caused to the
church by the iconoclasts. Note the fine brasses and hatchments.'
Is a translation needed, or at least some key that can open the door into
the arcane Perp and Dec and early English? The most natural place to turn
for enlightenment would be The Buildings of England by Nikolaus Pevsner, the
invaluable Penguin Guides to all the counties of England. This great German
refugee professor did what only a German could do. He methodically tackled
the task of listing and visiting every building in England and describing
them in an inimitable way that was both accurate and opinionated. Only
Pevsner could write the sentence that says: 'The Perp font as usual,
octagonal', assuming realms of knowledge that most readers are unlikely to
have.
It was Sir John Betjeman who memorably described Pevsner as 'Herr Professor
Doktor' - implying quite rightly that architectural scholarship has its
place but is not much use if it cannot enlighten and communicate.
The only thing that really matters when you visit an old church, or examine
an historic building, is to understand how to look. Once you learn to spot
the clues - and it is easy enough - then visual discrimination and the
detective work of architectural history can begin.
When it comes to churches here is a rough guide. The Norman style of
architecture was developed in England from 1050 to 1200. You can recognise
it by its use of the round arch and the fact that most Norman buildings are
very big and solid. This solidity meant that there was no need for large
projecting buttresses. Towers are usually square and the place for richly
carved ornaments is around doorways. You can tell the difference between
early and later Norman work by the thickness of the mortar joints. In the
11th century they were wide and coarse, while in the 12th century they
became fine and exact. Much of Durham Cathedral is Norman.
Out of the Norman style emerged the national Gothic style, which is known as
Early English or EE. It was struggling to life in 1150 but really flourished
for the whole of the 13th century. The arches are pointed and the buildings
less fortress like. They also become lighter. Spires appeared and roofs
became steeply pitched. Vaults were no longer barrel shaped but became
pointed and groined. Decoration became less geometric and more naturalistic
 -carved foliage can be seen. Salisbury Cathedral is the best example of
this style.
It was inevitable that the cool refinement of the early English style would
develop into something more elaborate and that is why the Decorated (Dec)
evolved during the period 1290 to 1350. This style achieved something that
modern architects have never been able to do: ornament became an integral
part of the constructional elements of a building. Windows became much wider
and gained strength from stone tracery based upon simple geometric designs.
Wooden roofs became more elaborate, while piers and columns became slender.
Lincoln Cathedral is a good example of the Decorated style.
Perp stands for the perpendicular style and its dates are 1350 to 1530. It
looks as it sounds. All the emphasis is upon the vertical. This style
represents the ultimate in Gothic architecture. The best way to learn what
Perp is is to look at Kings College Chapel in Cambridge. The elaborate 'fan
tracery' of the roof is the culmination of Gothic vaulting. Arches are
flatter and the flying buttress developed at this time to support walls that
were sometimes composed entirely of glass. Walls that are not windows are
covered with panels that emphasise the vertical nature of these tall Gothic
buildings.
Part of the fun of church calling is not just mastering the basic stylistic
differences but noticing the local variations of style and materials. In
East Anglia, for example, there is a characteristic use of flint. Sometimes
the flint is knapped (made smooth) and sometimes it is contrasted with stone
in Heraldic patterns - this is known as flushwork. It is a regional art form
of a very high order.
Churches are potent with the palimpsests of architectural as well as
national history. The secret to unlocking their pleasure is learning the
basic language and recognising different styles as you see them. Then
churches become strange and wonderful changing things. They are an endless
source of character and beauty.

Four airlines are banning smoking on their transatlantic flights.
The most sweeping change comes from Delta Air Lines which says it will ban
smoking completely on all flights between the US and Europe from January 1,
citing overwhelming support from passengers for the move. It will be the
first US carrier to introduce a total ban on transatlantic flights. From
October 1, American Airlines will extend no-smoking services to two out of
six
daily flights between New York and London and to one out of two flights
between Chicago and London. And from October 30 United Airlines, already
experimenting with no-smoking flights on several international routes, will
extend a smoking ban to two out of three of its flights between New York and
London.
British Airways is also widening a no-smoking experiment on October 30 to
embrace one of its five daily flights between London and New York and all
transatlantic routes to and from Canada.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Management: Digging deeper and wider - BHP is moving further
afield but it will not forget its Australian roots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Broken Hill Proprietary's presentation to shareholders in Sydney could have
been taken from a modern marketing manager's manual. Held in a giant
auditorium, it had overhead slides, bold graphics and plenty of razzamatazz.
Then, as the meeting was thrown open to questions, a gentlemen in the
audience rose to his feet. 'I can remember when you were running the
Newcastle (Australia) steelworks in the 1970s . . .' he told Brian Loton,
BHP's chairman, as he launched into a long reminiscence. The BHP executive,
half-charmed and half-embarrassed, listened patiently, before quickly
steering the meeting back to business.
The incident last year, although trivial, seemed to sum up the dichotomy
which surrounds the Australian resources group. On the one hand, it runs an
ADollars 30bn (Pounds 14.2bn) portfolio of businesses worldwide, ranging
from coal mines in Indonesia to oil rigs in the Irish Sea. A fifth of its
shares are held internationally and in key divisions - such as petroleum -
much of the staff and management are outside its home country.
On the other hand the tug of BHP's roots is also strong - and not always
entirely welcome. There is, for example, a peculiarly Australian share
structure, which has BHP owning half of another company which in turn owns
almost 20 per cent of BHP. There is an ADollars 2.2bn investment in Fosters,
the Melbourne-based brewing group, which is carried in the books at
significantly more than its current market value and has nothing to do with
BHP's core operations. 'It's a big credibility question,' says one analyst.
In addition, although overseas interests are growing by leaps and bounds,
the fact remains that the bulk of BHP's money is still made in its home
country. About 70 per cent of group assets are held there.
There is nothing unusual about a formerly domestic company reaching a point
where its growing international interests create a string of dilemmas over
expansion and diversification strategy, and over organisation structure. But
BHP's case is interesting for two reasons.
First, the company is curiously bound up with Australia's national psyche.
'For 50 years, BHP has held a dominance in Australian economic life such as
no company, to my knowledge, had ever exercised over the US economy,'
Geoffrey Blainey, a historian, has commented. Even now, the company accounts
for 1.5 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, and is frequently
referred to as the 'Big Australian'.
This status adds quite significantly to management responsibility. 'We are
always being asked to do this or that nationally by industry organisations,
and government,' says John Prescott, managing director. 'It's usually far
more than we can handle. We try to speak when asked.'
That, however, does not mean that the group escapes criticism for not doing
more. Some mining industry players, for example, wondered whether BHP should
have taken the lead more forcibly during last year's debate over Australia's
Native Title legislation and the issue of Aboriginal land rights.
Second, BHP is the only Australian company that can fairly claim to be
making a 'global' leap at present. Other groups of comparable size and
status include News International, the media company, and National Australia
Bank. But the former remains the personal fief of Rupert Murdoch, while NAB
operates only in the Australian, Irish and UK markets.
BHP admits that being out on this sort of limb brings unique pressures. The
company, says Prescott, has used management consultants 'sometimes for
extended periods, particularly to help us overcome the isolation of BHP in
Australia, to understand what the rest of the world is doing by way of best
practice'.
Most of BHP's development outside Australia has occurred during the past
decade. During the first four years of this period the company's management
was also wrestling with rival takeover attentions from Robert Holmes a
Court's Bell Resources and John Elliott's Elders IXL.
Peace was finally bought in 1988, although the price is still evident in the
controversial Fosters holding and the circular share structure. In spite of
belated changes made to this last week, it could still provide takeover and
management protection and hence could retard share price performance.
All the same, many observers believe in retrospect that the long and complex
struggle with the two entrepreneurs also brought benefits - forcing BHP to
take a more aggressive management approach and shaking up a complacent
bureaucracy.
Whether or not this is an accurate assessment, the tussle did coincide with
a sharply increased international focus at the resources group. In 1982,
BHP's sales from operations outside Australia were just ADollars 87m. By
1992-93, helped by a mixture of acquisitions, investments and exploration
work, they had grown to more than ADollars 5bn.
Even today, however, the extent to which BHP has 'globalised' its operations
varies markedly between divisions. The company has four main operating
areas: steel, minerals, petroleum and 'services', which includes a range of
businesses from shipping to engineering consultancy. This structure was put
in place in 1985, although there have been refinements since. 'The broad
thrust is to organise on product lines - generally based on worldwide
groupings of products,' says Prescott.
The petroleum division, which includes Hamilton Oil, is generally seen as
the most internationally-focused. About 70 per cent of employees are based
outside Australia and recent chief executives have been recruited from
outside the company. (Peter Willcox, who stepped down earlier this year,
came from Amoco; his replacement, John O'Connor, from Mobil).
The minerals side, too, is highly diversified and much of the management
conducted from San Francisco, thanks to the purchase of Utah International's
mining interests from US General Electric in 1984. Steel, by contrast, is
described by one analyst as 'more or less Australian'. The current
generation of top head-office executives has also been drawn heavily from
this division's ranks: Loton, Prescott and two divisional bosses all worked
their way up through steel.
In financial terms, BHP's structure and its range of interests has served
shareholders quite well recently - in contrast to the performance a decade
ago - and most pundits acknowledge that the spread of interests and their
slightly different business cycles are advantageous.
Earnings dipped in 1991-92, but have since risen steadily. In the latest 12
months, to end-May, operating profit after interest rose by almost 30 per
cent, to ADollars 1.28bn. The BHP share price has also been strong,
outperforming the Australian stockmarket by 120 per cent since 1988 and the
mining sector by a similar amount.
In the current year the company admits it will have its difficulties.
Nevertheless, analysts seem fairly confident that another year of steady
performance is in sight. Barring sudden commodity price movements, market
estimates suggest that profits of ADollars 1.4bn could be achieved.
Looking longer-term, much will depend on the scale and efficiency with which
BHP spends its development funds. To achieve a 10 per cent profits growth
and using a target rate of 15 per cent for return on equity, David Rubin at
ANZ McCaughan calculates that BHP needs to commit around ADollars 1bn to new
projects each year - on top of the replacement capital expenditure to
replenish depleting assets.
In fact, over the past five years, the total capital and investment
programme has topped ADollars 12.5bn. Gearing, meanwhile, has come down
about 35 per cent, and the company has been at pains to stress that it
intends to avoid a 'lazy (underused) balance sheet'.
'We have the capacity to fund any substantial new investment opportunity
that should arise,' Graham Heely, the finance director, told analysts at the
results presentation in July, prompting speculation that a multi-billion
deal could be in sight.
BHP has enthused about two potential channels for expansion. The first is
direct reduced iron (DRI) - a process which involves the reduction of
high-grade iron ore concentrate using natural gas. The resulting iron is
made into small, transportable briquettes, which can be fed directly into
the new generation of mini-mills.
Ideally, the production system requires high-grade iron ore and natural gas
to be in close proximity - a situation that exists in Western Australia's
Pilbara region, but is only becoming a feasible option with the opening of
the gas market. This month, BHP announced it was seeking environmental
approvals for the construction of an ADollars 750m DRI plant in the region,
indicating the final feasibility studies are in progress.
The second is power generation, predominantly offshore, and probably in the
growth markets of Asia and South America. This attracts some scepticism,
since it would take BHP into a new area of operation. The company, however,
claims such a move is a fairly natural progression from existing
energy-related activities.
Indeed, while BHP is only examining possibilities at present, Prescott does
not quarrel with the notion that power generation might eventually form a
fifth leg to the business. 'It could be a self-contained entity, although it
would have to work closely with the rest of the group. But it may well be a
core operation,' he says.
On the organisational front, Prescott recognises that some changes will
probably be necessary as the company comes to terms with its growing global
spread. BHP, he suggests, may need to move from its divisional structure
towards a 'matrix' of the sort especially common among big US
multinationals, where the product divisions and a geographical management
network are superimposed on each other. Because of their complexity, such
structures are often controversial and difficult to operate.
'The current structure may not give the best means of promoting BHP in a new
part of the world,' he continues. 'It might be better if we had a structure
which allowed us to present our credentials collectively in a country where
we were not well known. Rather than have our steel business go in
separately, then our minerals business, then our petroleum business . . .
perhaps there should be a 'Mr BHP' who would be the single focus of contact
in each particular country.'
The company is already tending 'to move a little bit in that direction',
Prescott adds. Its president of BHP Japan serves as a single point of
contact for all businesses there, and it is implementing the same concept in
China and Russia.
But what nationality is 'Mr BHP Japan'? Prescott admits that he is
Australian - 'well, actually a Scotsman' - but quickly adds that on the
divisional side of the structure the senior iron ore, coal, transportation
and steel salespeople are locals.
'It's only in recent years that I could say that - it's a bit of a change,'
he remarks. For BHP, it is really a revolution.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Management: High days, holidays and hard work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today is a statutory public holiday in Britain - one of a dozen or so,
depending on where people live. What is the occasion for celebration that
warrants the loss of billions of working hours? Is it Trafalgar Day, VE Day,
St George's Day? No, it is merely the last Monday in August - a cause for
national rejoicing.
Britain has about the same number of public holidays as the US, France and
Italy. But Switzerland, the country with the highest GDP in the world, has
only seven, though individual cantons do have their own as well.
This set me thinking whether I could do a latter-day Weberian analysis. It
was the sociologist Max Weber who 90 years ago showed that the Protestant
countries were (and still are) richer than the Catholic countries. He
attributed this to the now-famous Protestant work ethic, with its emphasis
on hard work, asceticism, industriousness and frugality.
Is it possible, I wondered, that a country's number of public holidays is a
simple index of its economic success? So I looked up the economic dragons of
the Pacific Rim - Hong Kong and South Korea have as many as 18, Japan 14.
Even Germany appears to have one of the highest numbers in Europe.
It seems there is a link, but opposite to my theory. Could it be that the
hard-working citizens of the Pacific Rim need to rest more often because of
their long-hours of toil? Or perhaps they simply need more time to spend
their yen.
The sight of a male colleague dousing himself with an expensive cologne
rather surprised me recently. Had he, I wondered, been influenced by
research that has indeed shown there is a sweet smell of success?
In an American study conducted in the 1980s by a social psychologist, a
woman was interviewed for a job by a number of interviewers. It was the same
woman, in the same room, applying for the same job and giving standard
answers. But for one group of selectors she wore no perfume, for another a
less-preferred brand and for a third a popular musk-based brand. The
selectors were required to rate her on abilities such as communication
skills, conscientiousness and numeracy.
The researchers showed reliably that those who interviewed the woman when
she was generously sprayed in the popular brand of fragrance gave her higher
ratings on nearly all the competencies.
Whilst it might be true that after-shave won't exactly compensate for lack
of ability, it might just help to pip others to the winning post. And my
friend splashing it on - he was trying out a new wasp repellant.
Britain's long-running rail strikes provide management researchers with an
excellent opportunity to measure the (intrinsic) motivation of their staff.
The central question is who makes the effort to come to work and who prefers
a spot of rose-pruning. A number of favourite hypotheses could be tested,
such as the higher your rank in the organisation, the more likely you are to
make the effort.
Interesting and important, though difficult and time consuming, this
research is unlikely to be pursued because few organisations attempt to keep
accurate and reliable measures of absenteeism.
Having no way of monitoring absenteeism leaves organisations susceptible to
skivers, hypochondriacs and moonlighters. Further, it makes estimates of
days lost through strikes (or illness) vague and open to manipulation for
political purposes. How many organisations have any accurate idea of the
cost of this rail strike to them?
Some time ago I 'came out' as chronobiologically incompatible with my peers
and the preferences of most organisations. I am a 'lark' - an early bird who
prefers to get up and start work early. In at 6am, home at 4pm. My
colleagues, indeed most of the world, are 'owls' who come alive at the end
of the day. They prefer to saunter in at 10am and leave at 7.30pm.
Why are important meetings scheduled at 11am and 4pm and not 9am and 2pm?
And why is staying late heroic but arriving early eccentric? The business
breakfast imported by the Americans in the heady 1980s seemed not to have
caught on in Britain.
The benefits of life as an early bird are manifold - less traffic, lower
rates of crime, better quality of air - but all are unheeded.
Alas the data are against me again. A string of British studies (funded by
the Medical Research Council) of biological rhythms - measured by body
temperature - show the lowest point is about 3am and the highest about 5pm.
Because people are more vigilant and attentive when warmer it does make
sense, even for larks, to schedule meetings later in the day.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Management: Desert island manager - John Guinness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Guinness, 58, spent most of his career as a diplomat and civil servant
before taking over as chairman of BNFL, the nuclear fuels reprocessing
company, in 1992. In his last nine years as a civil servant he was deputy
secretary then permanent secretary in the Department of Energy and was
responsible for the privatisation of the electricity industry.
Who would you take with you other than your family?
I would have a chat with the Almighty and try to get my former boss, the
late Victor Rothschild. He was the nearest thing to Renaissance man I have
known. He was a fellow of the Royal Society, an expert on the spermatozoa of
the bull, a county cricketer, he could have made a very good career as a
jazz pianist, he wrote the bibliography of English 16th century first
editions and he was a great wit and bon viveur. He was also head of the
Think Tank, where I had two spells in the 1970s.
What would you miss most?
I would miss the opportunity to go to obscure private picture collections. I
have a collection of a quarter of a million photographs of historical
portraits which I have amassed since I was 15. I also advise Sotheby's and
Christie's, sometimes helping to identify portraits.
What would you miss least?
Bureaucracy (in both the private and public sectors), complacency and
negativism.
What would you read?
The first thing would be the Nuclear Installations' Inspectorate's safety
regulations. But then I would ask for Dom David Knowles's four volumes on
English monasticism, one of the great works of English scholarship. I would
also ask for the news pages of the Times and the business pages of the FT.
What film?
Kind Hearts and Coronets. Sir Alec Guinness is the most distinguished person
with the name of Guinness. I only wish I could prove we were cousins.
What drink and food?
I would want fish and chips, especially as there would be so much fish
around the island. It is a food I adore; one of my ambitions is to write a
guide on fish and chip shops from London to Norfolk. I would also want some
diet Coke.
You can have one item of office equipment.
I learned to type when I was 13 and I have always felt comfortable with it.
When I was in the Department of Environment I used to sign off my reports
with 'composed, typed and sent by JRS Guinness.'
But if I had to make a choice it would be a telephone, so that I could talk
to my family and employees.
What vehicle?
I would want to take my 1900 Clement Panhard. It is partly for this reason
that the telephone would be essential. My wife is the engineer of the
family. She can take cars apart and put them together with ease. I could
telephone her and she could tell me how to repair it.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Waste shipments from Thorp plant 'could be cut'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BNFL, the fuels reprocessing company formerly known as British Nuclear
Fuels, could cut the number of shipments overseas of radioactive waste from
its Thorp reprocessing plant from 5,000 to 150, it says in evidence to the
government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee.
It says the reduction could be achieved by introducing a practice known as
substitution. Overseas customers would be given the option of taking an
additional quantity of high-level waste resulting from the reprocessing of
fuel in place of bulkier intermediate and low-level waste. Countries with
Thorp contracts signed since 1976 are required to take back waste which
results from reprocessing.
BNFL has made its evidence available to the public following the publication
earlier this month of the committee's study on substitution, which was
ordered by ministers to help its review of nuclear waste management.
The report supports BNFL's claim that the radiological impact on the
environment of substitution would be neutral. It says, however, that if BNFL
is to be given the option of offering substitution there is a case for a
'small additional quantum of vitrified (glass) waste to be returned over and
above that calculated on radiological grounds alone'.
BNFL said yesterday that it welcomed the committee's advice to the
government and said it should be possible to implement substitution in a way
that accommodated the committee's suggestions on additional waste being
returned abroad.
The government is likely to decide in the next few months, as part of its
review of the nuclear industry, whether to allow substitution.
It will face strong representations from environmental groups such as
Greenpeace which oppose Thorp's operation and the transportation of nuclear
waste materials.
They will be concerned about the increase in transportation of high-level
waste if substitution is implemented and will dispute claims of a neutral
effect on the environment.
BNFL started commissioning Thorp this year after a long legal battle. It
plans to start returning waste to overseas customers around 1998.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Cook urges tight control on loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday called for measures to protect people from 'exorbitant'
interest rates as it unveiled the results of a survey showing that some
moneylenders were offering loans with an annual interest rate of more than
200 per cent.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the Office of Fair
Trading should 'actively monitor' and publicise the rates charged by
licensed moneylenders.
Saying that there were 'gaping holes' in laws intended to protect people
from high interest rates, he urged ministers to review what encouragement
could be given to alternative sources of borrowing for people on low
incomes, such as credit unions.
Mr Cook said Labour's telephone survey - which showed that some lenders were
prepared to offer loans with an annual interest rate of more than 40 times
the current base rate of 5.25 per cent - showed that consumers were likely
to suffer if the government deregulated the credit market.
He said: 'Rather than de-regulating this area of business, the government
needs to tighten it up.'
The government's planned deregulation of consumer credit would 'increase the
burdens on the very poor by removing the few safeguards that they currently
enjoy,' he said.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Lib Dems propose jobless voucher scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers should be paid up to Pounds 150 a week to give jobs to the
long-term unemployed, says a policy paper to be published by the Liberal
Democrats later this week.
The paper, drawn up by leading party figures including Baroness Williams, a
founding member of the former Social Democratic party, also calls for a 2
per cent payroll levy on companies to finance an increase in training.
The paper will be debated at the party's annual conference next month. It
says that social security benefits payable to people unemployed for more
than six months should be converted into vouchers payable to employers, with
a maximum value of Pounds 150 a week.
The value of the vouchers would be reduced by Pounds 1.50 for each week of
employment, avoiding an open-ended commitment by the taxpayer. Employers
would have to pay wages at least equal to the value of the voucher.
Companies would be eligible only if the employees hired were genuine
additions to the workforce, to avoid the displacement of existing workers.
Companies would be required to provide training.
The paper concedes that 'careful monitoring' would be required to prevent
abuses by unscrupulous employers. But it says tax revenue would be boosted.
The average benefit to the Exchequer is estimated at Pounds 23 a week.
The paper says: 'Even if some displacement of existing workers were to
occur, the restoration of hope, confidence and working capacity to
individuals who would otherwise be almost permanently excluded from the
workforce makes it worthwhile.'
The proposal goes much further than Workstart, a similar pilot scheme
launched by the government last year.
The paper says that the training levy would encourage a big increase in
company training schemes. All or part of the levy would be repaid to
companies offering approved schemes, and the net proceeds would be
distributed to local authorities and to training and enterprise councils,
the bodies which administer government training schemes in England and
Wales.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Body Shop document pre-empts expected US attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Body Shop International, the cosmetics and toiletries group, has issued a
32-page document pre-empting an expected broadside on it by Mr Jon Entine, a
US journalist, to be published in US journal Business Ethics on September 1.
Mr Gordon Roddick, Body Shop chairman, said: 'The Body Shop can no longer
sit, wait and allow pre-publicity hype to damage its reputation.'
Speculation over the contents of the article has prompted a 24p fall in Body
Shop's share price to 218p.
The company admits that it has not seen the 25,000-word dossier that Mr
Entine has offered to UK newspapers through his agent. However it has seen
an article submitted by Mr Entine to the magazine Vanity Fair, which was not
published. It is this article, Body Shop believes, that is being offered for
serialisation.
Mr Roddick said the article made 'inaccurate and misleading statements which
were very seriously defamatory'.
The Body Shop document attacks what it believes are Mr Entine's arguments.
It says: His statement of the percentage of Body Shop business which comes
from its Trade Not Aid programme with developing countries is false. 'More
importantly his percentages are beside the point,' although such trading 'is
a small part of all our trade'. Accusations about how Body Shop 'stole' its
name and concept are 'demonstrably false'.
Relationships with its franchisees are healthy and prosperous.
The company acknowledges that it uses synthetic, as well as natural
products, and says that it has made no attempt to hide the fact.
It restates its 'powerful commitment to charitable endeavours' and sets out
its 'efforts to be environmentally responsible', acknowledging that 'any
industrial or commercial activity involves some adverse environmental
impact'.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Top Tory defends 4.7% pay rise for MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government moved yesterday to defend plans to raise MPs' salaries by
more than twice the rate of inflation amid fears that the increase could
undermine its case for public-sector pay restraint.
As union leaders and others lined up to attack the 4.7 per cent increase, Mr
Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, denied that the government had broken
its own guidelines on public-sector pay.
Mr Newton said that over a three-year period, MPs would have been treated in
'precisely the same way as . . . the civil servants with whom their pay has
been linked for many years.'
He added: 'I don't think that any fair-minded person who looked at the
position on this over a three-year period . . . would regard this as either
unreasonable or a breach of pay policy.'
But the increase - well above the 2.3 per cent rise in the retail prices
index in the year to July - was widely criticised by trade union leaders. Mr
Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of Unison, the public services union,
said: 'This is sheer hypocrisy. It is grossly unfair that the government
should impose a three-year pay freeze on 5m public-sector workers and not
set an example within MPs' awards.
'Poorly paid local government and health workers, facing cuts in their
living standards, are bound to be enraged by the government's scandalous
double standards.'
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said: 'Their pay formula rides roughshod over the government's
spurious arguments about pay rises being dependent on increases in
productivity and efficiency.'
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT transport union whose next
strike in a pay dispute with Railtrack starts tomorrow, said: 'My signalling
grade members have been trying to get their claim recognised for seven
years. If the government has devised a formula to meet the particular
circumstances of MPs then we should be able to devise one to fit our
circumstances. If they can shift the goalposts for themselves they can do it
for other groups.'
Ms Liz Symons, general secretary of the First Division Association of top
civil servants, said: 'MPs' pay is now a hopeless muddle. What's really
needed is a complete review of how MPs are paid.'
Details of the MPs' increase could hardly have emerged at a worse time for
the government, with a damaging rail dispute in full swing and Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, expected soon to remind public-sector pay review
bodies that any increases next year must be paid for out of improved
productivity.
The raise, which will take effect from January, will take an MP's basic
salary from Pounds 31,687 a year to Pounds 33,169. The 4.7 per cent figure
comprises 2.7 per cent which MPs were already due to receive as the second
part of a two-stage pay settlement, and an additional 2 per cent to bring
them into line with middle-ranking civil servants with whom their salaries
have been linked.

FT  29 AUG 94 / M&amp;S prepares to accept debit cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marks and Spencer, the UK's most profitable retailer, is preparing to accept
payments by bank debit cards, such as Switch, in addition to its own store
card for the first time.
The food and clothing retailer has long refused to accept credit or debit
cards, saying that transaction charges levied by the card issuers were too
high. Analysts also believe it may have been concerned about the impact of
such a move on its own highly successful charge card, which has about 4m
holders and laid the foundations for its successful move into financial
services.
Its stance has irritated some customers and attracted headlines last year
when its branch in Salisbury, Wiltshire, refused to accept a Visa card from
the Princess of Wales in payment for two shirts.
The company has held successful trials involving debit cards in three stores
and has been in negotiations with banks about debit-card charges for two
years.
It said: 'We would like to extend debit-card payments, but we will only do
that if it is cost-effective for us.'
The company added: 'We have been in fairly lengthy negotiations with the
banks, and we are still talking to them.'
However, it is believed to be close to reaching agreement with the banks. It
is already thought to be making arrangements to extend debit-card payment
facilities throughout the chain, including plans for videos to train staff,
and for visual displays in stores promoting the move.
The company said its discussions had concerned only debit cards, which
function in a similar way to cheques, and not credit cards, which involve a
different method of payment and carry higher charges.
It said it would take some time to introduce card payments throughout its
stores, as new card-reading equipment would have to be installed.
The company's move reflects the growing popularity of credit and debit-card
methods of payment with consumers.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Bill on restrictive trade may be delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A planned strengthening of the law on anti-competitive behaviour may face
further delay because of the pressure on the government's 1994-95
legislative programme.
While the list of measures for inclusion in the Queen's Speech in November
has yet to be finalised, it is understood that reform of legislation on
restrictive trade practices is well down the Department of Trade and
Industry's list of priorities.
High on the DTI's agenda are a possible Post Office privatisation bill and a
bill to deregulate the gas market.
Pressure on legislative time is so heavy that legislation to pave the way
for gas-market reform is thought not to have been included in a list of core
bills for the autumn, agreed by the cabinet last month.
This is in spite of the fact that delaying the bill until 1995-96 would make
it difficult for it to be passed in time to implement plans to open 5 per
cent of the gas supply market in 1996.
The government announced in April last year that it had decided to
strengthen existing law on anti-competitive behaviour while backing away
from radical changes such as the introduction of large fines. The plans
envisage strengthening the law in four ways:
Wider powers for the Office of Fair Trading allowing it to search and seize
documents in certain circumstances.
Additional scope for companies to give undertakings to the OFT which could
be enforced through the courts.
Powers for the director- general of fair trading to make interim orders
prohibiting any further anti-competitive behaviour.
Extension of the law to cover some property rights, such as rights of
access.
Among the reforms rejected by the government were proposals that could have
resulted in companies facing fines of up to 10 per cent of turnover.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Shoppers make a day of Sunday trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shoppers were out in force yesterday, the first Sunday when stores could
open legally under the Sunday Trading Act to sell a full range of goods.
Many customers would find it difficult to notice the difference because some
of the supermarkets, DIY stores and out-of-town retailers have been opening
on Sundays for some time. Only three big retailers were open for the first
time. They were Marks and Spencer, Waitrose and House of Fraser.
For many people it was a Bank holiday family day out, particularly at
shopping centres where free entertainment and shows were laid on.
Mr Paul Keenan, a spokesman for Gateshead's MetroCentre, which has spent
about Pounds 50,000 on publicity, said: 'It's been very, very busy and we
reckon it could well turn out to be the second-busiest day of the week after
Saturday.'
Trade union concerns about Sunday trading appear to have eased. The chief
fear was that employees might be forced to work on Sunday against their
will, or face the sack.
But all shopworkers, including part-timers and those with less than two
years' service, are protected under the Sunday Trading Act from enforced
Sunday work. The only exceptions are those who contract to work exclusively
on Sundays.
Usdaw, the shopworkers union, is happy with the act but is advising
shopworkers not to sign agreements to work on Sundays unless satisfied with
the terms and conditions.
The Keep Sunday Special Campaign was less phlegmatic. It said many staff
were coming under pressure to agree to work on Sundays.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Energy Savings Trust cuts list of proposed projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government-sponsored agency to promote energy efficiency has slashed its
list of proposed projects after failing to win the support of Ofgas and
Offer, the gas and electricity industry regulators, for more ambitious
plans.
Last May the Energy Savings Trust, which is central to the government's
strategy to conserve energy and reduce harmful emissions, said it needed to
raise nearly Pounds 2bn by the end of the decade to meet government targets.
But according to Mr Eoin Lees, executive director, it is now 'just trying to
keep the show on the road'.
The trust is intended to subsidise household improvements which save energy,
passing on the costs through gas and electricity bills. But the only
substantial funding which it has secured so far has been approval from Offer
for electricity saving schemes costing Pounds 25m a year to 1997, and funded
by a Pounds 1-a-year levy on consumers.
The trust is awaiting a decision from Ofgas on a proposal for a similar
level of funding. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general, has opposed EST
projects because, she says, they require the regulator to impose taxes on
consumers.
Earlier this month Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry
regulator, decided against fresh measures to curb demand for energy. He
softened the blow to environmentalists by announcing financial incentives
for electricity companies to cut power losses, which amount to 7 per cent of
the electricity passing through the system.
The trust is unlikely to fare any better with Ofgas. Last month it asked
Ofgas to approve a levy which would raise Pounds 25m a year for five gas
conservation projects. The schemes, which the trust says are supported by
British Gas, would run until 1997.
Ms Spottiswoode is said to be 'giving serious consideration' to the
proposals. But she has repeatedly opposed on principal schemes which require
the regulator to tax consumers.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Lifeline to troubled shipbuilder reaches breaking point:
Chris Tighe analyses the bargaining on which Swan Hunter's fate hinges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week should witness the making or breaking of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside
shipbuilder which has clung tenaciously to life since it passed into
receivership in May last year.
By Wednesday Soffia/Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, the only
prospective bidder to emerge from a worldwide search by receiver Price
Waterhouse, must commit itself to putting cash on the table after more than
six months of negotiations.
The prospects of selling the business as a going concern are extremely slim
if, as seems probable, CMN does not come up with the money.
In that case the receiver is likely to announce that Swans will close in the
autumn once its last vessel, the Type 23 frigate Richmond, is handed over to
the navy - barring the highly unexpected appearance of another bidder.
The French-based, Lebanese-Christian Safa family who are the majority
shareholders in CMN and its parent, Soffia, have spent the weekend in St
Tropez discussing whether to pursue acquisition of Swans.
On Friday Mr Iskandar Safa, Soffia's senior director, and Mr Fred Henderson,
CMN's bid-team leader, blamed their review on doubts about whether the
government and the Ministry of Defence wished to see shipbuilding continue
on Tyneside.
But others involved in the negotiations are becoming impatient with what
they see as prevarication by CMN, presumably in an attempt to drive a hard
bargain.
Mr Dick Gonsalez, Swan Hunter union leader who has fought doggedly to keep
the yard alive, said: 'CMN have got to make their minds up, they have got to
put money where their mouth is. As long as the MoD sees them posturing,
they're going to do the same. It's only when they put real hard cash up that
it will make a difference.'
The receiver's Wednesday deadline is for CMN to start paying the wages of
the yard's remaining 100-strong design and technical team, which is vital to
tendering. They will otherwise be made redundant immediately, ending Swans'
prospects of winning the two-year order book which CMN is insisting on
before buying the company.
The MoD's decision on July 19 to award the Sir Bedivere landing ship refit
to the Rosyth yard rather Swan Hunter had been expected to seal the Tyneside
company's fate.
CMN then came up with a complex proposal to take over Swans' existing MoD
frigates contract and sub-contract the work to the receiver, using the
balance to pay the design team's Pounds 200,000 monthly wage bill until the
end of this year. This would enable Swans to compete for an MoD ocean survey
vessel for which tender invitations were issued last week. If won, it would
provide the two years' work CMN requires.
Under the offer - made after the receiver said CMN's bid was well below
Swans' Pounds 7.2m break-up value - the French company said it would also
pay about Pounds 5m for the assets. It claims a tax-loss deal, subject to
Inland Revenue agreement, could add a further Pounds 5m.
CMN wants Pounds 57.7m for the frigate contract, the price agreed last
month. The MoD, saying that passing time has reduced the risk, last week
offered Pounds 57m, but then suggested meeting CMN half way.
CMN says the issue is not the Pounds 350,000 gap, but the MoD's attitude.
The MoD is unimpressed. An MoD source said: 'We think they've shot
themselves in the foot.'
For Swans' remaining 660 employees this will be a week of numbing tension.
Mr Peter Hilton, a senior electrical designer who has worked at Swans for 30
years, said: 'Everybody is under no illusion. They're all expecting it to
close.'

FT  29 AUG 94 / PowerGen plan for US float angers Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers are angry with PowerGen, the electricity generator, for
threatening to break ranks over the Pounds 4bn sale of the government's
remaining shares in the generators.
The Treasury plans to co-ordinate the sale of its shares in the two
generators, PowerGen and National Power, by publishing a prospectus early
next year. This will link the sale of the two companies by requiring the
public to buy shares in both.
PowerGen, which has outperformed National Power on the UK stock market, is
considering seeking a US listing months ahead of the planned prospectus.
The Treasury is concerned that information on regulatory structure
developments facing the companies may have to be published ahead of
schedule, tying its hands and making it harder for it to control events.
PowerGen's US investors account for 7.5 per cent of its shareholding
compared with National Power's 5 per cent. The generator said: 'The timing
of the US listing is not critical but we would prefer to see it in place a
little ahead of the sale (of the government's remaining shares) to avoid
unnecessary complication.'
PowerGen has told the Treasury that it is 'seriously considering' a US
listing in November.
National Power has made it clear that it has no intention of following
PowerGen and instead plans to wait until next year.
The government expects to start marketing the sale in mid January with a
prospectus following about a month to six weeks later.
Shares would be issued either in late February or early March.
Both generators hope to increase their American shareholding by listing
their shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
Ministers wanted the generators to list their shares in the US
simultaneously with the issuing of all the remaining government shares next
year. It sold 60 per cent of each company when they were privatised three
years ago.
Both companies already have US shareholders who buy shares through American
Depository Receipts on Wall Street but some big US institutions are more
likely to buy shares if the generators are listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Since the public will be required to buy shares in both companies, as in the
March 1991 flotation, when 60 per cent of the shares were sold, the
government wants to co-ordinate the marketing of the shares.
Institutional shareholders will be expected to be given the choice of
splitting their investment between PowerGen and National Power.
PowerGen, however, may not prove susceptible to ministerial pressure to
delay its US listing. It has shown itself to be individually minded, and
quick to spot and take opportunities, such as building gas-fired power
stations.
More recently it repurchased 2.5m of its own shares, representing 0.3 per
cent of the total shares in issue, which it believes could boost earnings
per share and lift dividend payments.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Perkins engine output up 25%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Diesel engine production at Perkins, one of the two largest UK
manufacturers, is running 25 per cent above the levels of last year. That
reflects higher activity in the industrial and construction markets,
especially in the US and the UK.
Daily production is up to 780 engines a day, according to Mr Myles Coleman,
the manufacturing director at Peterborough, the group's main plant, which is
working for nine shifts every five-day week.
Perkins, owned by Varity Corporation of Buffalo, New York, recently reported
sales in the three months to July of Dollars 197m (Pounds 127m), 15 per cent
higher than in the same period last year.
Mr Bruce Anderson, the finance and planning director, said: 'What we've seen
is an acceleration of our basic progress. We've been recovering for 18
months or so.
'Perkins' results are not just a function of the economy. We've successfully
captured a number of accounts.'
Demand for diesel engines has recovered in the UK and the US, but remains
fragile in continental Europe. Sales from Perkins are largely to
manufacturers of construction, electrical and agricultural equipment, whose
growing orders are a response to the level of capital investment.
The other large diesel engine manufacturer in the UK is Cummins, also
US-owned, whose main plant is in Darlington. Its strength is in the market
for road vehicles.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Philips to boost capacity with Pounds 100m investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Philips Components, the division of the Dutch electrical and electronics
group which makes television picture tubes and special ceramics, plans to
invest Pounds 100m before 1997 to increase capacity at its UK manufacturing
plants.
Almost three-quarters of the total will be spent on the company's
colour-picture tubes factory in Durham. A further Pounds 10m will be spent
on increasing the capacity of its glass-making plant near Blackburn. This
will help alleviate the present world shortage of high-quality lead glass
used to make cathode ray tubes for television sets and computer monitors.
Glass manufacturers cut capacity and investment in this sector during the
recession.
Mr Wim de Kleuver, chief executive of Philips Components, said yesterday
that after comprehensive and often painful reorganisation, Philips UK
manufacturing plants were as cost-effective as any in Europe. Several were
world-class with a performance equal to that of the best Asian producers.
Philips Components, with the company's semiconductor activities, represents
about 12 per cent of the group's Fl58.8bn (Pounds 21.7bn) turnover. About 70
per cent of the division's production is sold to customers outside Philips.
Last year the division's UK plants produced Pounds 300m worth of product,
most of which was exported.
Mr de Kleuver said he was concerned that there was a general expectation in
Europe that the cost of electronic goods would continue to decline, without
an understanding of the nature of the underlying electronics revolution.
He was afraid that politicians and the public at large believed electronics
technology could be bought as a commodity regardless of source. 'It is
critically important that Europe retains competence in key areas,' he said.
He cited Philips' co-operation with the French companies Thomson and Sagem
and the German chemicals group Merck to develop advanced liquid-crystal
displays to challenge Japanese domination of flat-panel display technology.
The first displays from the joint venture are expected on the market soon.
Mr de Kleuver said Philips' aim was to be among the top five flat-panel
producers.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Probe into agencies at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London is investigating claims that some agencies in the
insurance market have been deliberately reducing and disposing of assets in
order to avoid potential payments to Names, Tracy Corrigan writes. Many
agencies are being sued by Names for negligence.
Lloyd's said yesterday that several cases of reported asset-stripping by
agencies were under investigation, but added that that no details were being
made public. It said: 'If any Names suspected they were subject to such
activity and reported it to Lloyd's, we would look into it.'
Names are up in arms about the alleged asset-stripping, which they see as
under-mining their hopes for compensation.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Israeli cabinet agrees budget cuts: Reduction in ministerial
spending and public sector jobs planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Israeli cabinet last night approved a Shk128.7bn (Pounds 27.5bn) budget
for 1995, the central components of which include about a third of the total
for debt repayment, 20 per cent for police and security, and 11 per cent for
education.
The budget provides for a reduction of almost Shk800m in ministerial
spending, a 2 per cent cut in the government workforce - eliminating 630
full-time positions - and an average 1 per cent reduction in public sector
pay.
There will also be a reduced allocation of funds for the absorption of
immigrants from the former Soviet Union (achieved by revising the estimate
of immigrant arrivals for 1995 to 70,000 from a previous 80,000 figure), a 3
per cent rise in the prices of public transport and a 7 per cent increase in
water charges to agriculture and industry. Mr Avraham Shochat, the finance
minister, intends to use some of the extra monies freed to help pay off
debts owed by the kibbutz movement, to provide much-needed assistance to
Israel's near-bankrupt Kupat Holim Clalit main health insurance fund, and to
boost the ailing military industry.
Money is also budgeted to finance the redeployment of Israeli troops in the
occupied territories, as anticipated in the coming phases of Israel's
autonomy agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
The proposal features more than Shk2bn worth of tax cuts, including a
reduced purchase tax on homes and lower taxes on electrical items.
A proposal to reduce government subsidies granted to companies investing in
various designated development zones, strongly opposed by the Ministry of
Trade and Industry, was not discussed at yesterday's marathon cabinet
session.
Instead, ministers will reconvene next week for another meeting devoted
solely to economic issues. That meeting will focus mainly on means to halt
rising prices, which are pushing inflation estimates for 1994 to 14 per cent
and beyond.
While the budget was the main item of cabinet business yesterday, ministers
also discussed the implications of Friday's murders in Ramle, central
Israel, of two Jewish workers at a building site. The Hamas Islamic
extremist group on Saturday took responsibility for the attack, the first
murder of Israeli civilians inside Israel since the Palestinian self-rule
accord came into effect in May.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel knew the identities of the murder
suspects, and that he expected the co-operation of the Palestinian police
force in tracking down the men. Israeli officials said this was regarded as
a 'test case,' and that future phases of the peace deal might be put at risk
if the Palestinians did not co-operate.
The PLO has condemned the murders.

FT  29 AUG 94 / De Beers sucks jewels off seabed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent, on board the Debmar Atlantic
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seventeen nautical miles off the coast of Namibia, armed with techniques
that would not be out of place in a science fiction novel, De Beers is
vacuuming diamonds from the seabed 125 metres below.
The South African group, which dominates the world's diamond business, is
pushing mining technology to the limit, to explore for and recover tens of
thousands of very small precious stones scattered across hundreds of square
kilometres of seabed.
The Debmar Atlantic, a converted oil exploration vessel, has been turned
into a floating diamond mine. It sucks up tonnes of material a minute from
which the diamonds are sorted. Then, for security reasons, the diamonds are
canned on an automated production line, with technology most commonly used
for peaches and pineapple chunks.
Each can is filled with a mixture containing up to 1,900 diamonds.
De Beers Marine, a wholly owned subsidiary of the group, is the only company
operating at these depths. The stones in these Namibian waters are 60m years
old and may have travelled 1,500km, washed down the Orange River by
thunderous downpours in the Transvaal.
To locate the diamonds, De Beers meticulously sampled an area as large as
Holland.
Only the most durable diamonds survived the trip, according to Mr Graham
Rees, DBM's general manager. Nearly every one recovered is of gem quality,
which is what makes the considerable expense of fishing them out of the sea
worthwhile.
DBM has spent about Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m) to buy and convert its seven
vessels. More than Dollars 50m has been spent exploring since 1991.
The Debmar Atlantic uses a huge drill to get at the stones. A short
helicopter hop away its sister vessel, the Louis G Murray, is using an
under-sea robot crawler, as big as a truck, with hydraulic drills operated
electronically from the ship.
Last year DBM sucked up 302,754 carats of diamonds from the sea bed, 16 per
cent more than in 1992. This year the seabed is likely to yield even more
carats, according to Mr Rees.
It is impossible to say how much the seabed diamonds are worth but DBM's
production last year was about a third of Namibia's diamond output in carats
and more than that in value.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Saudi gems theft linked to saga of assassination: Diplomat
has issued ultimatum and linked Thai killings to palace theft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is an extraordinary tale of theft, assassination and corruption on a
grand scale that has shredded the reputation of the Thai police and caused a
bitter diplomatic row between Saudi Arabia and Thailand.
In the latest twist to the five-year-old saga, Saudi Arabia said last week
it believed the murders of three of its Bangkok embassy staff and the
disappearance and presumed murder of a Saudi businessman in Thailand were
linked to the theft of jewellery worth millions of pounds from a Saudi
palace.
'They were all killed because they had information about the jewellery,'
Saudi charge d'affaires Mohammed Said Khoja said last Friday, adding that
detectives from his country had determined the link.
Mr Khoja, who directly accused Thai police of one of the killings, said he
was due to discuss the issue with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai this
week. 'Frankly I am fed up and the government of Saudi Arabia cannot wait
any longer,' he said.
In 1989 a Thai servant stole Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.9m) worth of jewellery
from a Saudi palace where he was employed. He fled back to Thailand and was
arrested in 1990 and jailed. However, much of the jewellery returned to
Saudi Arabia was fake.
Shortly afterwards, the wife of the director-general of police, General
Sawat Amornwiwat, was pictured in the local press wearing a necklace
remarkably similar to one of those stolen from the palace.
But as recriminations flew, hitmen started killing Saudi diplomats. Between
1989 and 1990 three diplomats were gunned down, apparently by professional
killers.
As relations with Saudi Arabia spiralled downwards, Thai authorities put
forward a number of contradictory and sometimes unlikely explanations for
the murderous campaign. Religious zealots, drug dealers, business conflicts,
Mafia-style gangsters and terrorists were all suspected.
But Saudi unhappiness reached its nadir with the revelation that a
businessman close to the Saudi royal family, Mr Mohammed Al-Ruwaily, who
disappeared after the murder of the diplomats, was probably abducted by a
group of Thai policemen.
The police officer who led the investigation into the murder of the
diplomats, Lt Col Somkid Boonthanom, was later accused of Mr Al-Ruwaily's
murder, but the case was dropped in September 1993.
The links between the three cases - the theft, the embassy murders and the
abduction - remain obscure. No fewer than three parliamentary committees and
two police committees were set up to look solely into the Saudi grievances.
But even now, Thai inquiries have still run into difficulties.
Mr Khoja, an urbane 60-year old diplomat, was posted to Bangkok
three-and-a-half years ago either to wrap up the murder and theft cases or
to close down the embassy.
The Saudis have stopped issuing work permits to Thai nationals, at an
estimated cost to the economy of up to Dollars 1bn a year in lost
remittances.
Under prime minister Mr Chuan Leekpai and a respected new police chief, Gen
Pratin Santiprapop, some progress has eventually been made. But Thailand is
still a long way from repairing relations with Saudi Arabia.

The presidential candidate of Mexico's main leftist opposition party, Mr

Addressing a crowd of 70,000 in Mexico City's central square, Mr Cardenas
modified his strident rhetoric of early last week. He warned his supporters
not to be provoked into clashes that could lead to bloodshed.
The governing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) won the election with
50.2 per cent of the votes that were not annulled and 48.8 per cent of all
votes cast, according to official results.
The centre-right National Action Party came second with 26.7 per cent of
valid votes, with Mr Cardenas trailing a poor third on 17.1 per cent.
Mr Cardenas has claimed that many of his supporters were deliberately left
off voting lists and that those from the ruling party were allowed to vote
several times.
The softening of Mr Cardenas's position follows divisions in his own party
on how best to respond to defeat.
While hard-liners have urged massive protests, the moderates in the party
have warned that this would further damage its public image and deflect from
the task of rebuilding.

The presidential candidate of Mexico's main leftist opposition party, Mr
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, has urged supporters to obey the law and avoid conflict
in spite of the outcome of the election a week ago, which he has denounced
as fraudulent.
Addressing a crowd of 70,000 in Mexico City's central square, Mr Cardenas
modified his strident rhetoric of early last week. He warned his supporters
not to be provoked into clashes that could lead to bloodshed.
The governing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) won the election with
50.2 per cent of the votes that were not annulled and 48.8 per cent of all
votes cast, according to official results.
The centre-right National Action Party came second with 26.7 per cent of
valid votes, with Mr Cardenas trailing a poor third on 17.1 per cent.
Mr Cardenas has claimed that many of his supporters were deliberately left
off voting lists and that those from the ruling party were allowed to vote
several times.
He has yet to offer proof of such allegations, although in his speech he
proposed to establish a series of regional 'truth commissions' to examine
electoral fraud.
The softening of Mr Cardenas's position follows divisions in his own party
on how best to respond to defeat.
While hard-liners have urged massive protests, the moderates in the party
have warned that this would further damage its public image and deflect from
the task of rebuilding and moving to the political centre.
'We are not afraid, but we will not fall into forms of mobilisation that, in
current conditions, would inevitably wear us out and exhaust both us and
society,' Mr Cardenas said at the rally.
In a sign that he is open to dialogue with Mr Cardenas, President Carlos
Salinas said in an interview last week: 'It's important to have the presence
of a modern party of the left that participates in politics and social
development. I trust that Mr Cardenas, who participated in the reforms of
past years, will continue to contribute in the following years.'
However, Mr Cardenas warned that unless electoral conditions were fairer for
his party - especially in its access to television and in campaign spending
 -his supporters would not vote in future elections. Without democratic
opening, he indicated, the electoral process could not be considered a
legitimate way of transferring political power.

<TEXT>
The stage is set for potentially the largest property development in the
Philippines in a decade. It involves turning part of a former military camp
on the east of the Philippine capital into a commercial and trading centre.
The 214-hectare property, part of Fort Bonifacio which has been home to the
Philippine Army since the 1940s, will become a 'new Makati (business
district),' according to the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA),
the state agency in charge of the proj ect.
Five groups responded to the starting gun last Friday for a selection
process for BCDA's 'strategic partner' for Fort Bonifacio's development. The
process will culminate in bidding for the property next January.
From the five, a shorter list of qualifiers for the bidding will be known on
September 9.
Among the five is a consortium led by Ayala Land, the property arm of the
widely diversified Ayala conglomerate which in the 1950s and 1960s pioneered
the development of Makati.
The Philippine subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based First Pacific Group is
co-lead investor, with Urban Bank, in another consortium that includes a
number of big local property companies and banks. A provident fund for
military personnel, the AFP Retirement Separation and Benefits System, leads
another group.
A predominantly Filipino group among the prospective bidders is the Fil
Estate/PentaCapital consortium led by Fil-Estate Group. Another Filipino-led
group is JG Summit Holdings, which owns the Robinson's chain of shopping
malls in Manila.
Under current plans, BCDA will auction 55 per cent holdings in the Fort
Bonifacio venture. Out of the property's 214 hectares, the partner will get
118 hectares.
At the bidding in January, the qualified groups will be asked to offer a
per-square metre price for the parcel. At the minimum price of 10,000 pesos
a square metre set by BCDA, the block will yield at least 11.8bn pesos
(Pounds 290.3m).

FT  29 AUG 94 / International Press Review: Sharif adds heat to nuclear row
 -Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistanis love to talk about their country's controversial nuclear
programme, even if the occasion is one where restraint or caution is
advised.
Last week, an admission by Mr Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister and
the country's main opposition leader, that Pakistan had produced nuclear
weapons, once again sparked a heated debate.
Politicians on both sides of the divide were concerned that on an issue
which is as popular as the nuclear programme, they should neither be seen as
weak or willing to compromise.
The government took the view that Mr Sharif's statement would threaten vital
national interests, while the opposition in its defence argued that their
leaders' 'disclosure' had removed ambiguity surrounding the nuclear issue
and would now deter India - Pakistan's arch enemy - from any 'adventurous'
moves.
The charges and counter-charges were enough to baffle many ordinary
Pakistanis.
But that could not be said about the Pakistani press, which by and large
criticised Mr Sharif's move, making use of the latest opportunity to write
extensively about one of its favourite topics.
'It's difficult to understand why the leader of the opposition, who is also
a former Prime Minister, would take a position that could create serious
difficulties for the country' declared the Jang, Pakistan's largest selling
privately owned Urdu newspaper, which traditionally follows a liberal
editorial policy.
The paper said that countries which are opposed to Pakistan's nuclear
programme, would use the statement to mobilise international opinion against
Islamabad.
'In Pakistan, a statement full of gung ho words on the country's nuclear
programme sells like hot cakes,' explained The News, another liberal paper,
adding that the opposition leader was playing to the domestic public
gallery.
It suggested that Mr Sharif had probably not considered Pakistan's strategic
concerns in making the statement. Rather, like all out-of-power politicians,
this was an effort on his part to attract public attention.
The Nation, a right-of-centre conservative paper, also joined the criticism
. 'It goes without saying that by letting the cat out of the bag, he has
created quite a stir in quarters that have traditionally been apprehensive
of Pakistan's nuclear ambition, and it wouldn't be surprising if the bogey
of 'Islamic bomb' is once again brought to the fore with renewed vigour'.
While arguing that Pakistan has the sovereign right to determine the
direction and the pace of its nuclear programme, the paper said the issue
should not be dragged out in partisan politics.
Dawn - the country's largest selling liberal English newspaper, which has a
large circulation among left-of-centre intellectuals, expressed similar
views, but went at a greater length to discuss different aspects of the
issue. 'If there is anything in this country about which verbosity should be
discouraged - even if it takes an act of parliament to do so - it is its
nuclear programme.'
The newspaper argued that it was best for the country to continue with its
practice of maintaining a 'nuclear ambivalence' because that leaves Western
anger at bay and keeps India guessing about the exact nature of the
programme. In describing the policy of ambivalence, the paper wrote:
'Although we have the capability to build a bomb, so goes the official line,
we have chosen not to do so because we are not a warmongering nation.'
Dawn also responded to speculation that the powerful Pakistani military may
have given the go-ahead to the opposition leader. 'We should credit our
military with possessing more sense than that.'
'This is a blunder of Mr Sharif's own making and no one else is responsible
for it. Instead of compounding his folly by going into all sorts of
unbelievable explanations, he should think of tendering the nation whose
interests he has damaged, an apology'.
Despite the criticism, the often conservative and pro- opposition
Nawa-i-Waqt, Pakistan's second largest Urdu paper, described the nuclear
programme as a guarantee for peace and supported Mr Sharif's statement.
In an editorial entitled 'Atomic ability - guarantee for peace', the paper
said the past two decades had seen both Pakistan and India refraining from
war, since New Delhi conducted its first nuclear test in 1974, followed by
Islamabad's decision to set up its own programme. The two countries would
benefit from their nuclear deterrence, and the opposition had helped
Pakistan towards that goal.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Business irked by orders from on high: Japan's 'iron
triangle' has developed a jarring note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just over a year ago, when Japan's Liberal Democratic party lost its hold on
government for the first time in 38 years, it seemed that the iron triangle
between politicians, bureaucrats and business might crumble with it.
The new, younger government that succeeded the LDP raised the banner of
reform and offered corporate Japan the hope, along with the fear, of less
government and bureaucratic meddling in corporate affairs.
But just as Japanese business was beginning to enjoy the idea of freedom,
the LDP is back in the seat of government and a ministerial mandate on
employment practices at Japan Air Lines has dropped like a bomb to
demonstrate that old practices do indeed die hard.
Earlier this month Mr Shizuka Kamei, an old-time LDP politician and current
minister of transport, forced Japan Air Lines to reconsider plans to hire
stewardesses on a short-term contract basis.
The plan, an attempt to cut costs, had already been approved by the very
ministry Mr Kamei heads. Yet the minister put a halt to JAL's scheme, which
other airlines had also been considering.
Mr Kamei cited safety concerns and the importance of lifetime employment,
and suggested that such a move would upset Japan's much vaunted practice of
harmony and equality in the workplace.
But business leaders, many of whom have expressed shock at Mr Kamei's
handling of the affair, sense a more sinister motive. Japanese business
executives have jumped on the minister's attempts to impose his views on
what they believe should be a matter for private business to decide. The
days of government meddling in business affairs, they fear, are far from
over.
Mr Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Nikkeiren, the Federation of Employers'
Associations, criticised the minister's actions sharply, triggering an
unusually vitriolic exchange of insults between the two.
The controversy is such that opposition parties are preparing to grill the
government on the issue when the Diet reconvenes next month.
The degree of indignation expressed by normally discreet Japanese business
leaders indicates that few of them accept Mr Kamei's argument that
introducing contract workers into a team of full-time staff would upset team
harmony and jeopardise aircraft safety.
For one thing, as JAL quietly points out, the Japanese airline has been
employing foreign stewardesses on contracts at lower pay than Japanese staff
for more than 20 years. Nobody has ever complained and a recent report by
the Civil Aviation Council recommends cost-cutting measures, including
hiring of foreign - that is, lower paid - staff.
Secondly, if safety were a serious concern, as Mr Kamei suggests, would this
affect Japan Asia Airlines, which has already hired contract stewardesses?
But not a word of complaint has come from the transport ministry on that
issue.
Neither is the sanctity of job security a convincing argument for business
leaders, many painfully aware of the need to cut labour costs to remain
competitive.
For a company like JAL to deny lifetime employment to its Japanese
stewardesses, may come as a shock to the generations of women for whom the
airline stewardess was the epitome of modern, high-flying, career woman.
Yet nobody in Japan would claim that lifetime employment was ever taken for
granted other than at the largest companies. The majority of Japanese
employees have no guarantee of lifetime employment.
Instead, many see the minister's actions as a relic of the bad old days when
politicians and bureaucrats could more or less impose their will on
businesses in return for protection and a lucrative contract.
As the opening up of Japan's markets to outside competition and the
declining influence of the public sector have whittled away the benefits to
business of this past relationship, government interference has become an
inconvenience.
'The minister's actions go against the spirit of deregulation and of
administrative reforms which are being implemented in October,' said an
official of Keidanren, Japan's most influential business organisation.
The high-handed approach of the transport minister is particularly
unsettling to the Japanese business community, which has increasingly come
to embrace the view that deregulation and freedom from the shackles of
bureaucratic guidance are crucial to revitalising the country's economy.
Officials at telecommunications companies, for example, frequently complain
that Japan's slow start in the race to build an information superhighway is
largely the result of bureaucratic red tape that hinders growth of new
businesses.

FT  29 AUG 94 / US and Cuba to hold talks over migrants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cuba and the US have agreed to hold limited talks on migration to address
the Cuban refugee problem, but will not discuss the trade embargo and the US
presence at Guantanamo Bay, it was announced over the weekend.
President Fidel Castro last week called for comprehensive talks, but the
Clinton administration has insisted that it is only prepared to discuss
migration at the meeting scheduled to take place in New York on Wednesday or
Thursday.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said yesterday: 'We're going
to talk with the Cubans on the one subject where we've got something to talk
about, and that is migration. . . On other subjects, we really don't have
very much to say to Castro.'
The US and Cuban governments have conducted periodic migration talks since
1984, covering issues such as hijacking, prevention of alien smuggling and
the return of criminals. The meeting this week is a resumption of those
working-level discussions, State Department officials said.
President Castro followed his decision to discuss migration with an order,
reported in Juventud Rebelde, the Havana newspaper, prohibiting the
departure of unsafe boats and rafts carrying children.
The order may be interpreted as a tiny concession to the US, which has felt
the flood of Cuban refugees attempting to come to the US by boat in the last
month was made possible by Mr Castro's border patrol turning a blind eye.
Stormy weather in the Straits of Florida has continued to deter Cubans from
attempting the crossing. The Coast Guard picked up 130 people on Saturday
and by early afternoon yesterday reported it had found only another 30 Cuban
refugees. The dramatic fall in numbers comes at the end of a month that has
seen 17,100 Cubans flee for the US.
Administration officials acknowledged the weather was a factor contributing
to the drop in numbers but also said it was an indication that Cubans had
come to understand that they would not get into the US if they fled by boat.
Cubans were getting better information about how to legally emigrate to the
US, officials said.
Mr Christopher took it as a positive sign that in the past few days more
than 200 refugees being detained at the Guantanamo Bay US Naval Base have
asked to be returned to Cuba.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Bankers worship the new orthodoxy: Unemployment is not their
problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JACKSON HOLE, WYOMING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Central bankers from 19 countries gathered this weekend at the invitation of
the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in the shadow of the Grand Teton
mountains to discuss unemployment, and came away with a reassuring message:
it is not their problem.
A bevy of academic economists agreed that most of the high unemployment
rates in industrialised countries was attributable to structural factors -
principally, the way the welfare state distorts an unemployed person's
incentive to work - and not to the cyclical, demand factors which are within
a central bank's power to influence.
Heads nodded piously in the audience as Professor Paul Krugman of Stanford
University said that it was now all but universally accepted among academic
economists, though still suspect to politicians and journalists, that there
was a 'natural' rate of unemployment. A central bank could expand demand and
push the actual rate of unemployment below this level, but only at the
expense of accelerating inflation.
Professor Krugman argued that there was a technology-driven trend towards
inequality that Europe's generous welfare systems turned into lower
employment and the US's more flexible labour markets allowed to pass into
widening income gaps.
Although Professor Charles Bean of the London School of Economics argued
that a central bank could actually help to lower this natural rate by
allowing a slight degree of additional inflation to accompany structural
reforms, the overwhelming view was that monetary policy could influence only
the short term rate of unemployment; in the long run, unemployment would
tend to converge on its natural rate.
'Where employment is concerned, in the short run, macroeconomics is
everything, and in the long run, macroeconomics is nothing,' concluded Mr
Alan Blinder, once an academic economist himself but now the new
vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
This is music to the ears of most central bankers, who have long been
defending themselves against the accusation that they are buying lower
inflation at the expense of higher unemployment.
'I am very happy with this general theme of the long run absence of any
trade-off between inflation and unemployment,' said one senior Fed official.
Another added: 'Not only is there no unemployment/inflation trade-off, but
there are positive gains for employment from a low inflation environment.'
The natural unemployment rate theory has precise implications for US
monetary policy, for although Fed officials are not as precise in their
estimate of this rate as Professor Edmund Phelps of Columbia University  -
who estimates it at around 6.45 per cent in 1993 - they concur that it is
very close to the current US unemployment rate of 6.1 per cent.
'Some people think we've passed it, some people think we have a little way
to go. Very few people think we're very far from it,' said Mr Blinder.
That implies that unemployment in the US has already shrunk to the point
where any further decline could trigger pressure on wages and a rise in
inflation, and so justifies the Fed's recent decision to raise interest
rates - in the face of criticism from some Democratic members of Congress
that this threatened to kill off the economic recovery prematurely.
For the Clinton administration, which is not anxious to see excessive
tightening of monetary policy, the Fed's certainty about the level of the
natural unemployment rate creates a difficulty.
'Our problem in the administration is to prevent anything rash and sudden,
and hope that if we can prove over the next two or three years that you can
keep unemployment in the low 6s without accelerating inflation, then we can
argue convincingly that the natural rate is lower,' one administration
economist said.
For Europe, there is much less certainty over where the natural rate lies,
although most agree that it has risen substantially in the last decade.
Nevertheless, it appears evident to US economists and policy-makers, though
not to all of their European counterparts, that at least some of current
unemployment in the European Union - perhaps 2 or 3 percentage points - is
cyclical in nature, and that central banks could still do more to reduce
unemployment by expanding demand.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Fast trains a long time coming: US railways remain stuck in
the slow lane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US exists in a time warp when it comes to rail services. Chugging along
at a maximum speed of 79 miles per hour, its passenger trains have been left
behind by developments in rail transport technology. The Sunset Limited, a
prestige transcontinental service, takes three days to hurtle from Los
Ang-eles to Miami, averaging 42 mph.
Just for a while, it seemed that the US might be ready to take a leap into
the high-speed era. In Texas, a private sector consortium planned to link
the state's biggest cities with a 200 mph system based on France's train a
grande vitesse. The consortium had a franchise from the state government and
a detailed financing plan. But 10 days ago the project collapsed through
lack of funds.
Is that the end of the American flirtation with high-speed rail? Possibly
not. Increasing strains on road and air transport have led to a
proliferation of ideas for high-speed and magnetic levitation rail systems
in the US. The difficulty is getting them off the drawing board.
The big problem any US rail project faces is that most Americans never take
trains. Fuel is so cheap and car ownership so widespread that people use the
roads for short-to-middle distance journeys. Over longer distances, where
rail cannot compete with air travel, they take the plane.
In Texas, the competition weighed even more heavily against the state's
high-speed rail project because the cities it would have served - Dallas,
San Antonio and Houston - were linked not only by good roads, but by
Southwest Airlines, one of the lowest-cost airlines in the US.
Speeding up trains on existing lines might seem a cheaper solution but is
not easily done. While US passenger trains are run by Amtrak, a public
sector corporation, the rail tracks are owned by private sector freight
railroads, so passenger trains have to jostle for space with slow-moving
freight trains. And even when there is no freight train ahead, passenger
trains cannot exceed 79 mph because of the technical limitations of the
signalling systems.
A notable exception to this general rule is the north-east corridor between
Washington, New York and Boston, where Amtrak runs the tracks as well as the
trains. Here, it already runs the 125 mph Metroliner service. Soon, it plans
to increase speeds to 150 mph by upgrading the tracks and buying new trains.
In the rest of the US, however, entirely new rail systems will be needed.
Paradoxically, these look more likely after the failure of the Texas
project. This is because state and federal governments now accept that the
private sector alone cannot build profitable high-speed railways.
The most promising scheme is in Florida, where the state government is
preparing to invite bids for the construction of a high-speed system linking
Tampa, Orlando and Miami. Unlike the government of Texas, which barred
public sector involvement in its high-speed scheme, Florida's government
says it is prepared to pay up to 100 per cent of the constructions costs and
cover up to 50 per cent of any operating deficit, if that is what it takes
to get the system built.
Finding the cash, however, is another matter: Florida's department of
transportation says any state contribution would be subject to the
availability of funds, and it doesn't have the money right now. And planning
the project will take so many years that, if the railway is built at all, it
is unlikely to be until well into the next century. Like US passenger trains
today, it seems, high-speed rail is going to be a long time coming.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Immigrants fall victim to Greek-Albanian tensions: James
Whittington watches thousands of illegal workers, rounded up in Athens and
bused to the frontier, herded back over the mountains at Kakavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 5.30am, 12 buses wound their way up a narrow mountain pass in northwest
Greece to a small border post on the frontier with Albania on the last leg
of a six-hour journey from Athens.
The early morning peace was shattered as nearly 1,000 tired and confused
Albanians were led by policemen from the buses to a padlocked border gate.
Watched over by the Greek army, they spilled through the six-foot opening
and past a sleepy Albanian guard. By the end of the day, over a thousand
more had made the crossing, bringing the number of Albanians expelled by
Greece as illegal immigrants since August 15 to more than 20,000.
Most of the deportees have been rounded up in what is becoming one of the
biggest purges of Albanian immigrants by the Greek authorities in modern
times. It comes against a background of deteriorating relations between the
two states which threatens to further destabilise the southern Balkans.
The deportees are mainly young men who, like hundreds of thousands of
others, had sought employment as cheap labour in Greece. Nearly all entered
the country illegally, trekking for days across the mountains that divide
the two countries. With Albania's economy struggling to cast off the
shackles of the former Communist regime, the money they send home has made
an important contribution to the country's balance of payments. Last year,
remittances from Albanians living abroad were around Dollars 330m, compared
to an estimated Dollars 125m in visible exports.
Now they are being sent back, carrying few personal possessions and
complaining that furniture, rent deposits and bank savings had all been left
behind. Landlords and employers in Greece have been asked to hand over all
Albanian immigrants for screening, and many more are expected to be
deported.
Before he was picked up by the police, 29-year-old Kostmas had been living
in Athens for four years and was soon to receive official residency papers.
He worked as a labourer in a magazine depot and said he had been held in a
detention camp for three days before being expelled.
'I knew that the police were searching for us but I thought I'd get away.
This has ruined me. I have no job, no money and nowhere to go. All I can do
is wait for the present problems to die down and then return to Greece,' he
said before hitch-hiking to Tirana, the Albanian capital.
Normally, the Greek authorities send only a hundred or so illegal immigrants
back to Albania every week. But since the opening of a court case in Tirana
in which five members from the country's Greek minority are being tried on
charges of possession of weapons and espionage, the numbers have increased
dramatically.
The trial has ignited long-running tensions between the two countries and
revived claims by Tirana that Greece has territorial designs on south
Albania, and by Athens that Albania is persecuting its Greek minority.
Greece has complained that the court case is a set-up and, besides the mass
deportations, has blocked European Union aid to Albania worth Ecu35m (Pounds
28m) in an attempt to have the trial stopped. It has also rejected Tirana's
offer of talks and threatened to step-up its military presence in the area
until the government's treatment of the minority improves.
No-one knows the size of Albania's Greek minority. The Albanians claim there
are about 90,000, out of a population of 3.4m; the Greeks say there are up
to 300,000. Most live in the south in an area which Greece still calls North
Epirus. They are Greek in all but nationality, speaking Greek rather than
Albanian and practising Greek Orthodoxy rather than Islam, which is the
country's dominant faith.
Under the Communist regime which collapsed between 1990 and 1991, the
minority was repressed like the rest of the population. Religion was banned
in 1967 and social progress was made only through the organs of the
Communist party. Now, under a democratically elected government, they are
demanding their own secondary schools and university education in Greek
along with full representation in the police, military and civil service.
The Omonia political movement, which promotes their rights as a minority
with funding from Greece, accuses the governing Democratic party of
discrimination. Not only have the Albanian authorities turned down all
requests for new Greek schools, but they have forbidden the use of Greek in
church services. The Athens government has jumped on this and warned it was
preparing measures to protect the minority. 'Greece is ready to defend all
its interests and at the same time protect, with all its means, the Greeks
in Albania,' Mr Andreas Papandreou, the prime minister, said last week.
Quite how far Greece is willing to go to back this statement up is unknown.
Today in Tirana, the prosecution is due to sum up its case against the five
men, all of them members of Omonia. It is expected to accuse them of
encouraging separatist designs for the Greek minority, possession of
weapons, and receiving support and funds from the Greek intelligence
services. A guilty verdict is expected at the end of the week.
In the meantime, bus loads of Albanians continue to arrive at border posts
and nationalist tensions in the region continue to grow.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Kohl takes the high road in poll campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany summoned more tears than cheers with a
calculated, emotional election speech to 17,000 of his Christian Democrat
(CDU) party workers in Dortmund yesterday. No mean hand at jokes and
mud-slinging himself, he left most of the dirty work to his lieutenants.
Mr Theo Waigel, leader of the CDU's sister Christian Social Union, warmed up
the proceedings with a hatchet job on the Social Democrats' would-be finance
minister, Mr Oskar Lafontaine. And Mr Norbert Blum, Chancellor Kohl's fiery
labour minister, sent the crowd home committed to driving out the red peril.
In between, Mr Kohl set out on the 50-day campaign before October's general
election presenting himself and his party as the only guarantors of a secure
economic and political future for Germany - and even Europe.
While his cohorts had given the opposition SPD a fresh coat of red paint,
damning them again as fellow travellers with the Party of Democratic
Socialism, successor to the defunct East German Communist party, Mr Kohl was
more thoughtful. He drew heavily on four years of historic change which had
propelled Germany into a new role in world affairs.
Correcting a blunder he made last week, he yesterday included Moscow in the
list of world capitals with which Germany had broken the ice and built sound
relations during his term. London and Paris were again worth a reference,
but Washington earned a special mention. 'Our connection with America is the
decisive factor for the peace and freedom of the Germans,' he said. However
the main body of his speech was devoted to internal relations, on which his
fourth campaign for the chancellor's job might yet stumble.
'It now remains for us to complete the fulfilment of our dream of German
unity,' he said. The divisive terms 'Ossi' and 'Wessi' had to be driven out
of the public vocabulary. The west had to accept how difficult it was for
easterners to adapt after 50 years of Communist rule. People in the east had
to remember how much better off they now were.
Although weekend polls showed the CDU-CSU and the Free Democrat coalition
partners gaining further support, and making their best combined showing
since April 1992, the spoiling potential of the PDS weighed heavily on
Christian Democrat minds yesterday.
On the one hand, there is a slim chance that the PDS, through a quirk in
electoral law, might gain a handful of seats in parliament without winning
the 5 per cent of the overall vote customarily needed. On the other, Mr Kohl
sees a chance of luring away the more conservative SPD voters to his side.
Party leaders in Saxony-Anhalt caused dismay recently when they established
a minority state government with their traditional Green allies plus the
informal backing of the ex-Communists. While the chancellor's co-speakers
vigorously denounced the prospect of a repetition at federal level, Mr Kohl
played down the perceived threat as an extra incentive for party workers to
fight for every vote.
Although the Free Democrats are showing some gain in support, the chancellor
does not want to leave his chances of a fourth term more in the hands of
fortune than is absolutely necessary.
According to weekend polls, the CDU-CSU would gain 41 per cent of the
popular vote if an election were held now. The union now has one point more
than a month ago, while the SPD is unchanged with 36 per cent. The FDP has 6
per cent and the Greens are steady with 9 per cent.
Much may depend on the 8 per cent balance held by 17 other parties
registered for the election. Half of this largely protest vote currently
lies with the eastern-based PDS.
With 49 more days to go and some 1,000 campaign meetings booked, the CDU's
leaders set off in noisy convoy yesterday. Only the command vessel, Mr Kohl,
was reserving most of its fire. He appeared content that his message - that
Germany had founds its place in the world and needed him to maintain it -
had come across clearly. 'Do our duty,' he said at the close. The cheers
came only slowly, but the eyes in the crowd watered freely. A woman in a
home-knitted yellow suit wiped away copious tears with one hand. In the
other she held aloft a plaster image of the Christ child.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Brussels calls time for EU late-payers: Jenny Luesby on an
issue the Commission sees as impeding the single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Across Europe, recession has seen companies taking longer to pay suppliers,
boosting their own cashflow at the expense of their business partners. And
despite tentative economic recovery - and much piety about business ethics -
late payment is a prop that companies are proving slow to relinquish.
The European Commission believes late payments are hindering the development
of the single market and acting as a deterrent to cross-border trade. It
argues in a draft recommendation, now with member governments for their
comments, that businesses 'hesitate to commit themselves to cross-border
trade because they are worried about exaggerated payment periods, and it is
widely believed that it is far more difficult to recover debts abroad than
in the home country'.
Mr Stan Mendham, head of the Forum of Private Business, representing 22,500
small businesses in the UK, argues that late-payers are also hindering
recovery. 'Our economies are being held back from growing out of recession,
because people cannot get their bills paid on time,' he says.
In an effort to ease the problem, the Commission is proposing, after several
years of consultation with businesses across Europe, a package of measures
which include:
a statutory right to interest at commercial rates, and compensation, for
late payment;
a simplification and extension of court procedures to seek redress against
late payment;
a statement of payment terms on invoices;
the disclosure in annual accounts of a company's payment policies and
performance;
allowing value added tax to be paid only on payments received.
One step short of a directive, a Commission recommendation does not require
members' approval. Brussels can simply issue it, after consultation, on the
basis that it should be acted on but is not legally binding. However, the
recommendation is backed with the threat of a directive if it has brought no
results within two years.
Whether such a threat could be carried through is uncertain. There is a
large and vocal business lobby in favour of legislation to curb late
payments, but it faces opposition.
Although the UK has the worst record for late payment within the EU, the
British government is the firmest opponent of binding legislation. It
recently concluded an extensive consultative process with British
businesses, followed by a ministerial review on late payments policies. In
May, it announced in its white paper on competitiveness that it would not be
introducing statutory interest.
Pointing to fears that the measure could make matters worse for small
companies - deemed to be most at risk from late payments - it argued that
larger companies would move to protect themselves from incurring interest
charges by seeking longer credit periods. The result would be later payments
from prompt customers as well as from the not so prompt.
Within the EU, contractual payment periods vary from an average of 20 days
in Germany, through 30 days in the UK, to 60 days in France and longer in
Italy. However, payments are an average 18 days overdue in Germany, 23 in
the UK, 19 in France and 20 in Italy.
As a result of these late payments, invoices in the Union take an average of
66 days to be paid, with a quarter of businesses having to wait more than 90
days to be paid, says the Commission.
Whether punitive interest would lead to longer contractual payment periods
would depend on the relative strengths of buyer and seller in negotiating
terms. But, says Mr Bo Goranson, chief executive of Intrum Justitia,
Europe's largest debt collection group, even if the result was longer agreed
payment periods, companies would be dealing with greater certainty and could
budget, or increase prices, accordingly.
But the UK government is concerned about the danger of over-regulation. It
is also doubtful about the Commission's assertion that payment periods and
late payments are deterring trade, describing it as an assumption that has
yet to be borne out by research. Even if true, there is little evidence from
EU members that introducing statutory interest improves payment performance,
it says, pointing to the lack of improvement in France, which introduced
binding legislation on late payments 18 months ago.
But campaigners for legislation argue that the introduction of statutory
interest in Sweden, for example, in the mid-1970s has seen a fall in late
payments to an average of just seven days.
UK Department of Trade and Industry officials also argue that shaming
companies into improving their record through pushing them to publish
details is impractical. There is ample scope for companies to hide poor
records through a few large payments at the end of the accounting year, they
say. And the introduction of the sort of 'foolproof' sampling used to assess
government departments' performance would increase auditing costs far beyond
what could be justified by the gains.
The debate is muddied by the existence of a sizeable, if hidden, band of
beneficiaries from late payments, enjoying free loans.
However, in opposing legislation, Britain will be doing battle twice -
within the EU, and within its business community. The government says that
while a majority of businesses it consulted favoured legislation, there was
no consensus.
The Commission, however, found during its consultations that businesses
'think that the existing legal framework is not sufficiently dissuasive for
bad payers'. And last month, Intrum Justitia published a study showing that
an overwhelming majority of businesses surveyed in the UK wanted statutory
interest to combat late payments.
Even Britain's usually anti-regulatory Institute of Directors has come out
in favour of legislation after pressure from its members, many of them small
businesses vulnerable to late payers. They want action, they say, because
their cashflows and profits are suffering.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Bonn gives pledge on defence spending: Armed forces budget
will be raised to DM47.9bn plus inflation for 4 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has assured anxious army commanders that years of
defence cuts, which have dented morale and held up modernisation, have ended
and that the armed forces budget will be increased slightly and will remain
untouched over the next four years.
In an unusual secret meeting last Thursday with around 30 senior commanders
of the Bundeswehr, the German armed forces, the chancellor promised that the
military would receive DM47.9bn (Pounds 19.7bn) plus inflation over the next
four years. This year's defence budget stood at DM47.5bn.
Further savings will also be available for new investments following a
decision in July to shorten the length of military service from 12 months to
10 months and a planned reduction of the Bundeswehr to 340,000 men and women
by the beginning of 1996.
The savings mean that 30 per cent of the defence budget will be given over
to new investments, up from the present 22 per cent, a spokesman said.
The government initially released no details of the meeting with the army
commanders so as to avoid the impression of a campaign stunt ahead of the
October general elections, according to the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
The armed forces' morale has been battered in recent years, with cuts in
defence spending coming just as the Bundeswehr integrated with the
170,000-strong Nationale Volksarmee, the armed forces of the former East
German state.
A report by the armed forces ombudsman in March said officers and soldiers
were bewildered by the political confusion surrounding the future of the
Bundeswehr and were having to shout 'bang bang' on military exercises
because there was no money for the blank ammunition which is usually used.
The mood in the Bundeswehr was not improved by numerous reports of confusion
in the upper echelons of the defence ministry and criticism by many senior
commanders of Mr Volker Ruhe, the defence minister, over the management of
the spending cuts.
A defence budget of DM47.9bn was first mooted during talks in July when the
decision was made to shorten national service. In 1990, the last year before
extraordinary savings were needed to fund German reunification, the defence
budget stood at DM52.6bn.
Mr Kohl's decision gives the defence ministry a sum with which it can
continue its strategic planning for the next four years, a defence ministry
spokesman said yesterday.

FT  29 AUG 94 / French rate their prime minister highly
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The presidential ambitions of Mr Edouard Balladur, the centre-right French
prime minister, were boosted yesterday by an opinion poll showing him with
the highest approval rating of any French premier for 24 years.
The poll, conducted by the IFOP research consultancy for the Journal du
Dimanche newspaper, suggested that the proportion of the French public
approving of Mr Balladur's performance had risen to 63 per cent at the end
of last week, from 58 per cent a month ago.
This score gives the avuncular Mr Balladur the highest approval rating of
any prime minister since Mr Jacques Chaban-Delmas hit 66 per cent in
November 1970. Mr Chaban-Delmas, a centre-right reformist who was premier
under Mr Georges Pompidou, saw his popularity soar during a period of
frenetic growth.
Mr Balladur's stature has risen for different reasons. The French economy is
still in a fragile state, although his standing among the electorate has
undoubtedly benefited from the recent stream of encouraging indicators. But
the main factor behind his ascent is his success at playing the role of de
facto president during Mr Francois Mitterrand's recent illness.
Since undergoing prostate surgery last month, Mr Mitterrand has withdrawn
from public life. His absence has left Mr Balladur in charge at a time when
the political agenda has been dominated by foreign issues which would
usually be the preserve of the president such as the capture of the
terrorist Carlos and the crises in Algeria and Rwanda.
Mr Balladur has thus been able to cast himself in a presidential mould. He
has also been helped by the role played by Mr Charles Pasqua, his pugnacious
interior minister, who has handled controversial issues such as the police
crackdown on potential terrorists.
As a result Mr Balladur's popularity has soared way above that of Mr Jacques
Chirac, the mayor of Paris who is his chief competitor for the right-wing
presidential ticket. 'He is no longer prime minister, he is already a
president,' said the editorial of yesterday's Journal du Dimanche.
The presidential elections are only eight months away but Mr Balladur would
do well to heed the fate of Mr Chaban-Delmas. He won his record approval
rating on the eve of the first oil shock which sent the French economy into
recession. His popularity plummeted, and, worse still, he was fired by Mr
Pompidou.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
With less than three weeks to go until Sweden's general election, the
opposition Social Democratic party is set for a decisive victory over the
reformist coalition led by the prime minister, Mr Carl Bildt, according to
latest opinion polls.
A poll published yesterday in the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet showed the
Social Democrats strengthening their lead to 50.6 per cent compared to a
similar poll in June, while the combined support for the four government
parties slipped to 40 per cent from 40.8 per cent.
Two other nationwide polls in the last week showed a similar gap. The worst
for the Social Democrats, in Dagens Nyheter on Friday, showed a small gain
for the coalition, led by Mr Bildt's conservative Moderate party. But it
still gave the Social Democrats 49.5 per cent support - enough to hold a
majority in the Riksdag if repeated in the election on September 18.
The striking pattern in all the major polls has been the stability of the
Social Democratic lead since the spring, with the party consistently polling
around 50 per cent or just above.
This has defied the hopes of Mr Bildt, who expected a strong swing towards
the government as the economy returned to growth after three years of
recession. Instead, deepening concern over the perilous state of the public
finances has created an atmosphere of economic crisis rather than recovery.
The Social Democrats have come under great pressure from financial markets,
forcing them 10 days ago to detail a programme of tax cuts and savings to
attack the budget deficit. But the electorate at large has so far apparently
not shared the lack of confidence in the party's economic policies shown by
the markets.
The growing expectation is that the Social Democrats - handed their worst
defeat since the 1930s in the 1991 poll as the economy slid into recession -
will bounce back into government, which they dominated for most of the past
50 years.
Mr Bildt is now desperately attempting to win back the initiative by
reminding voters of the Social Democrats' past failures, their commitment to
an overblown public sector and their preference for tax increases. But most
voters seem to be concerned to preserve rather than reform the cherished
welfare state.
Such is the confidence of Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Social Democratic leader
and former prime minister, that he is retreating to the mountains for
several days this week to plan for government. So far he has avoided Mr
Bildt's challenge to meet him in a face-to-face television debate, perhaps
the best chance left for the articulate prime minister to save his job.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Fed deputy attacks European rate policies: Central banks
criticised for not helping to boost jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JACKSON HOLE, WYOMING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European central banks should cut interest rates to reduce unemployment, Mr
Alan Blinder, the vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, urged at the
weekend in a stinging attack on European monetary policy.
At a conference of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Mr Blinder,
appointed to the post by President Bill Clinton, singled out European
central banks for criticism.
'The job of a central bank is to push the employment rate up to its natural
level, but no further. By that criterion, the US is, I believe, extremely
close to on target, and the European Union is, I believe, quite far from on
target,' he said.
Mr Blinder's remarks sparked a clash with Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of
the German Bundesbank. Mr Tietmeyer said: 'I regard the unemployment in
western Germany as very largely being a structural problem. Monetary policy
cannot be expected to make an active and direct contribution to a lasting
reduction in unemployment.'
Mr Blinder's new colleagues at the Fed also appeared uncomfortable with the
implication of a less than single-minded devotion to the battle against
inflation than has become a creed among central bankers.
While arguing that central banks could do nothing to influence the
unemployment rate over the long term, Mr Blinder maintained that the purpose
of monetary policy should extend beyond the need to lower inflation.
This position appeared to contradict remarks made by Mr Alan Greenspan, the
Fed chairman, in a speech opening the conference, organised by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Kansas City, on Friday.
Although policymakers around the world agreed, said Mr Greenspan, that
persistently high levels of unemployment were costly, 'any tendency to seek
a bit of macro policy relief by pushing on the outer limits of monetary
policy risks longer-term financial instability'.
Mr Greenspan warned that the delay between a monetary policy change and its
impact upon the economy was so long that attempts to forecast the economic
consequences of interest rate changes were probably doomed to failure.
International monetary offi-cials concurred that using unemployment as a
target to guide interest rate policy was fraught with the danger of
overheating the economy.
Mr Blinder's remarks may confirm fears of some analysts who have worried
that the Clinton administration might seek to tilt the Fed away from its
hawkish line on inflation as seats on the Fed board fell vacant.
However, any difference of opinion between the Clinton nominees and the Fed
incumbents on the role of the central bank has not caused a rift over US
monetary policy. Both Mr Blinder and Ms Janet Yellen, Mr Clinton's other
appointment to the Fed, joined other members on August 16 in a unanimous
vote to raise interest rates.

FT  29 AUG 94 / Viacom to sell Madison Square Garden for Dollars 1.1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Viacom, the US entertainment group, has agreed to sell its Madison Square
Garden unit to ITT and Cablevision for Dollars 1.075bn (Pounds 690m).
The deal, announced yesterday, will provide Viacom with much-needed cash to
repay debt acquired earlier this year in its Dollars 10bn takeover of
Paramount Communications, the New York-based entertainment group which owned
MSG.
Since completing the Paramount acquisition, Viacom has been looking for a
buyer for MSG, whose operations include the famous Manhattan arena, a cable
television sports channel and two professional sports franchises - the New
York Knicks basketball franchise and New York Rangers ice hockey.
Last year, the unit reported revenues of Dollars 330m, and although Wall
Street analysts had valued its operations at about Dollars 700m, Viacom's
chairman, Mr Sumner Redstone, would not accept less than Dollars 1bn.
ITT, a financial services, product manufacturing and hotels conglomerate,
and Cablevision, a Long Island-based cable company, originally bid Dollars
1bn.
They later increased their offer by Dollars 75m and the deal was clinched
early on Saturday morning. Mr Rank Araskog, chairman of ITT, said yesterday:
'The opportunity to acquire a world class property like Madison Square
Garden comes along once in a lifetime, and we were determined it would be
ours.'
Viacom's acceptance of the ITT and Cablevision bid for MSG ends a protracted
auction that at one stage involved several rival bidders, among them Liberty
Media, the cable group controlled by cable giant Tele-Communications, Nike,
the sports shoe retailer, and the Canadian brewer Labatt.
Viacom had hoped to sell the unit to Liberty Media as part of a complicated
transaction which would also settle an anti-trust action Viacom filed
against Liberty Media's parent, Tele-Communications, during the heated
battle for Paramount. However, the companies could not agree terms.
Although ITT and Cablevision said that they would each eventually own 50 per
cent of MSG, ITT will initially put up Dollars 600m in cash for the deal.
Cablevision will contribute Dollars 100m, and the remaining Dollars 375m
will be raised from borrowings.
ITT has been looking for opportunities to expand further into the leisure
and entertainment businesses, while Cablevision already runs one of the
country's biggest cable networks.

FT  29 AUG 94 / China slows pace of reforms amid fears of social unrest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China applied the brakes to its programme of economic liberalisation at the
weekend, with pledges of financial assistance for ailing state enterprises
and calls for local government intervention to restrain prices.
Chinese newspapers gave prominent coverage to a speech in Beijing in which
premier Li Peng warned of growing tensions in society due to economic
hardship and outlined a new strategy to deal with the problems of inflation
and faltering state enterprises.
The official China Daily newspaper reported that the government now intended
to 'rescue' a number of ailing state-run companies in 18 cities across the
country.
The apparent shift in sentiment reflects increasing official concern about
the risk of social unrest among disaffected workers who have either lost
their jobs or are on reduced wages.
About half of China's 10,000-11,000 large to medium state-owned enterprises
are reportedly running at a loss, and perhaps as many as a third are
virtually bankrupt.
For much of this year the government has talked about driving hopeless cases
into bankruptcy, but it appears to have backed away from this threat.
'A number of state-owned enterprises are in difficulty and the real income
of workers has dropped in enterprises with poor economic results,' said Mr
Li.
'Without a strong and highly efficient body of state-owned enterprises,
there would be no socialism with Chinese characteristics,' he said.
Mr Li, in his speech to an enlarged State Council, or cabinet, said that
fighting inflation would be the government's top priority for the remaining
months of this year.
He urged localities to take 'effective measures' to curb price rises, and to
enforce a price freeze.
The State Council last week ordered the freeze on costs of services such as
transport and electricity following publication of July inflation figures
which showed that urban retail prices jumped 24.2 per cent compared with the
same period last year.
Beijing has also called for a drive against food price rises, the main cause
of the inflationary surge.
The authorities are releasing commodities from government stockpiles to
stabilise prices.
'Prices have risen too fast and inflationary pressure is still too big,' Mr
Li told colleagues.
'Basic facilities for agriculture are fragile, resulting in huge losses due
to floods and drought.'

FT  29 AUG 94 / Sinn Fein peace hints raise hopes of IRA ceasefire: Adams
and Hume say 'significant progress' made towards accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation that the IRA may be about to call a general ceasefire was
mounting last night after Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the
IRA's political wing, announced that the 'essential ingredients' for an
approach to peace 'may now be available'.
Mr Adams, in a joint communique issued in Northern Ireland with Mr John
Hume, the leader of the nationalist Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP),
said that 'significant progress' had been made towards the conditions
necessary for a 'peace-ful and democratic accord'.
The statement, in which they said they were hopeful that the peace process
could be moved forward, came after a week of suggestions and hints that the
IRA might be about to call an extended ceasefire in an attempt to put
pressure on the British and Irish governments to make concessions over
possible peace talks.
They warned that: 'In any new situation there is a heavy onus on the British
government to respond positively, both in terms of the demilitarisation of
the situation and in assisting the search for an agreed Ireland by
encouraging the process of national reconciliation.'
There is growing expectation that an extended IRA ceasefire will be
announced this week. Although most unlikely to be a declaration of a
permanent end to the IRA's 25-year military campaign, there are hopes it
could mark the first step in de-escalating the conflict.
London and Dublin would almost certainly react to even an extended ceasefire
by saying it did not amount to a permanent cessation of violence and so did
not justify allowing republican leaders into political talks on Northern
Ireland's future.
Whitehall officials have been particularly heartened by the hard line
recently taken on this issue by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister.
But an open-ended ceasefire would put the two governments under intense
pressure to make some conciliatory gesture. Republican leaders would hope
that this pressure would in turn put the governments' united front under
fresh strain.
A series of meetings between Mr Hume and Mr Adams from April last year was
one factor which provided impetus for the peace process. It was followed by
the signing of the Downing Street declaration in December last year by Mr
John Major, the British prime minister, and his Irish counterpart, Mr Albert
Reynolds.
Last night Mr Reynolds, in a detailed response to the joint statement, said
there was an historic opportunity for a settlement of the Ulster conflict.
'It is clear that Sinn Fein and the IRA are in the final stage of their
deliberations,' he said.
Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist party disclosed last night that its leader,
Mr James Molyneaux, will have discussions with Mr Major in Downing Street
during the week about the search for peace.
The Downing Street declaration offers Sinn Fein a seat at the negotiating
table in the event of a permanent IRA ceasefire, and an eventual
simultaneous referendum in both parts of Ireland on a future constitutional
arrangement for the province.

FT  29 AUG 94 / US and Cuba seek better relations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Cuba yesterday sought to improve their stormy relations, with
President Fidel Castro ordering a curb on the exodus of some refugees and
the US agreeing to respond positively to any significant democratic reforms
by Cuba.
US secretary of state Warren Christopher said the administration was not
seeking President Castro's removal, even though it blamed him for the flood
of refugees leaving Cuba this month.
'If he moves toward democracy in a tangible, significant way, we'll respond
in a carefully calibrated way,' he told the CBS television programme, Face
the Nation.
He said the US sought peaceful, democratic change in Cuba.
Meanwhile, President Castro made a concession to the US over the refugees by
ordering police and coastguards to stop unsafe boats and rafts carrying
children from leaving the country, according to a Cuban Sunday newspaper.
A meeting between the US and Cuba to discuss the refugee problem is
scheduled to take place in New York on Wednesday or Thursday. The number of
refugees has fallen recently because stormy weather has deterred many from
attempting the crossing. US officials said Cubans also now understood that
they would not get into the country if they fled by boat. Report, Page 3

FT  29 AUG 94 / US and Cuba to hold talks on refugees
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US has agreed to hold limited talks with Cuba over the refugee problem
but will not discuss the trade embargo and the US presence on the island at
Guantanamo Bay.
Meanwhile, Cuban president Fidel Castro made a small concession to the US
over the refugees by ordering his police and coastguards to stop unsafe
boats and rafts carrying children from leaving the country, according to a
Cuban Sunday newspaper.
The numbers of refugees has fallen in the past few days as stormy weather in
the Straits of Florida deterred many Cubans from attempting the crossing.
The US coastguard picked up 130 people on Saturday and by midday yesterday
reported they had found no more refugees. The dramatic fall in numbers comes
at the end of a month that has seen 17,100 Cubans flee for the US.
Administration officials acknowledged that the weather had contributed to
the drop, but also said Cubans had come to understand that they would not
get into the country if they fled by boat.
US secretary of state Warren Christopher said more than 200 refugees being
detained at the Guantanamo Bay naval base had asked to be returned to Cuba.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, yesterday renewed efforts
to further isolate the Bosnian Serbs by trying to persuade Serbian leaders
to allow international supervision of their frontier with Bosnia in exchange
for the easing of sanctions.
At the same time - despite intense pressure from the international community
and Serbia proper - a No-vote was expected at the close of a two-day Bosnian
Serb referendum on an international peace plan that would divide Bosnia
roughly in half.
Mr Kozyrev's mission to Belgrade is the first visit by a member of the
so-called contact group of negotiating nations since President Slobodan
Milosevic of Serbia announced a trade embargo against his former Bosnian
Serb proteges for rejecting the plan.
Even in exchange for the easing of sanctions - most likely the opening of
the airport in Belgrade and the lifting of a ban on international sports
competition - Mr Milosevic so far has resisted the proposal to station
international monitors on the border with Bosnia.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US, after years as the United Nations' chief debtor, intends to pay more
than Dollars 900m (Pounds 580.6m) towards UN peacekeeping costs by the end
of the year, according to Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the world
body, Reuter reports from New York.
President Bill Clinton planned to sign a bill in the next few days
authorising Dollars 1.2bn for peacekeeping, she said. The funds will cover
peacekeeping arrears until the end of 1994 and allow some revenues for 1995.
UN members owe the organisation Dollars 3.3bn, including Dollars 1.48bn for
peacekeeping and Dollars 835m for regular dues. Of this, US arrears total
Dollars 1.48bn, including Dollars 956m for peacekeeping and Dollars 530m for
the regular budget.
The new US appropriations concern peacekeeping only and not regular dues,
but go a long way to improving the cash flow of the UN. The organisation has
had difficulty in recruiting peacekeepers from poorer countries as there has
been no money to pay them.
Ms Albright said Dollars 335m would be made available to the UN within days
and Dollars 335m would follow in September, contingent on the creation of an
independent inspector-general's office which will monitor waste and
mismanagement. Congress had demanded such action.
The US expects to pay off the remainder of its peacekeeping debt later this
year.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Manifesto for the party party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In what is bound to prove a lucrative deal for one of my companies, Party
Animals plc, I signed up this week to handle image projection and media
manipulation on behalf of Tony Blair, the young and vibrantly dynamic leader
of Britain's Labour Party.
You don't like vibrantly dynamic? Then tune out, vamoose, because at Party
Animals that is how we talk, hiply and tautologously, knowing, as we do,
that while all our clients are hip, some are also brain-dead and need all
the help they can get, though not Tony Blair, I swiftly hasten to add.
What does Party Animals do? Well, one of the things it does, obviously, is
organise parties. In recent months I and my assistants - Mark, Winston,
Mariella and Kinkyboo - have organised parties for Madonna, George Michael,
Ben Elton, Charles Saatchi, Maurice Saatchi, Samantha Goggin, Olivia
Jackson-Pugh, Princess Margaret, Eddie George, Michael Portillo and Giles
Bartleet-Zinn-Pasternak.
I have become London's most sought-after party planner. I also organise
previews, premiers, exhibitions and club openings - any high-profile,
media-friendly event that creates by association a trendy image for a
product or a person at a fraction of the sum it costs to use a slick
advertising agency.
As I told the Labour Party bigwigs when summoned to a meeting at Walworth
Road this week: 'Ad agencies start by asking how big the client's budget is,
whereas I start from the other end by telling them how big my fee is, and
grossing things up from there.
'My average party deal gives me a profit of Pounds 13,000. Madonna was far
bigger, as was Princess Margaret, whereas Eddie George - sherry and a cheese
dip for the relics of the banking press - yielded only Pounds 300. But my
parties for Tony would probably hit the average: Pounds 13,000 for me, which
means Pounds 20,000 to you. Between now and the general election I will
organise 30 parties for Tony at a cost to you of Pounds 600,000, an
unbelievably microscopically invisible-to-the-naked-eye sum when expressed
as a fraction of the mainstream advertising budget I believe you were
contemplating.'
I glanced at my assistants. Mark, Winston, Mariella and Kinkyboo stroked the
frames of their Benetton sunglasses, tapped their Haagen-Dazs ice-cream
spoons on the rims of their Haagen-Dazs ice-cream tubs, drummed their Gucci
loafers, flicked back their Tony &amp; Guy hair, flashed their Swatch-swathed
wrists, straightened their Comme des Garcons jackets, waved their Dunhill
pens - and smiled their youthful, laundered, laid-back smiles to signal
approval of the course I was plotting.
'Why parties?' asked one of the drabbies on the other side of the table.
(Labour's key election committee is comprised entirely of smart-alecs and
drabbies.)
'Well,' I said. 'The voters have a good idea of where Tony is coming from.
Durham childhood, Scottish schooling, played in a band at Oxford called Ugly
Rumours, never did drugs, hardly even drank, became a Christian and a
socialist, joined Labour, qualified as a barrister, ear-marked as a certain
Labour leader very early on, spearheads the modernisers, into partnership,
social justice, cohesion and community, charming, fluent and telegenic.
'Good. Extremely good. Very good poll vibes. Whichever way you slice the
Haagen-Dazs, Tony comes out well. But I've been looking at the demographics,
and there is one little chink of worrying concern talking to me loud and
clear. Blairism scores mega-ratings with the 18-25's, the 26-39's, the
40-46's, the 56-79's and the over-79's. See what I mean? There is a little
chink of worrying concern among the 47-55's, the age group that derived its
life-values from the mores of the 1960s - air-heads, most of them, but
significant as a voting bloc.
'What the demographics tell me is that Tony skates home against Major with
all but the 47-55's. They recoil from his straightness and clappy-happy
evangelism. So with the 47-55's I nurse this little chink of worrying
concern. What do the 47-55's like most? They like parties. So we'll platform
Tony at 30 parties at a cost to you of Pounds 600,000, an unbelievably
microscopically - '
At that moment, Tony walked in. He was wearing jeans, T-shirt, Swatch and
beads. 'Hi, guys,' he said, smiling pleasantly. 'Are we ready to boogie?' I
knew that my fee was in the bag.

He walks with slow, stiff self-importance but talks so fast that he must be
getting paid by the word.
Though a poet by inclination and an academic by profession, Michael D.
Higgins (the D is for Daniel) has a reputation for making things happen. As
Minister for Arts, Culture and the Irish language - 'with responsibility for
broadcasting, heritage and waterways', he added quickly - he has resurrected
the Irish film industry. Twelve films were made last year and there could be
even more this. Since his cabinet post was created in January 1993, a
sprinkling of Oscar and Grammy awards, not to mention a Booker Prize, have
added lustre to his halo.
An arts minister's job is easy to describe. He allocates subsidies and tax
concessions. But what is a ministry of culture - that is, outside a
totalitarian state?
When a company builds itself a gleaming skyscraper, they say it is time to
mark down the shares. When Ireland, historically one of the world's leading
exporters of culture, sets up a separately funded ministry should that be
interpreted as a sign of vigour, or of competitive weakness?
Like most politicians, Michael Higgins regards questions as opportunities
for a big speech. But, thinner-skinned than most, he treated my dissenting
questions almost as a personal affront. When things were going his way, he
was pinkly, almost flirtatiously enthusiastic. When crossed he turned an
angry, trembling white.
His central doctrine is something he calls The Cultural Space. 'I aim to put
works of imagination and creativity at the centre of things,' he said.
'Culture used to be seen as peripheral, dependent on economic growth. I have
challenged that and my thinking is beginning to prevail.'
It is a fine-sounding phrase, I said, but what is a cultural space?
'I was just going to explain it to you. It has to to with a theory of
culture that is democratic, participatory and inclusive. It is also one that
views culture as energising and positive. It's quite the opposite of the
theory of culture that is exclusive or elitist or residual or
concessionary.'
My heart sank.
Higgins continued: 'There is no need to say that because a person has lost a
job that they have lost their rights of cultural participation as well. If
you allow the cultural space to collapse you will get racism, anti-immigrant
feeling, alienation and so forth.
'This space is full of intellectual products based on imagination that could
re-energise the economic space.'
I detected a gap and jumped for it. Is this a complicated way of saying that
people will not be working in steel mills, farms or coal mines any longer
but in tourism or television?
'There's more to it than that.'
At this point an aide appeared to say that a radio interviewer was on the
telephone. The minister apologised, got up from the sofa and went to his
desk where, for 10 minutes or more, he poured a stream of words down the
line. In spite of the interruption, I felt sorry for the interviewer.
When Higgins returned I asked him if he was really another minister for
employment, but specialising in the leisure industries. He talked about
European unemployment and 'a lack of originality in intellectual structures
 -clapped-out thinking'.
We were coming down to earth. Better still, Higgins - who is after all, a
member of a left-wing government - began to drop clues about his political
feelings.
'People have wanted these things in little boxes. There is a view of society
that when economies go well shouldn't we go to the theatre once a year? And
people from a particular section of the social classes dressed up, they had
a little outing and they encountered culture, and went home.'
Do you come from the cultured classes yourself?
'No. I come from a very poor family. My father died in a poor house. But I
would argue for my father's culture in terms of his generosity of spirit in
being part of the Irish war of independence, his solidarity, the things that
he suffered. My mother, while poor, always had an interest in reading. The
house was full of books, and we had nothing else.'
Higgins was born in Limerick, in the west of Ireland, and at times one may
catch a Gaelic intonation (he both speaks and writes Irish) in the high,
sibilant voice. He was brought up in County Clare by an aunt and uncle when
his father fell ill. An academic career which has spanned English
literature, sociology, political science and economics took him from Galway,
to Indiana, to Manchester and Illinois. Higgins likes to remind his hearer
that he knows a few things.
I returned to the fray. Is this really an economic department with modern
art on the walls?
'It is a department of culture. It is a department that contributes
innovatively to the economic space of this country. We have created jobs.
'As to which are we, we never ask that question. I never ask that question.
I have a pre-Cartesian view of it. I live in my mind at a time before
compartmentalisation. I despise compartmentalisation.
Are you breaking even here?
'I'm in massive surplus.'
Having relaunched the film industry, Higgins is about to reorganise the
music business. He is studying interactive communications technology,
restoring canalboats and protecting wrecks. He wants to set up an
all-Ireland television channel for Gaelic-speakers and a European satellite
channel to show native Europrogrammes.
You may be able to create jobs by means of tax incentives, I said, but what
else can a minister of culture do?
Higgins yelped. 'I think that's a pathetic view of a minister of culture.'
How can you minister for culture? It's a contradiction in terms.
'Well, that is only a middle-class riddle. Now I agree that what I am doing
is controversial. I am not saying for example that everyone is a Picasso.
But I am saying that everyone has creativity, that is socially negotiated
and if I define . . .'
What on earth does socially negotiated mean?
'Yes. I can put it simply. If I lift my hand am I threatening you or giving
you a gesture of affection? You rely on the symbol that is involved. We
exchange symbols.
'But what a pathetic collapse it was to suggest that only people who had
come from a certain school background, standing in front of a picture, had
access to the appropriate symbols to make a literate comment . . . That kind
of nonsense was anti-democratic, destroyed general culture and if you read
Raymond Williams (the literary critic) you will see that it excluded, even
in Britain, the wonderful storytelling tradition and whatever.'
The minister was working himself into a rhetorical rage. But his mention of
storytelling was an opening. There is a caricature of the Irishman, I said -
and it is probably an Irish invention - which sees every man in a pub as an
Oscar Wilde in waiting. All you have to do is write down what he's saying
and you have literature. Was this what he meant by developing the cultural
space? If so, it sounded Utopian.
Higgins's exasperation was not feigned now. 'To whom does it sound Utopian?
We can't have the conversation if you ask questions to which you've already
given answers. Utopian to whom? You make statements in the question that you
put.
'Let me put it the other way to you. Do you want to continue with
traditional economic views, and just every now and again throw up your hands
quasi-politely and say 'isn't it a pity about unemployment?' Or are you
going to say 'maybe it is the economic model that has defects?''
Higgins refuses to accept that Ireland - or Europe - must eventually lose
the media market battle to US television and film makers. But he is not a
cultural protectionist, he insists. He will retaliate by encouraging Irish
talent to put rival 'product' into the market. In the same spirit, he sees
it as a proper government function to try and save the Irish language
against vastly superior market forces - in this case English.
'The market is an instrument that can be used for policy purposes, but the
market became an ideology. We do not live by the market alone.
'What I'm saying is you take the different components of the society,
including the cultural space and you draw from that and make it rich, so
that when you come to the marketplace you're neither frightened by it, nor
are you disabled from using it as a tool.
'What is really important is the quality of the total space. That's the area
I will go into when I finish.' It sounded like some post-modernist version
of Paradise.
If you lost office would you become a consultant?
'No, I'd probably go back to writing. I miss writing very, very much.'
You're not a businessman manque?
'No, though I know how to do it. I see so many missed opportunities. I
believe it is only narrow thinking and bureaucracy that is stopping us doing
wonderful things.'
The minister was restored to good humour. As I left the Ministry of Culture,
past a peat-and-bone sculpture hanging on the lobby wall, I thought: if
economic miracles could be talked into being, Michael D. Higgins would be
your man.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Black and white and grey matter: Dominic Lawson looks at the
inexorable advance of the electronic mind across the chess board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Novelists have long known it: the most compelling struggle of the second
half of the 20th century is that between the human and artificial minds.
Arthur C. Clarke fantasised brilliantly about it in 2001: A Space Odyssey,
which was no less memorably transferred to the cinema by Stanley Kubrick.
You will perhaps remember the scene of the furious astronaut unplugging all
the circuits of HAL, the on-flight computer, after HAL became a bit too
uppity, not to mention homicidal.
In what we laughably call the 'real world' the homicidal battle between man
and machine is conducted symbolically: over the 64 squares of the chess
board. This is fitting. Chess is the oldest of war games, and has been
around for about as long as the abacus, the computer's still-thriving
precursor.
However, chess is less fitting as an ultimate trial than many non-chess
players imagine. It is true that chess is very difficult. Because its
possibilities are virtually limitless - mathematicians describe the game as
'non-trivial' - chess is a profound challenge to the scope of machines which
feel most at home in the merely finite.
But it seems to me wrong to assume that chess is necessarily the final
frontier of human intelligence. For that we would have to construct a new
game which would be a pure test of imagination, unlike chess, which for most
grandmasters is as much a test of memory as it is of powers of original
creative thought.
Nonetheless, there, on well-trodden ground, the challenge lies. In the late
1960s the recently retired Russian world chess champion, Mikhail Botvinnik,
a computer scientist by trade, announced a wager of Dollars 10,000 that by
the end of the following decade the computer would be able to beat any human
at chess. His bet was taken by a British computer scientist, David Levy.
In 1979 Levy, a strong player but no grandmaster, crushed the world's
strongest chess computer program in a match of six games. It was fortunate
for Botvinnik that the value of the dollar had been devastated by inflation
in the intervening period. But he was still embarrassed.
It was only towards the end of the next decade that advances in computer
science began to catch up with the human mind - which had, after all, had a
start of about 2,000 years of chess playing. In 1989, in a tournament in
America, the Deep Thought chess computer, programmed at Pittsburgh's
Carnegie Mellon University, defeated the leading Danish grandmaster, Bent
Larsen. (It has to be said, however, that Larsen, though a great player, can
lose to almost anyone - perhaps one should say anything - on one of his off
days.)
A few weeks after Larsen's loss, I challenged Deep Thought to a half-hour
game by telephone link. While I eventually lost on time, I had been able to
establish a winning position by the simplest of strategic means. I was not
impressed.
That particular Deep Thought program analysed positions at a rate of only
750,000 a second. I say 'only' although, at the time, that was considered
astonishing. But far more astonishing has been the development of computer
capacity in this decade. And that has finally begun to shift the balance in
the battle between man and machine.
Now, the Fritz 3 Pentium program is almost unbeatable at so called 'speed
chess' - the one-hour games most popular with tournament sponsors. In a
recent event, sponsored by the microchip manufacturer Intel, Fritz 3 tied
for first with Kasparov, and beat the world champion in their individual
game, before losing the play-off match.
In London next week Kasparov, along with the best of his fellow humans,
rejoins the battle with Fritz 3 in another event sponsored by Intel. But
what would it signify if Fritz came out on top in this tournament?
I would be inclined to recall the remark of Dr Max Euwe, a world chess
champion in the 1930s and a mathematician who thought early about such
matters.
'Even though the car has been invented,' said Euwe, 'man still gets great
pleasure from walking.'

FT  27 AUG 94 / Books: Dance story for adults
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNCONVENTIONAL LIFE by Joan Brady Andre Deutsch Pounds 14.99, 213 pages
For the performer, dance is the most punishing of all the arts: years of
rigorous physical and mental training for, at best, a short-lived,
overworked career, or, more likely, failure. But perhaps because of the mix
of asceticism, pure aesthetics and absolutist devotion it demands, dancers
have always been highly romantic figures. Moira Shearer in The Red Shoes,
Noel Streatfield's Ballet Shoes, quicken the pulses of generations of
schoolgirls. Now, in Prologue, here is a dance story for adults as evocative
and thrilling.
Joan Brady is a harrowingly honest writer who won last year's Whitbread
prize for her novel about dysfunctional American family life, Theory of War.
Her first career, however, was as a dancer: she trained at the San Francisco
Ballet School and under Balanchine in the heyday of the New York City Ballet
in the 1950s.
At 19, she was poised to enter Balanchine's company, and given four days to
rehearse his ballet Stars and Stripes. For 72 hours, she searched vainly for
a record of the piece, and trembled over the jetes elances and Balanchine's
famous perfectionism. On day four, she found the record and was about to
begin hours of practice when the door burst open and her mother screamed
'you're nothing but a snivelling little tart . . . you don't even know that
silly little part. You'll never know it. You haven't the wit to learn it . .
. You look like death on stage. Who wants to watch death? One performance,
and that'll be the end of you. You'll never dance. Not ever.' She flunked
the performance and a week later walked out of ballet school. She married,
had a child, and left America.
Did she make a comeback? Could she retrain and get back into shape? Who were
the generous dancers who helped her and the jealous ones who hindered her?
This superb memoir recaptures the brittle, vengeful milieu of family life
which Brady distilled in Theory of War and interlaces it with the
powerfully-tense and competitive world of ballet school. Plies and frappes,
leotards and legs, the nervous titters and the too-bright looks, teachers
like Balanchine and the great ballerina Alexandra Danilova (dressed in old
age 'like a Woolworths Christmas tree ornament'): all are scrutinised under
Brady's quick, passionate, amused eye.
Threading through the book is her relationship with the writer Dexter
Masters, with whom she fell in love in 1942 when she was three years old.
When he visited her family home, she used to sneak a look at him sleeping in
the guest room and vowed that she would marry him. Just before they began an
affair in the late 1950s, it had emerged that he had been her mother's lover
for years, and that she had destined him to be 'the husband of my old age'.
In a deadly serious version of The Graduate, mother and daughter fought out
a battle which ran in parallel to the elations and exhaustions of ballet
training.
This is one of the most fluent and colourful autobiographies of recent
years: a contribution to both dance literature and the literature of
adolescence. It contains not a shred of self pity, and confirms Joan Brady
as a striking and unconventional voice.

RD LAING: A BIOGRAPHY by Adrian Laing Peter Owen Pounds 25, 248 pages
It takes courage to dig out the case notes if the subject is your own father
 -real courage if his name is RD Laing. Perhaps Adrian Laing found the
experience cathartic. For what emerges from his biography is pure Greek
tragedy.
RD Laing was a gifted, musical, only child from lower-middle-class Glasgow
who hated his mother and broke with his father, who revolted against the
prevailing medieval treatment of the insane, craved fame for himself and
found it as a cult figure of the 1960s, and who was driven by an egoism of
heroic proportions into a self-destructive vortex of drink, drugs, violence
and despair.
Laing's own analyst characterised him as 'a special case' who had 'an
extremely effective schizoid defence mechanism against exhibiting signs of
depression'. Ironic, because Ronald Laing's most influential work, The
Divided Self, was a study of schizophrenia, a condition he refused to call a
disease but associated instead with family tensions. To label someone a
schizophrenic was, he once said, 'a political act'. Indeed, he regarded all
madness as mere behaviour, a healing process for some existential impasse.
For all his radicalism RD Laing was not, says his son, an anti-psychiatrist.
He had an extraordinary skill and sympathy with patients but an
extraordinary contempt for authority, too.
The peak of his career was in the mid-1960s when the fashionable
intelligentsia gathered at Kingsley Hall, his experimental hostel in the
East End of London.
There, in an haze of recrimination and LSD, things began to fall apart.
Though he remained as energetic and prolific as ever, Laing's love- life was
a mess (he fathered 10 children by wives and lovers), his books began to
fail and his American lecture audiences to yawn.
A meditational sojourn in Sri Lanka and India restored him temporarily as a
guru for the pot-smoking generation. But the tide of fashion was turning.
Laing tried to stay with it by jumping onto American bandwagons like
're-birthing' and the natural childbirth movement.
But he was a follower now, not a leader. One daughter suffered a breakdown,
another died of leukaemia at the age of 21. The old brilliance became more
fitful and the charisma wore thin, exposing a violent, hard-drinking,
bad-mouthing, bitter Glaswegian.
The final indignity came in 1987 when Laing was struck off by the General
Medical Council, accused of being unfit to practise due to alcoholism.
Although he gave up drink and retired to Austria it was too late for the
comeback he planned. He died two years later at the age of 62.
Little wonder that the author says his relationship with his father has
greatly improved since the latter's death. Admiration, disgust and love are
all evident in this portrayal, though one is left wondering whether the
picture is too black - or not black
enough.
Adrian Laing has not passed judgment on his extraordinary father's life.
Nor, as a lawyer, has he attempted to assess RD Laing's place in the short
history of psychiatric medicine.
What seems obvious even to the layman is that Ronald Laing was not really
interested in providing solid scientific justification for his theories,
humane and liberating though they may have been.
Modern neuroscientific research seems to be mainly propelled by the hunt for
'schizophrenia genes'. In other words, madness is seen as a chemical
aberration not a social construct.
If RD Laing was a failure, he was a spectacular one. But if he was a failure
it seems to have been not so much because he was wrong about madness. He was
just too obsessed by himself.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Books: Guilt and attribution - AC Grayling challenges Kate
Millet's interpretation of torture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AC GRAYLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLITICS OF CRUELTY by Kate Millett Viking Penguin Pounds 18, 335 pages
According to Amnesty International, torture is practised by more thanhalf
the world's governments. The United Nations definition of torture is any act
by which mental or physical suffering is intentionally inflicted by public
officials, or their agents, for the purpose of securing confession or
information, or for punishing or intimidating the recipient.
By the end of the 19th century torture as a judicial instrument against
crime had ceased almost everywhere - it was banned in Russia in 1801, in
Japan in 1847, in Britain during the 18th century. But even as it vanished
as an acknowledged resource, openly applied as a result of due legal
process, it reappeared elsewhere as an unacknowledged and hidden weapon of
the state against 'political crimes' of dissent and opposition. If it was a
'shame and reproach on mankind,' as the Tsar's ukase described it in
September 1801, it has since become even more so in the hands of secret
policemen everywhere.
Kate Millett made her name with her best-selling Sexual Politics and has
been a vigorous protester ever since. Here she turns her attention to
torture and its widespread occurrence in the recent and contemporary world.
She ranges widely, across the Soviet Gulag, Northern Ireland, South American
dictatorships, Africa and Asia. And the range is not merely geographical;
one chapter addresses the Holocaust, the next reports the case of an
Algerian journalist in the hands of French soldiers. Much suffering and
cruelty is recorded, prompting much sorrow and anger in response.
We read in newspapers of the 'disappeared' in South America, of torture,
rape, and murder in Guatemala, Argentina, Brazil. Distance makes it easy to
shake one's head and pass on to the next item. Then we read of 'ethnic
cleansing' and rape in Bosnia. We stir uneasily: this ugliness is in Europe,
nearer home - and so soon after 1945.
But, rightly, Millett will not allow us just to pass on again. If we are
French, there is the scandal of Algeria to live down. If we are British,
there is the fact of prisoners in Northern Ireland standing hooded for long
hours, deprived of food and sleep and subjected to continuous monotonous
noise. It is and should be an unpleasant shock to face such facts. British
treatment of terrorist prisoners might be relatively much less severe than
torture usually is - although comparisons are of little comfort to victims -
but the meaning is starkly clear. It happens here too; guilt is everywhere.
Because torture is a vileness it is, in one way, easy to evoke shock and
concern by recounting the brute facts of it. This Millett does in the
passages where she is simply reporting. Her method is to summarise a book by
a torture victim, or a film, or to describe photographs of victims; in this
respect her book is an anthology of paraphrases, a sort of agonising
Reader's Digest of Solzhenitsyn, Primo Levi, and other sufferers.
Among these summaries she intersperses her own meditations and views.
Whereas the paraphrases retain something of the power of the originals -
suggesting that one should read and think about them and not Millett's
summaries of them - her interpolations are nowhere near as telling.
The chief reason is that Millett is indiscriminate. She has her betes-noires
 -one especially: 'patriarchy', that is, male-dominated culture - and her
thinking is restricted to the polarities thus generated, so that she sees
everything in (so to say) betes-noires and blanches. This makes her analyses
crude and her advocacy on behalf of victims weaker than it should be.
Her model for explaining what torture is and why it happens is Western male
sexuality ('Western' because she was once married to a Japanese, she tells
us; she makes no mention of Japanese wartime torture, once a by-word for the
practice). She describes 'Western eroticism' as a system in which men turn
women into vulnerable sexual victims, at the same time hating them for being
such.
This doubtful picture is then used to analogise torture. Torture is 'based
on traditional ideas of domination: patriarchal order and masculinity'. Its
victims are female, either actually or symbolically. Torture is hierarchy, a
master-slave relationship. It exists to give pleasure to the perpetrator and
to humiliate the victim.
No doubt this is sometimes true, but as analysis, it merely scratches the
surface. For example, Millett does not consider that a person might torture
to punish a terrorist outrage, or out of belief that something dangerous to
society impends. Neither motive excuses torture, but nor does it fit her
model. Revenge, patriotism, political conviction, racism, insensibility,
war-induced madness, and much besides, might create a torturer. For Millett
the only motive is getting a kick out of dominance. Such is the result of
analysing the world according to a tendentious view of sexual politics.

These warmed-over essays should never have found their way between hard

FRUSTRATE THEIR KNAVISH TRICKS by Ben Pimlott HarperCollins Pounds 20, 417
pages
Publishing is said to be a rather dodgy business, with a lot of hit or miss.
Something like 50 'misses', books that do not even earn their advance, to
each big hit.
Certainly if you go into any bookshop, the shelves are filled with stuff the
demand for which it seems almost impossible to identify. Publishing must be
one of the few commercial activities remaining where no real market research
is ever conducted. The seed appears to be scattered at random in the hope
that one or two may end up as 'demand led' beanstalks.
Of course with HarperCollins this does not matter much. Its access to the
subterranean tunnels of the Murdoch accounting system has allowed it to pay,
by some accounts, more in (unearned) advances to Lady Thatcher and Jeffrey
Archer than the total paid to all other authors, by all other publishers, in
the whole of 1994.
And so, I suppose, instead of charging Pounds 20 for this collection of
warmed-over essays the book could have been distributed free. Even if it had
been, though, I doubt whether it could have overtaken Sir Norman Fowler's
epic, Ministers Decide - so far the loss-leader in the turkey stakes.
The blurb, curiously complacent even by the particular standards allowed to
this genre, warns the reader to look forward - inter alia - to a 'hitherto
unpublished account of the Portuguese Revolution of 1970.'
Gosh] '. . . the carnival months that followed the collapse of the old
dictatorship . . .'
Or should it be Aaah? Aaah, the seventies] The happy days of batty
activists, beer-and-sandwiches at Number 10 and 'meaningful' little dinners
among academics and 'opinion-formers' on the Left - before the wicked white
witch appeared on the scene and sent them all packing.
One of Mr Pimlott's problems - not his main problem, but one of them - is
that he is simply out of date. There are a good number of gifted political
essayists around. Matthew Parris and Frank Johnson still read well even
years later.
But it is absolutely no good binding between hard covers paragraphs with
phrases like 'How happy Kinnock must feel,' or (a good way off) 'Kinnock
should not believe that by stamping on Militant he has destroyed the Degsy
phenomenon,' or 'the Macmillan era was one of tinsel (sic) prosperity . . .
he . . . was an inept, elderly music-hall turn way past his best . . .' or
(of Winston Churchill) 'To the public the wartime hero now looked like a
domestic dinosaur.'
This man is meant to be a professor. But however exalted his position,
surely cliches such as these ought to have been edited out before the
original newspapers - never mind the book - went to press.
The high foothills of journalism, before one reaches the mountain range
where serious scholars (though not, apparently, professors) dwell, are
peopled by many writers of great talent.
In this company - I select names at random - Andrew Marr is better informed,
Lesley White more perceptive, Robert Harris (alas presently in suspense)
more pleasing in vituperation, Barbara Amiel more persuasive in argument.
The unfortunate Mr Pimlott is trite, derivative and, where his predictions
('I have a hunch that . . .' he often says) are capable of subsequent
verification, wrong.
He has no idea, really, what makes the Tory Party tick. 'Major's position
(writing in July 1993) is worse that that of Chamberlain in 1940.'
Nor much idea, it would seem, of what is happening to Labour: '. . . by
widening the gap between itself and the Alliance Labour has removed the
question-mark over its status as the main Opposition party, and much may
flow from that.'
He is irritatingly slack in his use of words. Regime can apply to diet,
dictatorship, or fitness schedules. Only Dave Spart or lazy journalists use
it to describe democratically elected administrations.
In a short piece on Christopher Hitchens (containing the only joke - a
personal one about the appearance of the author - that I could find in the
book) Pimlott says that 'the test (of collection of essays written since the
mid 1980's) is for the reader to be able to open it anywhere and be drawn
into the argument.'
Actually, now I come to look at it, I realise that even this undemanding
sentence is barely literate. But anyway, no thanks.
Twenty pounds may not be much for people who can send out at supper time for
an 'amusing quiche' but my advice would be - spend it instead on seven
gallons of (leaded) petrol and go for a drive.

NONE TO ACCOMPANY ME by Nadine Gordimer Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 324 pages
Here's fortune] Nadine Gordimer, with a speed that beggars belief, has
produced her novel of the New South Africa. The Nobel Prizewinner is of
course a political writer, and her response to the extraordinary
transformation that has overtaken South Africa has all the relevance, the
sympathy, the wisdom, that we could have hoped for.
None To Accompany Me marks, I believe, a welcome retreat from the
apocalyptic, even strident, tone that has jeopardised some of her recent
books, a return to the quiet authority of the middle period of The
Conservationist and Burger's Daughter. Indeed, it is also a return to the
liberal and multi-racial Johannesburg of the earliest novels and short
stories of 30 years ago: today, almost unbelievably, the revolution has been
achieved, the circle has been closed.
Vera Stark is a dedicated lawyer, working for a version of the real-life
Legal Resources Centre, which helps black and disadvantaged people in
trouble with what used to be apartheid and which these days finds itself
focusing on problems to do with land ownership. It is 'the year the prisons
opened' - 'the year when the old life comes to an end' - and, with majority
rule approaching, the exiles are returning home and Vera and her friends can
'indulge a little in the euphoria they knew couldn't last, but they were
entitled to enjoy . . .'
Gordimer has always had a remarkable gift for conveying the reality of
contemporary South African society, and at this most immediate level None To
Accompany Me is fascinating. That society is experiencing a convulsion of
change: the past is being undone before our eyes. Vera observes, approves,
becomes involved, understands: 'I can't live in the past', she tells her
expatriate son. She understands that, no longer young nor even middle-aged,
she must now go in search of her true self.
Her friends Didymus and Sibongile Maqoma have returned from their long and
dangerous political exile, having earned their heroes' welcome. But it is
Sibongile whose political career blossoms; her husband is dumped
ungratefully, and not because he had a brief involvement with the ANC
training camps to the north where torture was a scandal of the liberation
struggle. The new black middle classes move into the glossy suburbs and
restaurants of their white predecessors, the young leader (the un-named
Chris Hani) is assassinated, there are terror attacks from the white Right,
hit lists, rumours of corruption, casual - and fatal - violence, constant
debate about the re-making of the country - all this is the stuff of the
novel, yet informed by Gordimer's concern for her characters and their
humanity.
'Perhaps the passing away of the old regime makes the abandonment of an old
personal life also possible.' There is the theme of None To Accompany Me.
Vera Stark remembers the friends and lovers of her younger years. She buries
her father-in-law and leaves her husband. She acknowledges that her daughter
is a lesbian. She welcomes her grandson. She makes a profound, non-sexual
relationship with Zeph Rapulala, one of the new black businessmen. She is
'working through dependencies'. She sells her home and moves into the annexe
of Zeph's house.
The symbolism is evident yet never too intrusive. Vera and Zeph are the
alliance, the relationship, the friendship, that are to be the new South
Africa. Vera - alone in her annexe, rather as black maids used to occupy a
room behind the kitchen - has broken with the past and learned
responsibility for the consequences of that younger life. She has earned and
entered the solitary 'Nightfall in Autumn' of Gordimer's epigraph. This is,
to repeat, a political novel in the sense that the author writes about the
world (of strangers, of ideology, of conflict), but she populates and
illustrates this world with men and women, black and white, old and young.
Vera Stark is one of her most substantial creations.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Arts: Claudio Abbado fights back - Richard Fairman reviews
the Berlin Philharmonic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just as the Berlin Philharmonic was arriving in London, a torpedo was fired
across its bows. The attack came from an unexpected source and had nothing
to do with national pique that a German orchestra had been invited to take
pride of place in the Proms' 100th season.
In fact, this is not the first time that criticism has been levelled at
Claudio Abbado since he became the orchestra's music director. At the end of
last year Der Spiegel published a controversial article, accusing him of
allowing standards at Berlin's cultural flagship to sink. Now an interview
with a rival German conductor in The Times has repeated the accusations that
Abbado's rehearsal technique and his relationship with musicians leave
something to be desired. On top of that, he added, 'the players know that
Abbado will conduct from memory, but that his memory is not as reliable as
Maazel's'. Ouch]
There are still people in Berlin who mourn the passing of Herbert von
Karajan and cannot see in his successor the same all-powerful musical
dictator that they worshipped before. Unfortunately, we never heard Karajan
conduct Mahler's Ninth Symphony in London, but a live recording has
preserved it for us. Karajan came late in life to Mahler's music and its
hypersensitive neuroses were alien to his character, but he found subtle
colours in the orchestral writing that no other conductor has the finesse to
equal - for example, violins and solo low flute forming a delicate shade of
misty, tear-laden grey.
It was a bold statement on Abbado's part to schedule this symphony as the
first of his two concerts at the Proms. One of the barbs fired his way most
often is that the Berlin Philharmonic has lost its unique sound since he
took over. Certainly it is no longer Karajan's orchestra. After years of
being blended into a homogeneous whole, either rich or simply congealed
depending on one's taste, the Berlin sound is undergoing a process of
separation. In this Mahler, the orchestra was audibly made up of distinct
sections - well-knit strings, assertive wind and cultured brass (despite a
few low growls from the trombones).
Although his experience of conducting Mahler is both longer and broader than
Karajan's, I would hesitate to say that Abbado is any more of a Mahler
specialist. In the long opening movement of the Ninth Symphony (by far the
symphony's most challenging for the performers) the insights did not come
thick and fast. The keenest grasp of Mahler's very personal idiom seemed to
belong to some of the solo musicians, as when the flute and nimble, trilling
horn joined for their strange little meandering duet.
This was all at the opposite pole from a subjective conductor like
Bernstein. Christoph von Dohnanyi (for it was he who poured out his acid
observations to The Times) had harsh words to say about Bernstein as well,
declaring that his Mahler was 'totally wrong'. This is unfair: Bernstein's
performance of the Ninth Symphony may have been exaggerated, but it probed
important parts of the composer's psyche, such as his instability and his
Jewishness.
Abbado does not have a hot-line to emotions like these. His Prom performance
was streamlined. Where the music seems to demand abrupt changes of mood or
detours to investigate passing feelings, he kept his eyes fixed straight
ahead. Each movement worked towards a single climax, the first its mighty
collapse into seminal thematic germs, the third its headlong rush to the
closing bars. Perhaps there is such a thing as Italian Mahler, which counts
urgency, clarity of structure and flowing warmth of lyricism as its main
concerns - as Toscanini probably would have done, if he had conducted any.
If each of the first three movements left something unsaid, that is because
Abbado also sees the symphony itself as a whole. The finale, marvellously
played by the strings, built to one overwhelming affirmation of the main
theme. Then, having made its ascent, it reached a plateau of intense
slowness and quiet for the last ten minutes: a place of endless vistas and
cloudless skies, of absolute peace and stillness. At some points the music
came close to inaudibility. After the last note faded away, there was a
silence that nobody wanted to break, even by breathing.
The orchestra was due to follow with a second concert featuring Russian
showpieces on Friday, but that could hardly have seemed more out of mind at
the time. If anybody in Berlin is still thinking of trying to elbow Abbado
out of his post after a performance like this finale, he too would be wise
to hold his breath.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Arts: A happy month for Francophiles - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is rumoured that on the Tour de France's recent visit to England French
cyclists left behind large numbers of French-language movie videos. They
scattered them discreetly along the hedgerows, to be collected later under
cover of darkness by British video companies.
Something like this must have happened. How else account for an August video
slate berserk with Francophilia? High-quality films they are too, plucked
from the hedgerow of French cinema history. For Truffaut fans, there is the
enchanting 1968 quasi-autobiographical comedy Baisers Voles (Artificial
Eye). For those who still reverence Jean Gabin, the Marcel Carne classic Le
Jour Se Leve (Connoisseur) breathes poetic doom over a 1930s tale of love
and murder. For Jean Renoir admirers, his great class-clash comedy Boudu
Sauve Des Eaux (Artificial Eye) comes to video, looking far superior to its
50-years-on Hollywood remake, Down And Out In Beverly Hills.
And then there are Jean Marais in Jean Delannoy's moody-elegiac 1943 Tristan
and Isolde variant L'Eternel Retour (Art House); Jacques Doillon's
teen-angst updating of Goethe, Le Jeune Werther (Tartan); and Joseph Losey's
best late film M. Klein (Arrow), with Alain Delon as a wartime Parisian Jew
treading the path of the Holocaust.
In addition the most popular French film ever made - at least at the French
box office - comes to video with Les Visiteurs (Arrow): a sort of
time-hopping Gallic Monty Python, in which a Medieval knight and squire
crash-land in modern Languedoc.
This, though, is the only arguable turkey of the bunch. A hit at home, its
broad but parochial fun-poking was largely shunned abroad. And another
French domestic success now on video - Yves Robert's Pagnol-based two-parter
about youth and memory La Gloire De Mon Pere and Le Chateau De Ma Mere
(Artificial Eye) - gained respect rather than ecstasy in cinemas outside
France.
Many people think French cinema has now died and they will assume,
cynically, that this embarras of re-releases is a form of posthumous
honouring. The video-viewing ritual, after all, has long seemed
uncomfortably close to cremation: the sliding of the black box containing
the 'remains' into the jaws of that immortalisation machine, flickering with
light, that we call a VCR.
But perhaps we should look on the August French film frenzy as an
ambassadorial gesture: a symbol or earnest of the 'light at the end of the
Euro-tunnel'. Video is an unrivalled way to re-assess undersung movies and
some modern French films - especially the quiet ones - do seem better, far
better, on the small screen.
None more than Yves Robert's cine-diptych. Nothing much 'happens' in those
summery Provencal hills, or in the romantically forbidden footpaths around
that small-town chateau. But the two films have a real pop-Proustian charm.
And home viewing allows the narrative to grow at its own pace, with no
fidgety sense that having paid movie-theatre money we should be bombarded
with movie-sized drama and special effects.
We can get all these at home now anyway. My CDi machine, whose hi-fi
qualities I hymned last month, is responding well to saturation viewing. I
had some people over who sat there gawping at Top Gun, and finger-flicking
to favourite chapter-headed action scenes, while the dinner was getting
cold. And the dark, nearer-home violence of The Krays and The Crying Game
has a marvellous sheen and resonance viewed on Digital Video.
I have also been making use of the 'Compton's Interactive Encyclopaedia.'
You can punch up any entry you want, from 'Aachen' to 'Zworykin, Vladimir'
(father of television); you can roam and zoom all over a map of the world;
you can watch educational videos; and you can take a 'time machine' trip,
stopping for information at any historical station along the way.
Nor are the texts unduly skimpy. I looked up Existentialism on the 'Topic
Tree' and was soon floundering knee-deep through Kierkegaard, Sartre and
Heidegger. My friends urged a swift return to Top Gun, whereupon I insisted
on an overdue adjournment to dinner.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Arts: A revolutionary in salmon-pink silk - Joan Smith talks
to Erica Jong, a 'serious person of letters' dogged by her early, famous
erotic novel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOAN SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I first met Erica Jong over dinner at Christ Church, one of Oxford's most
traditional colleges. At high table, under the painted gaze of monarchs,
prime ministers and colonial governors, she talked fluently about
literature, the role of the writer and the future of feminism.
Then, as we sipped coffee in the company of Frank Weston, Archdeacon of
Oxford, she leaned forward and inquired innocently: 'Joan, do you get many
request for soiled underwear?' In the startled silence that followed, she
explained that, in the US, any woman who writes about sex is deluged with
readers' letters soliciting cast-off undies. At the time she seemed amused
by these and the other, even weirder overtures she went on to describe. But
a less flippant, more spontaneous response emerges in her autobiography,
Fear of Fifty: A Mid-life Memoir.
In the book Jong admits to being troubled by these requests, a reaction
which earned the disapproval of the author Henry Miller. 'Why don't you take
it as a joke?' Miller asked, a piece of advice Jong has clearly done her
best to follow. But the story neatly encapsulates her dilemma as a writer
who makes the erotic a major theme of her work yet has to live with the
perception that she is no more than the author of a very famous dirty book.
That Jong takes her writing seriously is in no doubt. Sitting in her airy
apartment on the Upper East Side of New York, overlooked by a portrait of
herself cross-legged and naked except for a salmon-pink wrap, she could be
taken for an archetypal, if unusually successful, child of the 1960s. Yet
her literary ambitions are positively 18th-century. She says she always
wanted to be 'a person of letters', reeling off a list of writers who, in
her opinion, also fit this definition - Updike, Burgess, Colette, de
Beauvoir. 'If you were a person of letters,' she continues, explaining why
she writes poetry as well as prose, 'it was a point of honour to write in
different forms'.
Yet in spite of her substantial output, Jong knows that her public persona
is still refracted through the lens of her early success, the runaway
bestseller Fear of Flying. Although she has published six volumes of poetry,
five other novels (including Fanny, a pastiche of 18th-century picaresque)
and a critical appraisal of Henry Miller, readers remember her above all for
a single phrase on the first page of Fear of Flying: the 'zipless fuck'.
That phrase, which held out the promise to women of guilt-free,
uncomplicated sex, leapt out at reviewers and readers alike in 1973. Its
timing was crucial, coming at a moment when many women were puzzled by an
inarticulate sense that the sexual revolution had not worked for them. Fear
of Flying captured the zeitgeist and sold 12 million copies in 27 languages.
Jong's heroine, Isadora Wing, embodied the angst and the ambition of a
generation of sexually-awakened but dissatisfied women. Yet Jong immediately
felt trapped by its success. 'Whoever pushes America's sex button must be
prepared for sirens and alarms', she writes in Fear of Fifty. 'Whatever else
we do in our lives will be drowned out by them'.
In New York a few days before publication, Jong reiterates this complaint.
'People don't make any distinction between pornography and writing about
sensuality or feelings or the body', she insists. She says that a new
generation of readers, young women in their 20s, has expressed surprise that
Fear of Flying has a reputation as an erotic novel. 'There isn't very much
sex in it,' she protests. Inevitably though, when Fear of Fifty was
published in the US last month, it was greeted in the mass circulation
newspaper USA Today with the inch-high headline, 'Jong unzipped'.
Her problem, in essence, is how far she can exploit her fame as a sexual
pioneer without running the risk that the rest of her ideas will be ignored.
Fear of Fifty is an irresistible title, playfully reminding readers of Fear
of Flying while suggesting that Jong, now 52, is grappling with a current
American obsession. (Betty Friedan, author of The Feminine Mystique, tackled
the subject of age head-on last year in a rambling, 600-page tome.) Yet the
very act of calling attention to the origin of Jong's fame raises the
expectation of sexual revelations. Fear of Fifty does not disappoint,
containing extraordinarily frank accounts of Jong's love affairs and four
marriages. In fact Jong has much more to say about sex than age, her
seemingly inexhaustible energy producing a tone that is sometimes angry but
never defeated.
There is a real danger, which Jong recognises, that the book's other themes
 -rivalry between mothers and daughters, how women develop a sense of
identity, the relationship between secular Jews and the past - will be
ignored. 'Here in the States, the interviews have been so silly', she
protests. 'Because I've revealed aspects of my personal life they want to
ask more about that. They don't get the ideas at all'.
Her first draft had an extra 100 pages, statistics from UN reports to shore
up her arguments about continuing discrimination against women. Her editor
suggested cutting them in favour of the personal details which American
reviewers have found so seductive. Jong gives the impression of continually
being caught by such dilemmas, wanting to be taken seriously but finding
herself steered towards the populist writing she does so well. Fear of Fifty
bounds along with jokey chapter headings like 'How I got to be the second
sex'.
Rivalry is a constant theme in the book: with her mother (a thwarted artist
who gave up her career for marriage to a jazz musician and motherhood), with
husbands, lovers, and the literary establishment. 'What so angered people
was a woman speaking frankly about her feelings', she says of her critics.
'If a woman claims this territory men get so angry. Sometimes I think
they're angry because we've taken away one of their devices. They created a
female character to express the female side of their own natures - Pope's
Eloisa, Madame Bovary, Anna Karenina. They can no longer blithely plunder
our psyches for their subject-matter'.
In spite of her fame and success, Jong still presents herself as something
of an outsider. She has a strong sense of mischief without always being able
to predict how her audience will react. She seems genuinely puzzled by the
inability of reviewers and profile writers to see her as she sees herself: a
revolutionary in salmon-pink silk.
Fear of Fifty is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (Pounds 16, 390 pages).

FT  27 AUG 94 / Arts: The Borodin Quartet takes up Beethoven theme - Music
in Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just in case the moral seriousness of Beethoven looks as though it might
make a heavy theme for a festival, Edinburgh has thrown in Chabrier as well.
Whoever brought these two composers together certainly has a sense of
humour, but at least the two together are providing variety.
That a composer as well-known as Beethoven should have been chosen at all as
a festival theme has been criticised in some quarters, which is hardly fair.
Leaving aside the need to attract an audience, a big international festival
like Edinburgh will always have to focus on composers who left great music
across as wide a range of disciplines as possible, preferably including
opera as well as orchestral and solo music. Beethoven fits the bill - just.
His weak area was opera, but the festival director, Brian McMaster, neatly
side-stepped that problem by offering a 'Fidelio day' that widened our view
of Beethoven's experience in opera to take in the years of struggle and
re-writing during which Fidelio was born.
The rest of Edinburgh's Beethoven is less adventurous. Assorted pianists are
offering piano sonatas and all nine of the symphonies are being performed by
sundry orchestras, both period and modern. No attempt to be dogmatic about
performance style there.
For the string quartets, the Borodin String Quartet has monopolised the
field. The Borodin is of course, a modern-instrument quartet. (Although
period orchestras are making notable headway with Beethoven, period chamber
groups have had less success; perhaps four period strings just sound too
thin and scratchy in our present-day recital halls.)
There need never be any complaint about tonal blend when the Borodin is
playing. Over nearly 50 years, and despite changing its personnel on the
way, this quartet has maintained an admirably civilised tone quality, second
to none for subtlety. Its Beethoven mornings in the Queen's Hall this year
were far removed from the Lindsay's strenuous, abrasive combat or the
Emerson's hard-edged intelligence, but perhaps that was half the problem.
Of their five programmes, I attended two. The early quartets - Op. 18, Nos 4
and 5 - were playful in the gallant manner, elegant court games, not
Beethovenian rough-and-tumble. The sforzandos needed a tougher attack.  In
the A Major's slow movement one of the variations was nevertheless
marvellously rapt.
Of the two mature quartets, the concise Op. 95 held together better than Op.
130, which passed through some finely cultivated passages without suggesting
it had any decisive goal in mind.
Trenchant Beethoven playing only firmly took the stage with the Grosse Fuge,
a challenge to which all four players roused themselves with fire in the
belly.
That performance drew enough applause to warrant an encore. The Borodin
Quartet is among Edinburgh's favourites: hopefully it will be back next
year, whatever the theme.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Arts: In search of the spirit of German romance - William
Packer bemoans an opportunity missed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the importance of an exhibition is to be judged by the weight of its
catalogue, then The Romantic Spirit in German Art is a very important
exhibition indeed. And so, up to a point, it proves. Nothing can gainsay
either the quality and interest of the work on show, or the scholarship that
informs the exercise. The idea behind it is obvious enough, and in the
celebration of particular artists, from Caspar David Friedrich to Joseph
Beuys, there are groups of work as fine as one could wish.
Why then, in the end, a sense of disappointment, of an opportunity missed?
The answer lies with the orthodoxy of the scholarship and the banality of
the curatorship.
No one who knows anything of German art could fail to be intrigued by the
central premise of the show. What is this dark and tormented sensibility,
that yearns for perfection even as it chases false gods and hopes, that sees
only Death and Despair stalking the forest of its imagination, that finds
Love only to lose it? What is this Romantic Spirit by which we would say of
Friedrich and Kiefer alike, as of Goethe and Wagner, that they are, well, so
very German?
In short, the show cries out for a radical comparative look at the work in
defiance of chronology. With Beuys, for example, whose fine group of
drawings touches the very quick of his originality, how good it would have
been to see him alongside Paul Klee, Marc and Wols, and earlier, Rethel and
von Rayski in the 1840s, Olivier in the 1820s, and the young Friedrich in
the 1800s, all of whom are well shown. But no.
Time after time we are brought up short by particular and remarkable images.
As striking as any is a self-portrait by Victor Janssen of 1828, who looks
out at us across his bare shoulder, his shirt folded down to the waist. It
prefigures the paintings of the Neue Sachlichkeit, the New Reality, by a
clear century. And where is the portrait by Christian Schad from the 1920s
to set against it, or by Dick Ket, or George Grosz, or Otto Dix? Nowhere.
Dix, in this aspect, is represented by only a minor piece, while Schad, Ket
and Grosz are not even in the show.
Such omissions are serious enough - that of Grosz is inexplicable - but none
is more serious than that of Max Beckmann, one of the truly great painters
this century. To leave him out and yet to include Georg Baselitz, a lesser
artist whose early work, quite reasonably, is shown in depth, is to make a
nonsense of any possible rationale. Indeed the contemporary ghetto at the
Fruitmarket end of the exercise, where Beuys, Baselitz, Kiefer and Richter
sit with trivia from Sigmar Polke and Blinky Palermo, shows curatorship at
its most orthodox and flatulent - these six are shown on a scale out of all
proportion to their importance in the given context of the show.
But I protest too much. The show comes to the Hayward in London next month,
and we shall see what differences a rehanging makes. As it is, section by
section, from Romanticism as such through Symbolism to Modernism and the
present day, each discrete display has its interest and qualities. The group
of paintings and drawings by Friedrich in particular is as strong as any we
have lately seen, and offers a more intimate and lively view of one who may
often seem remote and unsympathetic.
The show sags a bit in the mid-19th century - it could have done with
painters such as Calame and von Menzel who figure in the National Gallery's
current show of Romantic works from Winterthur - but it picks up with the
Symbolists, Bocklin, Klinger and Hodler especially, and moves on strongly to
the Expressionists and the Surrealists. It is intriguing thus to find Ernst
and Kandinsky cast as German Romantics.
Always more comparisons propose themselves. Bocklin's maiden rides her
donkey-unicorn through the forest. Hans von Marees has a naked horseman
pluck oranges from the tree while a girl, no less naked, morosely looks the
other way. How dark and soulful it all is, how very northern and Teutonic.
And we think back to Monet to Matisse next door at the Scottish National
Gallery, and to Roussel's lovers beneath the summer trees, and Picasso's
nakedly indolent hedonists - how very French, that all was, how very
southern.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Arts: A tragic Oresteia and fantasy on the Fringe - At the
Edinburgh Festival our critics spend an insufferably long time at an ice
rink and find comedy a few steps from the office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
How come the director Peter Stein can be presenting a version of Aeschylus's
trilogy The Oresteia that is almost without any saving merit? His revived
stagings of Falstaff and Pelleas et Melisande (Welsh National Opera) have
been among the highlights of the last 12 months in Britain. His account of
Shakespeare's Julius Caesar last year was flawed, but had some first-rate
solo acting, some colossal crowd effects, and a lucid and serious reading of
the text. The Oresteia, however, is badly acted and sluggishly paced
throughout. And in the last play, The Eumenides - where Aeschylus turns the
colossal family tragedy into a political drama - Stein resorts to
ludicrously camp and frivolous effects.
The Stein Oresteia began life in Germany over ten years ago, and I would
guess that it was then freshly conceived and potently acted. Yet could
anyone even then have been impressed by his use of the chorus? (Presumably
yes, since I have seen subsequent Euro-stagings of Greek tragedies whose
choruses - I now realise - were cast in this mould.) In Agamemnon, the
trilogy's opening play, the chorus of Myceanaean elders is played like a
collection of shuffling old gents, in brimmed hats, heavy coats and walking
sticks who are based around a long office table whose desk lamps they switch
on and off from time to time. (Halfway through they move office.)
Aeschylus's choral odes, whose rhythmic force is all-important, are turned
into conversational mutterings without pulse or metre.
In The Libation Bearers, the female chorus - 11 modern women dressed in
black suits and high heels - has fitful bouts of tepid lyricism; but in the
final play, the chorus of female Eumenides (furies) is a shrilly
expressionist coven of white-haired black-faced crones who shriek and shout
their lines. (The surtitles remind us that some of their words mean
'Moderation and discretion are always the best policy'. Hrumph.)
But most modern stagings of Greek tragedies blunder in their use of the
chorus. Stein, however, sinks further. Athena is played (rather well,
actually, by Elena Maiorova) as a slinky longhaired glamourpuss. She
presides over the big trial scene like a game-show compere, pacing briskly
around the Furies as if filling in time before one of them came up with this
week's prize-winning answer. Apollo, in a double-breasted white suit but
without a shirt, is a comedy ponce. He descends from the ceiling (sitting on
a lift), strums his lyre stupidly at irrelevant points, speaks his lines
with blatantly jokey insincerity, and then rushes feyly across the stage:
all to widespread audience laughter. I confess to a certain malicious glee
in reporting that, when he reascended to heaven, he bumped his head on the
ceiling.
In Agamemnon alone, Clytemnestra wears four different outfits. Can you
believe that she addresses her husband, the high king of Greece, feigning
joy at his return, with her hands in her pockets? I have survived to tell
the tale. I am not, however, man enough to tell you just how badly Ekaterina
Vassilieva acts her: mainly through clenched and bared teeth and with much
chestily melodramatic vocalisation. Her daughter Electra, though played in a
higher vocal key by Tatiana Doguileva, takes after her; she screams and
weeps with great relish.
Then there is the clunky pacing of each play. I realise now why I have
always preferred Stein's stagings of operas to his stagings of plays -
because he cannot set the tempo for Verdi or Debussy. In The Oresteia, you
long for more surtitles, just because you want something more to read
(anything - it need not be by Aeschylus). In Agamemnon, the gear-changes
introducing or following each choral ode are so slow that the whole play
stalls. Since the whole trilogy lasts (with two intervals) seven hours and a
half, this slowness becomes insufferable.
Lest I sound vindictive, I will add that Evgueni Mironov's performance as
Orestes has an integrity, a variety of tone, and a mixture of restraint and
intensity that stands out amid the other performances. And, of course, there
is some stimulus to be had from renewing acquaintance with Aeschylus's
monumental trilogy, even in these circumstances. To my ear, the Russian text
used here has nothing of Aeschylus's rich gravitas, but the power of his
overall dramatic architecture can hardly be missed. One thinks of The
Oresteia as one single work of art, like the Parthenon, but actually it
keeps changing as it proceeds. Eventually Orestes and his family pass out of
view, and the drama addresses the issue of justice and law, and leaves us
looking not backwards any more but forward into a new democratic world.
Beside this awesome construction, most subsequent drama feels as flimsy as
balsawood.

The Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh's Georgian honeycomb of social spaces,
retiring rooms, chambres separees and refreshment pit-stops, comes into its
own at festival time, writes Martin Hoyle. Over the past few years comedy
has become particularly associated with the George Street venue, by happy
chance a few paces from the Scottish FT office. This year's discovery is not
a complete surprise, since those in the know will recognise names associated
with last year's runaway hit both in Edinburgh and London, Anorak of Fire.
Such is the harrowing nature of much of the fringe, those who do not
immediately twig may take the opening of Gee] Wow] seriously, with its young
man in a woman's petticoat reclining on a chaise-longue and reminiscing
about the squalid background (one of 12 children of a hooker, regularly
abused) that led to eminence among Andy Warhol's superstars. Only when Clive
Neon casts off female garb and resumes a Black Country twang does the penny
drop: this Rugely radish-packer has channelled his lifelong 'rebellious
attitude and preoccupation with the colour cerise' into fantasy.
Just how far the fantasy extends we are unsure. Did he really take Warhol's
place on a lecture tour in blond wig and shades ('Oy know what it tikes to
be Anday'), uttering the famous bland fatuities? And, reluctant to
relinquish his allotted 15 minutes of fame, did he really impose himself on
the New York art scene sharing a flat with a performance artist who doubled
as a hatstand at fashionable parties? And finally achieve fame with a
free-form rock opera with penguins and celery?
Or did he remain the Midlands' most unloving son, dreaming of escape from
the boredom of Birmingham (which sensitive city I advise this show never to
visit)? Either way, James Holmes is very funny, especially in the Brum
scenes, when reliving his youth first as a mod ('we looked loike this':
blank vacuity) then as a rocker ('we looked loike this': blank vacuity, the
head further forward). Sarah Frankcom directs Stephen Dinsdale's script.
Blue Helmet might make more of an impact if those of the cast unused to
projecting without mikes could get their lines over. Chief offenders are
Mark Arden's semi-intelligible blurt as a thicky British private and Maria
McErlane's semi-audible mumble as a doctor from Medecins sans Frontieres. As
the well-meaning but ludicrously inept UN commander in a murderous eastern
European three-way civil war, Robert Llewellyn plays with cheerful clarity
and style; but then he wrote it.
The warring factions - two European, one Hindu include one military leader
who longs to meet Kate Adie. That is one of the funnier jokes. The humour is
heavyish-handed, certainly not funny enough to redeem trampling on sensitive
areas. And when reference is made more than once to a character's breasts,
it seems lazy to present us with a flat chest. Or perhaps that's a joke as
well.
The Oresteia is at the Murrayfield Ice Rink tonight and tomorrow

FT  27 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: What a very odd year that was - Claret /
Edmund Penning-Rowsell tastes the '84, and discovers qualities in an
irregular vintage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The claret vintages of the 1980s were unusually successful, but for more
than one reason 1984 turned out the least attractive.
The '80s were weak, the '87s inclined to be thin, but from both years there
were agreeable, relatively inexpensive bottles for early drinking. '84 was
not a bad vintage but it lacked balance and charm.
That year the spring was poor, the vine flowering irregular, with much
coulure (non-setting of the flowers) and millerandage (the grapes not
swelling). A moderate summer and a wet late September led to many wines
being made up to the middle of October. Conditions were particularly
unfavourable in St Emilion and Pomerol. Overall the crop was the smallest
since 1977.
Nevertheless, it was by no means uninteresting to taste a decade later the
'84 first growths, which in general make the most successful wines in any
vintage, at the annual dinner to taste the 10-year old wines.
Ausone, perhaps wisely, did not make an '84 grand vin bearing its label and
the wines were tasted in the usual order: Haut-Brion, Margaux, Lafite,
Mouton-Rothschild, Latour, Cheval-Blanc and Petrus.
There were seven of us present, including a guest, a distinguished
Californian winemaker. At the end, the customary vote on the order of
preference was taken, and the unusual variety of views reflected the
difficulty in assessing an irregular vintage.
As often, Haut-Brion provided a problem, for even after 10 years the red
Graves seldom have the outgoing qualities on nose and palate of the fuller
Medocs. In the final voting one member of the party placed it second, while
two others, including our American guest put it sixth. Here are my notes,
made at the table:
Haut-Brion: Slight tinge of brown, tannic nose, rather dry flavour, fairly
light, lacks depth - looked much older than Margaux, biscuit smell, full
palate, flatteringly ready, held up well, long; pretty nose, dry tannins,
holds up well, but not as pleasant drinking; some brown, some class, too
soft; slightly watery look, typical Graves nose, rather tough and tannic;
more generous than Margaux slightly bitter nose, pleasant to return to;
rather bitter.
Margaux: More colour, soft nose for a hard wine that tasted younger than the
others, edgy but long taste, holds up well in glass - deep colour, youthful,
needs aeration, may turn out something exciting, but now taut. Dry, tannic
at end; pretty nose, not a big wine, but balanced, smelling well; much
better wine. Real class, more colour, dry, young; a very good colour, lovely
nose, a very enjoyable glass; dryer on palate than Haut-Brion, a nice but
small wine, thin; softer more pleasant wine.
Lafite: Fair colour, some oak on closed nose, but developed in refreshed
glass, yet dry at end, gentle, mineral nose, after a time the acid began to
predominate, has its moments but did not last very long; again not a big
wine, but balanced and smelling well; deep, very sweet nose, a full mouthful
of fruit and tannin, slightly watery finish; very classy nose and flavour,
but less later; more nose than Margaux, a bit mean, better in re-fill, a
puzzle; rather thin compared with others.
Mouton-Rothschild: First really fine nose, concentrated, seductive, mulberry
taste, but fairly light body - deep crimson, pure cassis fruit on nose,
chunky and ungrateful, astringent finish, concentrated but not well
balanced, not as fine as Latour but food; rich, dry and good; definitely a
chaptalised taste, tannin coming through; concentrated nose, taste softens
in glass, but maintains character; rich, fruity, enjoyable.
Latour: Big colour, rich nose, the biggest, most fruity of all, long finish
 -deep colour, hot fruit, well-constructed, the most substantial of the lot
without being alcoholic; lovely nose, slightly chalky taste but rich enough
to carry it; great colour, deep and thick, not much subtlety on nose, very
full in the mouth, and sweet too; very odd nose, richness over-riding
tannin, very long; smell of paper and some acidity, a bit peppery, lively;
little nose, but pleasant to the palate, lively.
Cheval-Blanc: Little colour, light nose, lacks body and short - a bit sweet,
dilute and short, very disappointing; soft character, not pleasant to taste;
very poor nose and body; light colour, lacks fruit; cloth and paper on nose,
thin, edgy; sweet but not much charac-ter.
Petrus: Good colour, rich nose, fairly concentrated taste, light for Petrus
but food balance and sweet, slightly sickly, metallic nose, alcoholic but a
note of harshness at end; concentrated nose, but a certain made-up
character. Sugar addition shows through, but pleasant drinking; clothy nose,
but surprisingly pleasant drinking. Unattractive initially and not much
better when refreshed.
The table's order of preference, with the lowest figure top, was: 1. Latour
(10), 2 Mouton-Rothschild (15), 3. Lafite (28), 4. Haut-Brion (30), 5.
Margaux (33), 6. Petrus (34), 7. Cheval-Blanc (46).
My own votes were headed by Latour and Mouton-Rothschild. Ten-year-old wine
may vary from bottle to bottle, and only one bottle of each was opened.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Restaurant heaven by the Bay - Dining in San
Francisco / Nicholas Lander travels to northern California and is excited by
what he finds there
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nancy Cosgrove, a greeter and seater at Boulevard, one of San Francisco's
newest restaurants, described her job succinctly: 'It's as though I'd died
and gone to restaurant heaven.' I could just as easily have used the same
phrase to describe my fortnight's stay in the Bay Area.
Even for those who simply enjoy eating out, but do not share my fascination
with the restaurant industry, what is happening today in and around San
Francisco is exciting - perhaps more so than in any other large city.
It is not just the quality of the raw ingredients - the wonderful salads,
fruit and vegetables, an increasingly high proportion of which are
organically grown; the vast array of breads; and the excellent meat, poultry
and fish - but also the cooking techniques, which are innovative and varied.
They include wood-burning ovens, grilling over mesquite, spit roasting, and
the latest craze among American chefs - using stacked napoleons to present
food in layered mini-towers.
Spectacular locations for restaurants in and around the city, with views
over the bay and across the Golden Gate bridge to Marin County, are an
obvious attraction, while some spectacular modern design helps, too. It all
adds up to a package to convince even the most hardened sceptic.
Indeed, after dinner at Elka's, in San Francisco's Japanese district, Jean
Francois - who travels the world's wine regions selling the finest oak
barrels - admitted that the city's food was now better, in terms of interest
and value, than that of his native Burgundy. There are, however, two
economic factors which further benefit today's diner in northern California
and may set standards for restaurateurs elsewhere.
The first is the extraordinary growth in what Americans refer to as the
hospitality industry. The US Bureau of Labour Statistics considers food
service to be one of the fastest growing segments of the economy - it
estimates that jobs in this sector will increase 30 per cent overall, and
chef positions by 42 per cent, by 2005.
According to the California Restaurant Association, businesses which serve
food are the state's second largest tax source and in 1992 the industry
generated Dollars 24bn (Pounds 15.4bn) in sales and employed 780,000
workers. The number of American cooking schools to train future chefs has
increased from a handful in the mid-1970s to more than 500 today. The most
ambitious yet is due to open in 1995 in the former Christian Brothers winery
in the Napa Valley.
I had been told on a previous visit that San Francisco had so many
restaurants that if all its inhabitants were to go out to eat on the same
night there would be enough restaurant chairs to accommodate them.
Since then, San Francisco has lured chefs from Los Angeles where the economy
is less robust, enticed plutocrat Gordon Getty, the oil tycoon and son of
Paul Getty, to open Plump Jack's, initially a wine shop, now with a
restaurant attached - one restaurant, local wits observe, that may not have
to struggle quite as hard as its competitors to make a profit. All this has
given a second career opportunity to many chefs and restaurateurs whose
initial career ended in the recession.
As a result prices remain reasonable, menus and wine lists sparkle and
customers are solicitously looked after - if not they walk. The established
restaurateur's dilemma was poignantly voiced by Joyce Goldstein, whose
restaurant, Square One, has been winning plaudits for more than a decade.
'Every time a new restaurant opens we see our regular customers slightly
less often.'
A striking example of the American 'can-do' philosophy is the recent opening
of the Rutherford Grill, Napa Valley which has achieved a daily turnover of
more than Dollars 10,000 after just two months' trading.
This, comfortable, wood framed, roadhouse diner, which seats 120, is owned
by Houston Restaurants, based in Phoenix, Arizona and is the company's 27th
restaurant. Building began last January and doors opened on June 8.
Corporate policy with any new restaurant is to fly in their best staff from
across America - manager, barman or short order cook - for the first three
weeks to train their local staff.
The management realised that not only is the local competition intense from
such nearby restaurants as Tra Vigne, Stars Cafe, Mustard's Grill and Don
Giovanni's but that a sense of belonging to, and working with, the local
community is crucial for any new business's survival.
So for the first two days, for two hours at lunch and dinner, the Rutherford
Grill serves food free. Instead, every diner was asked to make a voluntary
Dollars 5 donation to two local charities and raised several thousand
dollars.
Business is booming. The queue of diners waiting for a table - the
restaurant operates a 'no booking' policy to promote what it calls 'the
spontaneous dining decision' - bears testimony to its reasonable prices,
efficient service and well prepared food; the spit-roasted chicken is
particularly good. The Rutherford Grill will hold its customers until a new
restaurant manages to make them a gastronomic offer they cannot refuse.
Restaurant heaven has no place for smokers. Most California restaurants
operate a no-smoking policy throughout to protect their staff from the
dangers of passive smoking. On August 1, Oakland passed an ordinance banning
smoking in all its restaurants. Naturally, this is being opposed by tobacco
company Philip Morris, but Californians will be able to vote on the measure
during the elections in November.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Mixed emotions of youth and age - Australian
Wines / Jancis Robinson is impressed by some vintages from Down Under
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There seems to be some sort of tax on showing emotion in Australia.
Certainly Australian winemakers are the most phlegmatic in the world, and
Philip Shaw of Rosemount is a prime example.
Earlier this summer, in his usual, heavy-lidded monotone, he presented the
first 11 vintages of his pride and joy, Roxburgh Chardonnay, in a suite as
opulent as the wine itself at the Ritz Hotel in London. 'Quite a nice wine,'
was about as close as he got to enthusiasm, even about the intense and
unashamedly Hunter Roxburgh Chardonnay 1993 (usually about Pounds 15).
The wines took us on a textbook trip through the recent history of the
world's favourite grape variety in Australia, with the younger vintages
substantially outshining those made before 1987.
This was back in the Dark Chardonnay Ages when winemakers thought that lots
of new oak and deliberate avoidance of oxidation during winemaking was the
answer. All that happened was that the deep golden wine all too often turned
brown and flat in bottle at about three years old.
From 1987 Shaw, arguably Australia's most influential arbiter of Chardonnay
winemaking fashion, used ambient rather than commercial yeasts, cut down on
the sulphur dioxide and acid additions, and began to decrease the proportion
of new oak.
Although the quality of Australian Chardonnay has increased almost
immeasurably since the late 1980s, relatively few of them (Petaluma and
Leeuwin perhaps) have demonstrated the ability to age. Most are made,
perhaps more sensibly, in the full knowledge that almost all Australian wine
is drunk within a few hours of being bought.
The Cowra region in New South Wales has long provided some of the best fruit
for this exuberantly fruity style of Chardonnay and The Rothbury Estate
Cowra Chardonnay 1993, Pounds 5.95 at 100 Sainsbury stores, is a
particularly fine example.
Grapes other than Chardonnay are a better bet for those with serious
cellaring intentions. The best of the bevy of Australian Rieslings available
in Britain will age well, and Hunter Valley Semillon is a prime example of
wine which actually needs years in bottle to show its best. Sainsbury's has
the probably underpriced McWilliam's Mount Pleasant Elizabeth Semillon 1988
for Pounds 6.25 in their top 50 stores; it is not nearly ready to drink.
By historical fluke (ships refuelling at Madeira perhaps), Australia grows
quite a bit of the long-lived, tangy white grape Verdelho, and producers are
beginning to see its potential. Richmond Grove Verdelho 1993 is another
exciting product of Cowra, from a Jacob's Creek affiliate, and costs about
Pounds 6 from stockists which include Sainsbury's.
More handcrafted and subtle is David Traeger's Nagambie Verdelho 1993,
Pounds 6.99, from the state of Victoria via the Australian Wine Centre of
London WC1 (071-925 0751). It has serious substance, no obvious added acid,
slight nuttiness and a slight fizz. It would make a great aperitif.
Australian reds have in general shown much better ageing potential than
whites. A few days before the decade of Roxburgh was displayed, Australia's
wine giant Penfolds showed off, inasmuch as Australians allow themselves to
show off, historical ranges of some of their most popular red wines back to
the prehistory of the 1970s, and even a slightly decrepit bottle of Bin 60A
1962.
Every Grange back to 1976 was a turn-on in some respect; but it was the
obvious age-ability of their high volume lines such as Koonunga Hill and Bin
128 that was most impressive.
Koonunga Hill 1982 was an absolute delight at 12 years old - just the thing
for the Bordelais who cannot believe that subtlety is ever to be found Down
Under. In fact although the wine contains more Shiraz grapes than Cabernet
(especially so in 1982 when Cabernet was all the rage and Shiraz an as yet
uncelebrated resource), the wine had an uncannily Bordeaux-like balance and
bouquet.
The 1982 was a museum bottle, but Koonunga Hill Shiraz-Cabernet 1992, widely
distributed at Pounds 5-something, is very easy to drink now and should keep
well.
In contrast, Penfolds Bin 128 Coonawarra Shiraz seemed a less successful
candidate for the cellar. The 1991 is still quite hard work because of the
acid that manages to dominate its big, fat fruit, while the 1986 was still
chewy but a bit simple, and the 1980 was old rather than mature.
The Wine Society of Stevenage has an Australian red that is at a delightful
stage of well-mannered, drinkable middle age: Houghton Gold Reserve Cabernet
Sauvignon 1988 is Pounds 5.95 and comes from the cool southern tip of
Western Australia.
Its maker would probably describe it as 'not a bad drink'. I would call it
gorgeous.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A fistful of fresh memories - Cooker /
Parsley, sage, rosemary and basil, Philippa Davenport looks at the best ways
to buy herbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Herbs now play a greater part in our diet than ever before. Yet, can anyone
name a fishmonger who still has the (once-common) courtesy of slipping a
bunch of parsley and a lemon into your shopping basket along with your
purchase?
In neighbourhoods with Greek, Italian, Indian or Iranian populations, there
are greengrocers who sell - at modest prices - huge handfuls of the herbs
essential to their native cuisines. If you are lucky, the herbs may even
come with their roots attached to help prolong their freshness.
That is the way I used to buy basil in markets in Italy, a country where you
might still receive this king of herbs as a gift if you are a regular
customer or a pretty young woman, or if you have bought enough tomatoes on
the vine or other produce from the stall-holder to earn his approval.
In Britain, if you have neither a friendly greengrocer to turn to, nor a
garden in which to grow herbs, the chances are that you buy fresh herbs from
a supermarket. Certainly, you are grateful for the variety available all
year round. But it irks to be asked to pay about 50p for 20g or less
(maximum two-thirds of an ounce) of something that grows as fast and
furiously as a weed.
There is something faintly mean-spirited about the small quantities in which
these crushproof-packed cut herbs are sold. I suppose the smallness of the
packs is, at least partly, because of the speed with which cut herbs wilt
even when crushproof packed. Coriander, in particular, has a nasty habit of
beginning to blacken and rot within a day or two of purchase, especially if
damp when packed.
To overcome this, some chain stores now offer fresh herbs loose in
crush-proof packs or complete with their own gardens (in other words, rooted
in punnets or pots, just like mustard and cress) for shoppers who do not
plan to use them immediately.
Herbs that are growing stay fresh longer - and they will continue to grow.
The proviso is that you take only a little snip here and there every now and
then. Frail plantlets such as these are massacred easily. Cut them back hard
in a sudden, greedy urge to make bowls of pesto and they are liable to curl
up their toes and die.
Long gone are the days when sage, parsley and bay were all that the average
English cook would contemplate using. Now, the more exotic the herb, the
better it sells. Basil was hot favourite until recently but rocket and
coriander have overtaken it, their popularity about to reach kiwifruit
proportions.
Lemon grass from Thailand seems easier to find than British lemon-sour
sorrel. And I have yet to see lemon thyme (so much more aromatic than common
thyme) or lemon-scented geranium leaves on sale. Other noticeable absentees
from the market-place are lovage, with its lemon, celery and curry notes;
and fennel, the feathery fronds of which make it the most pleasing of
aniseed-fragrant herbs.
My hopes were raised by a preview list from Daregal*, a French company which
is launching its herbs in the UK. Oregano, chervil, sorrel, lovage and lemon
thyme were all mentioned.
Alas, it turned out that the first two varieties were available only to
caterers while the others were not coming to Britain at all. At some
branches of Waitrose, Safeway and Sainsbury, however, home cooks should find
coriander, basil, flat-leaf parsley and half a dozen other Daregal herbs.
They are frozen, not fresh, but well done for all that: chopped roughly,
filmed with oil and fast-frozen for a free-flowing end product. Retailing at
about 89p for a 50g pack, they are priced competitively against fresh
produce.
Nothing can match the zip of good fresh herbs straight from the garden and
the fact that these frozen herbs are chopped does perforce limits their
uses. But they strike me as a far better back-up for fresh herbs than dried
ones at times when the fresh variety is not to hand. But the shake-and-use
packaging needs a rethink: it is too flimsy to open and close neatly on
successive occasions without spilling some of the contents.
These herbs can be - indeed, should be - used straight from the freezer as
they defrost almost instantly on contact with food, whether hot or cold. Do
not leave the packet hanging around in the kitchen while you cook - if
defrosted and re-frozen, the contents will become mush. For the same reason,
you need a cool bag and freezer sachets to protect frozen herbs when
bringing them home from shopping.
FRESH CORIANDER CHUTNEY (serves four-six)
Here is a recipe that makes lavish use of this popular herb: a sharp,
refreshing relish to serve in small dabs (like mustard with sausages) or to
use as a dip for samosas. Although best when made freshly, this chutney will
keep covered in the fridge for one or two days. It comes from the new,
revised edition of Madhur Jaffrey's Illustrated Indian Cookery, to be
published by BBC Books at the end of September.
Ingredients: 3oz fresh green coriander (the top leafy parts only) coarsely
chopped;  1/2 -1 fresh, hot green chilli, coarsely chopped; 1 1/2
tablespoons lemon juice;  1/2 teaspoon salt;  1/2 teaspoon toasted and
ground cumin seeds; freshly ground black pepper.
Method: Combine all the ingredients in the container of an electric blender.
Blend, stopping the machine several times to push the ingredients down with
a spatula, until you have a paste. Transfer to a small glass or other
non-metallic bowl.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Property: London's landlords can smile again - Cadogan's
Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Average rents in central London have risen 20 per cent in Mayfair over the
past year and 14 per cent in Chelsea, according to agent Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley. And there have been fewer British tenants over the past six months -
down 29 per cent in Kensington alone, where continental Europeans have shot
up 38 per cent. With a shortage of property, prospects for landlords are
good.
Good one-bedroom flats at Pounds 250 a week and flats with two to three
bedrooms at Pounds 500 are in great demand, according to Winkworth Central
Lettings; so also are houses at more than Pounds 1,000.
The lesson seems to be that if you find what you want, be prepared to agree
terms at once; otherwise, you are likely to lose it.
* * *
The Association of Residential Letting Agents is the professional body for
about 40 per cent of the country's letting agents. Its code of practice
includes forwarding rent payments promptly and not taking fees from a tenant
other than for the inventory and tenancy agreement. Its brochure, What Every
Landlord &amp; Tenant Should Ask, is available free from ARLA, in members'
offices, and from some Citizens' Advice Bureaux.
Send a stamped, addressed envelope to ARLA, 18/21 Jermyn Street, London SW1Y
6HP, or ring 071-734 0655 for members' addresses. Glentree Estates (081-209
1144), an ARLA member specialising in north London, also publishes guides
for landlords and tenants.
Typically, agents charge landlords 10 per cent of the rent for collection
and 15 per cent for full management. Henry &amp; James (071-235 8861), which has
a strong list in such top London areas as Belgravia, Chelsea and
Knightsbridge, charges a tenant Pounds 65 plus value added tax for a tenancy
agreement and the cost of preparing an inventory. The landlord pays for
checking it on departure.
Meanwhile, if you are letting a flat or house to which you will be
returning, it is worth making the effort to get to know the tenants. They
will be far more likely to look after the place properly.
Do not be mean or greedy over a few pounds when you are receiving hundreds.
Be sure to tell your insurance company. For a furnished let, you are likely
to find that the underwriters exclude 'mysterious disappearance' of contents
and will demand proof of forcible entry if anything is missing.
The deposit could go against such losses. But the most effective policy is
good relations with the tenant.
* * *
Fire regulations that came into effect in March last year are proving a
little-known trap for landlords. Curtains, covers and upholstery now must
pass flammability tests if they are part of a furnished letting 'in the
course of a business'.
A transitional period allows furniture used in the property before March
1993 to continue in use until December 31 1996, however.
The catch seems to be the phrase 'in the course of a business'. That should
exclude private, occasional landlords arranging their own lets but, once an
agent is involved, the landlord is caught.
What are the options? Let it unfurnished - that is already on the increase.
Or remove pieces that will not pass the test and let it part-furnished. Or
sell the furniture to the tenant.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Property: Wary buyers give rented homes a new lease of life
 -With negative equity afflicting many and job security on the wane, the
letting sector is buoyant again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the seven quarters since autumn 1992, it has - according to the
Nationwide building society - taken less than three times national average
earnings to buy a house. Apart from one quarter in 1970, buying a home has
not made such a small dent in people's wealth since 1957-61 when this
affordability ratio was steadily below three. (By contrast, it was 4.56 in
winter 1989.) Yet, the buying market stays soggy.
The rental market is buoyant, however. 'People who might have bought are
continuing to rent,' says Penny Parr-Head, of Cluttons London Residential
Lettings. Indeed, she estimates that 16-17 per cent of the firm's new
tenants in the first six months of 1994 do not want to buy at all.
These tenants represent a big change in the property market as they are
long-term renters, unlike traditional tenants - people on short assignments
or corporate re-location, foreigners, those between selling and buying, the
recently divorced and widowed, and young people who will buy one day - who
need the short-term flexibility of renting.
Together, the two groups are likely to turn the UK slowly towards the
pattern in continental Europe where about 50 per cent of accommodation is
rented, ranging from a low of just under 30 per cent in France to 75 per
cent in Switzerland. The UK average is a puny 7 per cent, with local peaks
of 14-15 per cent in London and Aberdeen, How different from 1900 when 90
per cent of UK property was rented.
The Britons who choose not to buy are an extra demand on a stretched letting
market, which is now at its annual, frantic peak of activity as tenants
scramble to settle themselves and their families before school starts.
Agents report that stock is as short as it is in the buying market, and that
rents have risen (see Cadogan's Place, above). Indeed, Parr-Head says
tenants are so eager that there have even been informal auctions. She
expects a further leap in rents when this quarter's figures are collated.
Thus, prospects are good for landlords, many of whom are Far Easterners who
have bought rental property in London with zest since the devaluation of the
pound in September 1992. A typical recent purchase is 4, 5 and 8 Observatory
Gardens W8, with 15 apartments.
Part of a re-development by Northacre, they were sold off-plan by de Groot
Collis for a total of about Pounds 10m, which works out at more than Pounds
470 a square foot compared with Pounds 375 for the first block last year.
Such investments should yield 8 to 10 per cent gross; perhaps a little less
in the affluent Belgravia district of inner London. Robert Orr-Ewing, of
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's nearby Chelsea office, says property prices in
Belgravia 'are so high that it is hard to achieve the same return'.
The recession and its aftermath changed attitudes among UK tenants,
especially the young. Many could not find employment after leaving school or
university and became sceptical about their prospects. They saw, too, how
their parents suffered when they lost their jobs.
What is the point of the costs and emotional commitment of buying, they
asked. In a few years, we may be somewhere else, unable to pay a mortgage or
with a new partner.
But the main reason for the turn to renting is purely financial. In the
1980s, government ideology promoted property ownership as the best way to
wealth. The recession, and the widespread plague of negative equity, have
made things very different - and a long way from the home-buying mania in
summer 1988 after the government announced in its Budget that spring that
multiple mortgage tax relief - which allowed people living together each to
claim relief on the loan for the same property - would end.
With low interest rates set to continue, the present 20 per cent income tax
relief on the first Pounds 30,000 of a loan can hardly be seen as the
special treatment for buyers it once was. And since that comes down to 15
per cent in April, the future looks even less welcoming.
There is, too, the fact that potential buyers who hold back and become
tenants keep their capital - and they can get a good return on this, since
real long-term interest rates are positive while inflation is low. If they
put that money into a home, continuing low inflation means they have little
reason to expect the compensation of capital gain from a rising house price.
For UK owners letting their own properties, the Housing Act of 1988, which
introduced assured shorthold tenancies, made life much easier - and saw the
gradual start of an improvement for people seeking places to rent. Until
then, there was the risk under existing law that owners could not regain
possession from private individuals.
The safest tenants were companies, which could not legally refuse to quit
when they had to; and foreigners, who were unlikely to start a legal battle
with the owner.
Assured shorthold tenancies do not confer any security of tenure, and
renters must leave at the end of their term (earlier if due notice is
given). With this guarantee of repossession for landlords, more properties
are now on offer and the pattern that was common before the second world war
 -when houses were rented by private individuals for longish periods,
without any social stigma - is re-appearing.
In June, for instance, Clegg Kennedy Drew was offering Dunkeld House, in the
Yorkshire village of South Dalton, for up to 10 years, at an initial annual
rent of more than Pounds 10,000. Another arresting offering is Birdcatcher's
Cottage, a folly designed by Humphry Repton on the edge of the park of
Woburn Abbey; this is available for up to five years at Pounds 600 a month
from the Bedford Estate.
The tilt to renting must be a worry to developers who build new homes for
owner-occupation. But Paul Mugnaioni, chairman of rented homes specialist
Quality Street, is one who knows exactly how the wind is blowing.
His firm, 75 per cent owned by Nationwide, offers lettings from Aberdeen to
Brighton in all sectors of the market on assured tenancies. (This
alternative to assured shortholds guarantees indefinite occupation as long
as the tenant continues to pay.)
The firm is now adding to its stock of 4,500 units - 2,500 of its own and
2,000 managed for others - and has started its own developing. As Mugnaioni
puts it (and new-home builders take note): 'The crash altered attitudes
fundamentally. Until then, all of us believed that God made house prices go
only in one way.'
Bedford Estate, Woburn Park (tel: 0525-290 202); Quality Street,
Glasgow.(041-248 4553) and London (071-431 6464).
In some editions of last Saturday's Weekend FT, the captions accompanying
the pictures of Bodidris Hall in north Wales (Pounds 425,000) and Four
Chimneys cottage on Dartmoor (Pounds 160,000) were transposed.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Independent Schools - FT 500: The old powers remain at the
top of the league - John Authers assesses the results of the FT analysis of
this summer's A-level results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Football fans will recognise the latest league tables of independent
schools' A-level results.
A wealthy elite in the big cities gets first choice of all the most
promising talent, so barely half a dozen have even a chance of coming first.
Outside this premier league, competition is often fiercer, but the top
positions are out of reach.
Each of this year's top four schools - Westminster, Eton, St Paul's and
Winchester - has had an average placing in the top five in the previous five
years, while only one of the top 12 - Downe House, a Berkshire girls'
boarding school - had not had an average ranking in the top 20.
Big-city day schools with wide catchment areas, and boarding schools with an
international reputation such as Eton and Winchester, attract more
applicants and are able to select abler students. In many cases they also
have strong financial resources, and their reputations make them proof
against the recession.
Fears that the stratified English education system has created a
self-reinforcing elite seem to have some justification. All the top four
schools were among the nine 'great' public schools identified by the
Clarendon Commission 130 years ago. The other five - Harrow (34th),
Charterhouse (45th), Shrewsbury (46th), Merchant Taylors' (49th) and Rugby
(65th) - all fared well.
Meanwhile the wind of recession blew through the rest of the independent
sector, with boarding numbers falling by 5.5 per cent. With fewer children
applying, many schools have no choice but to become less selective. There
are no A-level results printed here for the schools which have closed or
merged with others since the end of last term, such as Felixstowe College in
Suffolk, or Lawnside near Malvern.
The FT excludes from its survey schools which have less than 10 candidates,
as results for such schools might be statistically insignificant. This year,
that meant cutting out 28, several of which produced weak results.
The enduring strength of the traditional elite is the most startling feature
of the table, but the showing by girls' schools outside the elite is
scarcely less impressive.
Girls' schools have poorer resources than boys' schools. They are also
coming under increasing competition from boys' schools which have opened
their sixth forms to girls, such as Westminster. But this year, several
girls' schools, most spectacularly Downe House, registered impressive leaps
in the tables compared with their usual performance.
At face value, these results are a strong case against co-education. The
highest-ranked school which is mixed throughout its age groups, rather than
just in the sixth form, is Bablake School in Coventry, which came 37th.
This may be due to the historical accident that most independent schools are
single-sex, and those which are already the most successful have no
incentive to change.
But Sue Cameron, headmistress of Downe House, suggests that single-sex
education allows girls to avoid the sexual stereotype that they should not
do science. The school's 10 successful Oxbridge applicants include students
going on to read chemistry, material sciences and experimental psychology.
League tables themselves arouse controversy. While schools, particularly in
the independent sector, accept that rankings are inevitable, A-level results
can be judged in several ways, which lead to different league tables.
The FT's statisticians, using data supplied by the Independent Schools
Information Service, have tried to make these tables as inclusive, and as
proof against manipulation, as possible. They are based on total UCAS
points, which include both A-levels, and the new AS-levels ('Advanced
Supplementary') which are intended to be as difficult as A-levels, but with
smaller syllabuses.
All grades achieved, not just As and Bs, are taken into account, giving a
full picture of a school's academic strength, and crediting extra options
such as AS levels. However, general studies A-level, which is often ignored
by university admissions tutors, has been excluded from all the FT's
calculations.
The FT has also aimed to avoid over-simplification by ranking schools using
two separate scores - UCAS points per entry, and UCAS points per pupil. The
former gives the average grade in each exam taken, while the latter gives
the total grades each pupil has on average accumulated. Arguments could be
made for either measure. The former can be manipulated by deliberately
withdrawing pupils from A-levels where they do not seem likely to do well,
while the latter rewards 'exam factories' where pupils commonly take more
than the standard three subjects.
League tables compiled using the two measures would be different, as a
glance down the columns headed UCAS points per entry and UCAS points per
pupil shows. The two have been combined to give the ranking score (for which
the precise formula is points per pupil plus three times the points per
candidate divided by four).
As the bald ranking can unfairly accentuate what are often marginal
differences between schools' results, the figure in the second column gives
an 'FT score' which shows by how much a school has varied from the norm.
This is calculated so that an average school will score 1.00. This was
achieved by the schools ranked from 262 to 269, and is equivalent to roughly
18 UCAS points, or three Cs per pupil. By comparison, Westminster, with an
FT score of 1.54, was 54 per cent better than the norm. If this sounds a
little bland, consider that Westminster's pupils achieved this score by
amassing 314 A-grades - rather more than half the total - along with 129 Bs,
51 Cs, 19 Ds and four Es. They only failed four A-levels between them.
At a less exalted level, schools can be separated by 20 or 30 positions in
the rankings, but have almost identical FT scores. If this is the case, it
would be unwise to put emphasis on the 'superior' school's higher ranking.
One disadvantage of ranking by A-level results is that it is almost
impossible to treat fairly schools which ask students to study more subjects
in the sixth-form, via Scottish Highers, or the International Baccalaureate.
Both are respected by universities, while the Headmasters' Conference, which
represents the most prestigious independent boy's schools says A-levels have
'passed their sell-by date' because they are too specialised.
No schools offering Scottish Highers have been included, as there is no
agreed fair way to rank them. However, they will be covered in the FT-1,000
guide to secondary schools, published in October.
The figures for Cheltenham College, Malvern College, and Sevenoaks School
incorporate results for some candidates for the International Baccalaureate,
using an agreed points conversion scheme. All three are probably
disadvantaged as the baccalaureate is regarded as a harder qualification. It
is reserved for the ablest pupils who might have piled up As in A-levels.
Even so, if Sevenoaks' IB candidates are treated as one 'school', they
finish seventh. Once A-level candidates are included, the school ranks in
the 50s.
These FT tables have two more profound disadvantages. One is that they cover
only independent schools, and so do not enter into the question of whether
it is worth opting out of the state sector. The FT-1,000 will incorporate
state schools, but there is no central statistical body for the state sector
to parallel the role of Isis for independent schools, so we are not yet able
to publish complete statistics for them.
A second disadvantage is that they do not control for a school's ability to
select its pupils. The main factor behind the success of the top schools is
that most of their pupils are very able, and their success is thus of no
interest to parents with less academically able children who would not be
able to gain admission.
A system which takes into account pupils' ability and sees how much value
schools in the state-maintained and independent sectors have added would be
more useful. This is harder to deliver than it sounds, but one of the first
attempts to assess 'value-added', produced by statisticians at the
Department for Education, suggests strongly that independent schools can
improve children's A-level scores.
It compared the A-level point-scores that students achieved last year with
the score they had obtained in their GCSE exams.
As might be expected, children who did well at GCSE were the most likely to
get good A-level grades. But the statisticians found that, regardless of a
pupil's achievements at GCSE, they were more likely to get good A-levels in
independent schools than in the state sector.
For example, 42 per cent of the state school pupils achieving 70 or more
GCSE points (equivalent to 10 grade As) went on to get three or more grade
As at A-level. But this feat was managed by 61 per cent of independent
school pupils with similar GCSEs.
At a level within reach of rather more children, 11 per cent of independent
school pupils who had only managed between 45 and 49 GCSE points -
equivalent to about eight B-grades - went on to score three As at A-level;
while 56 per cent of them managed at least 15 A-level points.
In state schools, only 1 per cent of pupils with GCSE scores in this range
achieved three As or better at A-level, while only a quarter managed 15
A-level points.
These figures must carry a health warning. This is their first year, and
they may prove to be a freak. Even independent schools were surprised by
them, as they felt that they should already have added value to their pupils
by the time they took GCSE. It is theoretically possible, albeit unlikely,
that private schools look good on this analysis because their children
underperform at the age of 16. As they stand, the figures must be accepted
as a powerful case for independent education, at least at sixth-form level.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Sport: The man who fell to earth - Soccer / Peter Berlin
watches Klinsmania break out in north London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fan gave a little skip as he passed under the gate to the ground. He
clasped his little blue season ticket book so tightly that his knuckles were
white. 'Calm down, Andy]' said his friend without much conviction. 'It's
only a game of football.'
But it was not any game of football. It was the second turn on the Premier
League's emotional roller coaster; Osvaldo Ardiles's wild ride.
In particular they had come to see Jurgen Klinsmann, the German
international striker, who has joined Tottenham Hotspur and who was playing
that night against Everton.
The frenzy surrounding Tottenham Hotspur reaches a surreal level this
afternoon when they entertain Manchester United, champions for the last two
years, double winners last season. Yet all eyes will be on Spurs, a team
which barely escaped relegation last season and which started this one with
a six-point penalty.
Spurs began to capture the headlines when they signed Ilie Dumitrescu, a
Romanian World Cup striker, in late July, igniting a small fizz of
excitement among fans. The rocket took off when they signed Klinsmann. It
exploded to delighted gasps of surprise last Saturday when Ardiles solved
the selection problems presented by his two new signings by picking five
attackers.
Many teams in England play two strikers, some pick just one. Fans who have
teams in newspaper fantasy leagues would not be allowed to pick the team
Ardiles has selected. This is fantasyland.
The white knight is Klinsmann, the smiling, friendly, blond, swashbuckler.
He has already scored three goals in two games, helped wipe out the
six-point penalty and has talked defiantly about winning the championship.
It is as if he had stepped through Alice's mirror. A month ago he rivalled
Diego Maradona as the footballer most loathed by English fans.
The basic problem, for these fans, is that Klinsmann is a German. This is
not simply a question of who won the world war, although the tabloids who
greeted his two goals against Everton with 'Herr Raid Warning' and 'Master
Brace' seem determined to ignore Basil Fawlty's advice on this subject. It
is more a question of who won the World Cup. Since losing to England in
1966, Germany have won twice. In the last seven world cups, England have
reached the final stages only four times, and on three of those occasions
West Germany knocked them out.
This is also the reason why even non-Spurs fans are queueing to watch him. A
German star has chosen to play in England. Fans may hate to admit it, but
his presence suggests that foreigners respect the English league, it even
gives a little weight to the increasingly hollow boast that the Premier
League is the best (or at least toughest) in the world.
But Klinsmann is guilty of a greater crime. English fans still demand fair
play - at least from sportsmen of other nations - and they regard Klinsmann
as a cheat.
Eric Cantona, United's French striker, will miss today's game because he is
suspended again. Cantona has an unpleasant habit of kicking, raking or
stamping on opponents. Cantona is an 'artist' and therefore, the cant goes,
this is part of his nature.
Klinsmann, an athlete, is not violent but, in the eyes of fans, he is
sneaky. English fans criticise his habit of tumbling when tackled in the
penalty area. He is known as the Stuka, because he dives. The fans may claim
not to like him, but they pay to see him and they cheer when he mocks them
by diving across the pitch after scoring a goal.
Since Spurs signed him they have sold Pounds 500,000 of season tickets.
Shirts with his name and number are falling off the shelves at Pounds 47.24.
On Thursday, after his goals against Everton, Spurs' shares jumped 10p.
Klinsmann's powerful header at Sheffield on Saturday helped Spurs to win
4-3. His two in the first half on Wednesday, a close range header and a
satisfyingly spectacular scissors kick, gave Spurs a 2-1 victory. But he
cannot win games alone and a lot will depend on how well the other members
of the team play.
So far the attack is working nicely but the undermanned defence is creaking.
Ardiles' biggest gamble was dropping Gary Mabbutt, club captain and England
international, and picking two centre halves - Sol Campbell, 19, and Stuart
Nethercott, 21, - with barely 20 Premier League games at that position
between them. Today's match will provide a test of their nerve. After
Wednesday's game Ardiles said: 'We are cavalier, yes that is the right
word.'
After Ardiles, Mike Walker, the Everton manager, started to answer
questions. Suddenly the crowd in front of him turned and walked away.
Klinsmann had come in.
Two years ago, after the launch of the media-friendly Premier League, clubs
began to bring players to meet the press after matches. The first time Spurs
tried this, the choice was an experienced player who had scored the
match-winning goal. 'I just stuck my boot out and it went in,' and 'it felt
tremendous' was all he could manage. The experiment was dropped.
On Wednesday, Klinsmann stood in the same spot. He held forth articulately,
intelligently, charmingly until he was dragged away by Ardiles to some other
appointment.
In a way this Spurs team is a caricature of English soccer: stacked with
strikers, devoid of midfielders and with a very mixed bag of defenders.
Furthermore, there seems to be something in the air. There have been other
big scores in the first two rounds of league games. Liverpool scored six
goals in one match, Newcastle have scored seven, Sheffield Wednesday have
let in seven and scored five. Even Arsenal, whose recent success has been
built on defence, started the season with four strikers.
This may have something to do with the tougher rules on tackling.
On Wednesday, Everton did not commit a foul - a penalty for hand-ball apart
 -in the first half. If defenders keep refusing to tackle, it may be a while
before Klinsmann has a chance to dive in earnest. Maybe he will spurn it
with a smile.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Sport: The hardest test - Tennis / John Barrett explains why
the US Open takes such a toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For US tennis this is the best of times, the worst of times. With record
prize money of Dollars 9,360,100, the US Open which begins on Monday in New
York is the richest tournament of the year. Furthermore, the defending
champion and No 1 men's seed Pete Sampras is American. So is the man he
displaced from that position, Jim Courier. However, both are competing under
a cloud. Sampras has still not recovered from the ankle injury he sustained
in retaining his Wimbledon crown in July and Courier, down now to No 11 in
the rankings, may retire from the game for an indefinite period because he
no longer enjoys it.
Nor is there any comfort for USTA President 'Bumpy' Frazer in the women's
game, which a few years ago was dominated by Americans. Neither Martina
Navratilova (a naturalised American) nor the disgraced Jennifer Capriati is
playing and of the five American names that appear among the list of 16
seeds, the highest is the promising but inexperienced teenager Lindsay
Davenport at No 6.
Then there is the problem of injuries. Apart from Sampras, so many of the
game's leading players are affected that this year's championships are in
danger of resembling an episode of Casualty. The walking wounded include
defending women's champion Steffi Graf (back) and two of the men's seeds -
No 2 Goran Ivanisevic (hip) and No 9 Todd Martin (groin)  - as well as the
Swiss No 1 and Olympic champion, Marc Rosset (shoulder). In addition,
trainers Bill Norris and Todd Snyder report dozens of minor ailments among
the lesser names.
The unyielding hard courts at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadow
always subject competitors to a searching test of fitness and stamina in the
often oppressive, sultry heat. Coming at the end of a six-week build-up
circuit on similar surfaces, more and more players enter carrying some
niggling injury so that upsets abound. This year will be no exception. But
who will the victims be?
Thursday's draw was kind to world No 1 Sampras. Already the winner in
Australia and at Wimbledon, he is attempting to emulate Jimmy Connors (1974)
and Mats Wilander (1988), the last men to win three Grand Slam titles in the
same year. Even though short of match play, Sampras should limp past Korda
and either Medvedev or Berasategui to reach the quarter-finals where either
Stich or one of the two former champions, Courier and Edberg, should be in
wait.
Stich has had a miserable year. He lost in the first rounds in Australia and
at Wimbledon. In Paris he went out in the second round. Courier is in a
slump. After reaching the semi-finals in Australia and Paris he lost in the
second round at Wimbledon and, as mentioned, has lost the zest upon which
his whole game depends. Edberg is another fading star. No longer can we
expect to see him produce the sort of electrifying performance that won him
the title in 1991. That day he played the best tennis of his life to destroy
Courier.
The popular favourite will the Andre Agassi. Down to No 20 in the rankings,
this flamboyant showman is unseeded and is due to play either Guy Forget or
former champion Mats Wilander who clash in the best of the first round
matches. Ahead in this section lie Wayne Ferreira and Michael Chang, an
American who in 1994 has seen the best of times and has a seeding (No 6) to
prove it.
Perhaps the best outsider, if one can so describe a former champion, is
Boris Becker. Suddenly rejuvenated, suddenly refocused with the help of
coach Nick Bollettieri, Boris comes to New York with two recent tournament
successes in Los Angeles and New Haven. He also arrives with his wife
Barbara and baby son Noah. It is wonderful what fatherhood can do for you .
. .
The only two direct British entries, Jeremy Bates and Mark Petchey, have
both been drawn against opponents whom they are capable of beating. Bates,
at 72, is ranked 39 places ahead of Venezuela's Maurice Ruah who is at his
best on clay. Petchey, ranked 84, is 11 places higher than Karol Kucera, a
20-year-old Slovak, another who grew up on clay. However, after the trauma
of the losing Davis Cup tie against Romania in Manchester I have ceased
making predictions about British players.
I am prepared to predict that Steffi Graf will not lose in the first round
here like she did at Wimbledon. In fact, in spite of her recent loss to the
No 2 seed, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, in Montreal, I can see no reason why
Graf and Sampras will not claim the equal first prizes of Dollars 550,000.
Yes, for the best of players it should once again be the best of times.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Sport: Rude awakening - Cricket / Teresa McLean explains why
she is grateful to Mike Atherton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nostalgia is dangerous. Under its spell one looks back on past outrages and
sees them as endearing amusements. Rude captains, for instance. Not rude as
the match referee thought Mike Atherton was rude at the Oval, looking at his
bat 'with an air of dissent' on the walk back from crease to pavilion after
his first innings dismissal. But rude in the grand manner, as Archie
MacLaren used to be rude to the lesser mortals around him.
During the 1902 series against Australia, having argued vigorously with his
fellow selectors about who should play, MacLaren is said to have marched
into the English dressing-room, looked round at the assembled players and
cried out in disgust: 'My God] Look what they've given me this time]'
MacLaren's sins, like his many failures as captain of England, were forgiven
him because, as his obituary in the 1944 Wisden put it, 'he possessed the
grand manner' and people loved his flamboyance, however rude.
Atherton is paying the price for having taken over the English captaincy
cautiously, in a depressed period of English cricket, with confidence gone,
press predatory and management uncertain.
Last Saturday at the Oval, I watched Devon Malcolm bowling with terrifying
penetration through the South African defences. It was a once-in-a-lifetime
sight and I will never forget it. Malcolm's second over was a
double-wicket-maiden, which removed opener Peter Kirsten and No 3 Hansie
Cronje, leaving the South African score 1 for 3. You could feel the
excitement grip the grotty, friendly old Oval, but everyone expected the
South Africans to fight back and seize the initiative before long. They did
not have a chance, but the sad truth is that England and English supporters
have got into the habit of expecting to lose.
I remember asking Glamorgan last year how Viv Richards had managed to work
such wonders for them in his first year there. I think it was their captain,
Hugh Morris, who said: 'You can't imagine what a difference it makes, going
out to play alongside someone who expects to win.'
English Test matches have gone the other way. They are played in a climate
of pessimism which is hard to shake off and is a constant resource of the
sceptical press. If the pessimism falters, the next best resource is
complaint about one of the old favourites: opponents, umpires, groundsmen
or, best of all, captains.
South Africa have been welcome opponents this summer, full of enthusiasm and
old fashioned sporting spirit. Not suitable targets for complaint.
Thus far the umpires could only be praised for their excellent handling of
the Oval Test, even when umpire Kenny Palmer's view of Atherton's 'dissent'
as 'within the limits of acceptable behaviour' was over-ruled by match
referee Peter Burge. Palmer is an old hand, from the days when umpires, not
referees, controlled cricket and he continued his capable partnership with
Steve Dunne undaunted.
Groundsman Harry Brind's pitch was an Oval breath of life into a medium pace
series - dry, fast and lively. Test Match Special's Bill Frindall was so
impressed with it that he proposed Brind, not Malcolm, as man-of-the-match.
Atherton was the obvious target for attack. Under his captaincy this summer
England had defeated New Zealand and now had a chance of drawing the series
with South Africa, but when Kepler Wessels started digging himself in,
lifting the score from 1 for 3 to 73 for 4, English journalists drifted back
to the ever useful subject of doubtful field settings. Surely Atherton
should have more than two slips?
It was the South African journalists who sent pieces home praising
Atherton's shrewd handling of his bowlers, particularly Malcolm, whom he was
clever enough to bowl only in short bursts.
Even if Atherton was right to use Malcolm in short bursts, the timing of the
bursts was crucial. Indeed it was and on Saturday it was perfect. Malcolm's
first three wickets came in his first two overs, the next three after lunch,
the last three after tea, when the crowd roared Malcolm in to the crease to
blast South Africa from 175 for 8 to 175 all out.
The South Africans were more upset by Atherton's and Graham Gooch's
uninhibited pursuit of the 204 required to win than they were by their
batsmen falling victim to these spells of glorious bowling.
The last hour's play was more humiliating. It carried on England's batting
in the cavalier manner defiantly adopted by Phillip de Freitas and Darren
Gough the night before. It deprived all South Africa's bowlers of respect
and made their main strike bowler, Allan Donald, look pathetic. Gooch, man
of caution and experience, hit 33 off 20 balls with the air of one who is
bored with the slow pace of Sunday cricket.
'What am I going to say to them back home?' asked the young South African
journalist next to me, straightening his blazer and tie. 'I've got Atherton
and Gooch cast as anchor men, not meteorites.'
After three overs they had scored 38 runs. Though the run rate dropped to
eight an over when Gooch was out, Graeme Hick played his shots with a
romping power that I have not seen him use in Test matches.
Whatever the public's feelings about Atherton before the Oval Test, by the
end of it the main feeling was gratitude, not just for winning a match and
saving a series, but for releasing in the process an element of flamboyance,
of which everyone had long been starved. Priceless stuff, flamboyance.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Outdoors: I flew around the hairpin at 130mph - Peter
Whitehead swapped his commuter bike for a racer and tested his skill and
courage on the track
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WHITEHEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Motor cyclists live in a strange world of exaggeration. They travel at
exotic speeds - always above 100mph - they can never be beaten away from
traffic lights, and they never have bumps or scrapes, just heroic acts of
derring-do.
I know this because I am a motor cyclist. And like other motor cyclists, I
have felt the rush of adrenalin that accompanies riding at speed and I have
heard the call of the race track. I can also hear myself exaggerating: 'Put
me on a superbike and I could break the lap record in a grand prix.'
Such boasts are now so much hot exhaust. I have been caught out - sent to
school and found wanting. On one of Britain's racing circuits I discovered
that blasting around a track pushes you to the limit: it is a test of
courage and confidence in your own skill and in the capabilities of the
machine beneath you.
As a birthday treat, I was packed off to Mallory Park in Leicestershire to
join a class at the Drayton Croft Racing School. There it was that my bluff
was called.
I was fast but not quite fast enough. Exact speed is a mystery as the
school's bikes have no speedometers but, without exaggeration, it must have
been 100mph on the straights.
I had begun to tremble even during the pre-school pep talk - 'If you see oil
on the track, avoid it . . . If you 'high-side' it will hurt . . .'
By the mid-session de-briefing I was speechless. When asked a simple
question - 'How is it going?' - I felt strangled, my reply spluttering into
nothing like a clapped-out engine refusing to start.
Here I was, a commuter grappling with a highly-tuned 130mph-plus Honda
VFR400R racing bike, and all I had learnt about riding and roadcraft now
seemed wrong. I was looking ahead, seeing the coming bend and slowing as if
on my way to work, rather than maximising my speed on every inch of track.
I was weighed down by years of road experience on two and four wheels, and
knocked off balance by the sudden need for naked aggression.
Overcoming this background was clearly going to require more than the hour
or so we had been allotted on the circuit. But my fellow students seemed to
have grasped the idea rather more quickly as they flashed past in their
turquoise or mauve leathers, hired for the occasion.
There were 16 of us on the track for that hour-and-a-bit, divided into four
groups of four, each with an instructor to guide us round the 1.4-mile
circuit.
Steve Bevington, the tutor allocated to my turquoise quartet, briefed us
briefly and finished with: '. . . so follow me.'
This was easier said than done. Out of the pits, round Gerards curve, along
Stebbe Straight, and I was keeping up nicely with Bevington and the rest of
the class. But a gap began to open up through the Lake Esses. 'Hang on,' I
gasped as the screeching Honda engine below me begged to be shifted a gear
or two higher.
I closed up a little on the approach to the hairpin, fell back through the
chicane, missed a gear as I was changing up on the adversely-cambered
Devil's Elbow leading to the Kirkby Straight, and that was it.
The thimbleful of confidence I had begun with was spilled on the track and
only occasionally did I catch sight of my class-mates from this point on.
We did meet up again in the pits for that mid-session 'discussion'.
Bevington wanted to assess our performances; he sensibly arranged to assess
mine separately.
I had already witnessed the astonishing speed and nonchalance of the other
instructors flashing past, one hand on the throttle, the other on the hip,
as they glanced over their shoulders. This time the glance was at me, and to
my total amazement Bevington raised his thumb.
Back in the changing room, the 15 survivors - one had hurtled into a fence
and been bundled into an ambulance with seemingly minor injuries - were
handed their certificates and 'Rider Analysis Sheets'.
Bevington's generous marking awarded me nine out of 10 for position on the
track, application of instruction, and improvement. And he definitely hit
the spot with his low marks for confidence and potential. 'Good improvement.
Well done,' he wrote at the bottom.
With those words glowing inside me, I set off home - at 150mph, of course.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Outdoors: This marigold madness - Gardening / Robin Lane Fox
is annoyed by riotous roundabouts and municipal hummocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank holiday Britain is blooming. The roundabouts are a riot of marigolds
and heritage cities are screened behind hanging baskets as cascades of harsh
carmine petunias compete in mid-air with the country's best Georgian
architecture.
But why do we not rebel and demand that this municipal madness stop? Such
profligacy bears no relation to the thoughtful art to which knowledgeable
gardeners aspire. It is a style that belongs with the toytown mentality.
Townspeople are apparently supposed to take pride in all this - but most of
them are too bewildered to have a view. They are used to it by now and think
that it must be approved. Basket 'gardening' has spilt on to the streets in
a style which belongs with that ultimate British phoney, the British pub.
The Britain In Bloom Board goes solemnly round our townscapes, giving prizes
to those which have done more than anyone else. The prizes are then pasted
on to signposts in order to legitimise the local council tax. Meanwhile,
great gardeners have written, planned and laboured to prove that there is so
much more to the art than lines of fibrous rooted begonias.
More than a century ago, William Robinson asked the right question: if this
is the result which gardeners want, why not paint the ground instead? Yet, I
have watched while historic Oxford has been dug up near its centre and
re-laid in hummocks. We need to pay for these hummocks because begonias can
be displayed better at a tilt to the ground: they stare at us
full-frontally, elevated on the local rates.
The maintenance of bedding plants requires three to four times as much
labour as perennials. I want a council to kill my rats, empty my rubbish and
pass on the cheques to the people who teach our children. I do not want them
to plaster the roads with marigolds when the rest of us are trying to raise
our sights beyond them.
If you are annoyed already, be warned that it will soon be worse. I have
just penetrated the breeding grounds, the base camps from which the
wholesalers push pre-germinated seedlings at council departments: they might
as well be selling pots of vibrant paint.
For centuries, the dianthus was a sweet-scented pink, fringed or laced with
elegant colours. In time for the millennium, the breeders have made it go
mad: they have levelled its height, enlarged its flowers, and selected the
colours which glow. In 1991 and 1992, they won Fleuro Select Medals for
their awful offspring. Next year, Dianthus Strawberry Parfait and Raspberry
Parfait will be blinking like cats eyes on every road junction.
Petunias have been driven insane too: the breeders call them Petunia Frenzy
Blue Veins and they are now making Busy Lizzie Hyperactive - her flowers are
the size of the old half crown. Snapdragons have shrunk to the dwarf Chimes
module and gentle old families have been invaded by the mania for peaches
and cream. What counts is impact, accent, dazzle, bred like the fruit in a
supermarket to be level, monotonous and 'tiny-garden size'.
I am not being negative, let alone elitist. There have been good
alternatives, beautifully advanced by amateurs during the years in which the
municipals have gone mad at our expense. In the 1980s, the Royal Parks,
under Ashley Stephenson, delighted the Chelsea Show with soft colours and
half-hardy plantings for bedding.
The new style of planting in pots has been the star turn of private
gardeners and its artistry could so easily be put in place of local
authorities' unsolicited visual rape.
How can we stop it? I see little point in appealing to Europe because
French, Italian and German bedding are even worse. We cannot send for the
Americans because it is their breeders who have produced most of the
monsters, conforming to their national taste for big and bright.
I therefore propose a project to kill off the salvias, shrivel the marigolds
and return peace and quiet to our over-heated cities.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Outdoors: You can take a boy to water . . . - Fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a scene in Jonathan Dimbleby's recent television programme about
Prince Charles in which the young prince was receiving instruction from the
old prince in the art of fly fishing.
The lad stood in a Scottish loch, waving his rod back and forth, his gaze
apparently fixed - not on the water but on his dad, perched in his kilt on
two boulders.
It so happened that a few days before, I had taken my elder son fishing. I
was not wearing a kilt, and nor is he a prince, and our intended quarry was
not Scottish trout, but whatever we might find lurking in a miniature
weirpool on a sidestream of the Kennet in Berkshire. Nor were we fly
fishing. Instead, I carried a tin of sweetcorn, with hook and float at the
business end of the line.
I told him we would certainly catch fish. He - with the bolshie scepticism
customary in adolescent sons, and mindful of previous disappointments - was
disbelieving. I impaled a grain of corn, dropped it in the pool, and the
float shot under. Soon a dace was in the keepnet, to be followed by perch,
chub, roach and bream. Within an hour he was proclaiming himself an expert.
And after an hour and half, even though we continued to catch fish as fast
as I could rebait the hook and he could cast it, he announced that he was
satisfied, and asked if we could go and watch football on television.
The truth is that, in his heart, he is not a fisherman. This matters not a
jot to him or me. But that afternoon, spent whisking out a netful of little
fish, and the glimpse of the Royal fishing lesson, set me thinking about how
the love for a sport is born and how, in my own case, the fire was lit.
My father was no angler. But by the time I was eight or nine I had become
aware that two of my elder brothers were thoroughly infected with this
strange passion for angling.
They had been given elementary instruction by my grandmother afloat on
Windermere. They had learnt the nasty but necessary technique of sticking a
hook through a worm, and how to subdue the perch which grabbed it. This
knowledge they took to the banks of our local river, and there developed it.
And eventually I was allowed to go too.
We were fortunate in our river, the Loddon, which flows into the Thames at
Wargrave, Berkshire. We had friends who lived in a large house beside it,
and we were given the run of the two or three miles of river which went with
it. It is many years since I fished there, and I would not care to do so
now, for there is too much of a tangle of memories attached to it.
Thirty years and more ago, it ran clear and was rich in weed and fish. Chub
thronged the quicker water, with barbel as well; while the quieter holes
held perch and roach.
I was passionate about fishing at once, and it is a sign of the depth of
that passion that it endured, for it was two years before I caught a fish at
all. This great event took place, not on the Loddon, but at the mill on the
Thames at Sonning. The great grinding wheels are now silent, and the place
is a pretty theatre. But then the water in the millpool roared and surged,
and shoals of chub and barbel gathered there to feed on the tasty waste from
the milling.
It was a tricky place to fish. You had to stand on the road bridge, and cast
up with a heavy weight towards the mill. The bottom was strewn with snags,
and many a week's pocket money was swallowed up on the hooks and leads we
left there. The best time was early morning, and we would bicycle over with
the aluminium worm bucket clanking against the handlebars.
It was not much of a fish, the chub I caught near the willow tree on the
right side of the millpool. But it was big enough to require one of my
brothers to scramble down on to one of the bridge supports to net it. And I
felt that I had joined the big boys. Being made a bishop or taking one's
seat in the House of Commons might be an adult equivalent.
Not long after, I caught a much bigger chub on the Loddon. It came up and
seized a piece of floating breadcrust, dived into several weedbeds, and
reduced me to an utter lather before giving itself up. By then the fire was
well and truly lit, and - though it has flickered occasionally in the
intervening years - it still burns warmly enough today.
The moral of my tale, if you can call it that, is as follows.
You can teach your child, or anyone else's, to fish; but not to want to
fish. You can provide opportunity, cash, advice, encouragement. But the
spark, the magic of the passion, is a gift, from somewhere.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Outdoors: Under the stars - FT expedition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world trip.
Many of the 40 trails and 12 lifts at Las Lenas, Argentina's most modern and
up-market ski area, are named after heavenly bodies: Mercurio, Urano,
Jupiter, Venus and Neptuno. Even the hotels are named after star signs.
Had we consulted the stars ourselves, we would have come earlier. We had
chosen the worst possible time - a national holiday - and there was not so
much as a sofa to be had anywhere in the resort. We made plans to spend the
night in the discotheque, casino or even our borrowed vehicle. Finally we
found a room at Los Molles, 20kms down the valley.
What makes Las Lenas a formidable resort is the off-piste terrain accessed
by just one lift: Marte (Mars). This long, steep, windswept chair reaches a
high plateau at over 11,000ft from which scores of chutes and gullies fall
away in all directions, some bringing you back to the base area, others
taking you into the wilderness to such places as the Laguna Escondida
(Hidden Lake).
On the night before we were scheduled to travel the 800kms to Chapelco, our
next resort, we were homeless again but managed to make a virtue of
necessity: we enjoyed a leisurely dinner at the Piscis Hotel, skied one run
after midnight, and then set off. This gave us the rest of the night plus
the following day to reach our destination without needing to search for
snow.
After two good days in Chapelco we used our 'ski at midnight' ploy again and
drove towards the Chilean border. It was another 500 kilometres to Temuco
and General Lopez, where we were due to return our vehicle and ski the
'local' volcano at Llaima once more before driving through the night again
to Santiago and the airport.
Eight thousand miles away, another volcano - Ruapehu on New Zealand's North
Island - was awaiting us.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Outdoors: No need to fear 'deadly diesels' - Motoring /
Stuart Marshall looks at research that counters recent scare stories over
emissions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There have been a lot of scare stories lately about diesel exhaust
emissions. You must have seen the headlines: 'Deadly diesel: new evidence of
killer in the air' and 'Diesel kills, experts claim.'
The one common denominator of these stories is that they are heavy on
sensation but remarkably light on facts. Some quote the results of studies
in a few US cities - where, incidentally, there are few diesel cars - and
extrapolate them to Britain.
The studies suggest more people die from heart disease on days when
atmospheric pollution is high. They probably do. If you are old and ill,
breathing in more than the normal amount of urban filth is likely to hasten
the inevitable end.
Some of this summer's pollution stories could make you think that diesel
vehicles were the only source of all this pollution. And I am the first to
admit that clapped-out lorries, aged buses and ill-used delivery vans spew
out disgraceful amounts of black diesel smoke. Their owners seemingly are
untroubled by the police, who appear strangely reluctant to proceed against
them.
Of course, diesel cars make their own very modest contribution. Any kind of
internal combustion engine puts a certain amount of muck into the air. But
it is modest, for two reasons.
One is that diesel cars are still out-numbered heavily by petrol-engined
cars. The second is that a modern diesel car's engine can be inherently
cleaner than a petrol engine fitted with a catalytic converter to clean up
its exhaust emissions.
Who says so? No, not me - despite being an admitted enthusiast who has run
nothing but diesel cars as his own personal transport for more than 15 years
 -but Ricardo Consulting Engineers of Shoreham, West Sussex, a world
renowned automotive engineering think-tank and development laboratory.
Ricardo has just published Automotive Diesel Engines and the Future*, an
independent and unbiased technical view on their emissions. Modestly,
Ricardo says it hopes the paper will provide a useful contribution to the
debate on the likely impact of diesel-powered vehicles on air quality.
I am sure it will. But what it really does is demolish some of the tabloid
fantasies with a barrage of hard facts.
The paper notes that although emission controls (that is, exhaust
catalysers) started on petrol-engined cars in California in 1966, diesel car
emissions began to receive serious attention only in the 1980s. Even so, a
study by Ricardo for Mercedes-Benz revealed that a car diesel engine without
the simplest kind of catalyser produced fewer 'air toxics' (exhaust
emissions) than a petrol engine with an elaborate catalyser. And that a
catalyser-equipped diesel (as many now are) was more than twice as clean
overall as a catalyser-equipped petrol engine.
Ricardo says air toxins emitted by petrol-engined cars tend to be dominated
by benzene - a known human carcinogen - whereas diesel engines produce
hardly any. Besides which, a lot also gets into the atmosphere every time a
petrol car is refuelled - but not when a diesel is tanked up.
In essence, Ricardo's conclusions are that:
Diesels offer excellent fuel economy - up to 40 per cent better in the urban
cycle than petrol engines of the same power. Their exhausts are much cleaner
under cold operating conditions and they do not give off evaporative
emissions of hydrocarbons.
Over the next few years, replacing old and environmentally unfriendly buses
and lorries with modern, low-emission vehicles will benefit urban air
quality markedly.
Even though relatively little effort has gone into curbing diesel emissions
so far, much has been achieved. Further large reductions can be expected as
technical improvements go into production.
All future diesels have a potential for very low smoke emissions.

interested bodies. Call him on 0273-455611.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Travel: Over the bed of Charlemagne - Leslie Gardiner
explores a quiet corner of Europe where three nations meet and examines the
time-warp of the Fagnes, Belgium's mountainous fen country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE GARDINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Belgian Army built this tower, says M. Rhenan as, hand over hand, we
negotiate its spiralling steel rungs. Part of their assault course, perhaps.
There is quite a view from the top, nonetheless: northward the industrial
sprawl of Maastricht and Aachen, southward the undulations of a countryside
rich in pastures, pine woods and mineral springs.
This is Dreilanderblick, or Trois Frontieres, where three nations join
hands. Beneath us a farm-hand urges red cattle out of a Dutch meadow, down a
German lane and into a Belgian milking parlour. Cyclists from Aachen in
Germany park their machines in Belgium and unpack their picnics in the
Netherlands. The Meuse river becomes Maas before our very eyes.
'And that moorland to the south?'
'The Fagnes,' says Rhenan. 'The fen country of Belgium.'
Unlike England's fens, the Fagnes extend across mountainous ground. Between
Eupen and Malmedy, two little towns of European renown long before
Maastricht (they once issued their own postage stamps), we stand near
Belgium's highest summit, which is all of 2,000ft, at the ancient
travellers' rest called Baraque Michel.
I step up to the door of the Baraque and launch a thunderous attack on the
bell. It responds with a booming peal. When the Baraque was the only
building on the Fagnes, they tolled this bell to guide lost travellers to
safety.
'Even now they toll it,' says Rhenan. 'Two summers ago - you have certainly
read of it - a whole class of schoolchildren went missing on the Fagnes. The
Belgian army searched for them and the bell tolled continuously for two days
and nights.'
Today it is breezy but when the wind drops the mist will settle over the
Fagnes. They are no bigger than the English fens (about 40 miles by 25). The
Eupen-Malmedy road crosses them and the forestry department's map is a
gridiron of paths which intersect here and there at a maison forestiere. But
the paths are confusing in that sea of peat moss and meadow grass, and the
low-built maisons are poor landmarks.
'You lose direction,' says Rhenan. 'You walk in a circle. You grow very
cold. You sink to the ground and sleep in the bed of Charlemagne.' The bed
of Charlemagne is an expanse of brackish moss which gives rise to some of
the rivers of the Ardennes.
In an hour's walk we meet only one other walker: a German who comes here to
botanise and to listen to the tinkle of the streams. 'I live beside the
Rhine, but I cannot hear it any more. I only hear endless vehicles, drunken
immigrants, police cars and quarrels among neighbours.'
Turning our backs on the Maas-Rhine triangle (like leaving industrial
Lancashire behind as you climb to the Pennine Way), then descending easy
gradients and picking up south-flowing streams, we enter Belgium's smiling
back-of-beyond, the undiscovered country.
The zigzag streets and crooked spires of Malmedy and Stavelot doze in a
time-warp. On a town square enclosed by steep crow-stepped gables we meet
the shakos, frogged tunics and bassoons of a Ruritanian band. We almost
expect to see His Serene Highness, fresh no doubt from exercising his droit
du seigneur, appear on the balcony for the daily anthem and plaudits of
loyal citizens.
Or is this the line-up for one of those famous marches militaires, exclusive
to this region, which, with solemn music and uniforms older than Belgium
itself, maintain the pure, unbroken traditions of the old-time volunteer
marcheurs, the villagers who protected religious processions and defended
sacred relics?
But this is Lent and the marches do not usually begin until Easter Monday.
Meantime, the carnivals reach their climax. Happy the child of south-eastern
Belgium. He grows up in a world of make-believe. Early spring for him is the
season of clowns, giants, fire-eaters and sword-swallowers, cardboard forts
and papier-mache armour, stilt-walkers and fairytale characters come to
life.
From the way the adults behave at the Lenten festivities you suspect that
the children never grow up, and you do not blame them. We caught the
tail-end of Malmedy's six-day carnival, with its expensive fancy dresses. On
Shrove Tuesday we saw the mayor of Eupen handing the civic keys to 'Prince
Carnival', but didn't linger for the licensed buffoonery which followed.
And at Stavelot we mingled with the blancs moussis (dialect: 'dressed in
white') as they performed with pigs' bladders and fired salvos of confetti
from antique cannon. The blancs moussis commemorate the monks of Stavelot
Abbey, who used to escape and flit through the carnival in bedsheets and
false noses.
Dig a hole anywhere on the skirts of the Fagnes and mineral water gushes
out. Most carnival townships are also watering places. Queen of the spas is
Spa itself, which bestowed its name on hydropathic establishments worldwide.
Upmarket leisure pursuits have taken hold of this smug little town of
scented pines, fountains and golf courses.
We had managed to avoid the week of the Belgian grand prix which meant we
could motor round the circuit on the Francorchamps road, threading the black
rectangles of pines, racing past half-timbered farmhouses which carry the
slogans of Elf, Bosch and Pirelli on their roofs, past the white flagpoles,
covered stand and pits, under the Mobiloil bridge and down the long straight
where a whiff of burning rubber still lingered.
Finally to Liege, home-town of Rhenan, and I brace myself for a little
campanilismo. Long ago I passed through Liege at night and I remember
spiritual desolation, blast furnaces, slag-heaps and the clanking of trucks
loaded with pig iron and brown coal.
Nothing could be more removed from the present-day reality. Broad boulevards
sweep under curving cliffs where the Meuse used to flow. Every other car is
a Ferrari. Tall narrow houses clamber skywards. In the Outre-Meuse quarter,
a self-proclaimed free republic to which you are admitted with a comic
passport, the alcoved madonnas are newly-coiffeured and Baby Jesus has a
pink face. It is carnival time here, too.
Liege is a city of elegance and sophistication. It is a dockyard port, a hub
of revitalised steam trains, a showpiece of domestic architecture, a fashion
centre, a museum of industrial archaeology, a metropolis of marionette
drama, a mother of arts and sciences and, at this season, an overflowing
basket of flowers.
Challenged to name five famous Belgians, you need not step outside Liege.
The musicians Cesar Franck, Gretry and Ysaye, the sculptor Del Cour and the
crime novelist Georges Simenon will do for a start.
Gastronomy is rife. At the Vachter hostellerie we dined on Zealand oysters,
coucou de Malines and Moka cream. The Chateau Margaux '53 at the foot of the
wine list was amusingly priced at Pounds 165, but the Graves rouge at the
top was quite drinkable. After all, this was Lent. What must the Liege
restaurants be like at Christmas?
Later, we looked in at the Olivettes cafe chantant and the Ane Rouge cellar
on the waterfront, the scene of Simenon's first novel. What next? For me it
was bed.
Rhenan approved. 'Il y sont des nights, des stripteases, des gamblings . . .
sont amusants, mais ils ne sont pas Liege.'

FT  27 AUG 94 / Travel: Galicia marches forward into the past - Is it celtic
magic that makes this area of Spain refuse to become part of the present?
Nicholas Woodsworth braves the elements as he tries to find out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is some strange power about on the damp, green, western-most edge of
Europe. I am not a superstitious person. I will run a mile from mystics,
astrologers, mistletoe-draped Druids or new agers.
But enrobe me in mist on a sheep-cropped hillside, lash me with a couple of
rain-driven Atlantic gales, then set me by a fire in a stone village with a
bottle of something strong. In circumstances such as these, I am just about
willing to admit that even in today's modern Europe, some old celtic magic
is still at work.
How else could you explain Galicia, a place that should not really exist? I
can understand rain, moody introspection and an overbearing sense of the
past in places further north. West-coast Ireland, the hills of Wales, remote
villages in Brittany - all are natural homes for brooding spirits.
But Spain? This is supposed to be the land of hot sun and exuberant
passions.
There are many superficial explanations for Galicia's special character.
Some cite its remoteness and inaccessibility. It is a long way from the
tourist costas and cut off from the rest of Spain by the Picos de Europa
mountains.
Others cite its under-development and rural 'backwardness', a word that
sounds odd in forward-looking Europe until you run into your first Galician
ox-drawn plough or solid wooden cartwheel.
Still others put it down to the weather: the unending series of Atlantic
squalls and storms that keeps the Galician hills lush and green year-round
but discourages mass tourism, economic development and fiery temperaments.
Whatever the reason, it is all as un-Spanish as you could imagine. I still
say it is celtic magic. The celts arrived in Galicia in the 6th century BC,
and have not let go since, despite Roman occupation, Visigoth invasion,
Moorish marauding and Franco's fascism.
It is perhaps not inappropriate that Francisco Franco was a Gallego. He
shared the same values of devout catholicism, strong family ties and
attachment to homeland as his countrymen.
The old ways are still there, but Gallegos have fared better in post-Franco
Spain. Today they can pursue their own strongly nationalist credo, speak
their own language and ignore the rest of the country and the world
precisely as they like.
In fact, much of their considerable energy, as far as I can make out, goes
into creating inertia. For no matter what politics Irish, Welsh, Breton and
Gallego nationalists profess, celtic blood will out. Their ancient race will
continue to march forward into the past, towards history, often bloody and
tragic, and towards a soulful, collective tribal memory.
Even the casual visitor will see age-old forces at work, a tug-of-war in
which tiny Galicia is pulling itself away from a homogenised Euro-future.
Further, it is winning.
The howling wind that blew rain horizontally into Cape Finisterre was too
much for me, and I retreated from my lonely cliff-top post overlooking the
sea. Finisterre - literally, the end of the earth - is the western-most
point of continental Europe, and takes the full force of the Atlantic on its
jutting chin. Its lighthouse was not yet lit as I made my way along the
Costa do Morte, the coast of death, to the shelter of the fishing port of
Camarinas.
Only the suicidal would venture out to sea in such weather, and the harbour
was full of boats. But the village itself, in early evening, seemed dead as
well. There was not a soul in its streets, bars or shops. Even finding a
place to stay was difficult. Here on the wild and storm-battered northern
rias (drowned river valleys) provisions for tourists are rarer than they are
in the warmer, more protected ones to the south.
But in the Hotel Plaza, a homey place where the elderly proprietors made
space for me by their sitting room fireplace, I solved a mystery.
The entire population was attending a street carnival up at the church to
celebrate the coming feast-day of the village's patron saint, San Xurxe -
Saint George to you and me.
I wandered over to see how Gallegos let loose. On the way, I noticed what a
mish-mash of a village Camarinas was. Gallegos have traditionally built with
the slate and grey granite of the hills that surround them.
Even the crops so laboriously produced with plough and scythe and sickle are
stored in granite. All over the village were vast hand-hewn horreos, oblong
grain silos with peaked roofs, perched 6ft above the ground on
mushroom-shaped stone piles.
Invariably topped with stone crosses, these bizarre and ancient
constructions lend an unworldly air to the Galician countryside.
But Gallegos have failed to grasp the aesthetics of contemporary building.
In the post-Franco years easy credit brought a construction boom to a people
who had lived the same way in the same houses for hundreds of years.
Gallegos used concrete the same way they used stone. The result is fairly
messy.
The street up to the Camarinas church was a hodge-podge of rough, unpainted,
concrete-slab houses, road-side heaps of straw and manure, fields of
cabbages, impromptu car parks, horreos with washing drying beneath them, and
a couple of empty bars with televisions blaring away.
An innovative village festival committee had hired a rock group from a
distant city and the band was doing its best to pretend it was still in the
20th century. But it was getting little encouragement from the villagers.
Coloured lights, wailing guitars, tight leather trousers, smoke-machines -
nothing seemed to raise a reaction from the inhabitants of Camarinas.
Hands in pockets, berets pulled over weathered faces, the villagers stood in
the street staring impassively at the temporary stage as the rockers went
into wilder and ever more desperate displays of abandon. Song followed song;
there was not a hand-clap, not a cheer, not a smile of amusement or
derision.
It ended, mercifully, in a sudden downpour. The crowds ran for cover, the
stage lights flickered and speakers crackled as water invaded the makeshift
wiring. There was a last pathetic wail, a crash of static, and all was
plunged into darkness and silence.
Enthusiasm ran high, though, with the advent next morning of a more solemn
and traditional celebration. I woke to the sound of lugubrious music and
opened the window to a cloudy sky and a brass band in threadbare blue
uniforms winding its way through the streets. Hard on its heels came a
traditional Galician band, with the same mournful drone played on the same
bagpipes you can hear in Scotland. The celts were never great ones for
innovation.
After circling the town a number of times, stopping on each circuit for a
quick round at the harbour-side bar, the bands returned to the church. The
entire village filed inside, the men in their sombre Sunday best climbing to
an upper gallery, the women and children in the pews below.
Even here the miracle of modern technology failed to adapt itself to
Galician life. Failing to master the hand-held remote control unit that
switched on and off the mass's recorded music, the priest behind the altar
found himself with an organ cantata on the rampage.
But after mass the plaster statue of Saint George, complete with horse and
fiery dragon, was hoisted to the shoulders of four village stalwarts. Three
times around the church they went, followed slowly by the congregation and
the village's collection of stray dogs.
The wind blew, the rain fell, church bells pealed, rockets were fired into
the air with great explosive bangs, and the bands played on. It was
magnificent.
I did not stay for further celebrations of tribal bonding, but took
advantage of a break in the weather to drive out to Cape Vilain on the far
side of Camarinas for a picnic. At the end of the cape I discovered a wind
farm, 25 towers supporting 25 vast propellers whirling and moaning
ceaselessly in the wind. They were as impressive in their way as the ancient
horreos scattered about.
Perhaps the wine I had with lunch was stronger than I imagined. Or perhaps I
was coming under a Galician spell. As I lay on the rocks looking up at the
towers, a curious idea came into my head.
What, I wondered, if this wind farm were some enormous celtic deception  -
not generating power at all, but, by the steady turning of its propellers, a
device intended to pull Galicia imperceptibly further out into the Atlantic,
away from the modern continent of Europe. It might take 1,000 years or so,
but what is that to the celts?

FT  27 AUG 94 / Travel: A sackful of myths - Practical Traveller / South
America is no longer a land of generals and jungles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For those who think of Latin America in terms of generals, jungles and
sackfuls of worthless currency, it may be time to overhaul some myths.
Things have changed.
South America's soldiers have long since goose-stepped back to barracks,
their power usurped by squadrons of technocrats and battalions of economic
miracle-makers. Hyper-inflation has largely been replaced by hypermarkets
and stockmarket hyper-activity. As for jungles, you should be so lucky.
Visitors to this new South America have been relatively thin on the ground.
You can still find yourself virtually alone amid the Inca ruins of Machu
Picchu in Peru, the solitary visitor to a Patagonian penguin colony in
Chile, or the only foreigner in a Paraguayan bar with no hands-on experience
of a Luftwaffe bombing raid.
South America is extraordinarily varied, economically, politically and
culturally. From afar it may be hard to distinguish Uruguay from Paraguay,
but close up they have about as much in common as France and Albania.
If the South America of your dreams is a tempestuous land of cultural
exotica and rampant foliage, then steer clear of Argentina and Uruguay, the
most temperate and European of states.
South Americans holiday in Buenos Aires because it is just like Paris but
far closer to home. Uruguay has such a sophisticated European-style welfare
state that everyone there is either still studying or on the point of
retirement. These countries will offer you art, theatre, style and a
coffee-house atmosphere.
Chile and Argentina may merge into one on the map, but historically their
peoples have been arch rivals. Chileans consider Argentines arrogant, rich
and lazy while Argentines view their trans-Andean neighbours as provincial
and rather dull. What they have in common is the dazzling lake district and
the forlorn beauty of Patagonia, both of which straddle their southern
border.
Northwards your chances of a culture shock or an electric shock (wiring can
be hazardous) are greatly enhanced. But even in Brazil, Bolivia, Peru,
Ecuador and Colombia, many of the big cities can be disappointingly western.
Sao Paulo is a lot like New York, just bigger.
Outside the urban centres, though, things become more like you might expect.
Ponchos, llamas, parrots, ruins, deadly snakes and deadly-long bus journeys
all await. Few are likely to be disappointed by the Galapagos islands in
Ecuador, the astonishing Inca cities of Peru or Venezuela's Angel falls, the
highest in the world. Less well-known are the Jesuit ruins of Paraguay, the
desolately beautiful northern beaches of Peru, or the gold-encrusted
churches of Quito.
Depending on where you go, prices range from the give-away (Ecuador, Peru)
to the give-me-back-my-arm-and-leg (Argentina). Because the Argentine peso
is fixed to the dollar, the portenos of Buenos Aires are no strangers to the
Dollars 50 cab fair or even the Dollars 5 cup of coffee.
Trips to restricted areas, such as the Galapagos islands, also tend to be
expensive.
Air fares between South American states (and in some cases within countries)
are normally expensive. If you are keen to jet-set between countries, it is
usually much cheaper to buy a package of flights before you set off. In
London, Journey Latin America (tel: 081-747 3108) specialises in this. Some
South American airlines are not in the best of economic health, so it might
be advisable to take out insurance in case your carrier folds.
There are direct flights to some of the bigger cities (Sao Paulo, Rio,
Buenos Aires, Caracas and Santiago) from many European capitals, with
connections to smaller destinations. You can fly almost anywhere on the
continent from Miami.
On safety, most Latin American cities present the same kinds of risks that
one associates with big cities almost anywhere. Buenos Aires and Santiago
are relatively crime-free, while Rio and some Colombian cities have less
enviable reputations. Dangers generally become more pronounced the greater
the economic gulf between those sipping champagne and those rummaging
through rubbish bins, though this is not a hard and fast rule.
Visitors concerned that they may face the anti-gringo sentiments
historically associated with South America should take comfort from the fact
that much has changed in this respect, too. Distrust of outsiders has been
tempered by a desire among many to emulate a western lifestyle. To graffiti
in Santiago proclaiming 'Gringo go home', someone recently added: 'And take
me with you.'
The South American Handbook, which is updated annually, is virtually
indispensable for travellers to this part of the world. From Trade and
Travel Publications.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Fashion: Inspired by her memories of the Caspian Sea - Lucia
van der Post on the sheer elegance of Shirin Guild
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All summer, the suit I have worn most often - the one I have reached for
when wanting to be well-dressed enough to face the frock-fancying world
without feeling all trussed up - has been a relaxed number I found by chance
in Browns of South Molton Street, London W1.
Attracted at once by its air of off-hand chic, its great comfort (the skirt
has a full-length flap that gives it a bit of dash and an elasticated band
to accommodate lunch at the Caprice) and its excellent price, I did not know
then how often I would wear it.
Judged by that old fashioned editor's adage that the true cost of a garment
is the price divided by the number of times you wear it, the suit has cost
little more than a row of beans and I have only had it since April. Who
designed this marvel, then? An elegantly thin and talented Iranian called
Shirin Guild, who now lives in London and is married to Robin Guild, (an
interior design consultant once married to Tricia Guild of Designers' Guild
who, it so happens, wears Shirin Guild's clothes much of the time). Her
autumn range is as distinctive a collection of clothes as I have seen in a
long time.
Most of her fans first become addicted to her clothes after buying one of
her sweaters. You may think that a sweater is a sweater is a sweater . . .
until you see Shirin Guild's sweaters. They are voluminous and dramatic -
great square shapes with hemlines that dip and sleeves that start somewhere
around the elbow. I have never yet worn one without those who have come upon
them saying: 'Aha, I see you are wearing a Shirin Guild sweater,' and those
not in the know wanting to know where they can buy one like it.
I think they work best with her own ethnically-inspired trousers - slightly
square-cut, often cropped above the ankle, sometimes capaciously-cut rather
like baggy Kurdish trousers, but they can as easily be worn with jeans or
leggings.
Like Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garcons and Issey Miyake, Shirin Guild
derives much of her inspiration from the traditional indigenous clothing she
saw all around her as a child. 'I always think,' she says, 'of those
scarecrows by the Caspian Sea wearing great black square coats.'
She uses the bold shapes and strong lines ('often peasants simply cut and
fold the fabric and then cut holes in the middle for the head') that are the
hallmark of the clothing worn by the working people of Iran and this gives
her pieces both a strong identity and great comfort.
Though Guild herself wears her own clothes to perfection and she is so thin
that she was busy downing pints of creamy milk to fatten up when we met,
they are particularly kind to larger women; capacious but having
considerable pizzazz.
The collection has a strong hand-writing but the pieces do not have to be
bought as a package or outfit. Issey Miyake once said: 'I love to see people
make the clothes belong to them, make them no longer mine, but their own.'
It could also apply to Guild, for her clothes demand a complicity with the
customer. They, too are 'not a finished piece of design until the wearer has
made her contribution'.
At Browns, Guild's clothes are sold mainly as separate pieces. 'The women
who buy Shirin Guild's designs tend to have a great deal of personal style
and they are confident about mixing her pieces with the clothes they already
have,' says Francoise Tessier, chief buyer and a director of Browns. Kate
Bush, the singer, is a fan, so is the designer Maryse Boxer and a TV
anchorwoman from Washington DC who buys the entire collection each season by
telephone.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Fashion: Bloomsbury in artist's bloomers - Me and My
Wardrobe / Jane Mulvagh meets Celia Lyttelton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Celia Lyttelton, artist, art critic and traveller, is a throw-back to a
Bloomsbury world. Her flapper's bob, preference for short skirts, silk
stockings, and brocade rather than sensible shoes and the arts of Albion,
created by her coterie of friends, is reminiscent of those rarefied tastes
which preoccupied the Bells, Woolfs and Frys half a century ago.
Indeed many of their descendants are her friends and fellow artists and,
like them, her decorative surroundings, dress, and reading material are all
crafted by them. Cressida Bell painted the silk that covers her cushions,
Andre Dubreuil designed the chair in which she sits, Belinda Eades the
sconces lighting the room, Craigie Aitcheson, Paul Benney and Matthew
Spender painted the portraits of 'Celia' that adorn the faux-Pompeian villa
walls of her drawing room.
Alastair Thane photographed her in the ball dress given by her friend and
former lodger, Lady Henrietta Rous. The wardrobe holds clothes by Georgina
Godley, Abe Hamilton, Paul Frith, Cressida Bell, Koji Tatsuno and Bella
Freud; all of whom have dined at her Jasper Morrison table.
With unabashed aesthetic confidence and an absolute disregard for the winds
of commercial taste, Lyttelton surveys the contemporary art scene; hangs it,
wears it and reports on it in the pages of Tatler or the Japanese cult
magazine, Le Millenium.
Her love of the avant-garde is disciplined by an exacting sense of manners.
Practicality and comfort are marginalised by her love of ceremony,
decoration and humour. She loathes sports clothes and all the sloppiness
they engender, denim for its prosaicness, Valentino for his vulgarity and
Azzedine Alaia for his ludicrous and cruel demands on the female form.
There is nothing egalitarian, commonplace or sensible about Lyttelton's
taste.
She never goes to shops. 'I hate them. They never have anything you want and
they are expensive. I only go into them when I am abroad.
'Last month I spent three hours in Issey Miyake's Tokyo store, just admiring
the colour combinations.' Instead she buys from her friends. 'It's so much
more fun trying on clothes in Abe's (Hamilton) studio with the sound of
sewing machines still putting the seams together or buying a whole load of
outfits in Bella's (Freud) sitting room, while she's on the 'phone and
friends pop round. Anyway, it's cheaper that way.'
Lyttelton's attitude to buying clothes is the same as it is to buying
furniture or paintings: she enjoys patronising young talent and 'in a modest
way, I like helping a designer on his way and helping to set a trend. That's
why I like young designers who have not been discovered, so that I can be
the only one wearing it. I cannot bear anyone else having something I have.'
Apart from clothes from designer friends, Lyttelton, dresses in cast-offs -
a Mary Quant mini given to her by George Melly's wife, Diana; a Molyneux
inherited from her grandmother; bloomers from the Spanish painter Anna
Corbero; an old 'Granny Takes a Trip' jacket from Nell Campbell (of the New
York nightclub); and an Ossie Clark skirt - or junk-shop finds from Echoes
in Hebden Bridge or antique shops wherever she happens to be staying.
Lyttelton is 'never knowingly underdressed'. Her two extravagances are silk
stockings of every shade and her custom-made Rigby &amp; Peller black or pink
satin bras, deemed a necessity because: 'My bosoms are huge and my back is
tiny. Every time I went into a department store the assistants just laughed,
so Issey (Blow) dragged me to Rigby's'
Lyttelton cannot remember a time when she did not love clothes. 'As a child
I would fantasise about them and was much more fastidious than I am now. I
used to have specially tailored first night gear to accompany by grandfather
(the theatre critic Sir Harold Hobson) and when I was a teenager I had 10
pairs of platforms from Petticoat Lane and pirate gear from Westwood.'
Her sartorial icons now are Marella Agnelli for 'that neck' and her good,
simple taste and Issey Blow, features associate of Vogue 'because all day
she wears evening clothes'. Her pet hate is anything touched by the grunge
school of dress and most Italian fashion.
Her incomprehension of Italian style is reciprocated, for few Continentals
can cope with her disregard for convention. It is not unusual for Lyttelton
to turn up to a party in one beautiful shoe, 'the other being lost on the
hard shoulder of the M4' for she would rather wear one stunner than two ugly
ones.
She used to suffer a weakness for Manolo Blahnik's shoes. 'I would go to all
his sales but now they are really off, rather Dolcis. I was so angry with a
pair I bought recently that I ripped the tassels off.' Instead she is shod
by Johnnie Moke, Miranda Morrison, Freud and, when working in her etching
studio, by a 1930s pair of white leather ladies golfing shoes worn with a
white overall and white opaque tights.
For someone who adores clothes, Lyttelton is blessed with a sense of
contentment. 'I do not need any more. Anyway people keep giving me their old
stuff and once a year I do buy one thing, otherwise there is an embargo. In
the end one has too many. I often forget I've got outfits because they've
fallen off hangers and lie at the back of my wardrobe and I've lost so many
Philip Treacy hats in New York nightclubs.'
If she were to have a windfall she would spend it on coloured kid leather
gloves from Yves Saint Laurent in Paris, more real silk stockings and a soft
leather bag.
This unorthodox aesthete would also like to make two pleas: 'More gold, like
gold sandals. People don't wear enough gold. And the daring mix of colours
and patterns, not in a gypsy style, but a more sophisticated one. Oh, and
one more thought. No more monochrome black.'

FT  27 AUG 94 / Britain's hire education: Andrew Gilligan looks at the
international appeal of UK universities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GILLIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Ruehl left school in Frankfurt with an academic record which would
have made him welcome at any university in Germany.
Instead, as national barriers come down, Ruehl - along with thousands of his
countrymen - has decided to study in Britain, where conditions for students
are much better, and his fees will be met by UK local authorities. He is one
of an increasing number of young Europeans to take advantage of EC
regulations enabling them to escape overcrowded campuses in their own
countries.
Figures from the Department for Education show that the number of
continental EC students at British universities has risen to 35,200, almost
seven times the figure a decade ago. The numbers arriving have risen by a
quarter in each year since 1988.
The flood of foreign undergraduates is increasing the already stiff
competition among British school leavers for the most favoured university
places, because there is little incentive for the British to study abroad.
Ruehl, in his second year at Queens' College, Cambridge, explains: 'My
friends at German universities are scrambling for floor-space in lectures
with 800 other people. Here, I get two hours' one-to-one contact with my
professor every week.'
Some nations seem keener on Britain than others. The Germans are becoming as
ubiquitous on campus as they are in holiday resorts. Greeks are running them
close, and both groups now outnumber the former leading nation, America. The
French, however, are scarcely visible.
Previously, continental Europeans have come to Britain as postgraduates, or
as part of a course based in their home countries. But the recent increase
is made up mostly of students choosing Britain for a first degree. They
follow the same syllabuses as everyone else; they sit the same exams; many
even come complete with British A-levels, taken at sixth-form colleges in
the hope of improving their entry chances. Most importantly of all, under EC
rules their fees are paid by the British local authority where they study.
For the cosmopolitan, multilingual children of the European bourgeoisie, it
is a bargain.
'British higher education is idyllic, Elysian compared to most European
systems,' says Judie Cole of the German Academic Exchange Service, a
London-based agency which advises those wishing to study in the UK.
In an odd inversion of the normal rules, continental European students
travelling across the English Channel are wafted from a struggling,
utilitarian world of dormitory beds and plastic cutlery into a privileged,
even sybaritic, existence of private rooms and personal tuition.
The continental tradition of accepting for degree courses all who pass a
school-leaving exam may be egalitarian, but it also brings overcrowded
halls, impersonal teaching and, say many, academic mediocrity.
'You are just a number,' says Cole. 'Many have never spoken to their
teachers.'
Students must sometimes sit through a morning of lectures outside their
subjects in order to be sure of a place for the afternoon. Unlike in
Britain, drop-out rates are high.
British universities' selectivity, as much as their comparative luxury, is
the attraction for the bright and ambitious.
'A British degree marks you out from the crowd,' says Ruehl. 'German
employers know it's tough to get in.'
A three-year BA is a quicker way of showing your mettle than the traditional
continental route of a further degree, rarely accomplished in under six
years.
Universities are happy - and perhaps slightly flattered - to welcome their
clever new applicants. Dr Graham Richards, senior tutor of Brasenose
College, Oxford, wrote in the university's magazine that they were 'likely
to become a major part of our admissions' from which 'the university can
only gain'.
For British universities' traditional customers, however, the academic
migrants are a threat. Every place for a continental high-flyer means one
less for a British student. As yet, the numbers are too small to matter
much, but Dr Richards predicts that 'if in 10 years, 25 per cent of our
intake is from the continent, the British parent who has paid large public
school fees in the hope of buying an easier route to Oxbridge may begin to
squeal'.
Dr Richards' forecast is a long way from fruition; 400 Germans at Oxford is
still not many in a university of 13,000. But the cross-channel students,
many destined for their countries' elites, already have an importance for
Britain's European relations out of all proportion to their numbers.
Ironically, however, the very factors which draw students to Britain in the
first place are disappearing even as they arrive in increasing numbers. As
high a proportion of the British student-age population now attends higher
education as in the rest of Europe; and with the sector's breakneck
expansion have come problems, albeit in embryonic form, familiar to any
inmate of Bochum, Padua or Grenoble.

FT  27 AUG 94 / How To Spend It: Designs for the garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since I last wrote about Frolics of Winchester, a small company with an
individual approach to designing everything the well-dressed garden needs,
it has expanded its range. Its chief claim to our attention was its use of a
material called Medex, made from a strong and versatile mix of 85 per cent
wood fibre and 15 per cent resin.
Because Medex lends itself to easy cutting, Frolics developed a series of
interesting garden benches and trellising.
There is now a much fatter catalogue, a larger range of garden seating
(simple and straight, curved, circular for going round a tree, and a corner
seat) and tables (round, octagonal refectory and with a variety of bases) as
well as bed headboards and decorative facades for window-boxes, both
photographed here.
The headboards can be custom-made and designed for adults or children.
Prices range from Pounds 170-Pounds 280 (excluding VAT and delivery).
Frolics sells both the window-box (Pounds 40) and the decorative facade
photographed here in dark green, grey green, dark blue or white (Pounds 45,
3-4ft long), or any other colour for an extra Pounds 7.
Finally, not photographed, but very dramatic are Frolics' perspective arches
they make a striking focal point, particularly suited for small walled town
gardens (Pounds 56-Pounds 120).
For details and a catalogue write to Frolics of Winchester, 82 Cannon St,
Winchester, Hants, S023 9 JQ. 0962-856384.

FT  27 AUG 94 / How To Spend It: Ideas above his workstation - Lucia van der
Post finds that desk design is catching up with office technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Marc Vlessing, a media consultant and film producer working almost
entirely from home, wanted a new desk to cope with the screens, computers,
cables, and machines that were cluttering his work-surface, he found, to his
astonishment, that there was almost nothing on the market that met his
needs. Or rather, nothing that cost less than about Pounds 4,000.
He started by going to Habitat and then to an office stationery store ('Have
you seen what they have to offer?' he explodes. 'It's as if they were still
operating in the 1950s') but neither came up with anything of the size and
quality he was after.
The desks in the furniture stores tended to be not big enough to cope with
the serious amounts of technology the up-to-date homeworker needs, including
a screen, fax machine and printer. Those in the catalogues of the office
furniture companies were mainly aimed at the purchasing managers of large
companies and were quite unsuitable for any domestic environment.
Some furniture retailers, it is true, specialise in desk systems, all
clearly aimed at the 'executive' market but these tend to be over-designed
and are usually prohibitively expensive. All of which seems odd in the light
of the fact that more and more people are working from home (The Henley
Centre suggests that there are already 300,000 teleworkers and that by 1995,
2.5m people will be working from home). While the computer companies have
moved fast in supplying affordable, powerful computers suitable for home-use
as well as attractive software, the furniture to go with it has lagged
behind.
Vlessing decided there was nothing for it but to get cracking himself. He
approached Oliver Peake, an interior and furniture designer, and together
they set about trying to produce something that was good to look at, large
enough to meet Vlessing's needs and not too expensive. What they came up
with is photographed here - as you see it gets away from the rather boring
square desk with cabinets on either side which are standard office issue. It
has curving lines, good materials and finishes, and an altogether pleasing
look.
Vlessing calls his system 'Desk'. It consists of the desk pictured here and
a satellite filing station, seen here in the far corner of the room.
Included in the price of Pounds 2,500 are all the filing systems and the
drawers but none of the equipment.
The hard disk and printer fit on to sliding shelves and, in this version,
the satellite filing station holds the fax machine. The monitor screen sits
on an extendable arm so that it can be used at eye-level and be moved in and
out of the way.
The basic structure is MDF (medium density fibre, a relatively inexpensive,
stable material much used in the furniture industry) with aluminium
cladding. The filing cabinets and drawers are aluminium clad, brushed and
lacquered and the worktop is a linoleum-like material called Desktop. It is
photographed here in a pale grey finish but Desktop comes in 12 different
colours. A maple trim on the top of the worktop hides the cables and also
functions as a pencil-holder.
The desk top is raised on four steel columns through which the cables run.
The printer and the computer are both on sliding trays in the cabinet, and
are very accessible. Both the desk and the filing station have industrial
trolley wheels so that they can be moved easily. It is available to order
only. Anybody who is interested should contact Oliver Peake on 071-375 0570.
If all that sounds a bit elaborate for you, you could, of course, just
settle for a large table. Ikea stores, for instance (255 North Circular
Road, London NW10 0JQ for mail order inquiries) has the simplest of table
tops (unfinished spruce, pine, birch or a mixture of all three, Pounds 21)
on trestles (Pounds 20 each) which add up to the princely sum of Pounds 61.
A thing of beauty it is not but it is certainly serviceable, straightforward
and entirely unpompous. You could then add a drawer unit on castors for
another Pounds 60 and be done with it.
Another, prettier solution, for technophobes who are still working mainly
with paper and pen and perhaps have just a simple PC and telephone and do
not mind the few cables they have being on show, is Cattelan Italia's Rondo
desk - in walnut or cherry with three little drawers. It would fit into
almost any home but at Pounds 1,383 is a real piece of furniture. It is
stocked by Atrium of 22-24 St Giles High Street, London WC2.
Aram Designs of 3, Kean Street, London WC2 always has a selection of clean
and simple desks. Possibly the most stylish of all the simple solutions is
Alvar Aalto's solid Birch desk with a top veneered in a choice of black
linoleum, white laminate, ash or birch. With it comes a pedestal storage
cabinet with five, three or two drawers. It costs Pounds 787.
Or there is Jasper Morrison's plain- as-plain blond wood table which sells
for just Pounds 600 and Marcel Breuer's elegantly clean-lined solution, a
combination of a black-ash-stained desk top with a crisp five-drawered
cabinet attached to the side for Pounds 1,322.
But if simplicity does not solve your problem - if you want the cables
attached to the technology neatly and properly housed, then the prices go
whizzing up.
Interlubke, the German office furniture manufacturer has a range designed
for the home - a bit 'executive' for my tastes, it nonetheless is
functional, beautifully-made (the top is of Swiss pearwood), keeps all the
cabling out of sight and offers a drawer or a plinth for every device you
could possibly need. It is a modular system, so you choose the bits you
require. A good-sized desk, some cabinets for storage and what is called in
the jargon of the office furniture world a 'return', would set you back at
least Pounds 3,500, if not more. The range can be seen at Atrium.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Advice was nonsense
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I own my house in Bristol. There is no outstanding mortgage. I have two
years to go before I retire and it had been my intention at the end of that
time to sell up and move down to Devon. A friend has offered to sell me his
flat there at a good discount to the market price.
It has been suggested, however, that if I do buy the flat but continue to
live in my present house for more than six months, I will, when I do sell
up, be faced with a CGT bill on the full difference between the original
price and the final sale price.
What you have been told is nonsense. Ask your tax office for the free
leaflet for owner-occupiers, CGT4. While this leaflet tends to over-simplify
the arbitrary rules laid down by parliament, it is a useful starting point
for talks with the solicitor who will (presumably) be acting for you in the
purchase of your friend's flat.
As a solicitor will be able to explain (provided that you choose a
reasonably competent firm), it should be possible - by means of judiciously
timed main-residence notices under section 222(5)(a) of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992 - to escape CGT, not only upon the sale of your
present home but also upon any eventual sale of the flat.
NatWest Registrars was employed to administer the Northern Ireland
Electricity 1993 share offer by the Department of Economic Development,
Belfast, and not by the company, as we stated last week.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Extra CGT liability
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have a unit trust-linked life endowment policy and, thus far, have
received yearly statements. These show the units held on the policy and the
capital gains liability of the insurer, which would be deducted at maturity.
I now have a statement showing that this tax has had to be paid and has been
met by selling units. Also, I am told that, in future, capital gains will
have to be paid yearly by sale of units but that no relief is available for
carrying forward in bad years.
As a consequence, it could be preferable to have the units transferred to my
own name, as I might be better off by utilising my own capital gains annual
tax allowance.
I can do this; the policy has matured and I have extended the term but I can
surrender at any time. Is there any personal tax liability on surrender,
though?
Presumably, the unit trust managers have to pay tax on their trading and
this would be the same whoever holds the units, whether managers or the
private owner. Thus, it is not clear to me why there is the additional
capital gains liability on my yearly statement. Could you explain this?
The way in which the surrender value of the policy is calculated depends
upon how much discretion the insurance company has given itself in the terms
of (1) the policy itself and (2) the extension - if that was not provided
for in the original policy document.
You should read the small print carefully and decide (i) if you think the
company's calculations comply, in principle at least, with the terms set out
in the small print and, if so, (ii) you consider that the salesman or the
company's staff, or both, failed to make the potential cuts in the
surrender/maturity value clear enough to you when first you were thinking of
(a) taking out the policy and (b) extending it.
Because of the Financial Services Act 1986, we cannot give investment
advice. Consequently we cannot say if you should surrender the policy; nor
whether, if you do decide to surrender it, you should take the surrender
value in cash or by the transfer of units from the insurance company's
portfolio.
We take it, from the limited data, that it is a qualifying life policy. That
being so, there should be no income tax liability upon its surrender. This
is something which you should check with the company, since only it knows
the full background facts and figures.
Finally, perhaps we should say that you seem to be confusing corporation tax
(on chargeable gains) with capital gains tax. The words 'capital gains' in
your letter should read 'corporation tax'.
If you do decide to surrender the policy, and to take the surrender value by
the transfer of units from the company's portfolio, then you would face a
capital gains liability only if you sold some or all of the units in a year
in which your total chargeable gains exceeded the exempt amount (Pounds
5,800 for 1994-95), after taking into account indexation relief and any
allowable losses.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My wife is a market research supervisor and uses one room of our flat wholly
for work purposes. When completing her 1994/95 tax return, I claimed
one-third of the council tax as an expense against her 1993/94 research
earnings. But the inspector will not allow the claim and says a deduction
can be made only for heating the room.
Similarly, he will not allow any expenses against telephone rental despite
the fact that much of her time is spent ringing people. (The cost of the
calls is paid by her employer). Is the inspector correct?
The inspector appears to be right on the second point but might be wrong on
the first one. We cannot say more than this on the basis of the limited data
you have given us.
Your wife should ask the inspector how he reconciles the proposed
disallowance of the proportionate council tax with paragraph 9 of the
Revenue press release of March 16 1993 entitled 'Council tax - income tax
and corporation tax implications.' This covers employees who are required to
work at home, and says:
'The duties of an employment may require an employee to work at home in
circumstances in which a deduction may be claimed for a proportion of
domestic expenses such as lighting, heating and cleaning. In such cases, a
room may be used exclusively for work purposes. In these cases, employees
may be due a deduction against their income for a proportion of the council
tax.'

FT  27 AUG 94 / As They Say in Europe: Singing those old Danube blues -
James Morgan on an outbreak of imperial nostalgia in Austria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just as Europe has been in a state of flux in the last five years, so has
Europe's attitude towards itself. The present influences the past, old myths
retire and entirely new myths rise to take their place.
The myth that has taken the biggest battering is familiar to students of
modern history: that of plucky little Serbia striving for national
independence and providing the heartland of South Slav unity. In 1914 Serbia
took on the Austro-Hungarian empire which replied in such a manner as to
unleash the first world war on an unsuspecting Europe.
The events of the past couple of years have led to a steady rewriting of
that version of history. This is not the result of a plot on the part of
revisionists. Instead, huge numbers of people, informed and ignorant, assume
that what is apparently so obvious today was always true: the Serbs are
motivated by insane great-power ambitions which they periodically visit on
their luckless neighbours.
One sees old film footage of June 1914 reinterpreted as the innocent
Archduke Franz-Ferdinand goes to the doom so irresponsibly plotted by
Serbian terrorists. Sarajevo, then as now, becomes the site of Serb
savagery, or stupidity. New books tell us of the glory that was once Bosnia,
not an administrative convenience as the three people who had heard of the
place had supposed, but a true nation of cheery peasants of different faiths
and unbounded freedom, a Balkan beacon in fact.
This new European history has been seized on by the Austrian press. For
months now there has been a wave of interest in the history of Bosnia which
enjoyed 40 years of benign rule from Vienna from 1878.
Newspapers publish conversations with those who remember the good old days,
and the demands of those too young to remember but who would gladly return
Bosnia to a resuscitated empire. It is a bit like the tales of India one
used to read in the British press recounting the natives' supposed nostalgia
for imperial rule, but carries greater force.
Thus the other day the Kronen Zeitung, a Vienna tabloid, ran the headline,
'How Bosnia was once part of Austria]' It concerned an exhibition at the
Ethnographic Museum in Schloss Kittsee on the Hungarian border. Bosnian
history is now integrated into the Austrian concept 'our glorious past'. The
paper publicised the occasion as a last chance to see its culture before it
disappears.
The day before, the main broadsheet, Die Presse, reported on another
exhibition that has run this month in the National Library in Vienna. It is
in fact a reproduction of what was supposed to be a permanent war exhibition
which opened in August 1915. The idea at that time was to provide both a
running commentary on the war and a focus for patriotism and enthusiasm.
Today's version consists of ephemera - battlefield postcards, children's
drawings, posters and propaganda. Of particular interest, and some pride, to
the reporter was the evidence of native ingenuity in the way everything was
pressed into service for the manufacture of ersatz materials: fruit stones
for oil extraction and women's hair for making belts.
The Great War is becoming one of those rather neutral historical events, not
as meaningless as the War of Spanish Succession to the modern student but a
bit like the Crimean War is to the British.
I have lived in Vienna on two occasions, many years apart, and in neither of
those periods was it done for the media to make too much of Austria's
glorious colonial past or the achievements of its peoples in the Great War.
Nostalgia is the lifeblood of the city but it has concentrated, publicly, on
imperial-and-royal pomp and, privately, on the Third Reich ('We could go all
the way to Bratislava on one tram without any border controls.')
Today the empire itself is often perceived as a model for the troubled
south-eastern corner of Europe. But history is not about to repeat itself.
In spite of the integration that is taking place - Austria is the largest
foreign investor in Hungary (Dollars 4bn in 1992) - Vienna's eyes are firmly
fixed on the west. That is a result of the cold war and the Euro-frenzy in
the wake of the positive referendum result. Meanwhile, the nation is fed up
with its one-time colonies and does not much care for their peoples.
Last week there was a meeting in Austria of governments which will join the
EU in January and those of the central European candidates. The European
Commission was there and the emphasis was on the opening to the East. Die
Presse doubted that Austria was really going to play its expected role of
intermediary on behalf of its eastern neighbours. It will not be an easy
role.
The four main parties are at odds with each other, as usual. 'Poles, Czechs,
Slovaks and Hungarians no longer speak with one tongue . . . so the
turn-of-the-century deadline for widening the EU is unrealistic,' it wrote.
Nostalgia is all very well, but if there is to be a resurrection of the
Empire, it will be without Austria.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Minding Your Own Business: A smarter breed of scarecrow -
Clive Fewins is told that only three things matter in business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

It was a chance sighting of a fallen beech leaf moving in the wind that gave
Charles Tweedie the final thrust to produce what he calls the only range of
hardy all-weather scarecrows for commercial use available in this country.
He had been racking his brains on how to develop a silent bird scarer to
complement his range of range of noisy electronic bird deterrents.
'The electronic devices are all excellent deterrents, but I felt there was
potential in the bird scaring market, to compete with the noisy, and rather
unsatisfactory gas guns,' said Tweedie, managing director of Phoenix
Agritech of Little Hereford, Ludlow, Shropshire.
The results were Whirly Ozidge, Spinny Mawkin and Major Twirly Tatty-Bogle,
three 6ft 4in-high creations of strong pvc sheet stretched over a
lightweight aluminium and steel frame.
They have attracted a great deal of attention in the agricultural community
since their public debut at the Royal Show in July, but so far have earned
their creator very little money.
It is the constant movement - like a fallen leaf - that distinguishes
Tweedie's rather clinical-looking scarecrows from the army of disreputable
rogues that have become a rare sight in fields in recent years.
'Farmers have traditionally thought that gas guns - timed devices that look
like small cannon - would do the job, but my research suggests these devices
are ineffective after a few days because the birds grow accustomed to them,'
Tweedie said.
'Because my scarecrows are mounted on swivel bearings and the metal skeleton
has an aerofoil shape, they move in the slightest wind.
'The real breakthrough will be when we can convince the farmer that a return
to the good old-fashioned scarecrow will add to his anti-bird armoury.'
The Phoenix family of three wind-powered revolving scarecrows is also aimed
at fruit growers, fish farmers, vineyards, golf course proprietors, shoots,
and other sporting applications.
It is also possible to have a fourth 'fun' member of the family - a
personalised version with a photo of a face of the purchaser's choice
superimposed. All the models are predominantly white because it is
acknowledged as being the best colour for the job.
Phoenix Agritech started trading in August 1992 and also produces the
Phoenix Maxi-Wailer, which is battery powered and cheaper to run than gas
bangers, with the option of eight speakers which can function up to 100
yards away.
'At the beginning of the year, I thought the time had come to broaden my
product range,' said Tweedie.
Phoenix is so named because it rose from the ashes of a small Welsh
borderlands electronics company producing automatic calf-feeding machines
and pest control equipment.
Tweedie acquired a controlling interest in the company in 1986 after
spending two years trying to decide on his future following redundancy as
managing director of a large poultry subsidiary of the Vestey group.
'I had been with the Vestey group for 14 years and had controlled a company
with a Pounds 60m turnover, two factories and 1,150 employees,' said
Tweedie, 50, a former soldier and diplomat. 'When the end came in 1987 my
salary was just under Pounds 50,000 and included a string of company
benefits. In the following two years I earned Pounds 6,000 through
consultancy. It was a painful adjustment.'
Several opportunities passed by until eventually, in May 1989, with the
agreement of his wife Susie and three teenage children, Tweedie sank Pounds
30,000 of his redundancy money into the electronics company.
The venture failed - but not before Tweedie had invested further
'substantial sums' in the venture. 'I realised I had made the mistake of
investing in a company that had too much debt in its balance sheet,' he
said.
A further venture into a software company that failed lost him more money.
He estimates that his losses in the two companies totalled more than Pounds
100,000.
'At that stage I was at my lowest, but I still had funds,' he said. The
family had moved from a home in Derbyshire to a hamlet near Ludlow, an area
which they all loved. So despite the failure of the agricultural electronics
company in which he had staked so much, Tweedie decided not to move.
He had space in the stables at the back of the large Victorian brick house,
and good local contacts. He also had a wealth of financial and management
expertise and a good knowledge of agricultural pest control equipment.
He managed to find a company 15 miles away that could assemble the
electronics in what became the Phoenix Wailer bird deterrent, and with a
little more difficulty was able to get the heavy duty waterproof housings
for the product made in Italy.
Two other versions of the Wailer and the Phoenix 'ratsonic rodent deterrent'
were added to the product list. The Phoenix range now numbers 129 products
including accessories, and with the exception of the plastic housings all
the items are manufactured by seven companies within a 30-mile radius of
Tweedie's home.
Controlling his empire takes 60 hours a week but after years of turmoil
Tweedie finds himself happy and satisfied - particularly when driving the
three miles to the river Teme for an evening's fishing.
'Turnover in the first year was Pounds 59,000, and we are running at about
Pounds 75,000 in our second year. Profits are virtually nil but we are
surviving,' he said. 'We have made sales to Japan, Belgium, the Netherlands,
the Middle East, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa and Ireland. Our gross
margins are very healthy, and with our low overheads I am sure we can make
very good profits.'
The next task is to clear a Pounds 5,500 overdraft and achieve sales growth.
Tweedie continued: 'There are 40,000 arable farmers and 10,000
horticulturists in the UK and if they all were to buy three of our
scarecrows at Pounds 99 each plus VAT that would be excellent business.
'The strange thing is that if I was running a big business again the way I
am running Phoenix I should be making a fortune for my employers. It is only
since working for myself that I have realised that there are only three
things that really matter in business: margins, overheads and cash flow. I
honestly did not see that when running a multi-million pound company.'

Option guarantees
Shaun Coleman, derivatives specialist at Morgan Grenfell, gives the
following example (which does not include charges).
Options essentially give you the opportunity to look back and say 'If I had
only known . . .' In the case of a simple five-year equity bond, someone
investing Pounds 100 could be offered back a guaranteed Pounds 125 or the
rise in the index, if greater.
To achieve this, the manager buys a call option on the FT-SE 100 index worth
16 per cent of the investment (ie, Pounds 16). This gives the manager the
right to buy Pounds 100 worth of equity market increase over 25 per cent in
five years' time.
The remaining Pounds 84 is invested in a five-year deposit at 8.5 per cent
and, after five years, is worth Pounds 125. If the market falls, you get the
Pounds 125 and the call option is worthless. If the market rises, say 27 per
cent, you get the Pounds 125 from the deposit plus the excess in the rise
over 25 per cent - ie, 2 per cent - providing a total of Pounds 127 at
maturity.
Most guaranteed pension funds also offer the chance to lock in to gains at
regular intervals. Quarterly lock-ins usually are more flexible but more
expensive than the annual version.
With-profits
Traditional with-profits funds invest in UK and international equities,
gilts and fixed-interest securities, plus property. In addition to a
guaranteed sum at maturity, the life office adds annual bonuses that also
are guaranteed. These bonuses are 'smoothed' - that is, the actuary retains
some profits in good years to maintain a fairly consistent return in bad
years.
On top of this there is a final bonus, which is discretionary and tends to
reflect recent performance. This used to represent about 30 per cent of
final payout but today it represents between 50 and 70 per cent, so the
guaranteed element has been slashed. The main charges are not explicit but
are deducted from the fund before the bonus rate is declared.
Unitised with-profits have almost entirely replaced traditional
with-profits. With these, there is no sum guaranteed at maturity and annual
bonuses are applied by increases to the unit price or the number of units.
Some, but not all, providers guarantee a minimum increase, usually of 4 per
cent. There is also a terminal bonus which is determined by the fund
actuary.
Charges are more explicit than on the traditional version and include a
bid/offer spread, an annual charge, and a capital levy - an extra charge
made in the early years to recoup the cost of commission paid to advisers.
Equity-linked funds
If you want exposure to the stock market and do not need the guarantee, then
there are two main pooled fund choices. In each case, the value of your
units fluctuates in line with the underlying assets.
Unit-linked personal pensions are available from more than 100 life offices,
which offer a wide range of UK and international equity funds. The most
popular choice is the managed fund, which invests in a range of the
provider's other main funds. Charges include a bid/offer spread, an annual
management charge, administration fees and the capital.
Unit trust personal pensions offer a similar range of funds to unit-linked
plans but are available from only a handful of unit trust groups; these
include Gartmore, Invesco Fund Managers and Rothschild Asset Management.
Charges are transparent and do not include the capital levy used by life
offices.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: BT tempts customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecom is offering customers a new discount service. 'With 15 per
cent off, our best customers now make the biggest savings' is the headline
on a BT letter mailed out with the booklet 'Introducing BT PremierLine'.
But, as the detailed conditions explain, the 15 per cent discount does not
come off the bottom line of the telephone bill. It reduces the basic unit
rate for local, long-distance and international calls dialled direct. For
calls to mobiles and information or entertainment lines, the discount is 10
per cent.
PremierLine costs Pounds 24 a year, which has to be paid in advance and also
covers various minor extras such as 'talking points', with each Pounds 1 of
the (ex-VAT) telephone bill gaining points towards gifts or air miles. All
PremierLine customers start with 500 free talking points, so they could be
reasonably sure of securing the minimum gift of a weed-grubber worth 510
points.
PremierLine is not the only BT discount scheme. There is also Option 15,
offering a 10 per cent discount for a Pounds 16 annual fee, paid quarterly.
A friends and family scheme gives 5 per cent discount on calls to five
selected numbers (one can be overseas) for a one-off fee of Pounds 4.99.
Combined with Option 15 or PremierLine, this can raise the discount on the
chosen numbers to 15 per cent or 20 per cent.
Are the discounts worth it? A quick look at your last telephone bill will
supply most of the answers. BT bills show a total for direct-dialled calls
at the basic rate. If this is consistently at least Pounds 40 for the
quarter, you could be close to break-even point for both Option 15 and
PremierLine.
Obviously, a 10 per cent discount on Pounds 40 covers the Pounds 4 quartely
fee for Option 15. And a 15 per cent discount on basic-rate call charges of
Pounds 160 for the year meets the Pounds 24 PremierLine fee. But the
break-even point will be higher for people making frequent calls to mobile
'phones or other lines where the discount is lower.
BT's automatic discounts begin once call charges exceed roughly Pounds 50 at
the basic 4.2p per unit rate. The exact amount varies, depending on the
number of days in the quarter.
The next Pounds 200 worth are at 3.99p (5 per cent off), and units past
Pounds 250 are at 3.86p (8 per cent off). So, the range of discounts passed
up by people joining PremierLine is from zero on Pounds 50 to an average of
around 6 per cent on Pounds 500 worth of calls.
To get a rough idea of the real saving likely with PremierLine, knock 15 per
cent off the last bill's quarterly total of direct-dialled calls at basic
rate, add line rental (Pounds 20.16) and VAT. Then add Pounds 6 for a
quarter of the Pounds 24 fee and compare the result with the final total
from the last bill.
As the table shows, real savings are likely to be about half the 15 per cent
publicised rate.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Cashback - the Revenue replies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are choosing between different types of mortgage incentives, one
significant tax question remains unresolved.
Lenders have been encouraging borrowers to take variable rate mortgages by
offering a lump sum cash payment or a discounted rate for a limited period.
In general, the discounted rate tends to offer better value - but the costs
of moving house are such that many people choose the cash.
The problem is that the Inland Revenue has not said clearly if these cash
payments are taxable.
Only in the case of the Cheltenham and Gloucester's Cashgift scheme -
details of which were submitted by the society - has the Revenue said tax
would be payable as a capital gain if borrowers had used up their annual
Pounds 5,800 CGT exemption.
Now, however, the Revenue has agreed to answer questions from the Weekend
FT.
Q. What is the logic behind taxing the C&amp;G cashback as capital gain? Some
accountants believe the cashback payment should be treated as a reduction in
the borrower's total interest paid for the tax year, and their mortgage
relief reduced accordingly.
A. Under the C&amp;G scheme, borrowers who took out new mortgages on or before
July 31 1994 (and have personal deposits with the society) were entitled to
receive in cash a certain percentage of the amount borrowed from the
society. This is clearly a contractual arrangement between C&amp;G and the
borrower. The receipt is a capital sum derived from the contractual right.
It is, therefore, chargeable under Section 22 (1) of the Capital Gains Act
1992.
If the cashback were a rebate of interest, the borrower's entitlement to
mortgage interest relief would be reduced accordingly, and it would be up to
the lender to operate the Miras arrangements on the reduced amount of
interest. But we are not aware of such schemes. Q. Other accountants say
that since the C&amp;G cashback is conditional - the borrower would have to
repay it if they redeem the mortgage within three years - it cannot be
treated as a gain until the three years are up instead of the year in which
it was taken. What is your view?
A. The cashback is treated as a capital receipt chargeable to CGT in the
year it is received. If, in the event, it was repaid, we would look at this
in the context of Section 49 TCGA (contingent liabilities) and whether the
borrower would then be entitled to make a claim under sub-section (2) to
have any assessment reduced.
Q. Must lenders show you details of their scheme before you can make a
decision? Surely the principles are similar with all cashbacks? A. Although
the principles may be similar, it is unlikely that any of the schemes will
be quite the same. A proper opinion cannot be provided without examining the
relevant documentation.
Q. Presumably if a borrower showed you details of a cashback before taking
out it out, you would be able to give him a clear answer regarding its tax
treatment?
A. Unless the borrower had already signed up, we would only be able to
advise on schemes we had considered. But the lender could submit the scheme
for consideration.
Q. Is there a difference in the tax treatment of a repayment mortgage rather
than an endowment one?
A. It is unlikely that the type of mortgage involved will make a difference.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Cutting the risks when you take out
a pension - Debbie Harrison examines ways to make it less of a gamble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do you know what risks you are taking with your personal pension
investments? Probably not, because life offices do not explain fully the
risks associated with their products and some of the guarantees offered are
anything but rock solid.
If you intend to make substantial contributions to your individual pension
plan, it is possible to control the level of risk by running your own
portfolio or appointing a stockbroker to do this for you. Self-invested
personal pensions (SIPPs) - and, for small businesses, small
self-administered schemes (SASSs) - provide this flexibility.
Where you do not have a substantial pension portfolio and expect to
contribute less than Pounds 10,000 a year, however, the fixed costs of a
SIPP are prohibitive and you should go for a standard personal pension.
Most providers offer a range of pooled funds that span the risk spectrum,
starting with the full guarantee offered by deposit funds; working up
through the quasi-guarantees offered by with-profit funds; and culminating
with the higher risk unit-linked, unit trust and investment trust funds.
While the investment risks associated with the top and bottom ends of the
spectrum can be understood readily (even if the charges are not), there is
considerable confusion about the middle ground - the funds that offer a
partial guarantee at a price.
Conventional wisdom argues that these funds are suitable for the more
nervous investor and for those approaching retirement. With-profits funds,
and the unitised version, still form the backbone of the individual pensions
market due to the apparently high level of stability offered through the
build-up of guaranteed annual bonuses.
Over the past decade, though, these products have mutated into a far riskier
vehicle than many realise. A series of changes to the traditional
with-profits concept has undermined the guarantee and, in most cases,
between 50 per cent and 70 per cent of the final pay-out is discretionary.
Unitised with-profits do not even offer a basic guaranteed sum assured,
while the fund actuary retains the right to renege on the guaranteed annual
bonuses if there is a run on funds during a stock market crash.
Add to this the spate of bonus cuts experienced over the past few years  -
which is expected to continue - and there must be a serious question mark
over the ability of all but the best of these funds to perform.
Now, there is an alternative: guaranteed equity funds, which use derivatives
to guarantee a percentage of stock market growth or to guarantee the unit
value of fully-invested funds.
Derivatives have been used for some years by institutional pension funds but
are relatively new to the retail market, with only a dozen or so providers
offering guaranteed funds. Most funds so far are index trackers, where part
of your investment is used to buy a call option to secure a percentage in
the index rise while the rest is put on deposit to provide a guaranteed
return.
A few providers, including Mercury Life and Provident Mutual, run
actively-managed funds. The choice between index tracker and active
management depends on which you think will perform best over the guarantee
period.
Several providers, including Manor Park and Provident Life, offer a choice
of guarantee levels. Provident also offers a choice of index links,
including the FT-SE Mid-250 and the more common FT-SE 100. But investors
interested in guaranteed funds will find the selection confusing. Each fund
offers different guarantees at different costs, so it is difficult to
compare like with like.
Sceptics argue that derivative-based funds are so complex that few
independent financial advisers really understand them.
Shaun Coleman, derivatives specialist at Morgan Grenfell, disagrees. 'A good
IFA should be capable of breaking these products down, identifying the
component parts and working out how much they cost in the market,' he says.
Essentially, there are two key elements to consider. First: what level of
performance or what percentage of the index is actually guaranteed? Second:
what is the cost?
To provide the guarantee, an investment manager usually buys a call option
or, more rarely, might use futures to hedge the portfolio. The cost of these
derivatives is added to the total charges.
Regarding performance, it is important to look at both capital growth and
dividend yield. A common problem with some of the index tracker funds is
that they guarantee the capital growth but use the substantial dividend
yields to buy the option.
Actively-managed funds re-invest the dividend yield and should, in theory,
provide a better return assuming that the manager outperforms the index. The
cost here is likely to be between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent a year on top
of the usual annual charges.
If you need to retain access to your money, you should examine the penalties
for early surrender. Some funds lock in gains each quarter, which provides
greater flexibility than the one year lock-ins. But the call option
guarantee price is more expensive - and you must pay for this flexibility.
So, who should use these funds? Andrew Warwick-Thompson, head of partnership
pensions at actuarial consultants Bacon &amp; Woodrow, says: 'Guaranteed
products should be used only in the run-up to retirement to lock in to gains
and to protect against price volatility. Until then, ordinary equity funds
offer a better return because you are not paying for the guarantee.'
Warwick-Thompson is convinced that, in this capacity, guaranteed funds are
better than with-profits. 'Guaranteed funds offer protection at a price, but
at least you know exactly what you are getting and how much it costs. The
returns on with-profits funds are almost entirely at the discretion of the
actuary.' With-profits charges also tend to be obscure, particularly on
traditional contracts.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: A mind of their own - The
Professionals / Credit Suisse / Last in a series by Joanna Slaughter on fund
managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Suisse Asset Management is the London-based investment management arm
of the mighty Swiss bank. Nicolas Bowater, head of the private client
division, says: 'The Swiss parentage brings to us an enormous amount of
resources that are not available to others.
'You are talking about an institution with a huge amount of assets under
management. It is the second biggest in Europe.'
Senior executives draw upon the information and forecasts supplied by 20 UK
investment houses and many overseas brokers at CSAM's monthly investment
strategy meetings. The global network of 500 Credit Suisse offices also act
as intelligence centres on their behalf.
'We believe that asset allocation is a large part of the success in the
management of the portfolios of private clients,' says Bowater.
'A private client strategist sits on the asset allocation committee, and the
committee's views are disseminated to the portfolio managers very rapidly.
Managers will then look at these recommendations and see if they are
acceptable from the individual client's viewpoint.'
Credit Suisse acquired a controlling interest in stockbroker Buckmaster &amp;
Moore in 1986, and the firm was re-born as CSAM five years later. But
suspicions that the Swiss influence would result in private client
portfolios being weighted heavily towards international bonds proved
unfounded.
More than half the 16 private client fund managers have been with the firm
since Buckmaster days, and Bowater stresses: 'We are not a branch of Credit
Suisse and we don't have an investment method imposed on us to which we must
work. We are totally autonomous.
'Outside Switzerland and Germany, there is much more of a penchant for
equities, and head office appreciates the way clients in different centres
want to have their money managed.'
The recommended asset allocation for a private client growth equity
portfolio is: UK, 58 per cent; Japan, 6 per cent; North America, 7 per cent;
Europe, 11 per cent; Asia, 10 per cent; index-linked gilts, 2 per cent; and
sterling cash, 6 per cent.
Bowater explains: 'Our present macro view is that the world is moving into a
period of global growth, and that this is going to be a period that favours
an investment in equities.
'We have been running down our bond exposure and increasing our equity
exposure, and we have also been moving a little bit into overseas markets.'
Indeed, CSAM held a zero position in Japan at the start of the year.
Nearly 90 per cent of private clients have their portfolios managed on a
discretionary basis, and Bowater places great emphasis on establishing
strong personal relationships with them. All the firm's fund managers travel
the country in order to service clients.
There is no fixed rule about the amount of money a private client needs to
secure the firm's services, but Bowater suggests Pounds 100,000 probably is
the minimum sum acceptable for a portfolio of equities, on grounds of both
risk and cost. 'It depends on a client's risk tolerance,' he says. 'With
Pounds 100,000, he could have 15 to 20 stocks and diversify away 90 per cent
of the risk.'
The fund managers work to a preferred list of stocks but the house approach
does not appear to be doctrinaire. Bowater says: 'We seek to be expert in a
manageable number of stocks but, clearly, if a client asks us to buy
something, we do so. In the main, we stick to the high capitalisation
stocks.'
Within asset classes, the firm favours active management. 'One would expect
to see a portfolio turn over in four to five years,' says Bowater. 'What we
try to do is to identify situations that are under-valued and hold them for
the long term.'
There is considerable expertise within the group in using derivatives.
Bowater believes it is logical to use these investment techniques on a
private client portfolio for 'insurance' purposes. Clients also can benefit
from access to the group's other resources.
Bowater argues: 'The range of services we can provide through our sister
companies is a genuinely full list of private banking services.' Where
expertise is not on tap - for instance, managing investments in agricultural
land - the firm acts as an homme d'affaires on a client's behalf.
Bowater describes the CSAM name as 'marvellous. It tells people who owns us;
where they come from; and what we do'. But he concedes that, in Britain at
least, it is a name synonymous with big corporate deals rather than private
wealth management.
'I think the growth in private clients will come from satisfied clients, the
intermediaries and our marketing techniques,' he adds. 'And, as the name
becomes better known, I believe we will start to benefit from that pool of
non-UK domiciliaries who use London as a centre of excellence.'

FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Woolwich cuts rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BAYLISS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Woolwich building society this week became the latest to make overdraft rate
cuts, although it had already reduced them in July to 0.78 per cent a month.
The trend was started by Halifax two months ago and has been followed by
most societies.
Not only has Woolwich now lowered its rates to 0.76 per cent, matching the
lowest available (from the Alliance &amp; Leicester), but it has raised credit
interest rates to the same as those it pays on its ordinary instant access
account, Prime Gold.
Interest is tiered and pays 1.15 per cent from Pounds 1, 3.50 per cent from
Pounds 500, 4.5 per cent from Pounds 10,000, 5 per cent from Pounds 25,000
and 5.1 per cent from Pounds 50,000. With no monthly or arrangement fee for
overdrafts, this makes the Woolwich current account the market's leading
cheque account for everyday use.
On the downside, selected tiers of Woolwich's Premier 90 and Prime have been
reduced, and its Tessa also is reduced by 0.1 per cent on the lowest tier
and 0.25 per cent from Pounds 6,000.
The fixed-rate market remains volatile. Five-year flat fixed rates from the
societies have continued to be withdrawn and the only one left is the
fixed-rate bond from Britannia, offering 8.25 per cent from Pounds 2,000.
Newcastle this week launched a competitive bond, maturing on September 30
1998. It pays 8.5 per cent from Pounds 2,000 with a monthly option
available, paying 8.25 per cent from Pounds 5,000.
Five-year escalator bonds remain popular. The best now available is from
West Bromwich. A minimum investment of Pounds 1,000 pays 7.5 per cent in the
first year, rising to 11.5 per cent in the fifth.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: How employers can trim NI bills -
David Cohen looks at benefit loopholes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's latest attempt to block avoidance of National Insurance
contributions (NICs) was announced this week by Peter Lilley, the social
security secretary, who said that these will be levied on payments to staff
in the form of diamonds and fine wines.
But even if this really is the final bell for artificial avoidance schemes -
and, until now, whenever one loophole has been closed, another has been
discovered swiftly - there are still several straightforward steps which
employers can take to mitigate their liabilities.
Both staff and employers must pay NICs. In each case, contributions are a
percentage of earnings - up to 10 per cent for employees and 10.2 per cent
for employers.
The key difference, however, is that while there is an upper salary limit
(now Pounds 430 a week) above which no further employee contributions are
due, there is no limit at all for employers. Hence, a director receiving,
say, Pounds 100,000 a year would have to pay only around Pounds 2,000
personally - but the company would have to find Pounds 10,000.
There was an upper limit for employers until 1985, and it was the abolition
of that which transformed NICs from a minor irritant to a major corporate
expense. Responding to demand from clients with bevies of high earners, tax
advisers blew the dust off their copies of the NIC legislation and found
themselves in a loophole-seeker's paradise.
The weakness of the NIC framework is that, generally, it catches only salary
and not perks. The recurring theme of the many techniques deployed by
NIC-dodgers over the past nine years was that the employee got a non-cash
benefit that could be converted, almost immediately, into cash.
Gilt-edged stock, equities, unit trusts, gold bullion and, finally,
expensive wines and gemstones were exploited by the avoiders before, in
turn, being outlawed by the authorities. The enduring mystery is why the
government did not simply extend the definition of 'earnings' for NIC
purposes to include non-cash benefits; this has been the case with income
tax for several decades. Sooner or later it will, presumably, do the
rational thing.
So long as benefits remain outside the net, companies continue to have
plenty of opportunity to provide them to staff. Larger companies presumably
will confine themselves to standard items such as pensions, medical
insurance and cheap loans, but smaller ones might also think of such perks
as holidays or suites of furniture. These are lawful provided the order is
placed by the employer and the employee cannot opt for cash in lieu.
Even more significant savings may be available for the substantial number of
private companies run by owner-managers. Instead of paying themselves extra
salary, they can extract money NIC-free in the form of dividends. And if
payments are not precisely proportional to shareholdings, the problem can be
overcome by dividend sacrifices, or 'waivers'.
(Say that A and B each owns 50 of the 100 shares in X Ltd but they have
agreed that A should get twice as large a year-end bonus as B. The money can
all be paid as a dividend provided B waives his entitlement in respect of 25
of his shares).
A decision to pay dividends rather than salary, however, should never be
taken on NIC grounds alone. The downside of a switch to the dividend route
is that it will reduce pensionable earnings and land the company with an
advance corporation tax bill. It might also increase the value used by the
Inland Revenue to assess inheritance tax liability on any future gift or
bequest of shares.
Neither furniture suites nor extra dividends will be a practical proposition
for public companies with substantial work forces. They, however, may be
able to take advantage of a small chink left open when the equities loophole
was closed in 1991.
Payment to an employee in the form of shares is still outside the NIC net if
the shares are those of the employee's company or its parent. Although
designed to benefit genuine long-term employee share schemes, the exemption
would apply equally to a one-off share transfer followed by an immediate
sale.
While this is a blissfully simple solution from an NIC perspective, it is
fraught with legal complexities. Issues to be considered include whether the
transaction requires shareholder approval; the timing of the sale (so as not
to infringe the insider dealing rules); and the tax deductibility of the
costs incurred by the company.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Why cost is everything
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It might be galling for an investor with only a couple of thousand pounds to
be told: 'Options are not for you.' But this has nothing to do with the
level of experience and everything to do with cost, which falls
significantly after a certain level.
Many brokers will charge 2 per cent commission (compared with 1.65 per cent
for equities) and a minimum of between Pounds 30 to Pounds 50 for each
investment, however small.
Thus, it could be uneconomic to buy less than Pounds 2,500 worth of options.
Many derivative specialists argue that options should not represent more
than 10 per cent of a portfolio.
Even ShareLink, the cut-price Birmingham-based broker which claims to carry
out around a quarter of all private investor dealing, charges a minimum of
Pounds 33.50 for the whole process from purchase to sale.
Every point move in FT-SE index options represents Pounds 10; so, if an
investor bought one contract, the option price would have to rise by 3.5
points just to cover the dealing costs.
In addition to the commission, the spreads - the difference between the
price at which a broker is prepared to buy and sell - often are high
relative to equities. The spread on Glaxo October 500 calls was recently 62
1/2 p bid and 68 1/2 p offered, or 10 per cent. The spread on the underlying
shares is around 2 per cent.
The other side of the argument is that if you can afford to lose the money,
options are one of the few ways to get gearing with limited risk. The costs
may be higher - but the potential gains and losses are greater, too.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Protect yourself against market
losses - Peter John recommends options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If a Pounds 100,000 windfall had arrived last Christmas and you had invested
it in a broad range of blue chip UK shares traded on the FT-SE 100 index, it
would have lost around Pounds 15,000 of its value just three months later.
There is a way of insuring against all or part of such losses by 'hedging'
through traded options. These are financial instruments carrying the right,
but not the obligation, to buy or sell shares at a fixed price during a
fixed period.
There are two types of option. A 'call' option gives you the right to buy
shares, and is useful as a speculative tool. A 'put' option gives you the
right to sell shares, and is often used to protect a portfolio.
If, for example, you bought 1,000 Glaxo shares in March, you could have paid
Pounds 7,000 - or 700p a share. At the same time, you could have bought an
October 650 put option - the right to sell 1,000 Glaxo shares at 650p
between March and October, thus setting a floor on potential losses. The
premium for the put option would have been 42p a share, or Pounds 420 in
total for a contract covering 1,000. This is, effectively, 42p of insurance
for every 700p share from March to October, and equates to an insurance
premium of around 10 per cent for the year.
This might seem expensive: very few people would spend Pounds 20,000 a year
protecting a Pounds 200,000 house. But it largely depends on the inherent
risk, which is reflected by the volatility in the market. In this case, the
caution would have paid off.
By the end of June, Glaxo's underlying share price stood at just over 550p.
The options could have been 'exercised' and shares sold for 650p. After
deducting the 42p a share option price, the options limited the maximum loss
to 92p a share - rather than 150p - allowing you, in effect, to sell at
608p.
The main difference between options and conventional insurance, however, is
that an option can also be sold on at a profit.
An option's price is made up of two elements. First, 'time value' is
calculated from the length of time left before the option expires, and how
volatile the share price has been. Second, there is 'intrinsic value' - the
difference between the option's exercise price and the underlying share
price. A put option has intrinsic value if its exercise price is higher than
the share price.
In the case of a 650p put, it has only time value when the underlying share
price is above 650p; but for each penny the shares fall below 650p, the
intrinsic value rises. Glaxo shares fell to 550p recently and the price of
the October put option rose consequently to about 135p. So, if you thought
the stock had turned the corner, you could sell your option back into the
market for about Pounds 1,350.
Of course, big investors usually have a varied portfolio of shares so,
rather than protecting each share with an individual put option, a more
likely scenario would be to hedge through a put option on the whole FT-SE
100 index.
Index options are different from individual equity options in that
exercising the contract involves only cash, not shares. Thus, rather than
selling off shares, you are compensated for their loss in value.
When the market was at its peak of 3,520, a put option at 3,500 (ie, one
that provided almost total protection) might have cost 6 per cent of the
portfolio value. But derivatives' analysts estimate that protection at 3,200
would cost only 1 per cent.
Options traders say the best time for an investor to buy derivatives is
after the market has moved (whether upwards or downwards) by more than 10
per cent over a short period, as there is a strong chance of that move being
followed by a correction. As the FT-SE 100 has recovered by 300 points since
the end of June, now might be a good time to ensure that the recent
300-point gain is not lost.
(The price of index options is shown on the London stock market report page
of the FT. Individual stock option prices are shown inside the second
section, generally on the World Stock Markets page).

The largest deal of the week was at property company Birkby where William
Cran, the chief executive, sold 400,000 shares at 273p each, raising more
than Pounds 1m. The sale was undertaken for personal reasons. Greggs, the
high street baker, has been enjoying a good run on its share price over the
past 12 months. Indeed, interim results announced at the end of July showed
earnings growth of more than 25 per cent and a dividend increase of 16 per
cent - fine results given the warmth of the summer which tends to depress
people's appetite for sweet buns.
The sale recorded by managing director Mike Darrington of 1,200 shares
leaves him with a total holding of more than 71,000.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Builders put up a better showing -
The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The interim results season for construction and building materials companies
starts in earnest on Wednesday when half-year figures are due from
housebuilder Persimmon, contractor Mowlem, and Rugby Group, the cement
company.
Persimmon is expected to have increased first-half profits to about Pounds
14m (Pounds 9.7m), while some analysts reckon Rugby's profits will have
grown from Pounds 30.2m to about Pounds 35m.
Just as interesting as the figures, though, will be what Persimmon has to
say about whether new house sales have started to pick up after a slow start
to the summer.
Forecasts for Mowlem, which sold its housebuilding operations following a
financial reconstruction, vary wildly; some brokers suggest the company has
remained in the red in the first half.
The consensus view, however, is that it could have made pre-tax profits of
about Pounds 4m following a Pounds 41.8m loss in the first six months of
1993.
Provident Financial, the personal loan and consumer finance group, will
report its interim results on Wednesday. Analysts expect an advance in
pre-tax profits for the first half of 1994 to around Pounds 26m-27m, against
Pounds 21.9m - an increase of between 18 and 23 per cent.
The increase in the interim dividend is expected to be slightly lower, at
around 15 per cent, taking it to 5.5p from the 4.75p reported last year.
Williams Holdings is expected to announce interim profits of about Pounds
90m on Thursday. With a hefty chunk of business dependent on housebuilding,
investors will be looking for signs of some pick-up in underlying trading in
both the US and UK.
The cashflow question which has plagued the conglomerate is likely to
linger, albeit in the background. More importantly, after April's Pounds
267m rights issue, observers will want signs that the new, more conservative
strategy of bolt-on acquisitions is working.
The upturn in European vehicle sales and signs of recovery in the US
automotive industry should lift first-half profits at T&amp;N by about 30 per
cent at the motor components and engineering group. Interim pre-tax profits
 -due on Thursday - are expected to reach Pounds 51m (Pounds 39.4m) as the
group enjoys higher volumes and the benefits of previous re-organisation.
Analysts warn, however, that investors will be seeking a 'significant
payback' following Pounds 263m of capital spending in the past three years
and a 92 per increase in the shares in issue since 1989.
Reckitt &amp; Colman, the household products and toiletries group, is expected
on Thursday to report a marginal increase in interim pre-tax profits to
about Pounds 150m (Pounds 144m). Gains on the disposal of its European
Colours business will push FRS 3 pre-tax profits to around Pounds 185m. The
interim dividend is expected to rise by 8 per cent to 6.95p a share.
Trading conditions in continental Europe and North America have shown next
to no improvement since a cautious AGM statement in May pushed the shares
down from 634p to a low of 558p in June. They have recovered since, however.
Ladbroke, the hotels, DIY and betting group, is expected to announce interim
profits before exceptionals of about Pounds 43m on Thursday, against Pounds
62.5m last year.
The sharp decline is due almost entirely to the dismal performance from
Texas Homecare, the DIY business. Most of the pain was taken at the year-end
when the group was forced to re-state the division's profits. But underlying
trading is still expected to have fallen further. The dividend is likely to
be reduced from 4.92p to 2.5p, in line with the year-end cut.
Rolls-Royce, the power generation and aero engines group, is expected to
reveal a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 32m to between Pounds 39m and
Pounds 46m for the first half of 1994 when it reports on Thursday.
Also on Thursday, analysts expect Vickers, which makes Rolls-Royce cars and
tanks, to have all but doubled pre-tax profits in the first half. Between
Pounds 15m and Pounds 18m is anticipated, against last time's Pounds 8.3m.
Behind the advance lies a better performance from the cars division, the
possibility of good news on the global diesel engines market, and an upturn
in the medical equipment division.
The City is expecting Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, to turn in
pre-tax profits between Pounds 65m and Pounds 73m on Friday for the six
months to June 30, sharply up on last time's Pounds 46.3m. The outcome will
probably be to the upper end of expectations, but precise forecasting is
particularly difficult this time.
Unlike last time, acquisitions such as Thames Television and Extel will be
included - but not the demerged Royal Doulton and Camco, the oil services
group. Schroders, the merchant bank, reports its first-ever interim results
on Friday. Growth in mergers and acquisitions business, along with US
expansion, should contribute to pre-tax profits of Pounds 100m. The interim
dividend could be lifted from 4p to 4.5p.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Debt traps that make student life a
misery - Bethan Hutton offers some advice on avoiding the worst of the
pitfalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the grant cheque first arrives in freshers' week, many students feel
richer than they have ever been. But, by the end of the first term, some are
already in debt. By graduation, the average student owes more than Pounds
2,000.
Coping with money - or, rather, the lack of it - is one of the least
pleasant aspects of student life. Nothing can make it easy, but knowing how
the system works can help students avoid some of the worst pitfalls.
Banking. Banks woo student customers with everything from free jeans to hard
cash, but it is better to look for convenience, free banking and cheap
borrowing.
The best student bank account this year seems to be with a building society.
The Halifax is offering the largest interest-free overdraft, the highest
rate of interest for those in credit, and the lowest interest rates for both
authorised and unauthorised overdrafts above the interest-free limit.
Some general advice for students:
Before making a final choice of bank (or building society), students should
check that it has at least one branch and plenty of cash points near your
place of study.
New students with existing bank accounts should demand all the student
conditions and privileges - or open an account with another bank if terms
are better elsewhere.
Check regularly how much (or how little) you have in the bank; it is easy to
let debt creep up on you. Allow, too, for the fact that balances given out
by cash machines are a day or two out of date and that cheques take several
days to clear.
Always talk to the bank before exceeding an overdraft limit. Bounced cheques
are expensive.
Avoid credit cards unless you have good self-control or parents with deep
pockets.
Grants. These were cut by 10 per cent in the last Budget, although the
maximum loan was increased to compensate. More grant cuts are expected to
push the balance further towards reliance on loans over the next few years.
Grants for most students aged under 25 are means-tested on their parents'
income. Parents start having to contribute if they earn more than about
Pounds 15,000 a year, and those with income of more than about Pounds 35,000
must meet the full cost of a son or daughter studying outside London.
Loans. Debt has become impossible to avoid for most students. The cheapest
way to borrow is an interest-free student overdraft, but student terms last
for a maximum of a year after graduation. Then, no matter what your
financial situation, you must pay off the overdraft or be charged market
interest rates.
Loans from the official Student Loans Company are repayable over five years,
starting the April after graduation, as long as you are earning more than 85
per cent of average earnings (now about Pounds 14,000 a year). If you earn
less, the loan can be deferred.
Technically, the loan is interest-free, but the amount you owe will rise in
line with inflation.
You can apply for a loan once each academic year. If you ask for less than
the maximum amount, you cannot make a second application if you need more
later. Other sources of money. The government gives each university or
college a sum of money for distribution as 'access funds' to help students
in dire need. The amount of money is limited, and demand is heavy, but if
you have a good case it is worth a try. Some institutions also have their
own hardship funds or scholarships.
Sponsorship is a very attractive option. It is easiest to obtain for
engineering students, but a growing range of employers, from the armed
forces to accountancy firms, are willing to sponsor students on other
courses. Careers offices may have more information, or get a copy of
Sponsorships for Students 1994 (Hobsons), Pounds 5 from the Careers and
Occupational Information Centre, PO Box 348, Bristol, BS99 7FE.
Some large companies have schemes to provide financial help to employees'
student offspring - parents should make enquiries. A few charities also make
small grants to students who meet certain conditions. For details, look in
your library for the Charities Digest, Money to Study, or The Grant
Register.
Tax. Grants, loans and parental contributions, to the level of the maximum
grant, are not treated as taxable income. Students can earn up to the full
personal allowance of Pounds 3,445 on top of their grant before paying any
tax. Most students will not earn enough from part-time or temporary work to
be liable for tax, but it is often deducted automatically from wages. To
avoid this, fill in Inland Revenue form P38S before starting work.
Further reading. The Department for Education's booklet Student Grants and
Loans: A Brief Guide covers the whole student funding system, with lists of
relevant organisations and publications. Free copies obtainable from the DfE
Publications Centre on 081-533 2000.
Two books full of information are: Pay Your Way as a Student (Hobsons,
Pounds 7.99), available from Biblios (0403-710 851); and Students' Money
Matters (Trotman, Pounds 7.95). Available by post for Pounds 9.45 (inc
Pounds 1.50 p&amp;p) from Trotman &amp; Co., 12 Hill Rise, Richmond, Surrey TW10

FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: How the other half pay
</HEADLINE>

UNITED STATES
Students must meet tuition fees but can get grants and loans from various
sources, writes John Authers. Parents can take out government loans and
Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). Most loans are paid off
within 10 years of graduation.
One of the most popular is the Stafford loan, which is means-tested and has
a zero interest rate while the student stays in education. The interest rate
is 8 per cent for the first four years of repayment and 10 per cent
thereafter.
Commercial banks make the loans, but the government guarantees them a return
of at least 3.25 per cent above the Treasury bill rate and also pays
interest to the lender while the student is in education. The downside is
that the cost of defaults is estimated at around Dollars 3bn a year.
AUSTRALIA
Australia's system is the one that many vice-chancellors and academics want
the UK government to adopt. Under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme,
every student takes out an automatic loan when enrolling to cover a portion
of the course fees. For full-time students, this is about ADollars 2,328
(Pounds 1,100) a year.
The loan is not repayable until students have graduated, and their income
has exceeded a minimum threshold, now set at the Australian average wage.
Repayments are made through the tax system - students' codes are altered
when they start at university and they pay a progressive tax rate of 2, 3 or
4 per cent until the loan is repaid in full. There is a 25 per cent discount
for those who repay their entire loan in one lump sum.
GERMANY
Germany's loans-based system is much less sophisticated than Australia's.
Loans are means-tested and the amount available falls quite quickly as
parental income rises. The parental contribution is fixed and a legal
requirement. Loans are repayable over 20 years with a minimum annual
repayment, which can be deferred if graduates' income drops below a certain
threshold. There is no interest rate - not even to keep up with inflation.
And if students are in the top 30 per cent of their year academically, a
quarter of the loan's value is written off.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Markets: Stocks are pulled up by their shorts - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed about 130 points to more
than 3,880 - its highest level since late March - on three separate waves of
buying.
It was not just a rally of blue-chip stocks, either. The composite index of
Nasdaq stocks climbed 3 per cent in four and a half trading days, in the
process scaling a peak untouched in six months, while the more broadly-based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index did even better, jumping 4.4 per cent to reach
its highest mark since early February.
After a difficult summer, traders, investors and analysts are wondering if
this is the beginning of the rally that everyone has been waiting for since
the Federal Reserve began ratcheting up interest rates in February. Rates
have been raised five times since then, but at the time of the last increase
10 days ago, hopes were high that it might be the last such move of the
current cycle of monetary policy tightenings.
Those hopes were reinforced this week by data which suggested that the
interest rate increases of earlier in the year may finally be feeding
through into the economy, slowing it down sufficiently to keep inflationary
pressures firmly in check.
First there was the July durable goods orders report, which showed that
orders had fallen by 4.2 per cent in the month, an unexpectedly large
decline that was the biggest in more than two and a half years. While that
figure was skewed by a big drop in orders in the transportation industry, it
was still encouraging, at least to those troubled by the strength of the US
economy.
Similarly, yesterday's revision in the second quarter gross domestic product
figure was also a pleasant surprise. Although the number was revised higher
 -from GDP growth of 3.7 per cent to 3.8 per cent - the market had been
bracing for a considerably larger upward revision.
The durable goods orders and GDP reports were exactly what the
inflation-sensitive bond market wanted: a sign that the economy may be
cooling off. The subsequent rally in Treasury prices lowered the yield on
the benchmark 30-year government bond - the most widely followed measure of
long-term interest rates - from 7.55 per cent at the start of the week to
7.47 per cent near the end. And, of course, where the bond market goes, the
stock market, which has been marching in lockstep with Treasury prices all
summer, follows.
The gains in share prices this week, however, were not entirely due to news
of a weakening economy and rising bond prices. A recovery in the value of
the dollar against the Japanese yen also helped lift stocks. More unusually,
though, activities in the derivatives market may have provided share prices
with a significant boost on Wednesday, the day when the Dow jumped more than
70 points.
Much of those gains were achieved late in the day, and market analysts
attributed them to 'short-covering' by investors and dealers. In recent
months, a record number of market participants, anticipating further
declines in share prices, have run up 'short' positions in stocks. This
means they have borrowed shares and immediately sold them on, in the hope
that when they have to return the borrowed shares, they will be able to buy
them in the market at a lower price - thus making a profit.
When prices start rising unexpectedly, short-sellers are faced with the
prospect of big losses, because they have to buy back their borrowed stocks
at a higher price. The only way to limit those losses, is to buy stocks
before they rise too far and wipe out the profit on the short positions.
This 'short-covering' is what happened late on Wednesday, and the rise in
prices that prompted it was reportedly caused by heavy buying of blue-chip
stocks by investors who had bought a particular derivatives product - a
short-term stock index option - from a Washington-based money manager. That
manager had sold the option because he was convinced share prices were going
to fall this week.
When prices rose above a certain level on Wednesday afternoon, however,
anyone who bought the index options from him started making money. Those
investors then kept on buying, because the higher prices went, the more
money they made on their options. It was this rush of late demand which
seems to have panicked the short-sellers into also buying stocks. The end
result was a 71-point gain on the Dow.
Short-covering may also have contributed to yesterday morning's big jump in
the Dow, but by then, share prices appeared to have an upward momentum all
of their own. For now, at least, the stock market is on a roll.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Markets: The ethics of being an ethical investor - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A friend, revolted by the thought of eating meat, used to recount the
drawbacks of being vegetarian. It was not so bad being challenged
continually about his ethics, he used to say, but what he could not abide
was being deliberately deceived.
On a visit to a restaurant he often frequented, he asked if the mushroom
quiche was vegetarian, and was reassured. But, after the first mouthful, he
became suspicious; closer examination revealed it contained little cubes of
ham.
Investors in ethical companies and funds probably know the feeling. They may
face opposition for bringing morality into the business of making money -
attempts to launch an ethical unit trust early in the 1980s were refused at
first by the Department of Trade and Industry on the ground that capital and
conscience conflict - but if they invest in good faith, only to be let down,
there is not much they can do other than to withdraw their money. To a great
extent, they will always be investing on trust.
The rights and wrongs of ethical investment were underlined recently after
the Franklin Research Development, a US ethical investment fund, advised its
clients to sell Body Shop shares. One reason was that allegations due to be
published about the company in the US press could, it believed, lower its
stock price in the short term.
For many people, ethical investment will remain little more than a marketing
gimmick to help the image of a company or an investment house. After all,
the Pounds 800m or so invested in UK ethical unit and investment trusts is
tiny as a proportion of total funds under management - more than Pounds 97bn
in the case of unit trusts alone. Yet, ethical and environmental funds are
relatively high profile.
On the other hand, investment has been growing steadily, increasing more
than fourfold over the past five years - a far higher growth rate than that
of the average fund over the same period.
Holder Meehan, a London and Bristol-based independent financial adviser
specialising in ethical investment, estimates that 'screened' investment -
when companies are analysed according to the ethical concerns of the
investor - amount to a rather more substantial Pounds 20bn. The figure
includes local authority money, plus charity and church funds.
The inclusion of the last two is ironic. Nearly four years ago, the Bishop
of Oxford lost a court case against church commissioners in which he argued
that they should give more weight to ethical investment than to financial
considerations.
If you are an ethical investor, how can you be sure your criteria are being
met? You could always build up your own portfolio using the services of a
company such as Eiris, which screens stocks to see if they meet about 300
ethical criteria, but it would be relatively expensive and risky compared
with a pooled fund.
Still, the choice of funds has become much wider over the past few years.
Initially, the only ethical funds were unit trusts - Friends Provident
established the first in 1984 - but now there are ethical investment trusts,
pension funds and packaged ethical products such as personal equity plans
and endowment mortgages.
You will want to choose a fund which matches your ethical criteria most
closely, perhaps with the help of one of a number of IFAs who specialise in
ethical funds. But choices need to be based on relative, rather than
absolute, criteria.
One of the criticisms of Body Shop was that its high-profile trade-not-aid
policy, which involves buying from developing countries, forms only a small
proportion of its business although the company says it spends a
disproportionate amount of time and money on the policy.
But, for the interested investor, the question is whether another company
can better the Body Shop record. If not, then the choice is between Body
Shop and others which do not operate such a policy.
Another way of avoiding disappointment is to ask the fund manager to be
specific about investment criteria and the way the fund's monitoring
processes operate.
Allchurches Amity Fund says it avoids 'companies materially involved in the
alcohol, tobacco and gambling industries'. Scottish Equitable is more
specific: its literature states it avoids companies 'for which the growing,
processing or sale of tobacco products account for more than 10 per cent of
its total business'.
Allchurches says, however, that it regards 'materially involved' as having
more than about 3-5 per cent of profits and turnover in those activities. It
does not like being specific because it might invest in a company exceeding
this proportion if it is outweighed by other factors.
Some funds apply stricter ethical criteria than others, but this is likely
to restrict their investment choice. The most common negative criteria -
avoiding companies dealing in arms, tobacco and gambling - exclude about 60
per cent of companies in the FT-SE-A All-Share index.
This restricted investment choice can lead to underperformance but, given
the variety of ethical funds available, it is hard to be certain how their
performance measures against a benchmark.
First select the most suitable ethical fund and then look at its performance
record before making a final decision.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Markets: Analysts fix their gaze on the horizon - London
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The London market rallied strongly last week with the FT-SE 100 index moving
decisively through the 3,200 level helped by positive domestic corporate
news and a strong US market.
In recent weeks, the index has frequently stumbled on the threshold of
3,200, but on Wednesday the FT-SE 100 climbed 30 points to close at 3,205 -
the first time it has closed above 3,200 since March 22.
Further advances on Thursday and Friday took the FT-SE 100 index to 3,265 by
the close yesterday, up 74 points on the week and 389 points above the late
June low.
A surge of retail buying interest on Wednesday pushed turnover up to Pounds
1.68bn that day while turnover on Thursday reached 843.5m shares, the
heaviest volume for several months.
With the September reporting season imminent, the summer rally has been
encouraged by a growing feeling that investors are focusing more clearly on
the strong rise in corporate earnings and dividends which is already
evident.
Forty-three companies - 27 of them industrials - with market capitalisations
of more than Pounds 200m and, for the most part, December year ends, have
already reported their interim results and are mostly coming in on target
according to S G Warburg.
S G Warburg analysts forecast underlying earnings would be 24 per cent
ahead. They have shown gains of 28 per cent. Dividend increases have been
two percentage points ahead of forecasts at 12 per cent.
Among the companies reporting, only those in the financial sector came in
slightly ahead of expectations. The 27 industrial companies are precisely on
target showing 18 per cent gains with dividends 8 per cent higher compared
with a forecast 7 per cent.
After this first tranche of interim results, analysts have been updating
their forecasts. Warburg analysts have lifted their 1994 forecasts for
earnings-per-share growth at the industrials which have reported so far,
from 15 per cent to 15.2 per cent and from 11 per cent to 11.2 per cent for
1995.
For the broader results group, Warburg raised its EPS growth forecast for
the current year from 15.6 per cent to 22.7 per cent, but the 1995 forecast
has been downgraded from 18 per cent to 10.5 per cent.
But how significant are profit forecast upgrades and downgrades anyway?
Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull set out to analyse whether changes in
consensus forecasts for earnings per share growth have been reflected in
sector performance.
The results (see chart) show that the pattern of earnings per share changes
fall into two broad camps. Sectors which have seen an upgrade in their
forecast earnings growth rates tend to be in cyclical areas such as the
engineering, printing, paper and packaging and chemical sectors.
However the majority of sectors have actually seen a moderation of their
forecast rate of earnings growth since April 1992.
There have been only modest reductions in the growth rate of the consumer
shares including wines and spirits, brewers, health and household,
healthcare and the pharmaceutical stocks. More significant downgrades have
affected the service areas including food retailers, general retailers,
leisure and tobacco.
As might be expected, those sectors which have been downgraded most sharply
have also been among the poorest performers in the market, but there are
exceptions, for example the engineering vehicles sector.
'While the relationship between long term revisions and relative price
performance may not be overwhelming, change in forecast EPS growth is likely
to be an important influence on sector performance,' says Strauss Turnbull.
Of course there are many other factors influencing short term performance,
and this was illustrated this week.
On Monday, Service Corporation International of the US, announced that it
had more than doubled its 'strategic' stake in Plantsbrook, Britain's second
largest funeral business to 8.4 per cent. SCI's move follows its successful
hostile takeover of Great Southern Group. Plantsbrook's shares closed 9p
higher on the week at 172p compared with 100p before SCI's initial
expression of interest two weeks ago.
On Tuesday Thorn-EMI disappointed the market by ruling out an early demerger
of its music and rentals group. Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, speaking as
the group announced an 18 per cent decline in first quarter pre-tax profits
reflecting exceptional charges, said he did not expect the board to look at
demerger proposals again for three years. The shares closed the week 21.5p
lower at 1041p.
The same day disappointing results from NFC, coupled with the surprise
resignation of Peter Sherlock, the group's chief executive, sent the shares
tumbling. The shares closed the week 23p lower at 179p.
On Wednesday, the regional electricity company shares rose sharply again
after Seeboard became the first since the recent regulatory review to buy
back its own shares. Seeboard, which closed the week 20p higher at 448p,
purchased 2m shares at 425p. All 12 RECs have approval from shareholders for
share buy-backs.
WH Smith, the high street retailer, reported a rise in underlying pre-tax
profits of 13 per cent to Pounds 124.8m, in line with expectations. The
shares gained 30p on the week to 509p.
On Thursday Weir Group, the Glasgow-based pumps and engineering group,
announced the acquisition of EnviroTech Pumpsystems, a specialist US pump
manufacturer, for Dollars 210m (Pounds 135m).
The deal will be part funded by a one-for-four rights issue at 252p to raise
Pounds 96m. The shares closed the week down 10p at 303p.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Markets: Balancing the book business - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wednesday started badly for John Napier, finance director of retailing group
WH Smith. He turned on the television news to hear a report that he was
expected soon to announce a fall in the group's yearly profits from a
mis-stated Pounds 144m to Pounds 124m.
Headline profits did indeed fall, but from Pounds 114m to Pounds 84m - and
that was after exceptional costs of Pounds 41m to cover rationalisation of
Do It All, the group's DIY joint venture with Boots, and restructuring costs
in the Smith chain. Adding back those costs, underlying profits increased 13
per cent to the forecast Pounds 124m.
For Napier, the television's mistake was another example of the difficulties
he faces in getting across the message that WH Smith is still growing and
that many of the uncertainties holding back its share performance in recent
years are now resolved.
Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiries into newspaper distribution and
compact disc prices gave the retailer a fairly clean bill of health. The Our
Price music chain is back in profit after being merged earlier this year
with Virgin - a deal in which Smith increased its share of the joint venture
with Richard Branson's group from 50 to 75 per cent. Losses are falling at
Do It All after the disposal of 100 stores to concentrate on the 137 best
performers.
Before Napier can sleep easily, however, the fate of the Net Book Agreement
has still to be settled. The Office of Fair Trading last week asked the
Restrictive Practices Court, which rules on whether agreements between
companies are anti-competitive, to review the agreement which allows
publishers to set the retail prices of books. Its removal would allow
bookshops to compete on price, leading to a squeeze on margins.
WH Smith, long an NBA supporter, indicated a shift in stance on Wednesday,
saying it would help to finance the defence of the agreement only if large
publishers demonstrated they were still committed strongly to it.
Already, there are rumours that one or more will pull out by early next
year, effectively killing off the agreement even before the court rules. But
chief executive Sir Malcolm Field is confident that WH Smith can withstand
the end of the agreement. Discounting, he says, would be limited to perhaps
30 best-selling books, and any lost margin would be recouped largely through
gains in market share.
The other anxiety about the UK business is that consumer demand is expected
to remain sluggish. The group plans to compensate for that partly by its
biggest-ever expansion programme. It is spending Pounds 50m this year on
adding 230,000 square feet of selling space to its present 3.6m sq ft,
including new stores and the extension of its flagship Virgin Megastore on
Oxford Street, London, into the world's biggest music and video store.
It is also working hard to get more out of the market-leading position it
enjoys in several sectors. It is targeting its different retail outlets - WH
Smith and Waterstone in books; Virgin and Our Price in music, video and
games - more carefully at specific groups of consumers, and building up
their brand names.
On the cost side, removing layers of management in the WH Smith chain will
yield annual savings of Pounds 2.4m, allowing it to take on more shop staff
to improve service. It is through providing good service and extending
'value-added' features such as Bookfinder - its computer-based book ordering
service - that bookseller intends to keep its competitive edge, rather than
by copying the everyday low pricing strategy of rivals such as Kingfisher's
Woolworths chain.
The US, however, could provide the most exciting opportunities for growth.
Already, WH Smith is the biggest US airport retailer of books. It plans to
expand this business and the Waterstone chain.
Where does that leave the shares? With pre-tax profit for this year forecast
at Pounds 142m-Pounds 145m, equivalent to a 10 per cent increase in earnings
per share, analysts believe they are about 5 per cent undervalued against
the market. They have gained ground in the past three days but still look a
worthwhile holding.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Demand for pensions drops - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of new personal pensions and life assurance policies fell in the first
half of this year, apparently reflecting concerns about the mis-selling of
personal pensions. Figures from the Association of British Insurers showed
that the number of regular premium pensions slipped to 264,000 in the second
quarter - its lowest quarterly levels for more than two years. The number of
single premium pensions sold in the first half of this year, 265,000, was 30
per cent below the first half of last year, and 40 per cent below the total
sold in the first six months of 1992.
The Securities and Investments Board, the chief City regulator, has set up a
review into the sale of personal pensions to people transferring out of an
occupational scheme.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unit trust investment fell sharply last month. Net investment fell to Pounds
646.4m in July from June's record Pounds 1.1bn. It was the weakest
investment figure since January. Last month's figure was also down by almost
one-third from net investment of Pounds 954.6m in July last year. The
Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds said one reason for the drop
might be a switch by discretionary managers into direct holdings of UK
equities at the expense of unit trusts. It also thought more people might be
holding cash.

FT  27 AUG 94 / The English coast and its holidays from hell: Britain's
tourism industry is in trouble. Michael Thompson-Noel packs his bucket and
spade and sets out to discover why
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I felt trapped and concussed. There was seediness and desperation almost
everywhere I looked. I believed I was in a time warp, or in a novel by JG
Ballard in which the past and the future had coalesced gruesomely into a
macabre and changeless present. I was in Great Yarmouth.
Among the horrors that market themselves as English seaside resorts, Great
Yarmouth, which sits like a boil on England's eastern cheek, is perhaps
without peer for hideousness and hopelessness.
In some ways it is a typically clapped-out English working-class coastal
resort-town whose fate, in an era of cheap mass foreign travel, is to play
host to the poorest and least sophisticated of Britain's stay-at-home
holidaymakers. It gives them beer and crummy boarding houses, dodgem cars
and shooting galleries, food to feed a pig on and a wind from the Urals. The
day I was there - a day in mid-August, the high point of summer - the wind
was so strong that the sea was unsafe and the beach out of bounds.
But there is something grippingly awful about Great Yarmouth. It looks as
though it has not changed in any respect in half a century, as though its
grotesqueness and datedness are protected, for some reason, by a
force-field. It could be England's worst seaside resort. That would make it,
by definition, one of the worst in the world.
Not that I stayed long. I was out of there fast. Why did I go? I went
because I was looking for a chimera: the Great English Holiday. Why should I
do that? Because I had read that Adele Biss, chairman of the British Tourist
Authority and of the English Tourist Board, was growing alarmed at the
bleakness of the position confronting British tourism, particularly its
English variant.
Reading of her concern, I realised that I had never, as an adult, spent a
holiday of more than three days in England. I have holidayed in France,
Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Morocco, Tunisia, Bermuda, the Caribbean,
Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Mexico,
California, Canada, Scotland, Wales and elsewhere. But England, hardly ever.
The reasons are quite conventional: climate, cost, familiarity and English
naffness (naff: adj, slang, unfashionable, socially awkward; worthless,
rubbishy).
Here are some figures. Tourism in all its guises is worth about Pounds 30bn
a year to Britain's economy. Britain's income from foreign tourists is
booming: 1994 forecasts are for 20m visitors, especially from the US,
France, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands.
In the international league table of tourism, Britain still ranks sixth,
after the US, France, Spain, Italy and Austria, though it used to be fifth.
Tourism accounts for about 1.5m jobs in Britain and more than 200,000
businesses. It employs nearly 7 per cent of the workforce.
But all is not well. In 1985, says the tourist authority, Britain had a
balance of payments surplus on its tourism account of Pounds 571m - ie, more
was spent by foreign visitors to Britain than by the British travelling
abroad (this does not take into account the money spent by Britons in
Britain). This account toppled into loss in 1986. Last year the deficit was
Pounds 3.6bn - a faster and deeper decline than that experienced by other
countries in Europe.
The main reason for this turn-around is said to be the growing number of
Britons holidaying abroad as their wealth grows. In real terms, between 1980
and 1992 expenditure by UK residents on holiday in Britain fell by 12 per
cent, while spending on foreign holidays soared by two-thirds.
A well-organised outbound tourism industry (travel agents, tour operators
and foreign tourist boards) spends well over Pounds 100m in marketing
overseas destinations to the British. By contrast, the domestic industry is
less well organised, highly fragmented and does not have the same marketing
muscle.
As more and more Britons have taken foreign holidays, Britain has lost share
of international tourism. During the 1980s, Britain took about 6 per cent of
world tourism spending. By 1992: 4.8 per cent.
In England, says Adele Bliss, the picture is at its sorriest: 'In the last
decade the share attracted by England of all holiday spending by Britons has
fallen by some 10 percentage points, all of which has gone on holidays taken
abroad. That share loss cost our tourism industry some Pounds 2.5bn in 1993
alone.'
So off I went in search of an English holiday. I spent 5 1/2 days and drove
972 miles. I travelled willy-nilly, stopping at random, looking for places
that would persuade me to spend my next holiday in England rather than in
Italy or in Fiji or in Sarawak (terribly nice, Sarawak, one of my all-time
faves).
I decided to travel up England's eastern coast because it was the one I was
least familiar with. But it makes no difference: east, south or west,
Britain's seaside resorts are almost uniformly wretched: grasping, ghastly,
catering to the lowest common denominator.
If there was a map of England's naffness that utilised coloured lights, you
would find that the cities glowed orange, that the towns shone purple and
that the English coastline throbbed in apocalyptic scarlet. It has lost its
soul to naffness. Only scraps survive. Worse, the bits in between are often
occupied by drab caravan parks or camping sites - people holidaying in
tents, a concept so twisted that the holiday-time murder rate in England's
coastal parts must be worryingly high.
For 2 1/2 days I meandered northwards, repulsed by ugly resort town after
ugly resort town. My main compensation was the quality of hotels I stayed
in. I did not shy from luxury. They were excellent, including the guesthouse
I stayed in on the second night, and proved that one of the best aspects of
English tourism is the quality and range of its hotels. They are as good as
any country's, but cheap they are not.
My first night was spent at Congham Hall, a luxury country house hotel set
in 40 acres of parkland near King's Lynn in Norfolk. It is near the
Sandringham royal estate, just inland, and is run with great flair by
Christine and Trevor Forecast. The peace of the Norfolk countryside is all
around. Its food is more than good and it has a heated outdoor swimming
pool. Its herb gardens are famous.
Would a holiday at Congham Hall prove memorable? Undoubtedly it would. But
prices, including full breakfast, range from Pounds 99 per night for two
people in a smallish double room to Pounds 118 (single) or Pounds 180
(double) for a luxury ground-floor suite.
After breakfast I chatted to Trevor Forecast, who will become chairman of
Pride of Britain, a marketing group of 33 stylish British hotels and
restaurants, in November. He and his wife employ 35 workers, including
part-timers.
'What are the virtues of foreign holidays?' asked Forecast helpfully as we
sat in the sitting room, watching the rain. 'I have jotted them down for
you. There is the weather, obviously, though people are becoming wary of too
much sun. There is their cheapness, of course, though not at our level of
hotel. There is the attraction of foreign culture. And, for some, the
adventure of flying, though that must be waning.
'As for holidays in England, I think there are three main advantages. The
food is better: I would throw in a plug for English cooking. Travel times
are shorter: you can use your own car. And it's safer. There is the odd rail
strike, to be sure, but no likelihood of a coup in Norfolk.'
He could have added a fourth: the immense range of things to see and do in
England. In recent times the English heritage business has been reviled for
turning England into a Disneyesque theme park. But the criticism has been
disproportionate to the damage inflicted by the heritage-mongers, at least
to date.
On price, the proprietor of Congham Hall said that British tourism was not
treated fairly by the government. One of its grosser burdens is the high
rate of VAT.
Biss says that Britain's tourism infrastructure is woefully under-utilised,
especially compared with that in Mediterranean countries. As a consequence,
profits are not high enough and charges are uncompetitive.
Part of the problem is the cost structure. In Britain, serviced
accommodation and restaurants have to pass 17.5 per cent in VAT on to their
customers, compared, for example, to 6 per cent - or sometimes outright
exemption - elsewhere in Europe. Forecast finds this galling. The morning of
our chat, The Times reported that Spain's government had decided to reduce
the 15 per cent VAT levied on five-star hotels to 6 per cent from January 1.
However, many five-star Spanish hotels had contrived to reduce their VAT
bills anyway, simply by down-grading themselves to four-star, where the
charge is already 6 per cent.
Unfortunately for English hoteliers, there is no sign of a slackening in the
appetite for foreign travel. Visa, for example, recently produced a survey
of the more exotic destinations favoured this year by holidaying Britons.
They included Ecuador, Gabon, Vietnam, Estonia, Guyana, Jordan, Papua New
Guinea and Zimbabwe.
For the British, a two-week package holiday in Vietnam, including flights
and accommodation, costs about Pounds 1,500. A seven-night Crusaders and
Citadels sightseeing tour of Jordan with Abercrombie &amp; Kent, an upmarket
travel operator, starts from about Pounds 900, including flights and some
meals.
In any case, British tourism is a millpond compared to the giant-size
business of global tourism, in which market trends of enormous proportions
take shape at oceanic depths before swelling to the surface.
The Mediterranean, for instance, is the world's premier tourist area, yet
even the Med has lost market share steadily (partly because of price), from
31 per cent of world tourist arrivals in 1987 to 27 per cent three years
ago. However, a report last year by the Economist Intelligence Unit
predicted that the Med would reverse recent trends and capture more than a
third of international tourist arrivals by 2000.
Can Britain cope with souped-up competition from established and emerging
rivals, or is its tourism doomed to slide further into the morass, in
company with British industry, science and sausage-making?
Probably, it will cope. The realisation that I could enjoy a holiday in
England impressed itself upon me the moment I left the coast. I did this at
Whitby. I had already bypassed Scarborough, of which people talk highly. It
is the Yorkshire resort. But I was daunted by its size, and carried on to
Whitby, a dramatically-sited north Yorkshire fishing port with a ruined
abbey peering down on it. But by the time I reached Whitby - I could not
park the car there, I could not even stop: it was crawling with humanity - I
was so sick of resorts that I swept straight out, and wrenched the car
westwards.
By doing this I was propelled, almost at once, into the serenity of the
North York Moors, 555 sq miles of outstandingly beautiful countryside, from
gentle farmland to sweeping heather moors domed by massive skies -
world-class scenery. The area is one of Britain's 10 national parks - so
immediately uplifting that I felt embarrassed at having spent my life
gallivanting to far-flung places without once having visited it.
But my embarrassment was salutary. It reminded me that the naff-map of
England does not glow at all if you study its interior: that the naffness of
England fades away entirely if you avoid its cities, towns and coast and
strike into its countryside.
Some of England's national parks are pretty heavily visited, particularly
the Lake District and the Peak District, each of which scores 20m
visitor-days per year. But at the other end of the scale are the national
park of Northumberland, the Norfolk Broads (a national park in all but
name), Exmoor and the Yorkshire Dales. The other four British national parks
are the Brecon Beacons, Dartmoor, the Pembrokeshire coast and Snowdonia - in
total, more than 5,400 sq miles of protected and outstanding countryside, as
fine as any in Europe.
If I were Adele Biss of the English Tourist Board, I think I would pipe
down. I would stop worrying about the deficit on England's tourism account
and conclude that the present figure was not particularly bad, all things
considered.
I would accept that nothing can be done about English weather and
acknowledge that the government does not care a damn about hotel VAT rates.
I would mourn that England possessed no coastal resort remotely in the class
of Deauville, Rimini or Surfers' Paradise, and then shut up about it -
confident that England's seaside resorts, led by hell-holes such as Great
Yarmouth, will cling stubbornly to their grottiness until the end of time.
Finally, I would stop parroting at conferences about under-used capacity,
the public policy agenda and our rich tapestry of heritage.
Instead, I would spread the word about England's national parks and the rest
of its splendid countryside, a task that could be accomplished for a
fraction of the budget presently at my disposal. Ring Miss Biss today. Ask
her for a naff-map to guide you on your travels. If she says she does not
have one, tell her she should be fired.

FT  27 AUG 94 / The Long View: Strange case of Lord A
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shame about Lord Archer's political career. But the wayward novelist does
enliven an otherwise dull week. The snag is that his curious share dealings
cast serious doubt on one of our most cherished and comfortable assumptions
 -namely that the British are wonderfully successful at maintaining the rule
of law without a surfeit of lawyers.
For those who have been sunning themselves on some foreign beach, here is an
edited version of the plot to date. In January, Lord A, whose wife is a
director of Anglia Television, buys shares in Anglia. This he does through a
stockbroker, Charles Stanley, that he has not hitherto employed. Within days
Anglia is the subject of a bid from MAI, whereupon the shares are sold at a
profit of Pounds 80,000.
While the broker had at first assumed that Lord Archer was buying for
himself, the noble peer subsequently demonstrates an admirable concern for
wider share ownership by asking for the shares to be registered in the name
of a Kurdish acquaintance, Mr Broosk Saib. He also provides Saib with an
unusually ritzy accommodation address. All correspondence, including the
cheque, is sent to Lord Archer's own London penthouse.
Britain's Department of Trade and Industry has never been noted for a
suspicious turn of mind where insider trading is concerned. Yet it did, in
this instance, investigate the transactions involved, which suggests that
its sense of smell is not entirely deficient in these matters. It then
decided to take no further action against any of the parties concerned in
the investigation.
Lord Archer now admits that his share dealings were a 'grave error', but
only because they embarrassed his wife, who later said that she did not pass
on information to him. This week the chivalrous novelist was to be heard on
the radio declaring repeatedly that he had nothing further to say, sounding
for all the world like an 'I speak your weight' machine that had acquired a
good lawyer. The newspaper pictures of Saib, meantime, portray a man of
exceptionally cheerful disposition.
For some, this is good knockabout fun in the silly season. Others of more
serious inclination feel that it demonstrates the stupidity of Britain's
insider trading legislation. Here, they argue, is a case of a man being
caught at the wicket and promptly declared not out.
Nor is this the first time that such a thing has happened. Since insider
dealing is a criminal offence, the burden of proof is exceptionally onerous.
The definitions of an insider, and of inside information, are
extraordinarily difficult to draw in a watertight legal manner. Enforcement
is therefore difficult and the authorities become absurdly preoccupied with
the table manners of people at brokers' lunches. Would we be better off
without such legislation in the first place, given that failure to enforce
the law brings the law into contempt?
It is not difficult to make the case. Market skulduggery can be divided into
two categories. Some behaviour involves the distortion of prices. If, as in
the case of the Guinness bid for Distillers, large companies change hands on
the basis of false information, there is a risk that resources will be
misallocated and the economy damaged.
Insider dealing, in contrast, makes for more efficient pricing. The victims
tend not to be the small shareholders, in whose name the legislation is so
often justified, but professional market makers who know how to look after
themselves.
Moreover, insider dealing laws, which originated in the liberal,
English-speaking economies, distance shareholders from management. They give
institutional investors an incentive not to lock themselves into a
supportive dialogue with companies because this would restrict their ability
to sell the shares. By reinforcing the fetish of liquidity, insider dealing
laws weaken the chain of accountability from management to the legal owners
of the company.
Well, up to a point. But the Germans and Japanese themselves now have
insider dealing laws; and the reason is political rather than economic. In
Japan, in particular, the fact that brokers' inside clients were recently
protected from an unprecedented market crash, while private shareholders
were not, caused huge disillusionment with the country's ruling elite. That
resentment partly explains the erosion of the Japanese political consensus.
Nor are the economic arguments for legislation negligible. A biased roulette
wheel deters punters from the casino. It is noteworthy that in countries
such as Italy, where insider dealing legislation is weakly enforced, the
stock market is distrusted by the public. That can lead to a higher cost of
capital.
Indeed it is possible that the low level of private share ownership in
Britain reflects a general suspicion of behaviour in the stock market as
well as the fiscal incentives for collective ownership. The fact that new
issues are so often underpriced and that companies change hands at large
premiums to their day-to-day market valuation tends to support that view.
Judging by comments overheard on the Clapham omnibus, Lord Archer's conduct
has done damage both to the Tories and the City - though not, dare one say,
as much as might have been done if he had been given a high profile
political role before the next election. There is surely mourning in the
Labour camp. It seems inconceivable, regardless of economic argument, that
any political party will repeal the insider trading legislation. Given
London's lucrative role as an entrepot in the capital markets, it would also
be damaging to part company with US practice, which is the international
norm.
We are thus condemned to frequent legislative amendments and repeated
criticism of poor enforcement. That means the law will continue to look like
an ass. But when has it not? As Mr Justice Cocklecarrot, the creation of
that connoisseur of legal form, JB Morton, remarked: 'If a cow with
handlebars is a bicycle, within the meaning of the Act, then a bicycle with
four legs instead of two wheels is a cow.'

FT  27 AUG 94 / Shortage of PVC to raise cost of building products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Makers of building products are facing shortages and steep price rises in
one of their main raw materials, polyvinyl chloride.
In the UK, manufacturers of plastic pipes, cabling and other products are
poised to raise prices for the second time this year following an increase
of more than a third in world PVC prices.
Heavy demand, especially from construction work in east Asia, and technical
problems at petrochemical plants in the US and Italy have meant that PVC
producers have struggled to supply customers.
Mr David Trapnell, chief executive of Marley, the UK building products
group, said his company had already increased prices of plastic products by
5 per cent and planned a further rise of up to 9 per cent next month PVC
accounted for about half of raw material costs.
Mr Terry Reddick, manufacturing director of Hepworth Building Products,
makers of plastic pipes, which has announced similar price increases, said:
'There are shortages. Supplies are difficult to get but not impossible.'
Construction is the biggest market for PVC, taking 57 per cent of European
capacity. The second biggest market is packaging with 15 per cent, according
to specialist chemicals consultancy Chem Systems.
Price rises have been led by north America and east Asia. US demand rose 8
per cent in the first quarter compared with the same period last year.
Prices rose from about Dollars 620 (Pounds 400) a tonne to Dollars 800 a
tonne between January and June this year.
South Korean demand increased 15 per cent in the 12 months to March and
prices rose from Dollars 640 a tonne in January to Dollars 860 in June.
European spot prices in the past year have risen from Pounds 400 a tonne to
Pounds 600, said Hepworth.
The increased demand from east Asian and US construction industries has been
followed to a lesser extent in Europe where German housebuilding and
renovation have risen sharply and where a slow recovery is under way in the
UK housing market. European plants are operating close to capacity.
There have also been technical problems with plants making ethylene, one of
the main raw materials for PVC. Two plants in the US and one in Italy have
been hit by production problems, and capacity overall has been cut by
closures such as the one at BP's plant at Baglan Bay in South Wales earlier
this year.
The price rise increases the chances of a flotation of EVC, ICI's joint
venture with Italy's Enichem and Europe's largest producer of PVC.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Russia seeks more timeto repay its Pounds 51bn debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government is trying to find a radical long-term solution to its
Dollars 80bn (Pounds 51.6bn) foreign debt burden as its budget is stretched
to the limit, Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's economics minister, said
yesterday.
In a wide-ranging statement on economic policy, Mr Shokhin hinted that
Russia would seek a more generous time-scale for debt repayments, and raised
the possibility of reintroducing price controls covering such areas as
electricity, gas and transport. However, he insisted this should not be seen
as a return to central planning.
Mr Shokhin, who as head of the debt negotiation team has repeatedly
confirmed Russia's intention of meeting its obligations, said the problem
was not the size of future repayments but the short period into which they
were compressed.
Despite a rescheduling earlier this year, Russia faces repayments of more
than Dollars 20bn next year.
His comments confirm that there are mounting pressure on government finances
as companies struggle to pay taxes because of a massive accumulation of
inter-enterprise debts. The problem is so acute that the government has
failed to pay thousands of state employees, prompting unrest across the
country.
In Vladivostok yesterday, hundreds of women and children picketed the
headquarters of the Pacific fleet. Some claimed their families had received
no pay since April.
Mr Shokhin forecast that seasonal factors might push up inflation this
autumn to 10 per cent a month from the average of 4-5 per cent a month that
has recently been achieved. But economic plans being drawn up for next year
envisaged a budget deficit of 5 per cent and a monthly inflation rate of 3
per cent by the year-end, he said.
He also cautioned against the government running up potentially huge debts
through guaranteeing the promissory notes which are seen as a means of
alleviating Russia's inter-enterprise debt crisis. The reintroduction of
some price controls, he suggested, could lessen the problem, which has risen
to the top of the political agenda.
The government is drawing up six presidential decrees to generate more
domestic private investment. Mr Shokhin estimated that Russia had
Rbs30,000bn (Pounds 9bn) of private savings.
Mr Oleg Davydov, minister for foreign economic relations, suggested Russia
should seek partial debt forgiveness from foreign creditors, but was
publicly rebuked by Mr Shokhin.
Russian officials say former Soviet client states, which collectively owe
Russia Dollars 147bn, are paying only Dollars 2bn a year compared with their
annual obligations of Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7bn.
In an interview in Trud newspaper yesterday, Mr Boris Yeltsin said the
danger of Russian disintegration had passed, but called on Russia's regional
leaders to stimulate economic reform.
'Economic problems are being decided more and more. . . by how the political
leaders of a region can succeed in creating a business climate and
conditions for the stable and reliable development of a regional economy,'
he said.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Girls' schools graduate up A-level exam league table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Girls' schools have risen sharply in the A-level examination rankings of
independent schools published in today's Financial Times.
Schools believe that parents' choice of where they send their children is
being affected by the A-level league tables, now in their third year of
widespread publication.
Girls' boarding schools showed the strongest improvement, with Downe House,
near Newbury, Berkshire, rising to eighth place from an average over the
previous five years of 59th.
Other impressive performances by boarding schools came from Malvern Girls'
College (13th, up from an average of 42nd), Badminton (19th from 76th) and
Roedean (27th from 96th).
Girls' day schools also improved on last year. Five members of the Girls'
Public Day School Trust, a network of schools which aims to charge
relatively low fees, were in the top 50 - South Hampstead, Notting Hill &amp;
Ealing, Brighton &amp; Hove, Wimbledon and Oxford High Schools. The top girls'
school, for the second year running, was North London Collegiate, a
selective day school.
The results are likely to sustain the recent recovery in demand for
single-sex girls' education. Girls' schools had seemed to be under serious
threat during the 1980s when many boys' boarding schools, which usually have
greater resources, were going co-educational either completely or just in
the sixth form. At the end of last term Felixstowe College, a large girls'
boarding school in Suffolk, closed because of declining rolls.
Mr Declan O'Neill, development officer for Malvern Girls' College, said
publication of league tables had encouraged parents to look at his school.
In particular, many were concerned girls would perform better in the
sciences in a single-sex school.
In university entrance, boys outnumber girls by six to one on engineering
and technology courses and three to one in mathematics. However, Downe
House, Malvern and Roedean reported that maths had been their most popular
subject and girls had moved on to science degrees.
Mrs Ann Longley, headmistress of Roedean, said that competition from
boarding schools with mixed sixth forms had dwindled.

FT  27 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: MBOs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The buy-out of BP's nutrition interests for Dollars 550m is the latest
evidence that the UK management buy-out market is in good nick. Last year
the MBO market was quiet as buy-out specialists found they could not compete
with the valuations vendors could achieve by floating subsidiaries on the
stock market. But this year MBO business has perked up. Though most deals
have been much smaller than BP's, Prudential is working on a Pounds 700m
buy-out of National Car Parks. Dairy Crest also looks a likely candidate
following the postponement of its flotation.
The fall in equity markets, and more specifically the closing of the new
issue pipeline in May, clearly helped MBOs. Buy-outs have found it easier to
compete on price with flotations and sometimes have been a vendor's only
option. But the recent recovery in equity markets does not mean the MBO
business will go back to square one. For a start, after buying several
disappointing new issues in the spring, investors will be more choosy when
action picks up next month.
Moreover, two developments suggest that buy-out specialists will start
bidding higher prices. First, several large new buy-out funds have just
closed, which should increase the competition to win deals. Second, banks -
which are also flush with cash - may be prepared to finance buy-outs with
somewhat greater levels of gearing than have been the norm since leveraged
deals such as Magnet went sour in the early 1990s.

FT  27 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At first glance it is startling that the German equity market stands lower
than at the start of the year. In January the government's 1.5 per cent
growth forecast was regarded as optimistic. Growth of at least 2.5 per cent
this year is now taken for granted. This brighter outlook is already feeding
through into corporate earnings: half-year results this week from the big
German chemicals companies showed an impressive recovery. Loss-makers such
as Volkswagen and Lufthansa have moved back into the black ahead of time.
The mix of modest growth and restructuring is having a powerful effect.
While the earnings recovery has come sooner than expected, though, forecasts
of the next profits peak in 1996 or 1997 have not been changed. The practice
of valuing shares in this manner is especially strong in Germany - thanks to
the predominance of highly cyclical capital goods companies. On a multiple
of around 12 times 1997 forecast earnings it is difficult to argue that
German equities are cheap. The best that can be said is that forecasts which
looked extremely doubtful at the start of the year now have a greater degree
of certainty.
Despite the good news from the corporate sector, then, the tone will
continue to be set by bonds. The equity market's recovery through June and
July owed more to falling bond yields than optimism ahead of the results
season. Having discounted so much so far in advance, there is little reason
for equities to move higher.

FT  27 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Gold
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold is torn between its role as an investment and its position as a
commodity. The investment fundamentals are hardly positive. Rising US
interest rates have increased the cost of holding non-yielding assets. The
resurgence of inflation, which gold bugs predicted would be well established
by now, has notably failed to materialise. The weakness of the dollar has
made bullion a dismal investment for yen or D-Mark based investors.
Meanwhile the hedge funds which fuelled gold's rally to over Dollars 400 an
ounce last year appear to have turned sellers. Against this gloomy
background it is surprising that bullion has remained so steadfastly around
Dollars 380 through the usual summer lull.
The pull of the wider commodities cycle might explain gold's resilience. It
is certainly more difficult for gold to tumble while other metals are racing
ahead. Economic recovery should mean greater demand for rings and other
trinkets. The autumn will be important in this regard, as jewellers prepare
for Christmas. Industrial demand might also be expected to pick up in line
with the economic cycle.
But the suspicion remains that investors and speculators rather than
consumers will determine the final outcome. Another wave of selling by
central banks, for example, could tip the balance against gold. Having seen
bullion remain so stable during the summer doldrums, though, speculators
must be tempted to try driving the price back through Dollars 400. With
demand moving in their favour and inflation worries in the wings they may
just succeed.

FT  27 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Summer holiday mood
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equities have had an excellent summer. The FTSE-100 index has recovered
almost 400 points from the trough in June. Lower than hoped for inflation,
better than expected growth and the stabilisation of world bond markets have
all played their part. This week's rally has been spurred on by data
suggesting that the Federal Reserve's interest rate rises are having the
desired effect of preventing US inflation.
Those worried about UK inflation can find some backing in this week's CBI
survey, which showed a slight increase in the proportion of companies
expecting to raise prices. But inflationary signs are weak and the betting
remains that base rates will not go up until late in the year. The challenge
will be to manage the rise in such a way that consumer demand is damped, but
industrialists still have the confidence to step up investment.
A further worry for bears is that, while shares have shot ahead, bonds have
merely held their own. As a result, the ratio between yields on long gilts
and equities has risen from 2.1 to 2.3 since June. It is hard to see the
ratio rising much higher, but that does not mean equities must fall. The
ratio would also drop if gilts were to rally or dividends were to grow
faster than expected. Both are possible. With UK inflation low, gilts should
arguably trade on a narrower discount to German and US government bonds.
Meanwhile, August's batch of corporate results has boosted dividend
expectations. If this is sustained when the reporting season gets into full
swing next month, there could be a further rise in equities. The danger will
be if dividend hopes are dashed.

FT  27 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow surges on economic growth
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
After a session's pause, US stocks surged again yesterday as favourable
economic news propelled bonds and the dollar sharply higher, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 51.16 ahead at 3,881.05, led by
cyclical stocks emerging from their long summer slumber. It was the index's
best closing level since March 18.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 kept pace, ending 6.08 better
at 473.80. Advancing issues outnumbered declines on the Big Board by a
seven-to-three margin. Trading was brisk, with 305m shares exchanged by the
final bell.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 2.44 higher at
449.56, while the Nasdaq composite was up 8.18 at 764.03.
Stocks opened solidly higher thanks to a welcome piece of news from the
Commerce Department, which revised its estimate of second-quarter economic
growth to 3.8 per cent, from a preliminary reading of 3.7 per cent. With
analysts expecting a much stronger figure, Treasury prices jumped ahead and
the dollar vaulted well over the Y100 mark.
Amid all the excitement, a big rise in the University of Michigan's August
index of consumer confidence was virtually ignored by the
inflation-sensitive bond market, though profit-taking took its toll in the
afternoon.
By late morning, the bellwether blue-chip index had extended its gain to
more than 50 points, triggering the NYSE's restrictions on computer-guided
trading. Still, the 'collar' failed to force share prices into retreat.
The same stocks which led Wednesday's 70-point surge were at the forefront
yesterday. Deere, the farm equipment manufacturer, gained Dollars 3 to
Dollars 73, while Caterpillar was Dollars 3 3/4 higher at Dollars 115 5/8 .
Alcoa climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 81 1/8 , General Motors Dollars 1 3/8
to Dollars 51 3/4 and General Electric Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 50 3/4 .
But consumer non-durable issues were not to be excluded from the rally.
Procter &amp; Gamble forged Dollars 1 7/8 ahead to Dollars 59 3/4 while Philip
Morris added Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 58 1/2 . In retailing, Sears chipped
in with a Dollars 1 1/4 gain to Dollars 47 7/8 . JC Penney powered Dollars 2
ahead to Dollars 51 3/4 on comments by money managers that the stock was
unvalued.
The improved outlook for semiconductor stocks benefited the entire
technology sector. Motorola gained Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 55 3/8 and Texas
Instruments put on Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 82 3/4 .
On the Nasdaq, Sun Microsystems advanced Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 28 and
Wellfleet added Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 23 1/8 .
Chiron, the biotechnology concern, jumped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 67 1/2
after adopting a shareholder rights plan designed to deter an unfriendly
suitor.
Canada
Toronto followed other major world stock markets higher with share prices
rising sharply in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index jumped 47.43
points, or 1.11 per cent, to 4,304.43, with advances leading declines by 461
to 284. Over the week, the index gained about 107 points.
Volume stood at 59.38m shares, down from 61.53m on Thursday. Trading value
slipped to CDollars 794.8m from CDollars 884.5m.
Brazil
Sao Paulo dropped 2.6 per cent in heavy trade as investors staged a
profit-taking bout after prices rose by 24 per cent this month.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares ended down 1,403 at 52,143
points.
On the Rio de Janeiro bourse, the ISENN fell 2.1 per cent to 20,419 points.
Volume was high at 573.3m reais (Dollars 641.2m).

FT  27 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Istanbul tries to make up ground lost
by lira - John Murray-Brown on the return of confidence to the Turkish
market in the wake of currency jitters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY-BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After running out of steam in the first quarter, in the wake of the currency
jitters in January, Turkey's stock exchange shows signs of gaining a second
wind.
It is probably to early to claim the worst is past, but there is evidence of
confidence returning.
This week, in the latest indication of the firmer grip on the helm, the
authorities moved decisively to stem a possible run on the currency, while
the index held steady, after making good gains in local currency terms in
recent months.
The Istanbul composite index is up by more than 50 per cent in local
currency terms since early June. It closed yesterday 609, or 2.3 per cent,
higher at 26,251, compared with 16,807 on June 6.
However, with the lira losing close to 50 per cent against the dollar since
the start of the year, the picture is different for foreign investors. A
week ago, the IFC's Turkey index showed a fall in dollar terms of nearly 38
per cent this year.
The decline was 63.3 per cent early in June and there is a general
expectation that share prices in dollar terms will end the current year
lower than in 1993.
Nevertheless, the recent trend is up, and the exchange received a further
impetus yesterday, this time of a technological nature, as Turk Radyo ve
Televizyon TRT, the state run television company inaugurated its teletext
market coverage.
The innovation will give a big boost to the market and particularly to
retail investors who, in the absence of big Turkish institutions, still
account for the largest part of demand.
Coupled with planned moves to bring all share transactions to a screen based
system by mid-October, some brokers believe Istanbul is due for a further
rally.
The market is certainly due for a change of fortune. With the first signs of
the collapse of the currency in January, domestic demand dried up. The
market has since suffered from competition from high interest rates as the
government sought to finance the budget by domestic borrowing.
After Turkey's credit rating had been downgraded repeatedly, the decision to
turn to the International Monetary Fund was unavoidable.
Today some of the elements in the stabilisation package are falling into
place. Officials point to the drop in annual inflation, which slowed from
115 per cent in June to 109 per cent last month. As a result, companies say
they are better able to plan production schedules.
The monetary environment certainly looks more robust. Even after the hiccups
this week, the lira has stabilised at around the TL32,000 to the dollar
level, compared with more than TL42,000 in late April following the
announcement of a major stabilisation package. Interest rates on government
paper have eased to around 100 per cent a year, compared with rates of 400
per cent on the so-called 'super bond' issues in June.
At a p/e ratio of close to 11 on 1994 earnings, Kaya Didman of Baring
Securities in London says that the market is among the cheapest in the
world.
There are still some voices of caution. 'In investing, when you see everyone
running to the same side of the boat at once, there has to be some concern,'
says the head of research at one of Istanbul's largest brokers.
Economists expect the true picture will only be apparent after the Fund's
first review of progress on implementation of the standby agreement,
expected in the second week in November.
In recent weeks, the index has been pushed higher following some
surprisingly good half year corporate results.
In food and beverage sectors, companies such as Tat conserve, a fruit
processing operator and the beer concerns, have outperformed the market.
However the biggest surprises were in sectors like paper where both Kav
Orman, a match maker, and the cardboard manufacturer Tire Kutsan showed
healthy first half earnings, apparently taking advantage of stock build up
before the crisis.
Liquidity has traditionally been one of the market's major constraints.
However, brokers anticipate that turnover will increase with moves to
introduce on-screen trading.
In the first tranche of 50 stocks - chosen as the least traded companies -
volumes increased fourfold.
A similar expansion of liquidity is expected in early October when the
entire 162 traded stocks are incorporated into Elit, Istanbul's electronic
Elit system.
The broadcasting initiative, for the first time, will bring the market to
Turkey's rural areas where officials say there is considerable untapped
demand.
Moreover, if teletext is also available on TRT's international
transmissions, Turks in Germany and other European countries - who already
provide some USDollars 4bn to bolster the country's balance of payments -
may be persuaded to get the trading bug.

FT  27 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses spurred by revision of
US GDP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN and ROBERT VINCENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European bourses picked up strongly after news that the upward revision in
second quarter US GDP to 3.8 per cent, compared with an expected 4.2 per
cent, took the pressure off the Fed for a further move to tighter monetary
policy.
FRANKFURT staged a strong post-bourse rally, after an uncertain official
session. The Dax index picked up from a low of 2,140.34 to finish 9.33
higher at 2,161.54 for a 0.6 per cent rise on the week, before pushing
through resistance to an Ibis-indicated 2,188.22.
Volkswagen, in the doldrums earlier in the week after its chairman forecast
lower German car orders in the second half of the year, rebounded to close
DM10.50 higher at DM490.50 and DM493 in the post bourse.
Deutsche Bank also put in a strong performance, rising DM13.50 to DM726.
Shares in Viag showed little reaction to news of a rise in first-half
earnings, falling DM2.20 to DM492.50.
Hoechst profited from news the group planned to cut more than 1,000 jobs at
three plants near Frankfurt by the end of next year, rising DM5.10 on the
day to DM358.50 in the post-bourse, and compared with its floor close of
DM354.80.
PARIS took its cue from the US GDP figures and after a lacklustre
performance put on a sprint at the end of the day. The CAC 40 index advanced
36.22 or 1.8 per cent to 2062.75, for a rise on the week of 3 per cent.
Euro Disney caused some excitement when it was suspended for 15 minutes
after it shares fell by more than 10 per cent to below FFr9.30. The stock
closed down FFr 0.80 at FFr 9.50.
The decline was prompted by a Paribas sell note and reports that the bank's
leisure analyst had valued the share at FFr 1.60.
Accor jumped FFr 11 to FFr691 after it said that it had handed in a new bid
for part of Air France's stake in the Meridien hotels group. Its rival is
Forte of the UK.
Danone, unchanged at FFr 846, said after the close that its first half net
income slipped to FFr 1.68bn from FFr 1.82bn but added it was confident it
could reach targeted profit growth in the full year 1994.
AMSTERDAM was spurred by the US news in later trading with the AEX index
ending up 3.10 ahead at 420.83, an increase of 2 per cent on the week.
Earlier in the day the market had retreated as some investors took profits,
hitting a low of 416.11. The US figures, however, acted as a pick-me-up
lifting shares which for much of the week had benefited from some solid
company results.
Following the trend, ABN Amro reported strong first-half net profits which
took the shares Fl 0.50 higher to Fl 62.80.
Aegon, the Dutch insurer, which unveiled a sharp profits increase and
bullish forecast, saw its shares rise Fl 2.80 to Fl 104.60.
ZURICH put on 1.2 per cent although trading was largely confined to
professionals. The SMI index rose 30.2 to 2,581.3 for a 1 per cent rise on
the week.
The rising dollar added to positive market sentiment. Roche certificates,
SFr95 higher at SFr5,845, led the active list. Nestle rose SFr27 to SFr1,229
and UBS added SFr17 to SFr1,126.
Zurich Insurance, under pressure earlier this week, rose strongly with the
bearers up SFr20 to SFr1,249 and registered shares SFr28 higher at SFr1,252.
Bearers in SMH, the watchmaker, fell SFr37 to SFr718 amid news that Swiss
exports of plastic watches had fallen in the first six months of this year.
Swissair rose SFr28 to a new high for the year of SFr888 in response to
Thursday's news that the airline's load factor had reached a record high.
MILAN drifted higher amid growing optimism that the government would unite
behind a deficit cutting budget and present it ahead of schedule.
The Comit index rose 0.88 to 685.60, for a 3.7 per cent rise on the week as
the cabinet met for the first time after the summer recess and Mr Giancarlo
Pagliarini, the budget minister, said he expected the full 1995 budget to be
unveiled by mid-September, two weeks ahead of the end-of-month deadline.
Banks performed strongly amid rumours that the limit on share ownership for
the privatised companies would be lifted from 3 per cent. BCI ended L134
stronger at L3,798, IMI rose L384 to L10,586 and Credito Italiano put on
L107 to L2,209.
MADRID also staged a recovery at the end of a generally dull session. The
general index rose 2.4 to 310.54, wiping out earlier losses as a recovery
was seen in Spanish bond markets. The market rose 1.4 per cent over the
week.

FT  27 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei picks up from
early lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Activity was low on the last trading day for August settlements but the
Nikkei average edged ahead on buying by arbitrageurs and investment trusts,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index rose 28.20 to 20,471.49, leaving it 0.2 per cent down
on the week. This was after the market had hit a low of 20,416.28 in the
morning session, and a high of 20,554.31 in the afternoon.
The index, after going lower, gained ground on buying by arbitrageurs and an
investment trust set up by Daiwa Securities. But profit-taking around the
day's high eroded most of the gains.
Volume totaled 233m shares, against 247m. Traders noted buying supported
from public funds around the 20,500 level, but most investors remained
inactive.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 1.92 to 1,635.69 while the
Nikkei 300 edged up 0.33 to 297.61. Gainers led losers by 498 to 437 and 221
issues were unchanged.
In London, the Nikkei/ISE index 50 index rose 4.56 to 1,327.50.
Stocks which moved significantly were limited to telecommunications, or
traded by foreigners, and issues cross-traded by corporations realising
profits on share holdings by selling and buying back stocks.
Overseas investors traded steel and construction stocks. Nippon Steel, the
most active issue of the day, rose Y1 to Y370 and Sumitomo Metal Industries
added Y9 to Y339.
Minebea, the ball bearings company, gained Y70 to Y875. It lost ground on
Thursday on reports that it planned to sell its finance affiliate to GE
Capital, the finance arm of the US electronics group.
DDI, the telecommunications operator on the second section, rose Y10,000 to
Y991,000 following the auction of for shares of Japan Telecom shares.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 13.33 to 22,835.21 in volume of 50.1m shares.
Roundup
HONG KONG closed with strong gains as property-related shares boosted
sentiment across the board. The Hang Seng Index climbed 62.97 points to
9,399.08, little changed on the week.
Strong overseas demand took the market almost 100 points higher during the
late afternoon with buying focused on property-related issues in response to
better than expected half year earnings figures from Cheung Kong and
Hutchison which came late on Thursday .
Cheung Kong rose 50 cents to HKDollars 36.50 and Hutchison gained 30 cents
to HKDollars 35.80.
Brokers said China-linked H-shares were boosted by expectations of strong
results and the H-share index rose 46.11 or 3.8 per cent to 1,269.79.
BANGKOK closed higher on late buying of building material with the SET index
6.03 up at 1,450.75, but still 2.5 per cent lower on the week. Turnover
totalled Bt13.9bn.
The finance sector was a loser, however, falling 1.9 per cent as Finance
One, which topped the active list, tumbled Bt30 to Bt462.
The building material sector gained 3.5 per cent with Siam Cement jumping
Bt84 to Bt1,360.
SINGAPORE was firm on demand for blue chips but Malaysian shares traded over
the counter fell in spite of a late round of buying.
The Straits Times Industrials index closed 6.30 up at 2,293.51 for a 1.6 per
cent rise on the week.
KUALA LUMPUR closed sharply lower after rumours had sparked profit-taking
which then gained momentum.
The KLSE composite index fell 24.36 or 2.1 per cent, to close at 1,111.78, a
rise of 2.6 per cent on the week.
Analysts said the fall had been expected because there had been no solid
reason why the market had risen so high.
SEOUL closed broadly higher in moderate trading but many blue chips fell on
profit-taking. The composite index closed 5.97 higher at 951.38.
TAIPEI was lifted by last minute buying, which took the weighted index 23.09
ahead to 6,881.10, for a rise of 1.7 per cent on the week. Turnover,
however, slumped to TDollars 58.42bn from Thursday's TDollars 90bn.

FT  27 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: US economic data fuel upsurge in UK
equities - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stockmarket rounded off a week of big gains with a flourish, as
international bonds surged higher in the wake of a much
smaller-than-expected upward revision of US gross domestic product in the
second quarter.
The news was widely interpreted in international markets as diminishing the
chances of another increase in US interest rates, and triggered big gains in
US bonds which in turn unleashed a burst of buying on Wall Street. The Dow
Jones Average was up more than 50 points up shortly after London closed for
business.
The FT-SE 100 Index, which burst through the 3,200 level mid-week after
numerous abortive attempts recently, ended the day 30.9 higher at 3,265.1,
its highest closing level since mid-March and a rise of 70.7, or 2.2 per
cent on the week. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which has tended to lag behind
the senior index recently, in spite of the inclusion of many of the regional
electricity stocks, underperformed again, posting a gain of only 17.6 at
3,807.0. Over the week the latter index has gained 53.1, or 1.4 per cent.
The burst of buying interest in London during the afternoon was in marked
contrast to that of the morning session, when share prices were marked down
and subsequently drifted easier in the wake of the latest monthly survey of
distributive trades by the Confederation of British Industry. The survey
suggested that UK interest rates would reach 6.25 per cent by the middle of
1995 and highlighted increasing upward pressures on prices of manufactured
goods.
Worries about the inflationary impact and the interest rate forecast from
the survey saw the FT-SE 100 down 15.9 at the day's low point, but the index
never looked like challenging the 3,200 level. A poor early showing by bonds
markets also proved a drag on share prices.
The picture began to change in mid-morning when dealers reported two
substantial buy programmes in the equity market, one said to have been
carried out by Hoare Govett and the other by James Capel. These uncovered a
number of short positions among the marketmakers who lifted prices in an
attempt to encourage sellers. Very little stock came into the market,
however. By midday, the 100 index was in positive territory and starting to
accelerate, when the US GDP news was made known.
The 0.1 per cent upward revision in US GDP to 3.8 per cent, against market
forecasts in excess of 4 per cent, transformed sentiment across the globe
and was the second piece of good news from the US this week. On Wednesday,
US durable goods orders in July were shown as falling 4.5 per cent, against
expectations of a small rise, indicating a marked slowing in the US economy.
With the FT-SE future being chased sharply higher and eventually closing
with a 16-point premium to fair value, the cash market leapt ahead as
marketmakers began to bid aggressively for stock. Dealers expect another
surge of buying in London next week from institutions that have missed the
recent sharp upward in share prices. 'We could be looking at 3,400 in very
short order,' said one leading marketmaker.
One disappointing element of the market's rise was the relatively low level
of turnover. The day's volume came out at 584.9m shares, a far cry from
Thursday's 843.5m, and Wednesday's 701.6m. The value of customer business on
Thursday was at just under Pounds 2bn, the highest for many weeks.
Insurances were again heavily bought, with analysts still pointing to the
sector's underperformance. Telecoms were also in demand. The regional
electricity stocks continued to post big gains and are expected to continue
to respond to domestic and overseas buying interest - which many expect to
lift prices to a sector average of 950p.

FT  27 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The release of revised second quarter US GDP data boosted derivatives,
sending stock index futures sharply forward to trade at a healthy premium.
At the close, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 stood at 3,287, up 44
on its previous close and about 19 points above its fair value premium to
cash of about 6 points. Volume was 13,332 contracts.
Turnover in traded options failed to match Thursday's high figure and closed
at 34,796 lots. The stock options were particularly busy with Guinness, and
NatWest trading over 3,000 contracts each.

Turnover in leisure company Granada Group soared to 9.7m and the shares
added 6 to 505p, after several brokers recommended the stock. The list
included UBS, Smith New Court and Kleinwort Benson and Henderson
Crosthwaite.
Mr Paul Slattery at Kleinwort was sceptical about recent speculation
suggesting Granada had its eyes on contract caterer Gardner Merchant. The
talk is said to have held back the stock in recent sessions. He said: 'It is
unlikely the company would give such an indication, as it would make such a
deal more expensive.' He urged investors to buy the stock, saying 'the
shares are now on a favourable multiple to the market'.
Smith New Court also recommended Rank Organisation where the shares advanced
13 to 426p after good business of 6.4m shares.
Daily Mail Group fell sharply in the A shares after the newspaper hit the
London news stands priced at 20p instead of 32p. There was an assumption
that the mid-market tabloid had been sucked into the newspaper price war.
The group announced that the quoted price was the result of an 'operator
error', but the shares closed 10 lower at 1020p.
United Newspapers fell 5 to 548p as bearish NatWest Securities repeated its
negative stance following the move by News International to tighten the
screws in the current price war. News International, which owns the Times
and Sun, raised advertising rates partly offsetting its recent price cut.
Generator Scottish Hydro gained 20 to 427p following a recommendation from
Panmure Gordon, which said the shares had lagged stablemate Scottish Power,
up 11 at 438p.
Food retailer Kwik Save gave up 6 to 643p after Hoare Govett advised
investors to sell the stock. However, speculation that it might buy the
Lo-Cost retail chain from Argyll Group continued to power the latter. The
shares finished 11 1/2 better at 315p.
Brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle moved against the market trend finishing 2 lower
at 529p.
Pollution control group Waste Management lifted 26 to 619p following a
successful presentation by the company to analysts.
Glaxo was restrained by US profit taking in early trading, but turned around
in the afternoon to close 4 up at 658p.
Debt-laden engineering company BM Group cheered the market with the Pounds
17m sale of Benford, its construction equipment subsidiary. The shares
jumped 6 to 50p.
Industrial group Charter continued to bask in the glow of its improved bid
for Esab, the Swedish welding equipment group. The shares gained another 15
to 836p.
High street clearing banks responded to encouraging lending figures. The
British Bankers' Association said gross mortgage lending announced by rose
to Pounds 1.81bn in July from Pounds 1.75bn in June.
Lloyds rose 10 to 559p, NatWest 12 to 501p and Barclays 8 to 587p.
Building and construction stocks responded to fading interest rate worries
and indications of good results to come.
Strongest was Barratt, due to report on September 21, which rose 9 to 191p.
Mr Scott Fulton at Smith New Court said the group was likely to see strong
growth over the next two to three years, levelling out afterwards unless
prices moved up.
Other analysts felt the good performance was simply a catch-up after recent
weakness.
Andrews Sykes was up 10 to 78p, with Bellwinch up 2 to 44 and Wimpey closing
up 4 at 164p. Building materials companies had a good day, with Caradon the
strongest performer, rising 11 to 315p on reasonable volume of 2.9m.
Analysts were divided about Caradon's fundamental values - doubts still
exist over the performance of its Pillar subsidiary and the margin squeeze
at its US cheque printing operation - but the market is looking for a
further rise of between 10 and 18 pence.
Tarmac, up 3 to 156p was another high volume trader reaching 5.1m after
heavy trading from the US.
Blue Circle was up 2 1/2 at 309 1/2p and Redland, a strong performer
yesterday, was up a further 8 at 545p.

FT  27 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Euro Disney sold
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Leisure group Euro Disney retreated in London as dealers reacted to a brief
suspension of the stock in Paris after the shares lost more than 10 per cent
of their value on a broker's negative comments.
The 15-minute suspension, a common practise in Paris when any stock falls by
more than 10 per cent, was prompted by reports that London-based Paribas
analyst Mr Nigel Reed had not only advised investors to sell the shares but
valued the stock at just FFr1.60 a share - they were suspended at FFr9.30.
Mr Reed was reported as saying: 'I value the shares at a very low level.'
The analyst, a known bear of the stock, was also said to have increased his
current year estimate of losses at the group to FFr1.62bn from FFr1.2bn.
The shares in London were down 10 at the day's worst, but steadied towards
the close to finish 9 down at 117p.

FT  27 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Stake sale hope lifts telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Enthusiasm for cellular telephone stocks spilled over to Securicor and its
subsidiary Security Services. Some in the market became convinced that
Securicor would sell its 40 per cent stake in Cellnet to majority
stakeholder BT sooner rather than later.
Mobile phone take-up has escalated this year and the arrival of Mercury
one-2-one, the Cable &amp; Wireless subsidiary, and Hutchison's Orange have only
served to stimulate demand.
An industry lunch with analysts focused attention on Cellnet and the
potential boost to the Securicor share price following a stake sale. Some
specialists say the shares could hit 1400p. The tightly traded A shares
consequently rose 54 to 984p with relatively heavy turnover of 1m.
Meanwhile, C&amp;W improved 9 to 478p as speculation returned that its Hong Kong
telecom arm was poised to win the principal telephone contract in China.
Also, some specialists returned to the sum-of-the-parts argument which sees
the Hong Kong stake as being worth around 400p to 420p a share. This would
mean that the remaining businesses were sorely undervalued. BT shares firmed
a penny to 390 1/2 p.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Dollar recovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar rose sharply yesterday on the foreign exchanges after the US
second quarter GDP report prompted a recovery in the US bond market, writes
Philip Gawith.
Second quarter GDP was revised up by only 0.1 of a percentage point, to 3.8
per cent, and the market took this to mean that tighter US monetary policy
was less likely.
The dollar later gained further momentum from rumours that Mr George Soros,
the US investor, was selling yen for dollars. There were also reports of
very active buying of dollars by the Singapore government, apparently
unrelated to the GDP figures.
The dollar's recovery took the market by surprise, coming against the
backdrop of thin trading conditions ahead of a long weekend in the UK. It
finished in London at DM1.5615, and was later trading at DM1.5750 in New
York, compared to Thursday's London close of DM1.5462.
It also breached the Y100 barrier, to close at Y100.285, up from a low of
Y99.05.
In Europe, the escudo prospered despite a half percentage point cut in the
emergency lending rate to 12 per cent. It closed unchanged at Es102.2.
The sterling index finished unchanged at 78.9, as the pound made up against
the D-Mark what it lost against the dollar.
The short sterling market responded calmly to the August Confederation of
British Industry survey, despite an increase in the balance of respondents
expecting to increase prices. The December contract traded 20,221 lots to US
close at 93.38, up from 93.36.
Mr Brian Durrant, economist at brokers GNI said the market appeared to have
'recovered some of its composure. Certainly the market has put up a braver
face than it did earlier this month when it was undermined by interest hikes
in Italy and Sweden.'
At the weekly Treasury bill tender, the top accepted rate of discount rose
to 5.35 per cent from 5.25 per cent last week.
In its daily money market operations, the Bank of England cleared a Pounds
550m shortage at established rates.
Analysts were sceptical about how long the dollar rally would last. Mr
Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in London, commented: 'I
think the dollar will quickly run up against a brick-wall. If the bond
market is fuel for the dollar, it will run out pretty soon.' He said it was
doubtful whether the US bond market could recover much from current levels
and this would cap the dollar.
Mr Michael Gallagher, director of IDEA, the financial markets consultancy,
said rumours of Mr Soros turning positive on the dollar had encouraged the
market to think that short-term, speculative funds might be buying the
dollar again.
Concerted buying by a well-known US hedge fund, and determined intervention
by the Bank of Japan are two factors which account for the dollar's solid
performance against the yen, despite the potentially destabilising influence
of trade talks.
The consensus is swinging increasingly towards the view that some sort of
US-Japan trade deal will be sorted out by the end of September.
But dollar sceptics argue that this will still leave unattended the trade
balance between the two countries. Recent data suggest it is still growing
in Japan's favour.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): New York buying lifts
coffee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong opening at New York's Coffee, Cocoa and Sugar Exchange helped to
lift the London coffee futures market out of its pre-holiday lethargy
yesterday.
The November delivery position at the London Commodity Exchange leapt more
than Dollars 130 in the afternoon as the transatlantic rise was fuelled by
roaster buying. At the close it stood at Dollars 3,710 a tonne, up Dollars
157 on the day and Dollars 394 on the week. In late trading the New York
December position was up 13.45 cents on the day at Dollars 2.11 1/4 a pound.
A strong rally that added Dollars 257 to the LCE November price on Monday
and Tuesday had petered out in mid-week as continuing speculator and trade
buying was matched by technical selling and some trade liquidation. But
concern over the dry weather persisting in Brazilian growing regions
prevented the sellers from getting the upper hand.
Selling was also discouraged by the publication on Thursday of German
statistics agency FO Licht's latest assessment of the Brazilian crop
situation. It cut its estimate of the 1995-96 crop, flowering for which was
damaged by severe frosts in June and July, by 8.5m bags (60kg each) at 18m.
New York traders attributed yesterday's dramatic rise to heavy investment
fund and speculative buying as stop-loss buying orders were triggered by the
December position's move above the 199.5-cent mark.
'There is clearly technical money coming into the market,' one told the
Reuters news agency. But he cited fundamental justification for the rise.
'Why were we able to get to the stops?' he asked. 'Because there is
increasing concern that the coffee trees in Brazil need rain now, not a
month from now.'
Another trader told Reuters that there appeared to be some short-covering in
the market and suggested that more stop-loss buying might be triggered above
210 cents.
Coffee's sudden break-out helped cocoa prices to end a lacklustre week on a
more constructive note. 'There appears to be some sympathetic buying from
coffee,' one New York trader said as the CSCE December position rose Dollars
21 to Dollars 1,432 a tonne in late trading yesterday.
News that the main crop in Bahia, Brazil's main cocoa-producing state had
been helped by favourable weather during the flowering period but was likely
to suffer losses from Witch's Broom disease was largely discounted, he
added.
The LCE's November futures position gained Pounds 25 yesterday at Pounds
1,059 a tonne, but that was still Pounds 15 down on the week.
At the London Metal Exchange most base metals contracts yesterday
surrendered some of the gains they had registered earlier in the week as
traders squared their books ahead of the long weekend.
The exception was copper, which closed at Dollars 2,427.50 a tonne, up
Dollars 13.50 on the day and Dollars 20 on the week, for three months
delivery and then moved on to Dollars 2,445 in after hours trading.
As with coffee, the buying began in New York and in thin conditions. It was
later fed by speculative buying, Chinese interest, short- covering and
stop-loss orders.
'There's no news,' one London dealer told Reuters. 'It looks like the aim of
the initial push was to flush out the shorts and hit stops. . . The market
is also anticipating (a rise in) fourth quarter demand.'
