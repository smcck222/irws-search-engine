Four Slovaks were yesterday caught smuggling 750g of uranium 235 into
Hungary. Officials from the Slovak interior ministry declined to say whether
the uranium was capable of making a bomb. Since May, the German authorities
have made five seizures of radioactive material, much of it believed to
originate in the former Soviet Union. The seizures have prompted fears that
criminals are taking advantage of lax security at installations in the
former Soviet Union to smuggle out dangerous nuclear material. This is the
third time Slovak police have seized illegal radioactive material in
Slovakia since the fall of communism in 1989. Russia's Interfax news agency
reported earlier this month that police had arrested thieves in the city of
Glazov trying to dispose of 100kg of low-grade uranium - the biggest cache
of radioactive material in the recent spate of smuggling cases.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Euro-MPs back drift nets ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The European Parliament voted yesterday to ban fishing with drift nets in
European waters from next January, only hours after EU fisheries ministers
failed to agree on a phased-in ban by the end of 1997. Drift nets are long
walls of mesh which are highly effective, but which the European Commission
insists cause ecological damage by entrapping species indiscriminately. They
were at the centre of this summer's skirmishes in the Bay of Biscay between
the northern Spanish and French fleets, which Spanish fishermen warned
before Wednesday's ministerial meeting could turn violent. The French fleet
uses drift nets to catch tuna at less cost than the Spaniards, who use the
line and live-bait system, while Spain is the main market for the catch.
Spain and the Commission won little support for their position, and new
scientific data on the effect of drift nets is due to be considered in
December. Yesterday's parliament vote, however, gives a political boost to
efforts to ban drift nets, although member states can disregard Strasbourg's
views.

<TEXT>
The French government is heading for a clash with the European Commission
over its refusal to allow Lauda Air flights from Vienna and Salzburg to land
at Paris's Orly airport. The action disregards one of the key conditions
which accompanied the commission's decision in July to allow the French
government to grant FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) of state aid to Air France, the
nation's bankrupt airline. The conditions clearly stated that in return for
the injection of state funds, Orly airport must be opened to competing
airlines. Mr Nicky Lauda yesterday met senior European commission officials
to complain about the French rejection of the private airline's flight
plans. Lauda Air already has the landing slots required to fly its routes
into the Paris airport. British Airways and British Midland were only
recently granted access to Orly airport after a protracted battle with the
French authorities.

Mr Ingvar Carlsson, Sweden's prime minister-elect, yesterday appointed Mr
Goran Persson as finance minister in the new Social Democratic government,
due to take office next week after this month's general election. Mr
Persson, 45, shadow finance minister since last year, is expected to
introduce tax rises and spending cuts to tackle Sweden's record budget
deficit and a state debt soon to exceed 100 per cent of GNP. Mr Persson has
a reputation as a tough administrator and financial markets hope he will be
strong enough to resist left-wing opposition to spending cuts. Mr Carlsson
also announced the appointment of Ms Mona Salin, the party secretary, as
deputy prime minister. Ms Lena Hjelm-Wallen, a former education and foreign
aid minister, was made foreign minister with the task of leading Sweden into
the European Union if membership is approved in a referendum in November. Mr
Thage Peterson was appointed defence minister.

The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development is to make a Dollars 35m
(Pounds 22m) equity investment in Tokobank, providing Russia's fourth
largest commercial bank with additional capital to service corporate
clients. The EBRD, which will gain 14 per cent of Tokobank's common voting
stock and gain a seat on its council, claims this will be the first
large-scale equity investment by an international financial institution in
the Russian banking sector.
Mr Victor Yakunin, Tokobank's president, said the EBRD's investment would
help it expand its products and markets, especially for long-term credits
needed for project financing. Tokobank was founded as a joint stock company
in 1991 and has built up a network of 16 branches. The bank has 400
corporate shareholders and provides banking services to large and
medium-sized enterprises, mainly in the energy sector. As of September 1994,
Tokobank had total assets of Dollars 1bn and common share capital of Dollars
250m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Privatisations have driven up the number of private shareholders in France
by more than one quarter in the last two years, an official survey showed
yesterday. The number of shareholders rose from 4.5m in 1992 to 5.7m in
1994, of which 4.6m held shares in at least one of three companies sold-off
in the most recent wave of state privatisation, Banque Nationale de Paris,
Rhone Poulenc and Elf. French privatisations have particularly appealed to
the younger generation, and a less elite and male-dominated group, said the
survey, which was sponsored by COB, the operator and regulator of the French
stock market, and the Bank of France. The survey also found that while a
quarter of shareholders come from the Paris region, nearly 18 per cent are
from rural areas and more than 13 per cent are farmers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Norway's unemployment rate in September fell to 4.8 per cent of the
workforce compared with 5.6 per cent the month before, the Norwegian Labour
Directorate said yesterday. The decline was in line with market expectations
because state employment schemes and job training programmes, which remove
the jobless from unemployment statistics, start in September. In Italy, the
unemployment rate reached 11 per cent in July, up from 10.3 per cent in July
1993.
West German engineering and plant construction orders were 16 per cent
higher in real terms in August against August 1993. In the June to August
period orders were 18 per cent above the same 1993 period.
New business registrations in eastern Germany totalled 13,630 in July, down
7.9 per cent from a year earlier. In the first seven months of the year,
103,747 businesses registered in eastern Germany, a 9.7 per cent decline
from the same period last year.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Spain to curtail budget deficit: Solbes proposals criticised
for failing to attack public spending more severely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Pedro Solbes, Spain's economy and finance minister, yesterday presented
to parliament what the government calls the most restrictive fiscal plan of
the past decade. Public spending will grow by 3.4 per cent next year, just
below the forecast inflation figure of 3.5 per cent.
The budget expects a rise in government revenue of 7.1 per cent and plans to
lower the deficit from an estimated 6.7 per cent this year to 5.9 per cent
next year.
Although prime minister Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist government lacks a
majority in parliament, the budget will be passed with backing from the
Catalan nationalist party. It is understood that the more restrictive
features of the budget, as well a reduction in the social security
contributions made by employers, were introduced by the right of centre
Catalan party in its negotiations with Mr Solbes.
Mr Solbes said the budget had been drafted 'in the context of clear economic
recovery' and that GDP would grow by 1.7 per cent this year against an
initial forecast of 1.3 per cent. The 1995 budget is based on growth next
year of 2.8 per cent.
The chief feature of next year's growth, according to the economy ministry's
projections, is that it will be led by strong recovery of private
consumption in part due to the first net creation of jobs since 1991.
Private sector demand is forecast to contribute 2.5 per to the growth rate
against 0.1 per cent this year.
Mr Solbes hopes that between 175,000 and 220,000 jobs will be created next
year although Spain's high unemployment - currently just over 24 per cent of
the working population - will only come down marginally because of new
entrants into the labour market.
Conservative critics of the budget say that the government has failed to use
the economic upswing to cut back more severely on the structural component
of the public deficit. Mr Solbes claims that he has stemmed former
spiralling deficits and that he has begun to make inroads on fixed
expenditure: the structural component of this year's 6.7 per cent public
deficit represents 4.2 per cent of the total and it will represent 3.6 per
cent in next year's planned 5.9 per cent deficit according to Mr Solbes.
There are also doubts about whether the government will be able to meet its
3.5 per cent inflation target next year in the light of a 1 per cent
increase in value added tax built into the 1995 budget and increased private
sector consumption. Mr Solbes had planned on a 3.5 per cent inflation rise
at the end of this year but he said yesterday the year end figure would be
'in the region of 4 per cent'.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Nato pledges tougher use of air power in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Nato defence ministers pledged yesterday to make more effective use of
alliance airpower in the skies over Bosnia.
But they also agreed, at the insistence of Nato's European members, that the
UN must retain its veto over any hardening of tactics by the Atlantic
alliance.
An informal meeting of Nato defence ministers, attended for the first time
since 1966 by France, heard calls from Mr William Perry, US defence
secretary, for much tougher action against Bosnian Serbs.
He told his colleagues Nato's political credibility had been damaged by the
fact that five aircraft were apparently needed to destroy one tank near
Sarajevo last week.
In a spirited exchange, the European allies agreed there was room for some
stiffening of Nato's stance but insisted that British and French generals on
the ground should retain the last word.
Diplomats said France showed slightly more sympathy than Britain for the US
position that an immediate toughening of tactics was necessary.
Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, said the use of airpower
so far had been more symbolic than substantial and said Nato could 'go a bit
further'. He called for a more vigorous response to 'unacceptable behaviour'
such as firing on UN aid convoys or relief flights.
Mr Leotard said he was sure Bosnian Serb behaviour in recent weeks reflected
a systematic strategy to reimpose their grip on Sarajevo, rather than
unrelated incidents. But Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence minister, said it
was still an open question whether recent violence amounted to a conscious
strategy.
While Britain and France both stressed the need to consult UN commanders on
the ground, diplomats said, Mr Rifkind put more emphasis on this than his
French colleague.
Supporters of the Bosnian government have been complaining that Nato's air
raids so far have been little more than pinpricks.
Senior officials in Russia's arms exporting enterprise have criticised the
US for 'discrediting' Russian weapons in international arms markets and
forecast a continuing rise in arms sales, writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
At the same time, a foreign office official told the news agency Interfax
there was 'no reason to break military relations with Iran'.
The comments came after Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton disagreed
on arms sales to Iran.

The government also planned fresh initiatives to strengthen the legal system
in the country giving citizens greater means of redress against the
intrusions of the state and companies.
Mr Yakovlev described Russia as 'a democracy without rights' and suggested
there would be a review of the criminal code.
Mr Yakovlev also confirmed the government's intention to introduce greater
competition into the economy, especially in the banking sector, by means of
more effective regulation.
Mr Yeltsin has won much praise in the press for his performance in the US,
but the newspapers have also been full of accounts of swirling political
intrigues between his advisers back in Moscow.
In an interview with the Interfax news agency, Mr Kostikov said: 'Will he
(Yeltsin) remain the democratic-minded president we knew in 1991 and 1993 or
will opportunist ways make themselves felt in his political conduct? In
other words, will he be faced with the dilemma: power at all costs or power
for the sake of reforms and democracy?' he said.
Yet Mr Kostikov's position is itself uncertain given that - unusually - he
has remained in Moscow while Mr Yeltsin is travelling abroad. Rumours abound
that the president is planning a wholesale reshuffle of his closest
advisers.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Meciar fights for sporting chance in poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRATISLAVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
True to his sporting instincts, Mr Vladimir Meciar, Slovakia's former and,
he hopes, future prime minister, likes to introduce his party's candidates
for this weekend's general election as 'a new team for Slovakia'.
But the game is far from won and Mr Meciar's fortunes have waxed and waned.
After he was ousted as premier in March amid allegations of corruption in
the privatisation process and economic mismanagement, sup-port for him and
his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), shot up to nearly 40 per cent
in sympathy.
But since campaigning began earlier this month for Slovakia's first general
election since it split from the Czech Republic, no opinion poll has given
the HZDS more than 30 per cent, and its support now hovers around 25 per
cent.
Unless the party wins at least 30 per cent of seats in the new parliament,
Mr Meciar is unlikely to win back the job of prime minister.
Many voters have been alienated by Mr Meciar's repeated attacks on President
Michal Kovac, whose criticisms of his leadership style led to the former
prime minister's ousting, and on Slovakia's Hungarian minority, which he has
accused of being too powerful. Slovakia's three ethnic Hungarian parties
currently support the present coalition government headed by prime minister
Jozef Moravcik.
The outcome depends on the 20 per cent of voters who claim to be undecided.
Though he still insists HZDS will reach its target, Mr Meciar seems to be
fighting a losing battle to convince those voters to back him.
Floating voters could opt for the Democratic Left party (SDL) of reformed
communists, which dominates the Common Choice grouping with 20 per cent of
voter support.
As an influential member of the present government, the SDL has transformed
its image from old-style communist to progressive social democrat.
The SDL is considered almost certain to be a member of the next government
because tensions in the party over this transformation could swing it either
into the HZDS camp or towards a government similar to the outgoing
coalition.
But if it chooses to support an HZDS-led government, senior members of the
party, including Ms Brigita Schmognerova, have threatened to quit. 'A
coalition requires co-operation, and HZDS does not seem able to co-operate
with anybody,' Ms Schmognerova says. 'They cannot be part of a stable
government.'
The campaign has been dominated by Mr Meciar's personality and differing
approaches to privatisation. In the last days of his previous administration
Mr Meciar approved over 40 secret deals to sell state companies to their
managers at give-away prices.
Mr Moravcik's government reversed 25 of them after taking office and
restarted voucher privatisation, the system popular in the Czech Republic
which Mr Moravcik hopes will work similar miracles in Slovakia. Vouchers
went on sale before the poll campaign kicked off and so far 700,000 people
have bought coupons they can exchange for shares in state companies.
Mr Moravcik is also hoping an improved economic outlook will rebound to his
advantage. Growth in the first half of this year is a healthy 4.4 per cent
after four years of decline, and both inflation and unemployment have
stabilised, though they remain high. Foreign investors are waiting in the
wings for signs of stability.
The parties in the outgoing government accept privatisation as the basis of
stability. Mr Meciar does not. He has said he will scrap the voucher
programme and begin selling state companies to management again if he is
prime minister. Some 700,000 Slovaks might not like to hear that.

<TEXT>
The Hungarian government yesterday banned the sale of paprika in the country
and ordered all retailers and wholesalers to make their paprika stocks
available for inspection. The move follows widespread contamination with
lead oxide of the tangy spice Hungarians use to flavour and colour their
food.
The ban is expected to last for 7-10 days, the government said. More than 40
people have had hospital treatment for poisoning.
The police believe some vendors have been using red pigment containing high
quantities of lead oxide to enhance the colour of low quality paprika or
paprika substitutes. The police said yesterday they were holding 18 people
in connection with the case.
Ms Erzsebet Schreiber, deputy head of the food product department at the
national quality control institute said: 'This is the worst case of food
contamination we know of in Hungary.
'The paint has been mixed with poor quality paprika or other paprika
substitutes and sold as the real thing,' she said. Traces of the toxic
substance had been found in around 15 per cent of paprika sold in unsealed,
unmarked containers which the institute has tested. Hungary produces about
10,000 tonnes a year of paprika, which is made from dried red peppers.
Around 55 per cent is exported, accounting for up to 6 per cent of world
production. The government stressed that toxic substances had not been found
in foods due for export.
Mr Zoltan Bertha, head of the red pepper growers association, blamed the
paprika poisoning on 'adventurers' who entered the industry in the hope of
quick profits after the state monopoly was dismantled in 1991.
Vendors fear the bad publicity from the poisoning would affect sales and
exports for years to come. 'I sell mainly to tourists,' one vendor said,
pointing to a basket of fancily packaged paprika costing Ft2,200 (Pounds
12.90) per kilo. 'This scandal could hurt our national image. Paprika is our
symbol. It's like hamburgers to Americans and what would America be if
hamburgers were not on sale?'

FT  30 SEP 94 / Nato pledges tougher Bosnia line

<TEXT>
Nato defence ministers pledged yesterday to make the use of alliance
airpower in the skies over Bosnia more effective.
But they also agreed, at the insistence of Nato's European members, that the
UN must retain its veto over any hardening of tactics by the Atlantic
alliance.
An informal meeting of Nato defence ministers, attended for the first time
since 1966 by France, heard calls from Mr William Perry, the US defence
secretary, for much tougher action against the Bosnian Serbs.
He told his colleagues that Nato's political credibility had been damaged by
the fact that in an air raid near Sarajevo last week five aircraft were
apparently needed to destroy one tank.
In a spirited exchange, the European allies agreed that there was room for
some stiffening of Nato's stance but they insisted that British and French
generals on the ground should retain the last word.
Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, said the use of airpower
so far had been more symbolic than substantial
and said Nato could 'go a bit further'.
Mr Leotard called for a more vigorous response to 'unacceptable behaviour'
such as firing on UN aid convoys or relief flights.
Apart from intensified use of airpower, he said, there was room for the UN
to adopt tougher procedures on the ground such as, opening fire when
humanitarian convoys are attacked.
Yesterday's meeting took place in the shadow of widespread complaints from
supporters of the Bosnian government that Nato's air raids so far have been
little more than pinpricks.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence minister, insisted strongly on the need
for the UN to be involved in the process of defining what a 'robust
response' to provocations in Sarajevo would mean in practice.
But he acknowledged the force of US complaints about damage to Nato's
credibility. 'If you use airpower at all, it has to be effective,' he said.
Senior officials in Russia's arms exporting enterprise have criticised the
US for 'discrediting' Russian weapons in international arms markets and
forecast a continuing rise in arms sales. At the same time, a foreign office
official told the news agency Interfax that there was 'no reason to break
military relations with Iran', writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
The comments came while Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton disagreed
on arms sales to Iran. Mr Clinton attempted to persuade the Russian leader
to stop arms deliveries to a country the US sees as a supporter of
terrorism, but Mr Yeltsin made no commitment.

FT  30 SEP 94 / How do you say federalism in Castilian?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spain has been taking a searching look at itself this week and its many and
varied parts have decided it is time to move a bit further apart.
The push for what could prompt a first amendment to Spain's 1978
constitution follows a three-day debate in the senate. It underlined the
complexity of a country that is multi-lingual, multi-cultural and, as some
would have it, multi-national.
At an immediate level the cleavages in the Spanish state are expressed
linguistically; five of the 16 autonomous community presidents at the debate
(there are 17 such areas, but the Basques stayed away) delivered their
speeches in languages other than Spanish, or, as Spaniards say, languages
other than Castilian.
The spectacle of senior Spanish politicians avoiding their common language
to sort out their differences prompted one Madrid political commentator to
write that the senate sittings had 'gone beyond the limits of what is
imaginable, to become hallucinatory'.
The constitution set off the decentralisation process, dividing
administration of Spain into 17 so-called autonomous communities. Some have
acquired powers more quickly than others, although by the end of the
process, which is open-ended, it is intended there should be no
discrimination between them.
Over the next two years a committee of more than 60 senators and judicial
experts will be putting together a constitutional reform package.
'We are looking towards a properly functioning territorial chamber that will
borrow elements from the US senate and from the (German) Bundesrat,' said Mr
Oswaldo Brito, a senator representing the Canary Islands.
The founder and leader of Catalonia's ruling nationalist party and president
of the Catalan autonomous community of north-east Spain, Mr Jordi Pujol,
told the senate gathering that there would always be qualitative differences
between historic nationalities such as his homeland and other communities.
'There can be no doubts that Catalonia is a nation,' he told the senate in
his native Catalan language.
Speaking in the lisping Castilian that characterises the south of Spain, Mr
Manuel Chaves, the socialist president of the Andalucia, the most populous
and one of the most economically deprived of the autonomous communities,
warned that any change to the existing guidelines would have to 'respect the
principle of equality that is enshrined in the constitution'.
Andalucia has already opposed an arrangement negotiated by the Catalans
which allows the community governments to spend 15 per cent of the income
tax raised in their jurisdiction as they see fit. It says this would allow
wealthy Catalonia to widen regional imbalances.
The position of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, is an awkward one as
his minority Socialist government is dependent on the support of Mr Pujol's
Catalan nationalists.
An altogether more prosaic, but no less keenly felt, issue was a squabble
over the transfer of water reserves from central Spain to the drought-ridden
fruit orchards by the Mediterranean coast.
Many of the present problems originate in Spain's fast switch to democracy
after the death of General Franco in 1975. The transition government had to
address the long repressed nationalist sentiment in Catalonia and in the
Basque country but, wary of the right wing and of Franco's army, it sought
to defuse home rule in those areas by extending it to the rest of Spain.
The result has been an unsatisfactory mix between certain communities which
can claim genuine political and cultural identities and others, like the
Madrid autonomy that sprawls out from the Spanish capital, that lack any
such attributes.
For all its shortcomings the autonomous system set up by the constitution
has served a purpose; applauding it El Pais, Spain's leading newspaper,
noted that its critics should 'just think about Yugoslavia'.
The Basque Country's president, Mr Jose Antonio Ardanza, best illustrated
the sort of differences that lie ahead. He chose to stay away from the
senate debates, saying they constituted a 'theatrical experiment' and a
'dialogue of the deaf'.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Markets hit by US data and Alcatel results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial markets in Europe and the US fell sharply yesterday after figures
showing strong US economic growth and weak results from a leading European
industrial group.
In the US, an upward final revision to second-quarter gross domestic product
growth to 4.1 per cent year on year from 3.8 per cent, together with a
lower-than-expected figure for weekly jobless claims, pushed the 30-year US
Treasury bond yield to touch a 2 1/4 year high of 7.87 per cent in early US
trading.
Analysts said bond investors feared that the Federal Reserve's decision this
week to keep interest rates at their current level meant the authorities
were not acting fast enough to keep inflation under control.
'The markets are increasingly of the opinion that Mr Greenspan (the Federal
Reserve chairman) hasn't got a grip,' said Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist
at broker James Capel.
The fall in Treasury bonds depressed US equities, with the Dow Jones
Industrial average closing 23.55 points lower at 3,854.63.
European markets were already fearful that the downward trend in European
interest rates had ended, and the weakness in US shares and bonds reinforced
problems in futures and equity markets. Shares in Alcatel Alsthom, the big
French industrial group, fell 13.8 per cent to FFr488.7 after a warning of a
sharp drop in annual profits.
The decline in the shares in the telecoms, transport and engineering group
depressed Paris stocks and the CAC-40 index closed 1.5 per cent lower. In
Germany it contributed to the 3.9 per cent decline in the shares of Siemens,
a quarter of whose turnover comes from telecommunications equipment.
In London, the FT-SE 100 index closed 46.2 points or 1.5 per cent lower at
2,992.5.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Ferries in six 'near accidents': Finland and Sweden order
checks after Estonia sinking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Sweden's government disclosed yesterday that six recent 'near accidents' in
its waters involving roll-on roll-off ferries had come to light since the
sinking of the Estonia on Wednesday with the loss of up to 900 lives.
Details of the incidents emerged as Finland and Sweden ordered widespread
inspections of ferries for bow door weaknesses following the sinking in the
Baltic Sea - the worst maritime disaster in European waters since the second
world war.
The newly reported incidents, which took place over the past few years, were
disclosed through informal contacts between the Maritime Board, crew members
of ships and staff of shipping companies shocked by the Estonia sinking.
Mr Bjorn-Erik Stenmark, Sweden's director of maritime safety, said that in
the worst incident a large ferry of similar size to the Estonia sailing
between Sweden and Finland was only saved by the skilful manoeuvring of the
ship by its captain after water had flooded into the cargo deck through the
bow.
'I am shocked by these findings,' Mr Stenmark said. 'Some ship owners have
neglected to report these near accidents.
'What I see now as a trend is that bow sections can be breached in the high
sea conditions that are to be found in the Baltic Sea.'
Referring to the Estonia disaster, Mr Stenmark said: 'The huge catastrophe
with the sinking of the Estonia perhaps could have been avoided if the
shipowners had followed the law and reported earlier close calls with
ferries of the Estonia-type construction.'
In Stockholm, the technical director of Swedish shipper Nordstrom &amp; Thulin,
co-owner of the Estonia, also said water entering the bow doors may have
caused it to sink.
'There is reason to suspect that this was the main cause of the accident,'
Mr Sten Forsberg said.
But he ruled out the possibility that seals on one of the two doors
shielding the car deck from the water was faulty, as had been alleged by a
Swedish seamen's union leader. Mr Forsberg said the seals had recently
passed an international inspection.
Mr Stenmark said he had ordered that all ferries with opening bow sections
using Swedish ports should be inspected urgently. There is particular
concern about ships with visor-type bows which, like those on the Estonia,
swing open vertically.
Mr Stenmark said he would decide by early next week whether to impose
restrictions on the operation of up to 30 such ferries in high seas pending
a fuller inquiry into their safety.
Announcing its own inspections, the Finnish interior ministry said: 'All
ferries, car, passenger and train ferries which fly the Finnish flag will be
subjected to inspections . . . within a week. Special attention will be paid
to cargo doors, front and back, and to alarm and monitoring systems.'
Meanwhile, the Estonian government said it had been given a list of 1,051
names of passengers who had bought tickets to travel on the Estonia.
Original estimates had put the number of passengers at 960.
Mr Heiki Arike, the home affairs minister, said the list was larger than
previous estimates because it included children under the age of five - but
also passengers who may not have turned up for the voyage.
Rescue officials still appear uncertain about how many people survived the
disaster, but the highest figure was only 147. The Finnish coastguard said
about 90 bodies had been recovered.
A joint investigation involving officials from Sweden, Finland and Estonia
headed by Mr Ande Meister, the Estonian transport minister, will produce the
main report on the Estonia disaster.
Insurers face potential claims of more than a Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m)
following the disaster.

FT  30 SEP 94 / BAe in friendly takeover talks with VSEL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace has made a friendly bid approach to VSEL, the Barrow-based
maker of Trident submarines. Discussions are continuing about the terms of
the deal, which would offer BAe shares in exchange for those in VSEL. A deal
may be finalised as early as next week.
As VSEL confirmed an approach from an unnamed suitor yesterday, its shares
leapt 252p to finish at 1,225p, valuing the company at Pounds 465m. BAe
shares fell 15p to 449p.
A successful bid would strengthen VSEL's attempt to become a prime
contractor, controlling all aspects and risks of future submarine contracts,
since it would be backed by BAe's experience of managing large projects.
BAe would be able to expand its business base from prime contracting in
aircraft to naval systems.
The deal would mark a further consolidation of the UK defence industry,
which is forming around GEC with its electronics expertise and BAe with its
complex contract management skills.
VSEL was floated out from the government-owned British Shipbuilders in 1986.
Employees subscribed for 20 per cent of the equity at 100p a share, but most
of them have since sold their holdings.
VSEL is currently competing to build the next batch of Trafalgar nuclear
hunter-killer submarines for the Royal Navy, an order worth around Pounds
2.5bn. For the first time in submarine construction, the contract will be
awarded on a fixed-price basis, with the prime contractor taking much of the
risk.
As a small company, VSEL had difficulty persuading the Ministry of Defence
that it was a credible prime contractor. An alliance with BAe would ease
such fears.
VSEL is currently teamed with US electronics company Loral to bid for
Trafalgar, and it is unclear whether a deal with BAe would scupper that
alliance.
BAe is involved in the Horizon programme to develop the next generation of
frigates for the UK, France and Italy, and was known to be interested in
bidding for the next batch of Trafalgar submarines. BAeSema, a joint venture
company partly owned by BAe, makes the command and control systems for
Trafalgar submarines and Royal Navy frigates.
GEC is also interested in the Trafalgar order, but had apparently decided
against bidding for VSEL to win the contract.
It is not known whether BAe's approach to VSEL will change GEC's view of
such a bid.
The proposed share exchange with VSEL would strengthen BAe's balance sheet,
and the Pounds 325m of cash which VSEL held at its year end in March would
almost eliminate the Pounds 367m of net debt which BAe reported in June.
Such a deal would resemble a disguised rights issue, though BAe's prime
motive for the deal is thought to be industrial, not financial.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Disney loses battle for US civil war park
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Battle of Third Manassas has ended in defeat for the Walt Disney Company
with the sudden announcement that it was abandoning plans to build a Dollars
650m (Pounds 411m) history theme park on the rolling Virginia countryside
over which the US civil war raged 130 years ago.
The flag of surrender to local environmental and historical opposition was
run up by company officials on Wednesday night in Richmond, the state
capital. Disney officials told Governor George Allen, who had pushed Dollars
163m in tax breaks for the project through his legislature earlier this
year, that it had been decided not to proceed.
A statement from its California headquarters said it was still intent on
building its theme park, preferably elsewhere in Virginia, and announced a
new management team for the project.
The collapse of the plan - controversial for its location, about 35 miles
from Washington and near the famous US civil war battle site - is another
setback in a year that is coming to resemble Disney's own Waterloo.
Beset by disappointing attendance at its US venues and the continuing
financial crisis at the 49 per cent owned Disneyland outside Paris, its
management has been deeply split over long term direction, including
possible purchase of a leading US commercial TV network.
Last month, Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, who had transformed Disney's moribund
animated film division, resigned after Mr Michael Eisner, the chairman, had
refused to give him a more powerful management role. Mr Eisner himself has
been incapacitated this year following open heart surgery, while Mr Frank
Wells, the highly regarded president, died suddenly in April.
The 3,000 acre Virginia project and its related developments, which included
2,300 houses, 1,300 hotel rooms and 1.9m square feet of retail space, would
have created 3,000 new jobs and an extra Dollars 12m in county tax revenues,
Disney said.
Governor Allen backed it for its economic benefits, and Prince William
County gave its provisional zoning approval, subject to environmental
clearance by the federal government. US Talk shows and political
commentaries saw the Disney park in growth-versus-environment and
populist-versus-elite terms.
But the plan was criticised by environmentalists and the local 'horse
country' set afraid that unspoiled countryside would be ruined. Historians
also condemned what they feared would be the sanitisation of history,
rendered all the more unacceptable by the location on top of beautifully
preserved battlefields.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Ferries face calls for safety curbs: Estonia disaster brings
reports of other 'near accidents'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's senior maritime safety officer yesterday questioned the safety of
roll-on roll-off ferries with opening bow sections and said he was
considering restricting their operations following the sinking of the ferry
Estonia in the Baltic Sea with the loss of as many as 900 lives.
In statements likely to reverberate throughout the shipping industry, Mr
Bengt-Erik Stenmark, the government's director of maritime safety, said the
National Maritime Board had been informed since the Estonia sank of some six
recent 'near accidents' in waters around Sweden, involving the failure of
opening bow sections, which had not previously been reported to the
authorities.
He said 'all the indications' were that water entering the Estonia, jointly
operated by Swedish and Estonian shipping companies, through the bow section
was the 'final cause' of Wednesday's catastrophe - although it may have been
the culmination of a chain of events including the shifting of improperly
secured cargo.
'What I see now as a trend is that bow sections can be breached in the high
sea conditions that are to be found in the Baltic Sea,' Mr Stenmark said.
He said he had ordered that all ferries with opening bow sections using
Swedish ports should be inspected urgently. He was especially concerned
about ships which, like the Estonia, have visor-type bows that swing open
vertically. He said he would decide by early next week whether to impose
restrictions on the operation of up to 30 such ferries in high seas pending
a fuller inquiry into their safety.
He added that he believed the International Maritime Organisation, the
United Nations organisation that sets standards for the shipping industry,
should study the whole issue of the safety of opening bow sections on ro-ro
ferries. 'It is a question of design,' he said.
The IMO confirmed that the danger of water penetrating the bow doors of
roll-on roll-off vessels was one of the most important issues under
consideration in its safety committees. However, it said there was no
evidence that this had proved to be a widespread problem.
The newly reported incidents, which took place over the past few years, came
to light through informal contacts with the Maritime Board made by crew
members of ships and staff members of shipping companies shocked by the
Estonia sinking, the worst maritime disaster in European waters since the
second world war.
'I am shocked by these findings,' Mr Stenmark said. 'Some ship owners have
neglected to report these near accidents.'
A joint investigation involving officials from Sweden, Finland and Estonia
headed by Mr Ande Meister, the Estonian transport minister, will produce the
main report on the Estonia disaster. They began interviewing survivors
yesterday, including a crew member and a passenger who both reported seeing
water rushing on to the car deck shortly before the ship foundered.
Officials at Estline, the operator of the Estonia, said they did not believe
a failure of the bow doors had caused the sinking, but they admitted they
had 'no concrete explanation' of why the ship sank so suddenly.
Confusion continued yesterday over how many passengers were on board the
Estonia when it sank. The main rescue centre at Turku, Finland, said it now
understood more than 1,000 people were aboard, compared with reports of
about 960 on Wednesday. Rescue officials also appeared uncertain about how
many people survived, but the highest figure was only 147.
Insurers face potential claims of more than a Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m)
following the disaster, but it is likely that the loss will be absorbed by
international markets relatively easily. Liability claims are not expected
to exceed Dollars 60m.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank is putting its mortgage bank activities together to form a new
organisation which will be the biggest source of mortgage finance in
Germany.
By merging Frankfurter Hypothekenbank and Deutsche Centralbodenkredit, it
will create a new bank with a balance sheet total of some DM72bn (Dollars
46.5bn). The merged bank will be called Frankfurter Hypothekenbank
Centralboden.
Deutsche Bank owns more than 90 per cent of both banks. Another group bank,
Lubecker Hypothekenbank, with a balance sheet total of DM12bn, will also be
included in the mortgage grouping through a management contract.
Mr Bernt Rohrer, who will be chief executive of the merged concern, said
yesterday that this concentration of Deutsche Bank's mortgage activities
would make it more competitive in a tough market and enable it to offer
bigger individual property loans.
The biggest mortgage bank in Germany is the Wiesbaden-based Deutsche
Pfandbrief- und Hypothekenbank, but Mr Rohrer said the amalgamated Deutsche
Bank subsidiary would be the biggest granter of mortgage loans in Germany,
covering 45 per cent of commercial property business and 55 per cent of
residential.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Labour dispute may put hockey season on ice: Owners threaten
to lock out players if new deal is not hammered out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Already deprived of the most exciting part of the baseball season, North
American sports fans now face the prospect of no ice hockey as a result of
another labour dispute between owners and players, writes Bernard Simon in
Toronto.
Owners of the 26 US and Canadian teams which make up the National Hockey
League (NHL) have threatened to lock out the players if a new collective
agreement is not hammered out in time for the scheduled opening of the
season on Saturday. Hopes were slim yesterday that the protracted and
increasingly hostile negotiations would be concluded before the deadline.
As in the six-week-old baseball strike, the public is venting its anger on
both sides, especially in Canada, where hockey is the national sport and
Hockey Night is the longest-running programme on television. One Toronto
newspaper columnist yesterday pinned the blame for the impasse on the
'cowboy mentality' of the two American lawyers who represent the owners and
the players' union.
The issues in the hockey dispute are similar to those which brought the
baseball season to a premature end. In both cases they reflect the degree to
which the entertainment element of sport has been overshadowed by business.
The NHL posted revenues of about CDollars 700m (USDollars 522.3m) in 1993,
and expects a substantial increase in coming years thanks partly to a
CDollars 155m five-year contract signed recently with Mr Rupert Murdoch's
Fox television network. But the owners are demanding various concessions
from the players to hold down spiralling salary bills, and to secure the
future of financially strapped teams in relatively small markets such as the
Canadian prairie city of Winnipeg and Hartford, Connecticut.
The players are concerned however, that the owners are moving towards a cap
on salaries. The owners have already proposed a limit on first-year players'
pay of about CDollars 275,000 a year.
With the exception of a few superstars, notably Wayne Gretzky of the Los
Angeles Kings, hockey salaries are generally well below those in baseball.
But 75 players now earn more than CDollars 1m a year - led by Mr Gretzky's
CDollars 8.4m - compared with just three players five years ago.

<TEXT>
South African Home Affairs Minister Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who is also
leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, offered an unconditional apology for
having burst into a television studio on Sunday night to confront a
political rival during a live broadcast, Mark Suzman reports from
Johannesburg.
The uncharacteristic apology by the combative minister, which came after he
had been formally censured by the cabinet for 'a serious violation of the
right to freedom of speech and freedom of the press,' appears to have
defused the controversy over the incident for the time being. However, Chief
Buthelezi remains under continued political pressure over his relationship
with Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini who last week broke off relations with
the Chief.
Speaking at a joint press conference with President Mandela in Pretoria,
Chief Buthelezi said that he had apologised to the President and the nation
as a whole for the incident.

FT  29 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Steel rides high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel continued to strongly outperform the market, climbing 6 to 171
1/2p as investors took a very positive view of the company's buoyant trading
prospects.
A big US securities house, said to be Goldman Sachs, did most of the day's
more aggressive bidding and 32m shares changed hands as the stock broke
through to a new high for the year.
On the back of firm steel prices and expanding production - output could
rise by 5 per cent this year - the shares have outperformed the market by 12
per cent over the past month and by 34 per cent on a 12-month basis.
US production is due to expand very strongly next year and new technology
looks set to make British Steel one of the cheapest producers in North
America.
The talk among analysts is that US buyers of the stock, having run down
their portfolios this year, could soon be in evidence.
British Airways continued to lose ground, shedding 4 1/2 to 360p as four
other major US airlines moved their trans-Atlantic fares down into line with
the recent special offer from NorthWest Airlines.
Some 3m shares were dealt and the stock was clearly out of favour ahead of
next week's traffic figures for September, which are widely expected to make
gloomy reading.
Conversely, BAA has taken heart from the air ticket reductions, advancing 9
to 487p on the expectation of growing passenger volume. Its September
traffic figures are due out on October 13.
Shell Transport came in for keen support after a profits upgrade by Nomura,
the stockbroker, whose analyst Mr Nick Clayton raised his current year
profits estimate to Pounds 3.85bn.
The Nomura analyst cited evidence of petrochemicals prices and volumes
improving much more rapidly than previously expected as being behind the
upgrade. The stock moved up to 697p before closing a net 4 1/2 ahead at 694
1/2p; turnover came to 3.2m.
Switching from British Petroleum to Shell and evidence of renewed US selling
of BP left the stock a poor performer in the London market at 398p, down 1,
after 396p.
News of the Pounds 58.4m rights issue saw Unichem tumble 22 to 276p.
British Aerospace declined 4 to 464p against the general trend. The
company's name has been linked with Fokker, of the Netherlands, over the
development of a new 120-seater plane. But the main talk among traders was
the possibility of an imminent takeover by the company, with VSEL, up 5 at
973p, said to be a likely target.
Smiths Industries dipped 5 to 427p following a large sale order by SG
Warburg at 422p, and Lucas Industries also went in the opposite direction to
the market in very heavy turnover, easing 2 to 192p on 10m traded.
Better than expected results triggered good support for Beazer, the
housebuilding group, whose shares settled 8 higher at 131p.
Among diversified industrials, Tomkins had another busy day with 7.2m shares
traded and leading to a rise of 9 in the share price to 218p as the market
took advantage of the clearing of a major stock overhang. Williams Holdings
moved forward 7 to 344p following yesterday's presentation to City analysts.
Bass, a weak feature after a trading statement from the group on Monday
disappointed the market, rose sharply after a leading broker urged investors
to buy the stock.
It jumped 12 to 526p in trade of 2.4m, when Smith New Court suggested that
investors, and income funds in particular, buy the shares for the healthy
dividend expected with the group's final results. Bass made an interim
dividend payment of 6.6p and Smith is expecting a dividend of 14.4p at the
end of the year.
Favourable results from property group Frogmore Estates not only boosted the
company's shares but also cheered several other stocks in the sector. The
shares responded by racing 25 ahead to 444p.
A recommendation from Lehman Brothers boosted BAT Industries, which finished
11 ahead at 423p.
Hotels group Forte, which reports figures today, put on 2 at 219p ahead of
today's figures. Vague talk of a rights issue announcement with today's
figures was heard early in the session, putting pressure on the stock. The
talk had faded by the second half.
The market was disappointed with figures from jewellery group Signet. The
decline in the US market was of particular concern to analysts and several
brokers downgraded full-year profits expectations by around Pounds 10m to
Pounds 16m. The shares retreated 3 1/4 to 28 1/4 p.

Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome wilted under waves of selling from
institutions after news that the US Food and Drug Administration had issued
a written warning to Wellcome about production problems at its US
manufacturing plant in Carolina.
The news was badly received in the stock market, where Wellcome shares,
buoyed recently by persistent talk that the company could be the target of
an overseas bid or a merger with one of the UK pharmaceuticals companies,
lost 19 at 659p, having fallen to 647p at one point. Turnover in Wellcome
was a heavy 7.6m shares, the highest since mid-July.

<TEXT>
There was a sudden rush of nervous covering in British Gas shares, which
delivered one of the best performances of the FT-SE 100 constituents ahead
of today's crucial strategy meeting at the Queen Elizabeth II conference
centre at Westminster.
Analysts described today's meeting, which runs from 8.30am to noon and will
be attended by analysts and fund managers from across the globe, as possibly
the most important since the group was privatised in 1986.
Dealers said British Gas shares have risen strongly in recent sessions and
especially yesterday as some institutions underweight in the stock moved
into the market to try to reach level weightings ahead of the meeting.
'It has been quite clear for some time that Gas will set out a progressive
dividend policy at the meeting, as well as outline the way ahead for the
company after break-up forced on it by the authorities,' commented one
specialist.
At the close British Gas was 9 1/2 higher at 299 1/2 p after turnover of
5.8m shares.

FT  29 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Fed decision encourages recovery in
blue chips - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by the Federal Reserve to leave its key interest rates
unchanged touched off the expected technical rally in the UK stock market
yesterday. Led forward by firmness in bond markets and by a spectacular
return to a premium on the December stock index future contract, equities
rebounded sharply, closing just under the best of the day after Wall Street
opened the new session with a further gain of 20 Dow points.
There was no great increase in trading volume, however. Share gains were
mostly moderate, but there were market hints of impending bid moves in the
pharmaceuticals and insurance sectors.
After touching 3,039.3 in early dealings, the FT-SE 100-share Index trod
water for most of the day, rallying to close at 3,038.7, a net 30.2 higher
on the session. A substantial rise in durable goods orders in the US, while
not taken entirely at face value in London, indicated further strengthening
in the US economy.
The Fed's decision against a rate change left markets to continue worrying
about the timing and direction of global interest rates, with today's
meeting of the Bundesbank at the top of the list of concerns. Some analysts
argued that the impending elections in both Germany and the US may render
their respective central banks less anxious to act on interest rates for the
time being.
Two relatively small trading programmes were reported, perhaps linked to the
strong upswing in stock index futures which spurred activity in the blue
chip sectors. The broader market was also firm, albeit less active. The
FT-SE Mid 250 Index regained 16.3 of its recent loss to close at 3,533.8.
Seaq-reported trading volume increased only slightly, from 545m shares on
Tuesday to 575.5m yesterday. Non-Footsie trading made up around 58 per cent
of the day's total, a relatively high percentage and an indication that some
private investors may have re-entered the market.
Retail, or genuine customer, business in UK equities returned a value total
of Pounds 1.38bn on Tuesday, confirming once again the presence of the big
institutions, which are believed to have been sellers of stock during the
recent shakeout.
Dealers believed that, barring any unexpected move by the Bundesbank today,
the recovery in the London stock market has further to run. The outlook for
company profits and dividends is thought to have turned less confident,
however, and there is some uncertainty as to how far the Footsie can run
before the year-end, and whether it can meet the more optimistic of the
forecasts from City analysts.
The brighter mood in equities, which was also buttressed by the outcome of
the auction of Pounds 2bn of British government securities, brought the
focus back on to individual stocks, rather than to factors influencing
investors across the full range of the market.
Not all were favourable. Wellcome met selling pressure in spite of the
company's assurances that it had taken steps to meet comments from the US
Federal Drug Administration. Most other blue chip dollar-influenced stocks
performed well, however.
Among the consumer and retail sectors, which have taken a pounding over the
past week, store shares were generally firmer; the dull spot being Sears,
which was still upset by the half-time trading report. Banking stocks moved
higher with the market.
But analysts were wary of suggesting that the stock market had made a
genuine and lasting recovery from the weakness of the past fortnight.
Friday afternoon will see the end of the third quarter of the year, and the
next two trading days could well bring some window-dressing operations by
professional fund managers.

FT  29 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures advanced strongly yesterday in improving volume, with
premiums to the cash market at times widening substantially.
The FT-SE 100 December contract pushed ahead steadily throughout the
session, moving up from an opening low of 3,017 to a best of the day of
3,062 by mid-afternoon.
The contract closed at 3,056, up 38 points. At this level the premium to the
cash market was 17.3, with the fair value premium around 19.
Trading volume was little better than average, reaching 13,453 contracts, up
from 10,453 on Tuesday. But dealers said there was plenty of broad based
support.
On a number of occasions the premium to the cash market widened to 24
points, the best since mid-August, as stock futures attempted to provide
cash equities with a strong lead. But at these premiums the cash market
showed a marked reluctance to follow, said dealers.
Activity was again mostly in the hands of locals. Some traders thought
institutional business could soon start to return - possibly next week  -
once third-quarter book balancing was out of the way.
Traded option turnover eased to 30,859 lots, down 3,711 on the day. FT-SE
and Euro FT-SE volume accounted for 13,759 of the total. British Gas (4,073
lots) and Hillsdown (2,955) were the most actively traded stock options.

FT  29 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Improvement in Dow after Fed
stands pat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks improved yesterday as investors warmed to the Federal Reserve's
decision to hold steady on interest rates, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 15.14 higher at 3,878.18 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 2.79 at 464.84. The Nasdaq composite gained
4.64 at 760.01. NYSE volume was heavy, with 330.3m shares traded by the
close.
The solid upturn in share prices was essentially a follow-through on the
relieved response to the Fed's inaction in the previous session. Stocks, led
by issues most sensitive to shifts in the economy, climbed steadily through
the morning, in parallel with a good advance by US government bonds. During
the afternoon, equities receded from their highs but still were well up on
the day.
The positive sentiment suggested that there had been some concern that an
immediate move to lift interest rates could have set back the corporate
sector at an unfortunate juncture.
Even though the Fed now appeared poised to lift rates whenever it deemed
appropriate, equity investors took advantage of the lull to lift share
prices with just two more sessions remaining in the third quarter.
The economic news on offer yesterday was inconclusive. The Commerce
Department said orders of durable goods last month had jumped 6 per cent,
against forecasts of a 3.8 per cent rise. But most of the unexpected gain
was linked to the transport sector, the most volatile component in the mix.
That was enough to allow investors to brush aside the news and concentrate
on a firmer dollar and a positive trend in bonds.
Cyclical stocks were among the strongest. Caterpillar, a Dow industrial
component, jumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 54 5/8 . Allied Signal rose
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 35 1/4 .
Cincinnati Milacron, a machine tool maker, bounded Dollars 2 1/2 ahead to
Dollars 26, a 52-week high. An upgrading by Merrill Lynch was the catalyst.
Gap Stores bounced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 32 3/4 thanks to favourable
reratings by at least two Wall Street pundits. The stock had retreated
during the previous sessions when other analysts took the opposite view.
On the losing side, MascoTech dropped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 11 3/8 after
the industrial engineering concern reduced its earnings estimate for the
full year.
On the Amex, Atari surged Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 7 1/2 , a 22 per cent
gain, on news that Sega Enterprises would buy 4.7m Atari shares as part of a
broad strategic agreement between the two computer game makers.
On the Nasdaq, Roadway Services backpedalled Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 56 3/4
. After the close of trading on Tuesday, the trucking company announced a
sharp decline in third-quarter net income. Antec, which makes products for
communications networks, was marked down Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 26 1/4
after issuing a profits warning.
Canada
Gold shares backed off from a Toronto market rally, limiting a gain in the
TSE 300 index to 11.70 points at 4,372.48. Overall, declines led rises by
408 to 329. Volume amounted to 61m shares valued at CDollars 914.7m.
A dose of profit-taking and a stronger US dollar were enough to put the
brakes on the surging gold sector, analysts said. The golds index slippped
1.40 per cent as the New York bullion price fell USDollars 3.20 to USDollars
394.55 an ounce.
Mexico
Equities crawled back to end down 1.9 per cent after the assassination of a
top official of the ruling party rocked the market at midsession - at one
stage losing some 3 per cent.
Traders said movement on the Mexican stock exchange was dominated by the
assassination of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, with investors selling off
shares because of this latest political upheaval. Mr Ruiz Massieu was gunned
down outside a Mexico City hotel early yesterday and died in hospital as
surgeons tried to save his life. He was the secretary-general of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary party, or PRI, and a former governor of the
state of Guerrero.
News of the shooting spread like wildfire on the trading floor and the
initial reaction was to dump stocks, a trader said. But bargain hunting
investors moved back into the market before the close, bringing a partial
recovery. The IPC index shed a net 53.61 at 2,764.82; at the end of 1993 it
stood at 2,602.63. Volume was an extremely heavy 172.54m shares worth 2.72bn
new pesos.
Mexico has seen a year of upheavals, including a New Year rebellion in the
state of Chiapas and the March assassination of presidential candidate Luis
Donaldo Colosio.

FT  29 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Lima puts in higher performance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lima put in a sharply higher performance last week as foreign interest in
the market was ignited by a Dollars 45m offering of ADRs in Banco Wiese on
the New York Stock Exchange, the first ever international offering for a
Peruvian equity.
The issue was reported to have been 20 times oversubscribed, with the price
rising to a 16.5 per cent premium on the first day of trading.
Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets notes that Lima's positive mood was also
helped by news that talks with foreign commercial creditors would resume
following official recognition of all outstanding debts.
The result was a 19.4 per cent increase on the week in average daily
turnover to Dollars 15.5m, according to figures from the Lima exchange.
Wiese, Peru's second largest bank, surged 25.5 per cent on the week in
domestic trading, pulling Banco de Credito, the country's largest bank, 17.7
per cent higher in its wake.

FT  29 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Short covering, Wall Street
lift bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Short covering lifted bourses in the morning, and Wall Street offered
support in the late afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS started well, the CAC-40 index peaking at 1,925.99. It ran into
trouble after lunch, rumours of a big seller in futures taking the index
down fast to a low of 1,889.16, but rallied thereafter to close 3.67 higher
at 1,904.95 in turnover of FFr3.19bn.
Rumours also produced the main individual feature, LVMH rising FFr38 or 4.2
per cent to FFr889 on talk that a bank was buying the shares for the
Christian Dior holding company. Other winners included Peugeot, up FFr9 to
FFr781, as analysts revised their forecasts following this week's figures,
said Mr Frederick Sauvegrain at broker Ferri International.
Among financials, Societe Generale rose FFr6 to FFr540 after a good
first-half report, and Credit Lyonnais recovered FFr8.20 to FFr382.20 after
its report on first-half losses.
Losers included Lafarge Coppee, down FFr4.40 to FFr419.50 after a
satisfactory first half; GAN, the insurance company, off FFr11 at FFr290 on
a profits warning; and Vallourec, the metal fabricator, down FFr30 or 9.4
per cent at FFr290 after barely breaking even in the first six months.
FRANKFURT followed its pattern of recent days, with share prices led by bund
futures and activity restrained by the pending German elections. The Dax
index rose 9.39 to 2,068.11 as turnover rose from DM5bn to DM5.3bn.
Metallgesellschaft staged one of its occasional rebounds, closing DM11.50
higher at DM130 following its drop from DM211 at the end of August. In
pharmaceuticals, Schering's rise of DM17.50 to DM964.50 fitted into a
pattern of recent share price volatility.
The star performer, once again, was SAP in computer software, up DM25 at a
new closing high of DM899 after a DM24 gain on Tuesday. The stock had risen
by more than 200 per cent in the past year, noted Mr Jens Wiecking of Merck
Finck in Dusseldorf, adding that it was now looking expensive with a high
market capitalisation to sales ratio.
MILAN remained in mostly confident mood in response to the cabinet's
approval of 1995 budget measures, and the Comit index rose 12.64 or 1.9 per
cent to 693.55, shrugging off the general strike called for October 14 by
unions opposed to pension cuts.
Prices edged back from their best levels late in the day, however, after the
Northern League, one of the coalition partners, gave notice of its
opposition to elements of the proposed pension reforms.
Hopes of improved first-half figures from Fiat today also provided support.
Fiat rose L53 to L6,825 and Olivetti was up L75 at L2,150.
Telecom Italia was up L157 at L4,560 after Tuesday's positive first-half
results and Stet climbed L250 to L4,935 ahead of its first-half figures, due
out later that day.
BCI was L122 higher at L4,095 on barely changed first-half results, while
Credito Italiano rose L42 to L2,250.
ZURICH edged higher, the SMI index rising 9.0 to 2,590.0. Banks, under
pressure in recent sessions, were the biggest beneficiaries of the easing
worries about interest rates, with SBC up SFr4 to SFr370.
Among insurers, Swiss Reinsurance was up SFr12 at SFr638, lifted by some
bargain hunting after being sold earlier in the week on uncertainty ahead of

FT  29 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Firm gold price aids S African recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg bounced back after two days of hefty decline as a firmer gold
price pulled buyers back into the oversold market.
Gold bullion's rally, as well as gains for leading world markets, eased
nerves after the negative inflation data, a bank rate rise, and weaker world
markets that drove shares lower on Monday and Tuesday.
The overall index recouped 56 at 5,639, after losing 172 points in the first
two days of the week. Golds picked up 41 to 2,464 and industrials advanced
78 to 6,249.
De Beers collected a further 50 cents at R100, Anglos added R2 at R237 and
Gencor put on 50 cents at R14.50. Amic recovered R5 to R190 after losing R13
on Tuesday.

FT  29 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises mildly,
regaining 19,500 mark

<TEXT>
Stepped-up corporate and public fund buying helped stocks post a modest
recovery in a quiet trading session, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average rose 38.71 to 19,507.60, just above the 19,500 mark
breached by Tuesday's 345.47 drop. The market traded in a relatively narrow
range from a high of 19,566.01 to a low of 19,479.20.
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by 541 to 432, with 206 stocks
unchanged. Brokers attributed the rally to technical factors and the renewed
participation of public funds, which had remained on the sidelines on
Tuesday. Trading volume improved from 231.7m shares to 280m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks ended 6.84 up at 1,569.59, but
the second section index was off 12.00 at 2,219.43. The Nikkei 300 firmed
1.15 to 287.19 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.74 at
1,286.45.
Japan Telecom fell for the third day this week, closing below Y4m for the
first time since its listing on September 6. The closely watched new issue
shed Y70,000 to Y3.95m. Investors who bought the stock in a pre-listing
public offering and auction paid between Y4.7m and Y6.6m. Some brokers felt
that many were now selling to cut mounting losses.
Rising gold prices took Sumitomo Mining up Y26 to Y980 in the day's highest
volume of 8.2m shares. Steelmakers were heavily represented among active
stocks. Nippon Steel, the second most active, ended flat at Y385, but
Kawasaki Steel rose Y6 to Y438 and Kobe Steel inched up Y1 to Y327.
Automobile shares made a strong showing. Toyota Motor gained Y20 at Y2,030,
Nissan Motor Y8 at Y794 and Honda Y30 at Y1,630. Major trading houses also
gained ground. Itochu moved ahead Y17 to Y712 and Sumitomo Y22 to Y970.
Matsushita Electric Industrial receded Y20 to Y1,580 after Tuesday's news
that it would issue two domestic convertible bonds totalling Y200bn. Other
electricals fared better. Hitachi rose Y7 to Y962, Oki Electric Industry Y20
to Y775 and NEC Y10 to Y1,180.
In Osaka the OSE average advanced 16.11 to 21,859.98 in volume of 39.7m
shares.
Roundup
Unchanged US interest rates after yesterday's FOMC meeting had only a
limited effect on the region. Taiwan was closed for a holiday.
SINGAPORE used the US Federal Reserve's decision as an excuse to go bargain
hunting, and investors who had sold on expectations of a US interest rate
rise were forced to cover sizeable short positions.
The Straits Times Industrial index moved up 40.85 to 2,330.69, with an
estimated 283m shares traded.
Malaysian shares traded over the counter as measured by the UOB-OTC index
closed 9.39 down at 1,267.76. MBf Capital led the actives, falling 18 cents
to SDollars 1.88 in more than 24m shares dealt, while Samanda Holdings
dropped 85 cents to SDollars 5.60 after news that its attempt to take a
stake in MBf Capital had failed.
HONG KONG closed off its highs in thin trade, but buying linked to the
September index futures settlement today helped the Hang Seng index finish a
net 83.25 up at 9,693.49 after touching 9,747.45. Turnover edged up to
HKDollars 2.98bn from HKDollars 2.96bn.
The Hang Seng H-share index jumped 31.62 or 2.3 per cent to 1,409.68.
Analysts said shares in Chinese-incorporated companies were rebounding from
recent weakness.
SHANGHAI's A share index, meanwhile, closed just over 5 per cent better, up
45.36 at 943.22 in turnover of Yn3.62bn, on hopes for positive market news
from the fourth plenary session of the 14th central committee of the Chinese
Communist party in Beijing.
SYDNEY stayed uncertain over the direction of interest rates, and the All
Ordinaries index ended only 0.4 up at 2,014.2. Brokers said the market was
disappointed that the US Fed left interest rates unchanged, and that they
would have to rise sooner or later. WELLINGTON declined on high existing
interest rates, the NZSE-40 Index slipping 14.98 to 2,068.60.
MANILA took a sharp tumble and Wall Street was partly to blame. PLDT dropped
by 2.7 per cent to 1,420 pesos following its Dollars 1 1/4 slide to Dollars
56 1/4 in New York overnight. Brokers blamed foreign exchange appreciation
in recent weeks.
The composite index fell 56.58 to 2,877.69. The other main contributor to
the fall was Meralco 'A', 3.6 per cent lower at 267.50 pesos because a state
pension fund offer of shares to its members at 250 pesos was encouraging
arbitraging.
SEOUL saw profit-taking, the composite index dipping 12.22 to 1,039.79.
BOMBAY was still shaken by plague fears and the BSE 30-share index lost
37.73 to end at a provisional 4,406.83. KUALA LUMPUR encountered heavy
afternoon profit-taking and the KLSE composite index shed 8.77 to 1,140.83
after a morning high of 1,158.88.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Dollar drifts upwards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar was slightly firmer against the yen yesterday as markets,
stretched to the limit of anticipation, eyed the eleventh-hour trade talks
between the US and Japan, writes Motoko Rich.
In the absence of any real news from negotiators, the markets gave the
dollar the benefit of the doubt and bounced the US currency around at the
upper end of its ranges against both the yen and the D-Mark.
Against the yen the dollar closed in London at Y98.720, up from Y98.135.
Against the D-Mark it finished at DM1.5467, down slightly from DM1.5470. It
ended in New York firmer at Y99.00 and DM1.5527.
In Europe, the lira remained the focus of attention as Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi's cabinet approved the government's budget proposals for 1995 and
Italy's trade unions called a general strike for October 14 in protest
against the pension reforms included in the budget. The lira finished at
L1007 per D-Mark, down from Tuesday's close of L1006.
Sterling showed some potential to test its upside against the dollar, but
fell short of a real breach of important technical levels. It closed in
London at Dollars 1.5784, up from Dollars 1.5770, and at DM2.4412, up from
DM2.4396.
The dollar maintained a firm bias against the yen throughout the day,
although neither US nor Japanese officials were forthcoming with any
substantial details on the shape of their trade talks, which look set to
continue right up until the deadline tomorrow.
Mr Steve Barrow, economist at Chemical Bank, said: 'Unfortunately for the
market it has always looked like it would come down to the wire, and that is
the way it has proved.'
He said the market was assuming that the two sides would arrive at some
compromise on most industrial sectors, and avoid sanctions. In the event of
such an outcome, Mr Barrow said the markets would 'just give a big yawn'.
The markets were slightly unsettled by comments from US Treasury Secretary
LLoyd Bentsen, who said any trade sanctions that were imposed against Japan
would be specific, rather than broad-based.
Earlier, the dollar took a dip as a stronger than expected August durable
goods orders figure - which rose by 6.0 per cent from July's figure -
emerged from the US. It was the biggest gain since December 1992.
The lira was bounced around in choppy trading as the markets continued their
vigilant watch over Mr Berlusconi's progress with a budget for 1995. The
cabinet's approval of the budget helped the lira to rise to L1001.5 in the
morning, and although the trade unions called a general strike for October
16, they were largely discounted by the markets.
The revelation by the Northern League, one of Mr Berlusconi's coalition
partners, that it would oppose certain measures in the budget aimed at
reforming the country's pension system gave the lira a fright.
But in late trading the lira took strength from Mr Berlusconi's announcement
of further budget details, which included a promise to cut the deficit by
L50 trillion.
Mr George Magnus, currency economist at SG Warburg, said the lira is still
undervalued. 'But there is a long way to go before the lira can turn around
to what most people regard as a reasonable value, around L950 to L980
against the D-Mark,' he added.
Sterling attempted a push upwards against the dollar on the back of the
strong US August durable goods orders. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury
economist at ABN-Amro, said traders were waiting for the pound to breach the
important technical level of Dollars 1.59.
'Once the pound breaks through Dollars 1.59 or Dollars 1.60, technical
traders will be asking why it does not go up to Dollars 1.70,' he said.
'While it is hard to see an independent rise of the pound, it might tally
with a general weakening of the dollar.'
The short sterling futures contract for December rose by 8 basis points, as
recent UK economic data fed through into the markets and traders began to
revise interest rates slightly downwards.
Since Chancellor Kenneth Clarke raised base rates earlier this month, the
futures markets have been pricing in rate increases to 7 per cent in the
December contract. Analysts have said such forecasts are highly exaggerated.
The December contract settled at 93.27, up from 93.19, discounting a
short-term interest rate of 6.73 per cent.
Mr Norfield said the rate currently priced in by the markets is still
'implausible', but that investors are slowly curtailing their expectations
of rate rises because recent UK economic data have shown more balanced
growth without signs of a consumer boom.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds
400m and provided liquidity of Pounds 400m at established rates. Overnight
rates traded between 3 3/4 and 5 1/4 per cent.
German call money firmed to 4.75/85 per cent from 4.30/40 per cent.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar deficit put at 1.8m
tonnes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world faces another deficit year in sugar supplies after a worsening in
prospects for this year's crop, according to the latest report by ED &amp; F.
Man, the UK commodities house. Sugar production is forecast to be 110.7m
tonnes for the next crop year (1994-1995) leaving a shortfall of 1.8m
tonnes.
World supplies are tight after the unloading of stocks in the current crop
year when production of 109.03m tonnes led to a deficit of 2.2m tonnes. The
two deficit years come after 12 years' of production surpluses with supply
tightness pushing prices higher.
A poor crop in China and difficulties in Cuba combined with India's desire
to increase imports and rebuild stocks could push prices higher.
China's cane crop has been damaged by flooding. Man's estimate for Cuba's
crop next year is 3.5m tonnes.

<TEXT>
European Union member states will present counter-plans within two weeks to
prevent Spanish vessels overfishing after they gain access to EU western
waters in 1996, EU officials said on Wednesday, Reuters reports from
Brussels.
Britain and Ireland led attacks by nearly all EU fisheries ministers against
European Commission proposals, notably the allocation of 'standard vessel
days' for fishing, as complex and unworkable.
'It's not a runner . . . We have seen off that particular proposal,' British
fisheries minister Michael Jack said after a meeting of EU fisheries
ministers. Jack said Britain would present special controls to protect fish
stocks in sensitive zones.
British fishermen are concerned that the Spanish fishing fleet, the largest
in the EU, will destroy fragile stocks in waters off western Britain.
Germany, which holds the rotating EU presidency, said it was clear many
countries had problems with the approach and details of the proposals from
the commission, the EU's executive agency.
Spain has warned it will block Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria joining
the EU if terms for Spanish fishermen are not agreed by the end of the year.

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australian wool prices nosedived at sales this week after soaring since the
start of the 1994-95 season, reports Reuters from Sydney. But industry
officials said the market remained well supported.
The newly reweighted eastern Australian market indicator had soared to an
end-week high of 829 cents a kilogram (clean) from 681 cents at the start of
the current wool season on July 1, before slipping slightly last week to
close at 808 cents.
But at the Newcastle and Melbourne auctions this week the indicator fell by
37 cents to 771 cents on Tuesday, and traders were expecting further
retrenchment as the market entered its period of peak offerings.
'This is the correction everyone has been waiting for as the market has been
rising so quickly,' suggested Mr Peter Klein, assistant director of the Wool
Council of Australia.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Monarch opens Venezuelan gold
mine

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Monarch Resources, a company registered in Bermuda, has opened the first
underground gold mine to be developed in Venezuela for five decades.
The company, whose shares are traded on the London and Toronto stock
exchanges, invested about USDollars 25m in the new mine, called La Camorra,
located in Bolivar state.
It expects La Camorra to produce around 220kg (7,070 troy ounces) of gold a
month. Reserves of ore at the mine site are estimated at 540,000 tonnes with
a gold content averaging 22 grams a tonne, according to company officials.
Exploration at the site began in 1988 and construction in 1992.
The company has invested a total of Dollars 80m in gold operations in
Venezuela since 1987.
At the same time, Canada's Placer Dome, which has identified sizeable gold
reserves at another site in Bolivar state, Las Cristinas, announced in
Vancouver that it was raising its estimate of gold resources at the property
from 7.7m troy ounces to 8.6m. The Canadian company is studying the
development of an open pit mine at Las Cristinas, which could yield about 6m
ounces of gold.
International companies have expressed considerable interest in Venezuela's
gold mining potential. However, potential investors complain about an
outdated law covering the mining sector and about controls on foreign
exchange activities established in June of this year.
Before exchange controls were imposed, a private Venezuelan gold mining
association estimated that investment in gold exploration and mining could
reach Dollars 142m this year.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Taiwanese cast their nets wider
 -Pollution and overfishing has hit local catches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fishmongers at Keelung port's bustling fish market hawk scaly wares ranging
from imported Norwegian salmon to Pacific tuna and squid caught off the
Falkland Islands.
Pollution and overfishing of nearby waters has forced Taiwanese fishermen to
scour ever more distant shores. The catch of neighbouring China nearly
tripled from 1981 to 1990 to become the world's biggest fisheries producer.
Taiwan will soon sign an accord with the 15-nation South Pacific Forum
allowing its fishermen uniform access to waters controlled by those
countries, according to the country's ministerial-level Council of
Agriculture. The South Pacific is an important fishing ground for Taiwan,
especially for tuna and skipjack.
Forum members are Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Western Samoa,
Fiji, Vanuatu, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Cook Islands, Tonga,
Tuvalu, Nauru, Niue Island, the Solomon Islands and the Federated States of
Micronesia.
Since the United Nations switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing in
1971, Taiwan has encountered difficulties in securing fishing grounds,
especially from countries with which it does not have diplomatic ties.
In 1989 the quasi-governmental Overseas Fisheries Development Council was
set up to negotiate fishing rights and help settle an escalating number of
fishing disputes. The government has already secured fishing rights within
the 200-mile coastal zones of South Africa, Tuvalu, Tonga, Solomon Islands
and Marshall Islands, all countries with which Taiwan maintains diplomatic
relations.
Commercial fishing agreements have so far been reached with over 20
countries or territories, of which those with Indonesia, India and the
Falkland Islands are the most important. Talks are under way with several
other countries including Vietnam and Burma.
Although Taiwan does not appear in statistics compiled by the United
Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation, it ranked the 18th among fishing
nations in 1990, and falls within the top five in production of both tuna
and squid. Government efforts to curb growth in the domestic fishing
industry cut the total catch to 1.317m tonnes in 1991 from a 1990 peak of
1.455m. But production has risen since.
Taiwan, a major fish exporter, sold just over a quarter of its catch
overseas in 1993. Tuna dominated exports and the biggest markets were Japan,
Thailand and the US.
Fish imports have grown to meet increased domestic consumption resulting
from economic growth. Official figures show that Taiwan's imports more than
doubled over the past decade. Unofficial imports from China are also on the
rise. Taiwanese fishermen either pick up their illicit cargo from Chinese
ports or buy the fish from Chinese boats at sea and smuggle it into ports
such as Keelung.
With nearby waters depleted, nearly 60 per cent of the 1993 catch came from
distant seas. Tuna caught in distant seas through long-lining jumped 80 per
cent in 1993 from 1992. Last year's catch of squid, caught by a type of
hook-and-line method called zigging, climbed 22 per cent. The two species
combined comprised one-third of the total catch last year.
Despite Taiwan's pariah diplomatic status, which prevents it from joining
international organisations, the government generally complies with
international maritime and fishing conventions. For instance, it banned
whaling in 1983 and in 1993, it outlawed drift net fishing following a
United Nations resolution against the practice.
As competition grows fiercer for fewer fish, Taiwanese fishing boats have
encountered numerous disputes over fishing grounds from the South China Sea
to the South Atlantic.
Recognising the problems of overfishing, the government in 1989 instituted a
policy of trying to contain growth of the fishing industry. Through
restrictions on boat-building and a boat buyback programme Taiwan's fleet
was cut to 28,880 vessels last year from peak of 32,340 in 1990. But
remaining boats and those which are being built are more sophisticated and
thus have a higher catching capacity.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian smelter clean-up
stalled by cash shortage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norilsk, the world's biggest nickel producer, could not afford to renovate
its Pechenga smelter, one of the world's biggest polluters, in Russia's
Murmansk region, near the Finnish border, Mr Mars Altibaev, logistics
manager and the company's representative in London, said yesterday.
He said that was the main reason Norilsk, still 48 per cent owned by the
Russian government, was seeking foreign investment.
The company has retained a Scandinavian consortium including Elkem and
Kvarner Engineering of Norway and Boliden of Sweden to carry out the
Pechenga reconstruction, which Mr Altibaev said would cost a minimum of
USDollars 200m and up to Dollars 1.5bn, depending on what investment the
company could attract.
Pechenga spews out about 284,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide a year. Some
falls on the nearby town of Nikel but prevailing winds take two-thirds
across Finland and Norway where the acid rain it causes has severely damaged
forests.
Western observers suggest that the smelter, established in the 1930s and
renovated in the 1940s, has only a few years of life left. Pechenga produces
about 100,000 tonnes a year of nickel in matte (an intermediate material),
which is sent to Montshegorsk for refining.
Mr Altibaev said Norilsk was suffering from cash flow difficulties because
the central government took half the nickel output and paid in roubles at
the domestic price - 47 per cent below world prices. The government also
kept most of the income from its platinum group metals sales. The company's
inability to pay on time had caused strikes in the May to August period when
employees needed cash for their holidays. However, management had reached a
compromise agreement with the trade unions that should prevent future
strikes.
Norilsk claims, in documents prepared for presentations to London financial
institutions today, to account for 21.2 per cent of world nickel output; 3.2
per cent of copper production; 18.9 per cent of cobalt and 42 per cent of
platinum production.
Mr Altibaev said Russian nickel exports to the west would be about 100,000
to 105,000 tonnes this year, similar to 1993 levels. If nickel prices rose,
shipments would increase next year. He indicated that Norilsk's copper
production, once about 400,000 tonnes, would be less than 300,000 tonnes
this year of which up to 100,000 would be exported. He would not comment on
platinum or cobalt production and exports.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar deficit put at 1.8m
tonnes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world is expected to face another deficit year in sugar supplies after a
worsening in prospects for this year's crop, according to the latest report
by ED &amp; F. Man, the UK commodities house. Sugar production is forecast to be
110.7m tonnes for the next crop year (1994-1995) leaving a shortfall of 1.8m
tonnes.
World supplies are already tight after the unloading of stocks in the
current crop year when production of 109.03m tonnes led to a deficit of 2.2m
tonnes. The two deficit years come after 12 years' of production surpluses
with supply tightness already pushing prices higher.
A poor sugar crop in China and crop difficulties in Cuba combined with
India's desire to increase imports and rebuild stocks could all contribute
towards pushing prices higher. Man expects India's output to reach 11.6m
tonnes with consumption at 12.1m tonnes, leading to imports for next year at
similar levels to this year.
China's cane crop has been badly damaged by flooding this year and stocks
are dwindling. Man's estimate for Cuba's crop next year is 3.5m tonnes -
500,000 tonnes below this season's level pushing the country out of the top
ten producers.

FT  29 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Gold traders discount Russian
export move - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A headline indicating that Russia intended to stop exporting GOLD sent the
precious metal briefly to Dollars 400 a troy ounce yesterday. Once dealers
read the accompanying story, the price swiftly dropped back to close in
London at Dollars 395.50, up 10 cents.
Mr Valery Skripchenko, head of the scientific and technical department at
Russia's Precious Metals Committee, said: 'We will set up a mechanism before
the end of the year under which it will be unprofitable to sell gold abroad
but it will pay to sell it all domestically'.
Analysts argued that Russia needed all the foreign currency it could get,
and gold was one source, while it would take many years to develop a
domestic gold market. Also Russia had not been a substantial seller of gold
in the west this year, Mr Skripchenko said that Russia exported 6.6 tonnes
of gold in the first five months of 1994 compared with 21 tonnes in the same
months last year.
Substantial selling was seen when gold reached Dollars 398, dealers said.
One analyst suggested that it was significant that gold could not hold on to
a move through Dollars 400 despite the apparently bullish news from Russia.
At the London Metal Exchange most base metals ended the day on a firmer
footing following sprees of speculative buying and short-covering.
The three months delivery COPPER price briefly hit a high of Dollars 2,578 a
tonne but did not have enough upside momentum to trigger stop-loss nuying
orders hovering just above that level, dealers said. It ended the day
trading at Dollars 2,564 per tonne, up from Tuesday's Dollars 2,558 close.
Early Japanese buying and news that power to Alcoa's Portland smelter in
Victoria, Australia, would be trimmed and could restrain production helped
to underpin the ALUMINIUM market. The investment fund and consumer buying
that encouraged took the three months price to a high of Dollars 1,632 a
tonne; but it slipped back to end at Dollars 1,675, up Dollars 13.
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures ended weaker but off lows in sleepy
London trade as many investors retreated to the sidelines for lack of news,
traders said.
'The market is looking to stabilise around current levels,' said one dealer,
adding that it did not want to stray too far below Dollars 4,000 a tonne
because of the continuing uncertainty about Brazil's weather conditions.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Accountancy Column: 'True and fair view' in need of
refurbishment - Why a guiding principle is more relevant than ever in
today's business climate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To give a 'true and fair view' is the statutory objective of UK financial
reporting and, via the Fourth European Directive of 1978, the leading
accountancy principle in the European Union. Like most guiding concepts,
however, it defies agreed definition.
Unofficial attempts to pin it down swing wildly between the 13 paragraphs
once hammered out by the technical partners of the UK's Big Six accountancy
firms to more informal attempts to sum up its flexible nature as a
'make-believe compass'.
Standard setters, accountants and academics from nine countries met in
Oxford last week to consider 'The true and fair view: a European
retrospective'. Like most useful conferences it transcended its title and
discovered, oddly, that the real value of the true and fair view may lie in
its future use by regulators of financial reporting.
There was also some agreement that the real value of this principle to
accountancy within the EU could lie in its ability to rise above legal
definition and provide a principle which can be used in any country at any
time.
The need to revitalise the principle is obvious to anyone who takes a glance
at the many companies which have collapsed with no warning signs from
auditors who examined their health barely a few months before. The papers
retrospectively show that the auditor was very often aware of many of the
signs of impending doom - but said nothing publicly.
Before looking at some of the views expressed at Christ Church at the
conference, which was organised by the Chartered Association of Certified
Accountants, two questions need to be answered. Why true AND fair? And how
is true and fair incorporated into the Fourth Directive?
To answer the first question, there are various illustrations. Consider the
captain of a ship who records in the log that the first mate was drunk on
Monday. In revenge the first mate records in the log on Tuesday that the
captain was sober. This is true but hardly fair.
The answer to the second question is more complicated. The European Fourth
Directive's second article says that accounts should be drawn up according
to generally accepted accounting practices. If this fails to give a true and
fair view then notes must be added. In exceptional circumstances where these
disclosures are still insufficient, the true and fair view can be used to
'over-ride' other rules.
Again an illustration helps. The accounts should be a signpost to a true and
fair view. If the signpost points in the right direction but fails to give
you enough information to get to the destination then additional information
is needed. If it points in the wrong direction to start with, then the
'over-ride' comes into play.
The conference's principal speaker was Mrs Justice Arden, the co-author of
an influential legal opinion on the true and fair view. She saw the
principle as useful in the last resort to resolve disputes in 'penumbral'
areas of the law: 'When you have rules there are always going to be problems
at the edges and you need something like the true and fair view to resolve
them.'
She said that the definition of true and fair would be tested in the courts
and that the final decision of the judge would rest on expert evidence. The
opinion of the Accounting Standards Board would carry particular weight.
Karel van Hulle, head of accounting at the European Commission, revealed
that the inclusion of the true and fair view in the directive had been
initiated by the Dutch during the drafting process. He said that its main
role in the European context was as a safeguard to over regulation: a
principle to stand against a system of prescriptive rules  - the so-called
'cookbook'.
Van Hulle said that he was aware of about a dozen examples within the EU
where the true and fair over-ride had been used, but hoped the
FourthDirective would provide a flexible regime: 'We must allow companies to
be creative within limits.'
Graham Stacey, with 15 years practical experience of the true and fair view
as an auditor, was one of the technical partners who originally tried to
define the true and fair principle. He said the concept rested on providing
information to shareholders which was sufficient in quantity and quality to
meet their reasonable needs and expectations. He now saw a case for meeting
the needs of other users of accounts.
At the heart of this definition lies reasonable expectations - a concept
which changes over time and is often moulded by the standards set by
regulators. The content of the accounts may alter but the principle remains.
Stacey doubted that true and fair was a useful tool for practitioners at
all: 'The dominance of rules brings us towards being a cookbook country.'
However, the principle would be relevant if the regulators, such as the
Accounting Standards Board, altered public expectations of what accounts
should tell them.
Allan Cook, of the ASB, said that true and fair had many definitions, all of
which had a use. For him, its most important was to give direction and
authority to development in reporting requirements. He also saw it as a
signpost to commercial reality, a reporting obligation on preparers, and a
brake on the proliferation of rules. Within Europe he felt that the
principle could be a 'subtle instrument of change'.
Looking ahead, Doreen McBarnet, from the Oxford Centre for Socio-Legal
Studies, said that historically the more detailed rules became, the easier
it was to avoid them. Some terms were best left undefined.
A culture of rules gives rise to 'creative compliance', she said, and could
stimulate the need for regulators to develop a system of 'creative control'.
But the use of 'open textured' principles allowed the use of discretion on
the part of professionals.
Christopher Whelan, of Warwick University Law School, analysed the potential
role of the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the ASB's sister body, which
has the power to reprimand companies or take them to court if they breach
standards. He saw the true and fair view as a 'tool for the enforcers'.
The panel's problem, said Whelan, was that if it took companies to court
then a body of law would build up which would define the principle and
reduce its effectiveness. If it was bounded by law it would fail.
Professor Anthony Hopwood, from the London School of Economics, and
conference organiser with Dr Peter Walton, said the tone had been
'conciliatory' but illustrated the profound ignorance which still existed
about different accounting cultures.
He felt that the true and fair view was part of the 'archaeology of
accountancy', laid down in the past as part of a laissez-faire economic
culture. It was now capable of being excavated and providing a modern link
between accounting standards and the law.
Finally he asked: 'Are we asking too much of accountancy?'. He questioned
the role of accounts as the only source of information in the market and
wondered if alternatives, like newspapers less inhibited by libel or
ownership, might not play a bigger role.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Auction of benchmark gilt meets strong
demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bond prices were pushed higher yesterday after the successful
auction by the Bank of England of Pounds 2bn of new stock.
The auction - of 8 1/2 per cent gilts due 2005 - was covered 1.74 times,
close to market forecasts, and had a tail - the difference between the top
and average yield - of 1 basis point.
Unsatisfied demand for the bonds - which will become next year's benchmark -
after the auction drove prices higher. There were rumours in the market that
the Bank of England moved to meet this demand by supplying an extra Pounds
100m of gilts after the auction to help market-makers who found themselves
short of stock. One trader said: 'It is pretty rare for the Bank to sell
other stock on the day of an auction, and it has supplied stock right along
the yield curve.'
Traders believed that the Bank supplied Pounds 100m in total of the 7 per
stock due 2001, 9 per cent stock due 2011, and 8 per cent stock due 2013.
They believed much of the new gilt went to long-term investors, and then
marketmakers who had been selling futures against the new benchmark issue,
found themselves short of stock and needed to cover their positions.
'It has been a very technical market today, with a big squeeze. But cash
volumes have been pretty pathetic. There hasn't been a lot of profit in it.'
The December long gilt future moved up  29/32 to 99 15/16 before the close,
and the spread over bunds was 151 in late trading.
German government bonds followed US Treasuries upwards in the afternoon,
with the December bund future around 89.60 in late trading, up 0.60 point on
the day.
Mr Adrian Owens, European economist at Yamaichi said: 'The market had a much
better feel to it, and the floating-rate note was well received.'
The DM10bn floating-rate bond met strong demand, traders said.
A total of DM4.49bn was issued yesterday, after DM3bn was issued the day
before. The Bundesbank withheld DM2.5bn for market-tending purposes.
The performance of the Italian government bond market yesterday was a
reaction to domestic political events.
The yield on the 10-year bond fell by 15 basis points to 11.63 per cent on
hopes of a reduced government deficit heralded by agreement on a budget.
'The Italian soap opera continues,' said Mr Neil Williams, analyst at UBS in
London.
He said the market rallied by almost a point on the news that the
government's budget had been finalised for presentation to parliament, but
fell back on news that the trade unions were planning a short strike in
protest at pension cuts, and on news that the Northern League had
dissociated itself from the budget.
Mr Williams said: 'It will be a choppy ride from here on. The market will
continue to ebb and flow on rumours of the deficit. It is a fascinating
market to follow.'
US Treasury bonds regained their poise yesterday as traders ignored an
inconclusive report on durable goods orders.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/8 better
at 96 13/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.805 per cent. At the short end,
the two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 1/32 , to yield 6.50 per cent.
Bonds were stronger overnight after retreating the previous day on the
decision by the Federal Reserve to stand still with its current policy on
interest rates.
At the long end of the maturity range, Tuesday's inaction by the Fed had
brought a measure of disappointment. Holders of the most inflation-sensitive
securities would have preferred a more forceful response to recent signs of
economic acceleration.
Yesterday's economic news are essentially neutral for the Treasury market.
The Commerce Department said orders of goods built to last more than a year
had risen 6 per cent last month, against expectations of a 3.8 per cent
increase.
Bonds slipped on the headline figure, but quickly recovered. Most of the
unexpected surge was attributed to aircraft orders, perhaps the most
volatile of sectors. Without transportation, the August increase was only
2.3 per cent, a tame growth rate which traders were able to brush aside.
Bonds gained additional support from a firmer dollar and a well-bid auction
of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes. Despite a lukewarm reception for a
two-year sale the previous day, strong demand surfaced for yesterday
afternoon sale.
Afterwards, the long bond fell off its session highs amid some light
profit-taking.

FT  29 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: NICAM launches innovative
fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new type of open-ended mutual fund is available to UK institutional and
retail investors: the Nikko Japan Return Reversal Fund, run by Nikko
International Capital Management (NICAM). Investing in Japanese equities, it
aims to outperform the broad Tokyo stock market index, TOPIX.
Its investment strategy is based on 'mean reversion' theory, a concept
derived from statistical evidence which shows that the price of a share
tends to over or undershoot its intrinsic value, returning to its 'real'
value over time, NICAM states.
Research conducted by two American academics has shown this trend to be
particularly pronounced over the long term in the Japanese equity market,
they state. Nikko's fund therefore aims to select fundamentally undervalued
stocks at the bottom of their price cycle and capture their price recovery.
Given expectations of a stronger Japanese stock market performance as the
economic recovery gathers pace, 'the timing of the launch makes sense,' says
a London dealer.
The fund's investment strategy follows a three-stage approach to select the
stocks which are deemed most likely to increase in value and outperform
TOPIX.
It begins with the selection of the worst-performing 25 per cent of stocks
over the preceding eight years listed on the first section of the Tokyo
stock exchange.
Each stock is then measured to establish its level of undervaluation, and is
judged to establish its potential value for performance, in order to remove
stocks of fundamentally poor companies.
Finally, the stocks are assessed on the basis of specific fundamentals,
including net worth, risk, equity and financial solvency. The final
portfolio will consist of 60 to 80 stocks and will be rebalanced each
quarter to ensure that all stocks in the portfolio are likely to be
undervalued and that those which have already reached their peak are
removed.
NICAM launched an institutional offshore fund using the return reversal
strategy in February 1992, which, it says, has outperformed TOPIX by more
than 9 per cent and the Nikkei 225 index by 22 per cent.

FT  29 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Warm reception for Lebanon's debut
offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The launch yesterday of Lebanon's debut eurobond was a resounding success,
meeting so much investor interest that although the size of the issue was
increased, it failed to satisfy all the demand, market participants said.
After launching an initial Dollars 300m of the 10 1/8 per cent three-year
bonds, lead manager Merrill Lynch raised the size to Dollars 400m in
response to 'overwhelming' demand, according to a Merrill syndicate
official. 'The issuer wanted the deal to be tightly placed, and we convinced
them that even Dollars 400m would make no difference in terms of market
reception,' he said.
Indeed, the bonds saw keen demand from a wide variety of investors. 'There
has been a lot of demand from retail investors, several institutions in the
Gulf region, and the who's who of European funds and insurance companies,'
said the syndicate official. A large portion of the paper was said to have
been bought by Lebanese expatriates.
The bonds were priced to yield 325 basis points over the corresponding
Treasury bill, largely as expected. The spread on the bid price narrowed to
305 basis points over by the end of the day.
In the D-Mark sector, the African Development Bank issued DM300m of 7 1/4
per cent five-year bonds. Priced to yield 24 basis points over the 6 1/4 per
cent Treuhand notes, they saw good demand from German banks and investment
funds in Benelux countries and Switzerland, said Deutsche Bank.
Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley continued building the books for
the World Bank's DM2bn global bond, which is expected to have a five-year
maturity and be launched on Tuesday.
The D-Mark sector today could see the launch of a DM150m 10-year bond for a
government-guaranteed Japanese borrower.
Societe Generale Acceptance made a rare appearance in the sterling sector,
issuing Pounds 120m of 8 7/8 per cent three-year bonds. According to lead
manager HSBC Markets, the paper met with good demand from continental
European retail investors, who have recently shown keen interest in
short-dated sterling paper. The bonds were priced to yield 40 basis points
over the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 1997, which was widely deemed to be fair.

FT  29 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: EC in insurance rule move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has dismissed newspaper reports that recent European
Union rules on insurance companies' solvency requirements could harm the
Dollars 1,500bn eurobond market, Reuters reports.
According to the reports, insurance companies could lose their ability to
own eurobonds because a EU directive prohibits securities not traded in
regulated markets to amount to more than 10 per cent of assets qualifying
for the purpose of meeting solvency rules.
But a Commission spokeswoman said the rules allowed EU countries to classify
Eurobonds as securities 'susceptible to be traded' in EU exchanges.
The International Securities Market Association, the non-regulated market's
body, agreed with the Commission's interpretation and said that the problem
noticed in Britain could be solved.

US banking regulators plan to give bank employees who sell mutual funds and
other investment products an examination similar to that given to brokers by
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Reuter reports from
Washington.
The plan aims to ensure that bank employees give accurate information to
customers about the investment products they are buying, including risks of
buying funds that are not insured.
The US Comptroller of the Currency, Mr Eugene Ludwig, told a conference of
the Consumer Bankers Association that regulators are finalising details of
the testing programme.

FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Stet profits up 30% as state
sell-off set for next summer

<TEXT>
Stet, Italy's state-controlled telecommunications holding company, pushed up
profits by 30 per cent in the first half of 1994, as the process of
modernising the sector for further privatisation continued.
But the Italian government made clear yesterday that investors would have to
wait at least until the middle of next year before they have the opportunity
to buy further shares in the group, 65 per cent of which is still owned by
IRI, the Italian state holding company.
In the first half, Stet's profit before tax reached L2,695bn, (Dollars
1.73bn) taking account of the inclusion of Iritel, the vehicle for local
long distance telecoms operations which was transferred to the group from
direct government ownership in January. Removing Iritel from the results,
Stet's pre-tax profit rose to L2,325bn, an increase of 30 per cent compared
with the L1,788bn profit reported in the first six months of 1993.
The company also forecast yesterday that consolidated sales would increase
to L34,000bn for the full year, and that the net profit for the group would
be well above the 1993 profit of L3,284bn before tax.
The Italian government yesterday said further privatisation of Stet would
begin next summer. Stet and its subsidiary Telecom Italia, Italy's telecoms
operating company, are already two of the largest stocks quoted on the Milan
stock exchange and investors had hoped the sell-off would start at the
beginning of 1995, or even by the end of this year. Stet yesterday declined
to comment on the government's announcement.
Stet owns 60 per cent of Telecom Italia, newly formed from a merger between
state telecoms interests. But Stet's holdings also include software,
multimedia and equipment manufacturing operations, and international joint
ventures.
The group has managed to cut net debt in the first half from L22,085bn at
the end of 1993, to L20,754bn at June 30, and expects the figure to drop
below L20,000bn by the end of the year.
Meanwhile, investment has continued with L4,100bn spent in the first half,
and Stet said it expected to invest some L11,500bn during the year, funded
internally, against L9,708bn spent in 1993.

FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Natwest in move to acquire share
of Indian venture bank
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank of the UK is planning to invest about Pounds 10m
(Dollars 15.8m) in a newly-formed joint venture Indian bank. It is the
latest move by an international financial services group to take advantage
of India's economic liberalisation programme.
NatWest is proposing to take a 20 per cent stake in HDFC Bank, which is
promoted by the Housing Development Finance Corporation, India's largest
housing finance company. HDFC would hold 35 per cent.
The deal is expected to be signed in early October.
HDFC Bank is one of 10 new privately-owned banks licensed by the Indian
authorities as part of efforts by Mr PV Narasimha Rao, prime minister, to
liberalise the economy.
The authorities have also licensed five overseas banks - Dresdner Bank of
Germany, Chase Manhattan of the US, the Bank of Mauritius, the Development
Bank of Singapore and Denmark's ING Bank. Other banks, including Germany's
Commerzbank, are considering applying for licences.
NatWest and the other new entrants will join about 24 foreign banks already
operating in India, including Standard Chartered Bank of the UK,
Australian-owned ANZ Grindlays, and Citibank, American Express and Bank of
America from the US. Unlike most Indian-owned banks, foreign banks escaped
nationalisation in the 1970s, but suffered until recently from tight
operating restrictions.
The authorities might have granted new licences sooner had it not been for
the 1992 Rs40bn (Dollars 1.28bn) securities market scandal in which foreign
banks were accused of playing a prime role.
The Indian authorities hope that the new banks will increase competition.
India is dominated by 28 state-controlled banks holding 90 per cent of
banking assets. The encouragement given by the finance ministry and the
Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, to foreign banks comes in the face
of criticism from some politicians who have blamed all foreign banks for the
alleged wrongdoings of those involved in the securities scandal, such as
Standard Chartered Bank and Citibank.
Mr DR Mehta, a deputy director of the Reserve Bank of India, the central
bank, said India very much wanted to encourage competition from foreign
banks and would distinguish between scandal-affected banks and the rest.
NatWest, once represented in India through one of its forerunners, the
National Bank, sees the venture with HDFC as a better way of entering than
establishing a wholly-owned banking operation.
They also think it will be an advantage to be tied to a strong local partner
when bidding for government-related business such as privatisation.
The partners would offer shares to the new bank's employees, and to
employees and shareholders of HDFC. The bank would be floated on the stock
market early next year.
NatWest is also planning to open a representative or liaison office in
Bombay through which it could handle non-banking business such as capital
markets activities.

FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Dow bids for stake in east
German operation
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dow Deutschland, a subsidiary of Dow Chemical of the US, is seeking to buy a
majority stake in east Germany's former state oil and chemical operations
after it has completed an extensive evaluation study, company officials said
yesterday.
An investment by Dow, which has been seeking a foothold in eastern Germany
for some time, would boost prospects by the Treuhand privatisation agency to
find additional partners for the Leuna/Buna/Bohlen chemical complex in the
eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt.
In its letter of intent to the Treuhand, Dow has targeted its interest on
the steam cracker facilities at the Sachsische Olefinwerke in Bohlen, the
electrochemical units and derivative operations at Buna, in Schkopau, and
the polyolefin and intermediate chemical operations at Leuna.
The decision on what it will buy will be made by the end of the year.
All three facilities formed the nucleus of east Germany's chemical sector
under the former communists.
Since unification, the Treuhand has been engaged in a massive restructuring
programme aimed at attracting investors to install a new steam cracker
facility and oil refinery in the region.
Despite overcapacity in the chemical industry in Europe, a Dow official
said: 'East Germany is part of our long-term strategy in Europe.
'We are looking for a better position to serve all of Europe, not only west,
but also eastern Europe.'
The official added Germany's state and federal authorities were expected to
provide 'the normal grants' for such an investment. Dow's European
operations have an annual turnover of Dollars 4bn.
The Treuhand has been providing generous financial investment incentives for
the Leuna/Buna/Bohlen chemical sector in which 68,500 people had been
employed before 1990. This figure has sharply fallen to 12,300 through
closures, redundancies and early retirement schemes.
At the same time, the Treuhand, backed by the finance ministry, has picked
up the sector's DM3.5bn (Dollars 2.27bn) old debts and has provided a
further DM5.5bn in real investments which will increased to DM8.7bn by 1998.

FT  29 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Japanese warrants are down,
but not out - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Mark Twain might have put it, reports of the Japanese equity warrant
market's death are greatly exaggerated.
True, symptoms of an ailing market abound: the supply of bonds with warrants
attached has slowed markedly in recent months, warrants have severely
underperformed the underlying stock market of late and volatility has
declined sharply.
In this environment, Morgan Stanley recently stunned the trading community
with its decision to pull out of warrant market-making, the second defection
this year after Baring Brothers withdrew in January. In the D-Mark sector,
where only some 40 warrants are actively traded, Commerzbank announced early
this week that it, too, would stop market-making.
However, most market participants say the market is suffering only a
temporary malaise from which it will recover when the environment improves.
'It's been a difficult time, but the market has survived tough times before
and will do so again,' says a senior warrant dealer in London.
The market for Japanese equity warrants - call options on stocks, stripped
from bonds issued by Japanese companies and then traded independently - has
had its ups and downs.
Pushed to dizzy heights in the late 1980s by the raging bull run in Japanese
equities, warrants slumped when the Nikkei 225 index plunged from a high of
38,295 to a low of 20,222 in 1990, falling as low as 14,309 in 1992. They
have shadowed the stock market's lacklustre performance through the Japanese
recession.
Warrant issuance has fluctuated accordingly. From a high of Dollars 67bn in
1989, issuance slipped to Dollars 29bn in 1991, Dollars 16bn in 1993, and
has totalled a mere Dollars 8.2bn in the year to date, according to data
from Euromoney Bondware.
Meanwhile, the expiry of more than Dollars 100bn of warrants in the past two
years alone has meant that a significant number of maturing issues have not
been replaced, thus reducing the absolute number of actively traded
warrants.
This year's uninspiring performance of the underlying market hasn't helped.
After a spurt early in the year, the Nikkei 225 has languished in a narrow
range between 19,000 and 21,000.
'When the stock market is static and volatility falls, this erodes the time
value of the warrants, causing them to fall in price,' says Mr Cliff
Benford, head of trading in Far Eastern markets at Fleming Securities.
Warrants dramatically underperformed stocks in recent months. After reaching
a high of 1,093 on June 17, the DE Shaw Warrant Index fell by 37 per cent to
689 this week, compared with a 9.5 per cent drop in the Nikkei 225 during
the same period.
But according to Morgan Stanley, its main reason for pulling out was that
warrant market liquidity was drying up.
'We will continue to have a substantial presence in the market, both through
our client business and proprietary trading,' says Mr Charles Stonehill,
head of European equity operations at Morgan Stanley. 'But what we believe
is unattractive is a market-making requirement in a market of declining
liquidity.'
Following the liquidation of large warrant positions this year, some
investors' withdrawal from the market has rendered it less liquid, says Mr
Stonehill. 'You can't run a market for the benefit of the market makers -
you need to have some sophisticated investors. If liquidity comes from
market-makers dealing with each other, that's false liquidity.'
Others disagree. 'This is not a dealer-driven market, it's driven by
institutional investors - the dealers just provide additional liquidity,'
argues Mr Louis Salkind, managing director at DE Shaw Securities, one of the
biggest warrant market-makers. Moreover, he adds, there is actually more
liquidity in many warrants than in the underlying stocks.
Some say it's not so much the market's liquidity but its profitability, or
lack of it, that persuaded Morgan Stanley to stop making markets. They say
that houses with a well-established client base have been able to weather
the storm more easily than those with large proprietary trading books,
largely the big US houses, which have suffered most from this year's
downturn.
'The houses with huge hedge books have enjoyed great profits in the past,
and this is the first cold bath they've taken,' says Mr Benford. Since
Flemings' business is driven by institutional investor activity, 'we can sit
out these droughts - we're not affected by the drop in volatility because we
don't have a proprietary book', he says.
Warrants, which tend to he highly geared, are a favoured way for
hedge-traders to play the Japanese stock market. 'Warrants are a speculative
vehicle offering fast, liquid and leveraged exposure to the market,' says
one trader.
Meanwhile, the 11 remaining market-makers are expected to continue providing
a liquid market. The London-based warrant market-makers are Daiwa, Nikko,
Nomura, Yamaichi, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers, Robert Fleming, BZW,
Cresvale, DE Shaw and Smith New Court.
However, despite a chorus of soothing statements from the market-makers,
supply does remain an issue. New Japanese accounting rules, introduced in
April, which require that bond and warrant portions of new issues be
accounted for separately, were seen to increase the issuers' cost of funding
and have slowed the flow of issues, with the convertible bond market taking
up some of the slack.
While the new rules do alter the playing field, they don't justify
predictions of doom for the warrant market, according to Mr Salkind at DE
Shaw. 'While warrant issuance has dropped off substantially since the new
rules took effect . . . the recent shortage of warrant issues is probably
more reflective of seasonal patterns and bearish sentiment in the warrant
markets than a reaction to the changed regulatory environment.'
Moreover, as the convertible market, which has seen a rise in issuance in
recent months, approaches saturation, 'there is increased interest from
issuers who perceive the warrant market as still open for issuance,' says an
official at Nomura.
According to several market sources, the coming months are likely to see
some large dollar offerings which could revive the warrant market - provided
the stock market also shows some improvement and volatility recovers. 'We
need a pick-up in market volatility before we would regard the market as
generally cheap,' the Nomura official says.
Amid predictions of the market's recovery, even Morgan Stanley seems to be
keeping its options open. 'Though we don't feel optimistic about any
immediate change in market conditions, that could change,' says Mr
Stonehill. 'Some of these factors may be reversible, and if so, we will
re-evaluate our decision.'

Eltin, the Western Australian mining and earthmoving contractor, and Orion

floating the Salsigne gold project in France.
The companies, who were responding to a query from the Australian Stock
Exchange, said they had engaged the stockbroking company James Capel in
London to explore possible options, and expected its findings to be
presented within the next three months.
The project, near Carcassonne in south-west France, is the country's last
gold mine. Production has been budgeted to reach 90,000oz a year when full
capacity is reached.

<TEXT>
Alcoa of Australia, the alumina producer owned jointly by Alcoa in the US
and Western Mining Corporation, warned yesterday that cutbacks in production
at its Portland aluminium smelter could become permanent unless it secured
new power arrangements with the Victoria state authorities.
The smelter - a joint venture between Alcoa, the state government, China
International Trust Investment Corp (Citic), First National Resource Trust
and Marubeni Aluminium Australia - said it had been advised that the state
electricity commission would withdraw power supplied under a supplemental
agreement with effect from January 1. This, it said, would cause the smelter
to operate at an aluminium production capacity of around 300,000 tonnes a
year.
The smelter had already cut production by around 26,000 tonnes a year as a
part of the global initiative to reduce output in response to serious
international oversupply, but it was envisaged that this reduction would be
temporary.
The state authorities have been seeking to renegotiate the power
arrangements since May 1993. The smelter owners said they would 'welcome the
opportunity to agree on a satisfactory basis for acquiring additional
power', but offered to waive the three-month notice period so that the
withdrawal of the supplemental power would be effective immediately.

Borden, the US food group, said it would cut its quarterly dividend to a
maximum of Dollars 0.01 from Dollars 0.075 with its December 1 dividend
payment, Reuter reports from Cleveland.
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission outlining Borden's
definitive merger agreement with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co, the buy-out
specialist, notes that the board of directors 'has resolved that, until
resolved otherwise, the company will not declare, set aside or pay any
dividends other than quarterly dividends on the shares of common stock in
excess of Dollars 0.01 per share'.
Borden posted a restated 1993 loss of Dollars 630.7m, or Dollars 4.47 a
share.
Borden and KKR last week announced a definitive merger agreement under which
KKR would trade part of its stock in RJR Nabisco Holdings for all of
Borden's stock. Under the Dollars 2bn deal, valued at Dollars 14.25 per
Borden share, 41 per cent of Borden shareholders must approve the merger for
KKR to gain majority control.

FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Lean times spoil a free lunch on
Wall St - Securities houses are stepping up cost-cutting programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Monday, Lehman Brothers announced it was reviewing its 'meal-compensation
programme'. Translated into English, this meant the securities house had
decided it would no longer provide free lunches to its 1,500 sales and
trading staff.
The move, which follows similar cost-cutting measures by other securities
houses in recent months, was just the latest indication that Wall Street,
after enjoying three years of fat profits, is going through some lean times.
The attempt to rein in costs at Lehman go well beyond deciding to stop
paying for traders' pastrami-on-rye sandwiches. The firm, headed by Mr
Richard Fuld, also announced this week it was sacking 100 of its 300
domestic retail brokers as part of a restructuring of its private-client
business. It was just the latest in a round of cuts which has seen the firm
shed more than 700 jobs this year alone, out of workforce of more than
8,500.
Although the motives behind the redundancies at Lehman are unusual - since
it was spun-off from American Express in a public share offering earlier
this year, the management has been determined to trim the cost structure,
one of the more bloated on Wall Street - the securities industry as a whole
is facing up to an unpalatable fact: revenues are falling while expenses are
steady or rising.
This disturbing trend was most clearly illustrated last month when the New
York Stock Exchange released second-quarter results of its member firms.
Between them, the firms earned Dollars 16.4bn in revenues during the period,
down from Dollars 17.9bn in the same three months of 1993. Expenses,
however, rose from Dollars 15.6bn to Dollars 17bn.
As a result, NYSE firms - which together earned pre-tax profits of Dollars
2.4bn in the second quarter of last year - lost Dollars 622.8m between April
and June this year. It was the industry's worst quarter since 1987, the year
of the October stock-market crash.
Mindful of criticism that Wall Street has been slow to cut back on costs
during previous downturns in the earnings cycle, firms this year have been
quick to prune their payrolls. Aside from Lehman, other big houses which
have shed jobs recently include Merrill Lynch, CS First Boston, PaineWebber,
and Prudential Securities. Many of the cuts have been concentrated in the
fixed-income trading and sales side, where the worldwide bear market in
government and mortgage-backed securities has left firms with sharply lower
revenues - or, in some cases, losses - in their bond businesses.
The job reductions announced so far this year are unlikely to be the last,
say analysts, some of whom remain critical of firms' slowness in reacting to
the drop in revenues. Mr Michael Flanagan, who follows the securities
industry for Lipper Analytical in New York, says: 'The industry has been
slow in adjusting costs in the hope that conditions would turn upward
towards the end of the year. The possibility of that scenario developing now
appears remote. So, for the remainder of the year the industry is going to
be paying even more attention to cost control.'
The impact of some firms' inability to cut costs enough in the face of
falling revenues will be evident next month when Wall Street releases its
third-quarter results.
Last week, Lehman provided a foretaste when it reported earnings for its
fiscal third quarter, which ended on August 31. Revenues were down 19 per
cent as earnings from brokerage commissions, trading, and investment banking
all fell. Expenses, however, were down only 5 per cent from a year ago, and
Lehman's profits plunged 89 per cent to just Dollars 11m.
The results of other large firms are expected to be equally discouraging.
Since February, the rise in US and European interest rates, the troubles of
stock, bond and currency markets, and a drop-off in corporate debt and
equity issuance have all taken their toll on Wall Street's bottom line.
The only positive aspect of the current environment is the steadiness of
asset management revenues, and the robust health of the mergers and
acquisitions business, which is thriving in the wake of a series of
multi-million and billion dollar deals in the entertainment, defence,
healthcare and telecommunications industries.
These positive features, however, have not been enough to offset the
deterioration in other businesses: rising securities underwriting and
trading revenues fuelled the boom on Wall Street between 1991 and 1993, and
this is where firms are hurting the most today.
They have also begun to suffer in other areas, say analysts. According to Mr
Flanagan: 'The industry's poor results during the first two quarters of the
year were concentrated primarily in trading and underwriting categories.
Those two areas have not improved in the third quarter, and it's becoming
more evident that other revenue sources are also beginning to falter - such
as (broking) commissions and mutual fund sales. And the yield curve is
flattening somewhat, which will further depress net interest income for
firms.'
If the immediate future for Wall Street is not particularly bright, there is
cause for hope over the longer term. US interest rates will probably rise
further, but the current round of policy tightenings appears to be nearer
its end than its beginning - so stability could return to earnings as early
as next year. Also, for those big securities houses with formidable
presences in capital markets outside the US, long-term growth prospects are
even better.
Economists predict a steady increase in demand for capital worldwide over
the next decade, as less-developed economies in Latin America, eastern
Europe and east Asia push for growth. With a greater concentration of
expertise in raising money for corporations and governments on Wall Street
than anywhere else in the world, a small group of US firms led by Lehman,
Goldman Sachs, CS First Boston, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Salomon
Brothers should be well-placed to feed the global hunger for capital.

The Nicaraguan government expects to sell a 40 per cent stake in Telcor, the
national telecommunications company, by the end of the year, in what will be
the first telecoms privatisation in Central America.
Six foreign companies - France Telecom, Korea Telecom, AT&amp;T, GTE, Telefonica
de Espana, and Stet International - have pre-qualified for the sale. The
government will retain a 49 per cent share and the remaining 11 per cent
will be offered to Telcor's 3,300 employees on preferential terms.
Nicaragua has about 70,000 telephone subscribers and, at less than two lines
per 100 people, one of the lowest telephone densities in Latin America.
Investors, who will have management control of the company, must expand the
telephone network to 12 lines per 100 people by the end of the decade, says
Mr Hjalmar Ayestas, a consultant to Telcor.
The concession is expected to be granted for between 25 and 30 years, with
exclusivity for seven years.
Officials say the sale could raise more than Dollars 300m for the
government.
The Nicaraguan congress has yet to approve the sale. However, despite some
union opposition and scepticism from the Sandinista party, the bill is
expected to be approved next month.
Telcor has embarked on an ambitious modernisation programme over the past
three years, replacing an antiquated analogue network with a digital system.

Rinascente

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales at La Rinascente, the Italian retail group, rose 4.6 per cent to
L2,626bn (Dollars 1.7bn) in the first half of this year.
The group's hypermarkets, supermarkets and cash-and-carry stores, which
account for an increasing proportion of turnover, reported sales of
L1,734bn, up 6 per cent, while other outlets, including department stores,
turned over L891.2bn, up 2 per cent on the equivalent period.
Pre-tax profit edged up to L27bn in the first half of 1994, against L25.3bn.
The company said the imbalance between the first and second halves - with
the second six months accounting for most of the sales volume - made it
impossible to forecast full-year results.
Last year, net profits rose from L102.2bn to L105.3bn, although the results
were almost overshadowed by the sale of 33 per cent of the retailer by Fiat,
the automotive and industrial group headed by Mr Gianni Agnelli, to Ifil,
the Agnelli family's industrial holding company. The move was criticised by
investors.
La Rinascente has confirmed that Mr Luigi Arnaudo, the deputy chairman, was
now responsible for the operating management of the company.

Arco International Oil and Gas has signed a letter of intent with Corpoven,
a subsidiary of PDVSA, Venezuela's national oil company, covering the
development of a heavy oil project requiring total investments of Dollars
3.5bn.
The plan is to produce and upgrade heavy crude oil from Venezuela's Orinoco
Belt for export, reaching shipments of 200,000 barrels a day by 2004.
The Orinoco Belt, located north of the Orinoco River, holds the world's
largest known reserves of heavy oils and bitumen. PDVSA, which estimates
reserves in the belt at 1,200bn barrels, has assigned strategic importance
to developing this heavy oil potential.
Arco, a subsidiary of Atlantic Richfield of the US, and Corpoven plan to
upgrade heavy crude oil through a new industrial process to a lighter, more
valuable oil, and later blend the product with other Venezuelan crudes.
Exports are to be aimed mainly at US markets.

FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Sega and Atari link in wake of
patent row
</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sega Enterprises, the leading Japanese video game manufacturer, and Atari
Corporation, a US competitor, have agreed to form an 'affiliation' under
which Sega will purchase Dollars 40m of Atari stock.
Under the terms of the agreement, which follows the settlement of a patent
dispute, Sega will acquire an 8 per cent stake - about 4.7m shares - in
Atari. It will also pay close to Dollars 50m to acquire worldwide,
non-exclusive rights to more than 70 of Atari's patents.
Last year Atari filed suit against Sega, charging that its patent
controlling the way in which video-game action moves across the screen was
infringed by Sega. As part of the agreement, Atari will drop its legal
claims.
The companies also plan to license software for a specified number of video
games to one another, so that the games will be available for both Sega and
Atari machines.
The companies said the agreements, which are subject to regulatory approval,
will form the basis of a working relationship.
Atari said it would use some of the funds from the agreement to expand its
marketing programme for the important Christmas season. It hopes to gain
ground with its 64-bit game system, called Jaguar, which it claims is
technically superior to the 32-bit systems offered by Sega and Nintendo.
For Atari, an early leader in the video game market that lost ground to
Nintendo and Sega in the 1980s, the agreement provides a much needed cash
injection. In June, it said it had enough cash to fund its operations
through to the end of this year.
Atari's revenues plummeted to Dollars 28.8m last year, from Dollars 127.3m
in 1992, as it withdrew from the personal computer market. Losses in 1993
were Dollars 48.8m.
Sega's revenues for the year ended March 1994 were Y354bn (Dollars 3.6bn),
giving a pre-tax profit of Y42.5bn, down 23 per cent.

FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Cut in provisions and loan
losses helps bolster BCI
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Net profit at Banca Commerciale Italiana edged up in the first half of 1994
to L151.3bn (Dollars 96.5m), against L149.1bn in the equivalent period, as
the bank struggled against difficult trading conditions and narrowing
interest margins.
All Italian banks have been hit by the unfavourable environment, prompting a
series of poor half-year results, particularly in comparison with a strong
first half in 1993.
BCI's net operating profit fell 43 per cent to L356bn. Net non-interest
income was down to L651bn, against L783bn, and net interest income dropped
to L1,281bn, against L1,404bn.
Only reduced provisions and loan write-downs - down to L231bn against L274bn
 -and a lighter tax burden allowed the bank to push up net profits. However,
consolidated first-half net profits, declared for the first time this year,
fell to L177.6bn from L185bn .
However, BCI said it was well-placed to take advantage of any improvement
inthe trading environment, and was continuing to put pressure on costs.
Total deposits at BCI rose to L98,942bn, compared with L88,881bn at June 30
1993. Total funds under management, including deposits, stood at L245,000bn
against L220,000bn. However, loans to customers shrank from L54,319bn to
L49,117bn because of weak demand, while total loans rose to L86,929bn
against L84,941bn at the end of the first half of last year.
Last week, the bank completed a share issue which raised L1,575bn. The full
conversion of the attached warrants would bring in a further L787bn before
the end of next year.
BCI was controlled by Iri, the Italian state holding company, until March,
when the sale of the Iri stake raised some L2,700bn for the government. The
announcement of a discounted issue of shares and warrants in May, so soon
after the sell-off, was badly received by investors, but the share price has
recovered. Yesterday it closed at L4,081, against an opening price of
L3,977.
The issue was priced at L3,000 a share and the privatisation price was
L5,400.

FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Czechs to reopen talks on oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Czech government is to reopen talks with four international oil groups
on the future of the country's petroleum industry, breaking months of
deadlock over the role of foreign investment in the sector.
Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech trade and industry minister, said the
government is to 'create conditions for exclusive negotiations' between
Shell, Conoco, Agip and Total and the Czech Republic's two oil refineries,
Chemopetrol Litvinov and Kaucuk Kralupy.
If the negotiations are successful it will be an important breakthrough for
foreign companies seeking to invest in the country.
Opposition to foreign participation in the petroleum sector has come
especially from Chemapol, a monopoly importer of Russian oil, which tabled a
rival proposal for the industry and whose future could be under threat if
the foreign oil groups agree terms with the refineries.
Mr Dlouhy said the 'basic conditions and criteria' for the negotiations
would be announced by October 15 and would require approval by the council
of ministers.
They are expected to lead to agreement on a Dollars 700m investment package
for the industry.
Representatives of the four companies, which have been in negotiations with
the government for more than two years, described the announcement as 'a
substantial breakthrough' in their attempts to invest in the industry, which
is estimated to need up to Dollars 1bn to bring it up to international
standards.
The four companies have offered Dollars 180m for a 49 per cent stake in the
two refineries, which process most of the Czech Republic's oil requirements
using supplies of Russian oil.
They have also pledged to spend a further Dollars 520m on a five-year
investment programme of modernisation and environmental enhancement.
The announcement appears to be a victory for Mr Dlouhy and the privatisation
minister, Mr Jiri Skalicky, who have argued strongly for foreign
participation in the sector in opposition to ministers, including the prime
minister, Mr Vaclav Klaus, who favour keeping the oil refining and
petrochemical divisions of the industry together.

FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Asset deal gives Dutch group 33%
of Campari

<TEXT>
BolsWessanen, the Dutch food and beverages group, is to take a stake of at
least 33 per cent in Davide Campari-Milano, the maker of Campari, one of the
few remaining independent international drinks brands.
The Dutch company agreed yesterday to transfer its Italian brands and
production facilities to Campari in return for at least one third of the
privately-owned company, a stake worth an estimated L500bn-L600bn (Dollars
312m-Dollars 374).
BolsWessanen's Italian brands, which include Crodino, a leading
non-alcoholic aperitif, as well as sparkling wines, vermouth and mineral
waters, generate annual turnover equivalent to Fl 370m (Dollars 210m).
Campari, producer of Bitter Campari, Campari Soda and Campari Cordial, had
worldwide sales of Fl 450m in 1993.
The alliance between BolsWessanen and Campari is aimed first at the Italian
market, but should be a springboard for international co-operation in the
near future. 'The distribution networks of the both companies are
complementary on a worldwide basis,' they said yesterday.
Campari's private owners were initially reluctant to give up shares in the
group, which have been held by the Campari family or their inheritors since
the company's foundation in 1860. The Italian media has painted the deal as
a further assault on Italian brands by foreign companies.
Campari yesterday pointed out that well-known Italian brands such as Crodino
and Cynar, an artichoke-based liqueur, are coming back under Italian
control.
The deal is dependent on approval from Italy's anti-trust authorities.
If the transaction goes ahead as planned in late 1994 or January 1995, the
two will control 20 per cent of the bitters sector of the Italian spirits
market.

FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Alcatel warns of further decline
as profits tumble

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Alcatel Alsthom, the French engineering, transport and telecoms group,
yesterday warned of a sharp fall in full year profits to about FFr4bn
(Dollars 754m), compared with FFr7.06bn in 1993.
The announcement was prompted by losses at its German operations and
difficulties in Brazil and Turkey.
Mr Pierre Suard, chairman, said that the forecast confirmed his warning that
1994 would be a difficult year. But the expected decline is steeper than the
10 per cent to 20 per cent fall in net profits which he predicted in
January.
Announcing first-half profits of FFr2.02bn, a fall of 33 per cent on the
first six months of last year, the Alcatel chairman said that the
second-half results would be similar.
He cited three specific problem areas for the decline. In Germany, the
downturn had proved worse than had been expected in January. Mr Suard said
that depressed demand and prices should result in a fall in sales of about
20 per cent this year at SEL, its German subsidiary, and losses of about
Ecu200m (Dollars 162.7m). SEL is responding by restructuring its operations
and reducing the 20,000 workforce by about 20 per cent by the end of next
year.
The group's operations in Brazil and Turkey are each expected to suffer
exceptional losses of about FFr300m this year, Mr Suard said. In both
countries, government austerity programmes had depressed demand while rising
inflation had cut the value of contracts.
Mr Suard said that 1994 was likely to be the low point of the group's
fortunes and forecast an improvement in results in 1995. He said the company
had won more than 40 per cent of the supply contracts for a cable telephone
network in eastern Germany. In the US, Alcatel Network Systems had won
contracts with US telecoms groups such as Pacific Bell and Bell Atlantic.
The fall in profits comes at a sensitive time for the company. Mr Suard is
one of a number of French business leaders to have been investigated in
cases of alleged corruption, while his group is also engaged in a fierce
contest to win France's third mobile telecoms licence. Government officials
say a decision is expected soon.

<TEXT>
Stena Line, the world's biggest ferry operator, yesterday announced a 76 per
cent increase in profits to SKr476m (Dollars 64m) for the first eight
months.
It said it expected profits of around SKr500m for the full year, well ahead
of last year's SKr273m.
The group said market conditions in Scandinavia remained weak and there was
fierce price competition on its UK routes.
But these factors were more than offset by higher volumes, cost-cutting,
profits from a ship sale and lower financial costs. The group also said that
its 1993 figures had been hit by SKr55m in restructuring costs.
Turnover rose by 7 per cent to SKr6.67bn due mainly to increased volumes.
Passenger numbers rose 6 per cent to 10.9m from 10.3m, while freight traffic
climbed 8 per cent to 584,000 units.
Lines around the UK saw a 10 per cent increase in passenger volumes, but the
benefit was eroded by price-cutting in the run-up to the full opening of the
Channel Tunnel.
Scandinavian routes were affected by lower consumer spending and the weak
Swedish krona, which has affected travel between Sweden and Denmark/Germany.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Axa, the French insurance group, is to take majority control of Equitable,
the US life insurer, by the end of this year.
News of the move comes shortly after the September 19 expiry of a
stand-still agreement between the two companies.
Under that deal, Axa had been limited to a 49 per cent interest it acquired
in 1992.
The deal will take the French group's stake in the US insurer to 60.1 per
cent, and heralds the culmination of an ambitious move by Mr Claude Bebear,
Axa's chairman, to enter the US life insurance and investment market.
The 49 per cent interest, acquired for Dollars 600m at a time when Equitable
was struggling under the weight of underperforming junk bond and real estate
investments, is worth about Dollars 1.4bn.
Axa injected Dollars 1bn in all into Equitable, some in the form of
preference shares, as part of a rescue plan for the US insurer. Subject to
the approval of Equitable shareholders, the preference shares would be
converted into ordinary stock sometime before the end of the year, the US
insurer said on Tuesday.
The deal effectively brings forward Axa's assumption of full control over
the US group. Part of the preference stock was due to convert into ordinary
shares next July.
The timing of the deal could point to a further injection of capital by
Equitable into its core US life insurance subsidiary before the end of this
year.
At the end of 1993, the US life company had a regulatory capital ratio of
125 per cent, considerably lower than its main competitors. This was due
largely to its big real estate holdings.
The planned changes to Equitable's capital structure would strengthen its
balance sheet and cashflow, said Mr Richard Jenrette. One of his first
actions as chairman of the US group had been to negotiate the original deal
with Axa.
Equitable said it planned to file a shelf registration for Dollars 300m of
debt, a move which would further add to its cash resources and increase its
ability to inject capital into the life business.
Aside from the need to bring its regulatory capital position closer to the
level of its competitors, the US life business's demand for additional
capital has grown as its business has expanded.
Equitable has been one of the most successful US insurers in the variable
life and annuities business, one of the fastest-growing parts of the
personal investment market.

FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Escom forms alliance with SNI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Escom, one of Germany's fastest-growing personal computer companies, is to
team up with Siemens Nixdorf (SNI), the loss-making information technology
arm of the Siemens group.
SNI will buy a 10 per cent stake in Escom during a rights issue due in
November, and make between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of the smaller
company's PCs and notebooks, according to Mr Helmut Jost, Escom sales
director.
'At the bottom line, we will be left to concentrate on sales and marketing,
which has always been our main goal,' Mr Jost said.
The group, which last year sold 300,000 PCs and laptops, virtually all under
its own name, has more than 250 Escom Office retail outlets - about half in
Germany - was also negotiating a distribution agreement with the Otto
Versand mail order group, Mr Jost confirmed. But it was reviewing other
potential partnerships and franchise deals to expand distribution.
Although Mr Jost could not rule out SNI increasing its holding, he stressed
the 10 per cent level was fixed to ensure Escom could maintain an arm's
length relationship.
Many of SNI's early problems stemmed from a culture clash between the
conservatism of the Siemens group and the entrepreneurial Nixdorf
management. Losses have piled up since the 1990 merger, although
restructuring helped reduce the SNI deficit to DM419m (Dollars 272m) last
year on sales of DM12bn.
Escom, aiming for sales of DM1.55bn and about DM30m profits this year, is
Germany's second-largest PC retailer after Vobis, and last year had an 8 per
cent volume share of the domestic market.
The aim of the company's founder, Mr Manfred Schmitt, who will retain a
majority stake after the rights issue, is to win a 10 per cent to 15 per
cent stake in the European market. According to Mr Jost, this has become
more realistic now the company could concentrate on selling. 'We went into
the Netherlands last year and became number one within nine months,' he
said.
Speed is Escom's hallmark. Sales have increased at an annual average of 80
per cent since it was founded in 1989 but its enthusiasm outstripped its
ability to finance its ambitions from its resources. Following last year's
reversal into a stock exchange quotation via the takeover of the Hako photo
and video group, Escom's debts rose to DM251m from DM56m
Although the company had no problems with its banks, Mr Jost said, he
admitted the Siemens tie-up would make life easier in financial circles.
The link with SNI may free Escom's hand in its search for marketing
partners. Although Otto Versand remains keen, Mr Jost is not sure
computers-by-post is such a good idea. He is unperturbed by this month's
arrival in Germany of Gateway 2000, the large US direct-seller.

FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz enters reinsurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Daimler-Benz, the German industrial company, is setting up its own
reinsurance company to try to inject more competition into the industrial
insurance market and keep down rising premiums.
The move will be made through Debis, its service and computer software
subsidiary, which already has its own insurance operation serving Daimler
subsidiaries and outside customers. The new reinsurance company and a
reinsurance broking firm will be based in Luxembourg.
Daimler's decision comes as industrial companies in Germany are looking
closely at insurance premiums as they reassess their total operational
costs; other concerns like BASF chemicals also have reinsurance offshoots.
Siemens, the electrical and electronics group, has just switched a large
part of its fire risk business for next year from Allianz of Germany to
Factory Mutual of the US to save on premiums.
In recent years, German insurance companies have raised fire risk premiums
steeply to try to offset heavy losses resulting from over-capacity and
under-bidding.
Mr Hans Adam, a Debis director, linked the company's reinsurance decision
with the higher cost of fire insurance, the expense of product liability
insurance in the US, and increasing risks on the environmental liability
side.

   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aer Lingus, the Irish Republic's national airline, has put Team Aer Lingus,
its aircraft maintenance subsidiary, into examinership, the equivalent of
administration under Irish law.
The appointment of an examiner to the company which employs 1,800 people,
1,200 of whom have been laid off already, follows the breakdown of
negotiations between management and trade unions on restructuring.
Team Aer Lingus provides line maintenance for the Aer Lingus fleet but the
bulk of its business comes from aircraft overhaul work for other airlines.
The dispute is over the introduction of new work practices.
Team has accumulated losses of almost IPounds 58.5m (Pounds 57.8m) and a
deficit in its balance sheet of IPounds 18.3m. The failure of the
examinership process would almost certainly result in its liquidation
leading to the calling in of IPounds 22.8m of loans to Team guaranteed by
Aer Lingus. Team also owes IPounds 41.6m to its parent.
The examiner has three weeks in which to report to the Irish high court on
whether he believes a survival plan can be worked out.

FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Falling whisky prices cut Burn Stewart to
Pounds 4.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Falling whisky prices cut profits in half at Burn Stewart Distillers in the
year to July 3. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 8.12m to Pounds 4.19m on
sales ahead from Pounds 38m to Pounds 40.6m.
Mr Bill Thornton, chairman, described the year as 'the most testing in the
company's short history' following intense competition in the
value-for-money sector.
'Price pressure is doing serious damage to our profitability.'
Substantial changes had been made in company strategy, with the focus on
whisky bottled in Scotland. Cased sales in the UK and export markets were 43
per cent ahead by volume, and the company no longer depended on bulk sales
or a small group of customers.
'If they had sold at our 1991 bottled-in-Scotland prices profits would be at
record levels,' said Mr Thornton.
Of total sales by volume, only 18 per cent was accounted for by bulk exports
 -an area where the company feels reluctant to compete because of intense
price competition.
Bottled-in-Scotland sales accounted for the rest, with 48 per cent going to
own label customers and 34 per cent branded. While the overall reduction in
average cased prices was 2 per cent, this concealed a cut of 11 per cent in
own label prices.
Mr Thornton said there was a growing realisation that price discounting
could not go on forever, and he expected an improvement next year.
Operating profits fell from Pounds 9.66m to Pounds 5.79m, reflecting
increased costs of Pounds 34.8m (Pounds 28.3m) following investments in
sales and marketing.
The pre-tax figure included a gain of Pounds 298,000 from a disposal.
Interest payable rose from Pounds 1.54m to Pounds 1.9m.
Earnings per share fell from 9.53p to 5.20p.
The total dividend for the year is maintained at 5p, including an unchanged
final of 3.3p.

FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: MR-Data Management at Pounds 6.35m as
orders slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at MR-Data Management Group fell 27 per cent for the year to
June 30, from Pounds 8.76m to Pounds 6.35m, because of order slippage and
higher than expected restructuring costs.
The group had issued a warning in July which resulted in a 19 per cent fall
in the share price; yesterday the shares rose 6p to 135p.
Mr John Redmond, chairman, said: 'The effects of our reorganisation are
complete and we are now in a stronger position to market our business
services in the area of information management'.
Turnover was flat at Pounds 40.52m (Pounds 40.79m). Earnings per share were
8p (10.6p) and a dividend of 5.53p will be paid, 6.5 per cent ahead of the
previous 5.19p. Cash balances were Pounds 4.3m at the end of the year.
MR-Data, which operates in the UK and US, provides a range of bureau
services including large-scale laser printing, computer output on microfilm
and document scanning and transcription.
It also markets software for free-form text retrieval.
Mr Mike Elliott, chief executive, said restructuring charges had hit profits
at the document image processing division, which made a Pounds 480,000 loss.
Both the document filming and the map scanning businesses were now trading
on an appropriate cost base, he said.
Three orders for the company's Memex information retrieval software had been
delayed. One, for the National Criminal Intelligence Service, had now been
secured; the other two were expected to be concluded in the first half of
the current year.
The group is exploring moves into CD-ROM as an extension of its computer
output on microfilm (COM) business in the UK and US.

FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Beazer sales rise helps lift shares 6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The share price of Beazer Homes rose by more than 6 per cent to 131p after
Britain's fourth largest housebuilder announced that sales had risen by a
fifth since July 1 and had not been dented by the recent rise in interest
rates.
The company also announced better than expected pre-tax profits of Pounds
33.9m for the nine months to June 30. This compared with Pounds 37.8m for
the 12 months to the end of September 1993.
The City had been concerned that the rise of half a percentage point in
interest rates might have upset the housing market recovery following
comments by Tarmac on Tuesday that net reservations had halved during the
previous two weeks.
Mr Dennis Webb, Beazer's chief executive said: 'We have seen no sign of a
dip since interest rates increased and volume sales are up by 20 per cent
since June, compared with the corresponding 12 weeks last year.'
The company is selling homes from 40 more sites than at the same stage last
year following its Pounds 31m purchase of John Mowlem's housebuilding
operations.
Other large housebuilders yesterday agreed that sales had not fallen since
interest rates rose on September 12, although some said that the traditional
autumn surge had been more muted than expected.
Tarmac, the country's second biggest housebuilder, had said that its net
reservations, after allowing for cancellations, had fallen to between 50 and
70 a week, compared with between 100 and 150 before the interest rate rise.
Mr Victor Benjamin, Beazer's chairman, said yesterday: 'While it is too
early to evaluate the outcome of the recent interest rate increase, we
believe that in the current market it is uncertainty over interest rates
rather than the actual rates which unsettles consumer confidence.
'A further modest rate rise should not impact on sales, so long as the
national recovery is maintained.'
Beazer, which was floated earlier this year by Hanson, is paying a final net
dividend of 1.8p - which it says equates to 5.4p for a full year. Earnings
per share of 9.5p were equivalent to 12.7p for 12 months.
The company sold 4,015 homes over the nine months, at an average of Pounds
62,000 after sales incentives, against 4,805 homes sold in the previous 12
months. Operating margins fell marginally to 13.3 per cent (13.6 per cent).
COMMENT
The market had under-estimated the strength of Beazer's performance, hence
yesterday's bounce in the share price. Margins in particular have held up
better than the company forecast when it was floated. A strong balance
sheet, with about Pounds 60m of cash in hand after the Mowlem purchase, is a
very healthy position. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 56m puts the group on a
prospective p/e of just over 9, which still looks cheap. Longer term there
must be some concern about what a volume housebuilder does when the market
eventually turns down - hence Tarmac's decision to reduce the proportion of
capital employed in UK housing.

FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Williams pleases with acquisitions'
progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Williams Holdings yesterday announced its fifth acquisition in a year and
also told institutional investors that five recent purchases had improved
their profits contribution by an estimated Pounds 13m since joining the
group's stable.
Silvani, an Italian fire protection group, is being acquired for Pounds
16.5m. Mr Roger Carr, chief executive of Williams, said Silvani was 'an
essential part of the jigsaw' in building the group's fire protection
operation into a global business. It would add new products and markets, and
provide a solid base for further acquisitions in the sector.
His comments came at an institutional briefing, during which Williams sought
to set itself apart from the ranks of other diversified industrial groups.
Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman, said Williams had evolved into a focused industrial
manufacturing group, serving three sectors - fire protection, security and
building products.
The shares added 7p to 344p.
Mr Carr gave a progress report on five recent acquisitions in each of the
divisions, which together had cost Pounds 200m and had returned profits of
Pounds 19m. After reorganisation, at a total cost of Pounds 16m, the
businesses were generating an estimated Pounds 32m. 'And there are further
benefits to come in 1996,' said Mr Carr.
The charges for Solvay Woodcare, purchased for Pounds 64m in July, would be
slightly higher than expected at Pounds 6m.

FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Quality Software makes strong advance to
Pounds 604,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quality Software Products' shares rose 10p to 391p yesterday, as the
Gateshead-based accounting software developer more than quadrupled pre-tax
profits from Pounds 143,000 to Pounds 604,000 in the first half of 1994.
The results will be welcomed by investors concerned about the health of the
computing services sector in the wake of a series of disappointing results
from other companies, especially in financial software.
It also suggests that QSP is on track with Universal OLAS, a large-scale
accounting package which has cost the company about Pounds 16m to develop
over the past six years.
It has now sold the package to 19 clients at an average price of Pounds
200,000.
Turnover rose 10 per cent to Pounds 7.27m (Pounds 6.61m). Earnings per share
increased from 2.1p to 7.2p and an interim dividend of 1p is declared.
Gearing has been reduced to 21 per cent from 32 per cent.
The company has continued to invest heavily in Universal OLAS with Pounds
2.3m committed last year. The product, a modular system which runs on a
broad range of computing hardware and software, is now virtually complete
and new developments have been initiated to create support for executive
decision making and group working.
Mr Alan Mordain, chairman, said that good progress had been made in
increasing sales of products and services, expanding geographically and
obtaining reference sites.
QSP's US partner, Global Software, has made its first sale of Universal OLAS
to Avis in New York. It is expected that further partners will be announced
within 12 months.

FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Weinberg to head 'vulture' fund - New York
Life and St James's Place Capital create Pounds 100m venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Mark Weinberg, one of the leading figures in the UK life industry, is to
chair a new company with Pounds 100m capital to acquire life companies,
close them to new business and manage their existing funds.
The company is to be a joint venture with New York Life Worldwide, a
subsidiary of the fourth largest life insurance company in the United
States. It owns Windsor Life, which is already in this area of business in a
smaller way, having acquired six life companies in the past ten years.
When the plan was originally announced in November it was intended to link
up with a bank or building society as a way into 'bancassurance' - the
selling of financial products to bank or society customers through branch
networks. This is now to be pursued separately.
The main shareholders in the new company are St James's Place Capital, the
investment company run by Sir Mark and Lord Rothschild, and New York Life,
which is to transfer the closed fund business of Windsor Life.
Each will have a 30 per cent stake, while Scottish Amicable will subscribe
Pounds 10m, with other institutions expected to contribute the remaining
Pounds 30m.
Mr John Wybrew, the chairman of Windsor Life will be chief executive of the
new company. He expected the first acquisition within the next six months or
so.
He thought small and medium-sized mutually-owned insurers would be most
vulnerable, since they would suffer from their lack of access to capital.
The position of UK subsidiaries of foreign companies which have failed to
achieve critical mass was also highlighted.
The plan is a version of what is known in the life insurance sector as
'vulture life' because it depends on picking up life companies which cannot
survive on their own, and living off the business they have already
acquired. Combining the investments managed by separate companies should
bring cost savings.
Rising costs of meeting regulatory standards in selling financial products
against a background of intensifying competition have led many life insurers
to believe that the number of life companies open to new business will
sharply fall over the next few years.
Earlier this week, an analysis by Bacon &amp; Woodrow, the actuaries, suggested
that within a decade 40 per cent of life insurers would be struggling to
remain open.

FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help lift Adwest 21%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Acquisitions and a sharp rise in profits from its automotive side enabled
Adwest, which also has power systems and property divisions, to report a 21
per cent pre-tax advance for the year to June 30.
Group profits rose to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 9.42m) on turnover up by Pounds
10.6m to Pounds 147.9m. However, without the input from the five companies
acquired in the year - which contributed profits of Pounds 1.44m on turnover
of Pounds 10.6m - group operating profits would have fallen to Pounds 9.73m
(Pounds 10.5m).
Operating profits on the automotive side grew 45 per cent to Pounds 5.04m on
turnover up 10 per cent to Pounds 91.4m, while power systems fell 19 per
cent to Pounds 3.14m on turnover up 5 per cent at Pounds 53.5m. Property
profits slipped 6 per cent to Pounds 3m.
On why automotive had swung from profits 11 per cent lower in the first half
to 45 per cent ahead in the second, Mr Graham Menzies, chief executive,
explained that France in the first six months had been 'grotty'; by the end
of the year it became 'super'. Some Pounds 42m of turnover is in France. The
automotive acquisitions chipped in Pounds 580,000 and in the first half the
group had paid Pounds 350,000 due diligence costs for companies it did not
buy.
On the positive side, the success of the Land Rover Discovery helped lift
sales and improve margins and the thermostats business performed well. The
Rousseau jacks business had doubled turnover to Pounds 10m since
acquisition.
Slippage in defence demand lay behind the power systems fall. At the Pounds
22.2m rights issue in September 1993, defence accounted for more than 50 per
cent of power systems turnover. The acquisitions had cut that to under 30
per cent.
The property side would be retained, though not developed - it helped pay
the dividends, Mr Menzies said. A final of 5.4p (5.2p) lifts the total to
7.5p (7.2p), payable from earnings of 10.4p (10.5p).

FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Frogmore shares up 25p as net assets rise
26%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frogmore Estates yesterday surprised the stock market with a 26 per cent
rise in net assets for the year to June 30. Shares rose 25p to 444p in
response to figures which also showed a 54 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 16.4m.
The company spent Pounds 40m on acquisitions during the year, bringing total
expenditure to Pounds 155m since March 1992. Much of this was on retail
properties, which now account for 25 per cent of its property assets.
Mr Phillip Davies, managing director, said the company's retail properties
had shown especially good capital growth over the year. 'We have been very
deliberate in our acquisitions, always looking for an angle rather than just
picking up income-producing assets,' he said.
Frogmore also has a Pounds 115m portfolio of trading properties, which are
held for short-term gain and carried in the balance sheet at the lower of
cost or market value.
Investment in housebuilding joint ventures increased by Pounds 10m to Pounds
38m during the year and residential trading property assets now amount to
Pounds 41m. Mr Davies said the residential assets would be sold this year
following refurbishment, although this should contribute to trading profits.
Frogmore also plans to sell around 600 new homes this year, against 689.
Net rental income rose from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 20.1m during the year,
reflecting rents from acquired properties and additional lettings. Around
Pounds 2.2m annual income has been lost following early surrender of the
lease on 180,000 sq ft of office space in High Holborn for Pounds 7m cash.
The site is being considered for redevelopment.
Housebuilding contributed a gross profit Pounds 4.6m against Pounds 3.1m
last year. After a loss on sales of trading properties of Pounds 929,000
(Pounds 193,000 profit) and administrative expenses of Pounds 3.5m (Pounds
3m), operating profit for the year increased from Pounds 15.6m to Pounds
20.4m.
Net interest charges were higher at Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 5.1m) and taxation
lower at Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 2.4m) following the release of Pounds 3m
provisions. Earnings per share were 29.8p (21.1p). The final dividend is
13.2p (12.4p), making a total of 17p for the year.
COMMENT
Yesterday's pleasing increase in net assets will consolidate Frogmore's
reputation as one of the canniest companies in the sector. A June year-end
meant that yesterday's figures included the best of the rise in commercial
property values, but the company has outperformed the wider market. The
acquisitions made over the last two years look well-timed. Even if the
property market has gone off the boil, Frogmore's large portfolio of trading
properties and interests in housebuilding add spice to the earnings mix.
Yesterday's rise in the shares is fully justified.

Mr Bryan Castledine, chairman and chief executive, said the recovery in the

improvements market remained flat. There was also a first contribution from
eight branches acquired last year.
They contributed Pounds 1.3m to total turnover, which advanced 17 per cent

and the interim dividend was increased from 0.35p to 0.75p.

FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Cattle's Pounds 28m call to buy consumer
credit provider
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cattle's (Holdings) is to expand its consumer credit operations with the
acquisition of Welcome Group from London and Manchester, the financial
services company, for a consideration of up to Pounds 27.4m
The deal is to be financed by a 2-for-9 rights issue at 118p a share, which
will raise about Pounds 27.9m.
Cattle's shares closed down 7p at 135p yesterday.
Welcome provides monthly credit facilities, mostly unsecured personal loans
and hire purchase agreements.
It has a 39-strong branch network, concentrated in the Midlands and north of
England, and a customer base of about 33,000.
Cattle's main source of revenue, Shopacheck, makes smaller unsecured loans
and product sales, with repayments made weekly to an army of door-to-door
sales staff.
There are also marked differences in the rate of interest charged by the two
companies, with Welcome's rate anywhere between 20 and 50 per cent and
Cattle's more than 50 per cent, although the company pointed out that its
rates usually included administration and other fees.
Mr Edward Cran, Cattle's chief executive, said that Welcome would benefit
from the 44,000 customers who used Cattle's own monthly credit facility,
Shopaplan, which is run out of small retail out-lets.
He added that the co-operation between the group and London and Manchester,
in which they have used each other's customers as leads for new business,
would be developed.
Cattle's is paying an initial Pounds 21.4m for Welcome.
A further Pounds 2.5m is to be paid after three years, with an additional
Pounds 3.5m depending on the level of investment return generated by Welcome
by the end of 1996.
Welcome, which started trading five years ago, turned pre-tax losses of
Pounds 1.43m in 1991 into profits of Pounds 1.57m last year. Turnover nearly
tripled in that time from Pounds 15.7m to Pounds 45.53m.
Mr Cran said the deal would be earnings neutral in 1995. Analysts, who have
pencilled in pre-tax profits of about Pounds 26.5m for Cattle's in 1995,
said that it would require some Pounds 4m of profits from the new division
and a further Pounds 1m from Cattle's other recent purch-ase, Reedham, an
invoice factoring company, for that to happen.
Mr Cran, who said that current trading in both the Shopacheck business and
the two new acquisitions was at record levels, asserted: 'There should be no
problem whatsoever in achieving those kind of returns.'

FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: TI pays up to Pounds 19.4m for German
acquisition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TI Group, the specialist engineering company, has agreed to pay up to
DM47.4m (Pounds 19.4m) for Technoflow, which makes flexible fuel carrying
systems for European car manufacturers at plants in Germany and Spain.
Technoflow is being sold by Technoform, a private German engineering group
based in Kassel, to Bundy, the sector of TI which specialises in fluid
carrying systems.
Last year Technoflow made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2m on sales of Pounds
17m. It had net assets of Pounds 6m at the year-end.
TI is paying Pounds 5m for an initial 25 per cent stake and will acquire the
remaining share capital in two equal parts in 1995 and 1996.
Mr Karl Caprano, the chief executive of Technoflow, and the management have
agreed to stay with the company.

FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Cash calls send right signals - A report on
the announcement of further rights issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement of a further three rights issues yesterday, following
Monday's Pounds 235m cash call from Reckitt &amp; Colman, indicates renewed
corporate confidence in the demand for new shares, after the summer lull.
However, the number of such offers is likely to be linked increasingly to
mergers and acquisitions activity, as balance sheets are replenished by
record net cash inflows, due to the improving economic back-drop.
This week's issues have all been linked to corporate purchases, while last
year's record Pounds 11.4bn of rights money was more frequently applied to
patching up balance sheets.
In part, the change in motivation reflects a waning of institutional demand,
in the face of both an over-supply of flotations and the more volatile stock
market conditions.
Mr Richard Kersley, UK equity strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd
Securities, said: 'There is not the same wall of money that there was this
time last year, particularly from the overseas institutions.'
What money there is, has been drawn towards flotations. The Stock Exchange
estimates that Pounds 5.81bn was raised from rights issues in the first
eight months of the year, while the corresponding figure for flotations was
close to Pounds 9bn.
However, James Capel expects rights issue activity to pick up in the last
quarter, with a full-year forecast of Pounds 10bn.
This would represent almost 1.5 per cent of the stock market's
capitalisation at the start of the year, which is close to the average
figure since the late 1970s.
The attraction of raising funds through share issues might be expected to
increase with the turning of the UK interest rate cycle, which has raised
the cost of long-term bank money.
Analysts point out, however, that interest rates remain at an historically
low level. In addition, there is a limited need for cash.
Statistics released last week, show that UK industrial and commercial
companies generated a capital account surplus of Pounds 4.7bn in the first
quarter of 1994, and Pounds 4.78bn in the second quarter.
The figures demonstrate the highest level of corporate liquidity since the
late 1970s, a consequence of low interest costs and capital expenditure, and
the fact that earnings are increasing at a faster pace than dividends.
By comparison, the first half of 1993 saw a Pounds 1.75bn capital outflow,
although there was a Pounds 917m surplus for the full year.
As a result, there has been a sharp decline in the number of so-called
'rescue rights issues,' with the only substantial example being Eurotunnel.
Other large issues, from companies including Allied Lyons, Commercial Union,
Reckitt, Williams Holdings and GKN, and to a lesser extent Lasmo, have been
motivated by acquisitions.
Analysts predict that the improvement in corporate cash flow will result in
a substantial revival in takeover activity, since companies have recharged
their balance sheets.
This would increase the flow of rights issues, since the scars of the late
1980s can be seen in companies' preference for using capital markets rather
than banks to fund expansion.
M&amp;A activity peaked at Pounds 27.2bn in 1989, but had fallen to Pounds
7.06bn last year.
However, Hoare Govett is forecasting a recovery to about Pounds 11bn this
year. This should be matched by increases in the number of rights offerings.

FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Signet trims losses to Pounds 25.8m but
warns on weaker sales trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Signet, the jewellery group formerly known as Ratners, cut its interim
losses slightly but warned yesterday of a weaker sales trend continuing in
the US and softer September sales in the UK.
City analysts cut their forecasts for full-year profits from Pounds 20m to
Pounds 10m, and the shares closed 3 1/4 p down at 28 1/4 p.
The pre-tax loss for the six months to the end of July eased from Pounds
26.9m to Pounds 25.8m.
Included in the latest figures are trading losses of Pounds 4.65m at the
Salisburys luggage and handbag chain, which was sold last month, and a
related provision of Pounds 1.5m.
The group expects no further costs to arise from the disposal.
The operating loss on continuing activities fell from Pounds 7.32m to Pounds
3.06m. Sales were flat at Pounds 375.6m, compared with Pounds 375.9m
previously. Interest payments rose from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 16.6m.
Mr James McAdam, chairman, said it was too early to say whether the
softening US sales trend would make it more difficult for the group to trade
its way out of debt as the Christmas trading season would determine the
final result.
The group's attitude to a possible financial reconstruction remained the
same as at the annual general meeting in July.
'All our effort has been directed at trading,' Mr Mc-Adam said.
'If you do not have a cake in the first place there is no point in splitting
it up.'
However, Mr Julian Treger, an adviser to the UK Active Value Fund - a large
holder of US dollar convertible preference shares - said yesterday that the
capital structure was arguably holding the company back. He added that the
issue needed to be addressed in the interests of all shareholders. 'The risk
is, if they wait long enough there will not be a cake,' he said.
Preference dividends have not been paid since early 1992, and arrears now
stand at Pounds 78m. Net debt eased from Pounds 401.6m to Pounds 394.5m,
although the group attributed most of the improvement to exchange rate
movements.
The group now operates 616 stores in the UK, mainly trading as H Samuel and
Ernest Jones, and 909 in the US, where jewellery sales rose by 5 per cent to
Pounds 240.8m.
The closure of Ratners cut 102 stores from the UK total, the main reason
behind UK jewellery sales falling 7 per cent to Pounds 134.8m. UK
like-for-like sales were 3 per cent higher.
Mr McAdam said the group's reorganisation of the UK side of the business was
virtually complete. Signet is now completing the refurbishment of nine H
Samuel and five Ernest Jones branches, and plans to refurbish up to 150
stores next year.
The basic loss per share was 10.5p (10.9p).

FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: US flotation boosts Jefferson Smurfit -
Rights issue announced to raise IPounds 155m to help fund acquisition of
Cellulose du Pin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jefferson Smurfit Group, the Dublin-based paper and packaging company,
reported a surge in interim pre-tax profits, from IPounds 50.7m to IPounds
251.6m (Pounds 248.6m), thanks to the flotation of Jefferson Smurfit
Corporation in the US, in which it has retained a 46.5 per cent stake.
The company also announced an underwritten 1-for-10 rights issue to raise a
net IPounds 155m towards its IPounds 684m acquisition of Cellulose du Pin,
the paper and packaging operations of France's Compagnie Saint-Gobain, the
purchase of which propelled it to the top of the European corrugated paper
industry six weeks ago.
The rights price of IPounds 3.30 represents a discount to the market
especially after yesterday's rally, which took shares in London up 21p to
421p.
The group expressed optimism about growth prospects in its core markets.
'We've got a very bullish outlook for the second half. It is time for this
industry to start clawing back some of the losses it made in the past four
years,' said Mr Dermot Smurfit, joint chairman.
The results were buoyed by net exceptional credits of IPounds 206.9m,
representing the write-back of a provision made against its investment in
Jefferson Smurfit Corporation, which had been through a refinancing, and
taking into account other gains and costs relating to the flotation.
The underlying trading profit before interest and tax, including associate
companies, rose only modestly to IPounds 41.8m (IPounds 39m). But the
company indicated it expected to see strong cashflow coming through from its
operations as price increases were absorbed by the marketplace.
'The recovery of raw materials costs has been slower than we'd like, but it
is starting to happen in most of our major markets,' said Mr Smurfit. 'We're
not talking about price increases, but price recovery; bringing prices back
to where they used to be four to five years ago.'
Earnings per share rose from 7.4p to 51.6p, with the exceptional item
accounting for 44.6p. The company declared an interim dividend of 1.4p
(1.2p), a 17 per cent increase.
The group is looking to benefit from the industry's cyclical upturn over the
next few years.
'This year is not where it's at for the company. The full impact of strong
product price action and the real benefits of the US restructuring will only
flow through over the next couple of years,' said Mr Michael Moroney,
analyst at Goodbody's stockbrokers in Dublin.
COMMENT
Smurfit will take advantage of the paper industry's bounce back from
recession over the next couple of years. Full-year profits are forecast at
IPounds 100m-IPounds 110m, or 16.5p a share, giving a heady prospective p/e
of nearly 26. This drops sharply to about 12 on next year's earnings
forecasts, which go as high as 35p a share, buoyed by the price rises. The
acquisition could have been funded from debt, but the rights issue looks a
prudent move as it will give the acquisitive group some flexibility to look
for takeover targets in Germany, where it sees a gap in its European
portfolio.

FT  29 SEP 94 / National &amp; Provincial ousts chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David O'Brien resigned yesterday as chief executive of National &amp;
Provincial Building Society, after being told that the board wanted to
replace him with the society's finance director.
His successor is Mr Alistair Lyons, aged 40, who was brought into N&amp;P as
finance director by Mr O'Brien soon after his own arrival four years ago.
'We really felt we were moving from a stage where David's skills were very
valuable to a stage where Alistair's would be more appropriate,' Lord
Shuttleworth, N&amp;P chairman, said. 'When I communicated this to David, he
decided to resign.'
Mr O'Brien had a strikingly unconventional style of management in a sector
which is noted for a more traditional approach. Last year a clash of
cultures was cited as the reason for the collapse of the planned merger
between N&amp;P and Leeds Permanent, which would have created the UK's third
largest society.
In 1990 he had started a programme to re-design the society's operations,
and had developed a style based on teamwork and emphasising the focus on the
customer rather than the product. While he is widely credited for turning
around the performance of a society which had been in some difficulties
before his arrival, he was also seen as someone who created a potentially
unsettling climate of constant change.
N&amp;P's pre-tax profits increased 51 per cent in 1993 to reach Pounds 121m,
but at the same time its cost/income ratio rose sharply at a time when some
other large societies were seeing the ratio fall or remain broadly stable.
Lord Shuttleworth said N&amp;P, the eighth largest society, had gone through a
considerable time of change and saw the next stage as one of 'implementation
and consolidation of what we had achieved'.
Mr Lyons played down suggestions that his appointment would mark a
significant shift in direction for N&amp;P, but said he expected the pace of
change to be slower in future. Most of the building blocks for the society
to provide a wide range of financial services had already been put in place,
he said.
Mr O'Brien's abrupt departure means that he will qualify for severance pay
in compensation for loss of office, but the society said details had not
been agreed.

FT  29 SEP 94 / The Russians are coming, seeking Western investors:
Self-styled 'blue chips' want wider access to capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and LIAM HALLIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior managers of five of Russia's self-styled blue-chip companies will
today address institutional investors in London as part of a plan to attract
more European and US capital to the country's growing equity market.
Russia's newly listed companies are already attracting at least Dollars 500m
(Pounds 324m) a month from foreign investors, with numbers rising sharply in
the past few months following share price rises.
Some of the biggest companies are now seeking to improve their access to
international markets by issuing global depositary receipts (GDRs) during
1995. The five companies are part of the London 'roadshow' organised by
Moscow-based CA, a brokerage house founded in November 1990 and one of the
largest market-makers in Russian shares.
Unified Energy System of Russia, an energy company which controls more than
90 per cent of power generation and transmission and incorporates 69
regional utilities, power lines and other systems, is one of the largest.
Established as a joint stock company in December 1992, its shares have more
than doubled during the year. Western investors are already estimated by CA
to own 16 per cent of Unified Energy. Foreign investors also own a large
chunk - an estimated 6 per cent - of Norilsk Nickel, a mining company which
produces about a fifth of the world's output of nickel and cobalt. Some 11.5
per cent of the company's shares have already been sold and a further 10 to
15 per cent may be sold in the next year. The Siberian Far East Oil Company
(Sidanko) has grown to be the second largest oil company in Russia, behind
Lukoil, although it was only established in May 1994.
The Russian government is preparing to privatise Transneft, which controls
Russia's oil pipelines.
Almazy Rossii-Sakha, which controls Russia's largest diamond mine, has been
a joint stock company since May 1991.
Over the past few months investors, including a range of specialist funds
launched by US and UK institutions, have seen some spectacular returns, in
some cases of up to 600 per cent.
'A lot of negatives come out of Russia. People like to dwell on crime and
the pyramid selling scandals but there is a whole lot of brass among the
muck,' says Mr Richard Chenevix-Trench, head of emerging markets at Barings
Asset Management. It is planning to launch a Dollars 100m-Dollars 200m fund
for institutions next month.
Investors, however, must confront a series of problems and some unusual
risks. Most trading is over the counter. Price transparency is poor and
insider trading is common. According to CA, the government has only recently
begun to address the issue of securing property rights.
The quality of information at many companies is often weak, with Russian
managers frequently reluctant to give information or meet demands linked to
due diligence.
'In many cases we know the business of companies, but when it comes to
detailed accounts things are much hazier,' says Mr Chenevix-Trench. 'Valuing
these companies can be very difficult,' he adds.
The fact that privatisation was rapid in Russia means that employees and
managers often directly own large chunks of equity, minimising the extent to
which shareholders can influence the direction of the company. In
particular, these 'worker-manager alliances' are able to secure continued
government funding, given their responsibility for social services.
Many medium-sized and large firms are still responsible for the provision of
hospitals, schools and kindergartens for their workers. Companies continue
to carry out these functions despite privatisation. Vague notions of social
responsibilities are one reason why many assets are valued so cheaply.
Russian companies are now beginning to plan for the long term and a number
of banks are already planning GDR issues for Early next year. Utility
companies could follow suit in 1995.
Mr Victor Tokarenko, managing director of CA, says: 'We are now ready for
partnership with Western firms, not only speculative investment, but
strategic investment which is part of a long-term investment policy. We are
here to focus on investors interested in normal profit.'

FT  29 SEP 94 / US warns Wellcome on plant standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome, the UK drug company, has been warned by the Food and Drug
Administration, which controls the sale of prescription medicines in the US,
about manufacturing shortcomings in its main North American plant.
Wellcome shares fell 19p to 659p in spite of the company's assurances that
the FDA's concerns were 'fully addressed' at a meeting between the company
and the FDA earlier this month. Wellcome said the warning referred to the
monitoring of manufacturing processes rather than to products themselves.
It also did not cover the manufacture of pills, which make up most of the
company's sales and 'probably more than 90 per cent' of the output of
Zovirax, its top-selling anti-viral drug. Sales of Zovirax in the year
ending June 1994 were almost Pounds 900m.
FDA conducts lightning inspection of all manufacturing plants licensed to
make drugs for sale in the US. Warning letters are not especially unusual,
but Wellcome has not received any since 1979.
Wellcome's plant in Greenville, North Carolina, is one of only two that
makes virtually all the active ingredients in Wellcome's medicines. The
other is in the UK. The company said that after the meeting with the FDA on
September 8 it 'put in place immediate corrective measures. We are currently
in talks with the FDA to develop a long-term strategy to ensure that
standards are maintained.'

FT  29 SEP 94 / Chemical takes hard line on loans: Bank would shed market
share rather than relax terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chemical Banking is prepared to lose its dominance of the US syndicated
loans market rather than giving in to the pressure for looser terms,
according to Mr Walter Shipley, the bank's chairman and chief executive.
Mr Shipley said in an interview with the Financial Times that he had become
so worried at the deterioration in loan covenants in the world's biggest
syndicated loan market that Chemical might take strong measures.
He said this would include refusing to underwrite and lead manage loan
syndications where Chemical believed that covenants - the financial ratios
to which borrowing companies must adhere - did not provide enough
protection.
Margins on loans have narrowed sharply this year as banks have competed to
lend. Mr Shipley said Chemical was prepared to tolerate lower returns, but
that it was not prepared to compromise over covenants.
He said that although there had been 'some worrisome migration south' in
margins this year, he was primarily concerned at the 'rapid deterioration in
terms and conditions' attached to syndicated loans.
'It seems like the banking industry has a very short memory of the recent
past, and we are prepared to see our market leadership position go away
rather than chase down that path', he said in an interview in London.
Mr Shipley said he was primarily concerned to protect Chemical's reputation
as a high-quality underwriter. 'It is a question of being firm and
disciplined, and if we lose transactions, then that is banking', he said.
Although a number of senior bankers have expressed concern at conditions in
both the US and European syndicated loan markets, Chemical's strength is
such that it could give a decisive lead to other banks.
Chemical has established a dominant position in US syndicated loans since
the 1991 merger of Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover, and the bank
itself describes lending as the 'backbone' of its product range.
In the first quarter of 1994, Chemical syndicated Dollars 53.3bn (Pounds
33.8bn) of loans around the world, compared with Dollars 40.7bn of
syndications by Citicorp and Dollars 38.6bn by JP Morgan, according to
International Financing Review. Mr James Lee, Chemical's senior managing
director in charge of syndicated lending, has become a leading figure in the
market, with other banks describing Chemical as setting some of the most
aggressive terms. Chemical has just set a new European benchmark with an
Ecu6bn five-year facility for the kingdom of Spain at 4.5 basis points
(hundredths of a percentage point) over the London Interbank offered rate
(Libor).
The re-entry of smaller Japanese banks to international syndicated loan
markets has brought comparisons with conditions in the late 1980s, when loan
margins went down sharply as banks competed for business.
Banking regulators have started to warn of the dangers of deteriorating loan
covenants as banks faced with weak demand for loans have competed for
business in order to find a use for growing levels of capital.

FT  29 SEP 94 / UniChem eyes big time with Pounds 58m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UniChem, the acquisitive pharmaceuticals retailer and wholesaler, yesterday
announced a Pounds 58.4m rights issue to underpin its expansion as one of
Britain's largest suppliers of healthcare products.
The group plans to use the funds to wipe out short-term borrowings, acquire
retail outlets and move into other health-related businesses.
Acquisition strategies were cited in two other rights issues announced
yesterday by Jefferson Smurfit, the Irish paper and packaging company, and
Cattle's Holdings, the consumer credit group.
Smurfit outlined plans to raise IPounds 155m (Pounds 152m) to partly fund
its acquisition of the paper and packaging business of Compagnie de
Saint-Gobain, the French glass and building materials group, while Cattle's
said it was seeking Pounds 27.9m for the purchase of two new subsidiaries.
At UniChem, Mr Jeff Harris, chief executive, said the move was vital if the
group was to pursue an expansion which it started by spending Pounds 165.6m
on acquisitions and warehouse automation in the past three years, Pounds
49.9m of it in the six months to June 30.
Announcing a 17 per cent increase in first half profits, he said: 'We could
not maintain our growth without increased gearing or a rights issue. This is
the best option.'
UniChem slipped 22p to 276p after the group priced the one-for-six rights
issue at 245p - an 18 per cent discount to Tuesday's close. If fully taken
up, the issue of 24.4m shares - underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd and
UBS - would eliminate borrowings leaving the group with about Pounds 35.4m
in cash.
Most of the group's new funds are expected to be invested in new retail
outlets, although UniChem has targeted surgical equipment and hospital
supplies as areas for expansion.
While some City analysts welcomed the strategy, others warned that
government-imposed price cuts on prescription medicines and competition from
supermarkets and made the prospects for pharmacies uncertain.
'They should invest more in wholesale than retailing, that's where the
growth opportunities are,' said one analyst.
Improved performances at Unichem lifted interim pre-tax profits from Pounds
18m to Pounds 21m, on turnover ahead 11 per cent from Pounds 574.1m to
Pounds 637.7m.
The group, which is forecast to make full-year profits of about Pounds 44m,
shrugged off the effects of a 2.5 per cent price cut on prescription
medicines increasing operating margins from 3.37 per cent to 3.5 per cent.
Earnings per share rose from 8.6p to 9.6p basic or 9.3p (8.3p) fully
diluted. The interim dividend has been increased from 2.2p to 2.5p.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Clinton seeks to overturn Congress delay on Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton said yesterday he will ask the US Senate to remain in
session this year until legislation to implement the Uruguay Round trade
pact wins approval.
His move came after US approval for the creation of the World Trade
Organisation, a cornerstone of the 123-nation deal reached last December at
the end of the seven-year Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations,
ran into legislative difficulties.
'The US has to lead on this and I intend to do everything I can to see that
we do lead,' Mr Clinton said. The trade organisation is due to come into
existence in January 1995.
Enactment of the Uruguay Round deal is already delayed in the European Union
and Japan. Yesterday, its ratification by the US was threatened by the
decision of the chairman of a powerful Senate committee to hold it up until
the end of the Congressional session this autumn.
President Clinton said the legislation was supported by a majority in both
the House and the Senate and would pass once it came to a vote.
If the Senate's Democratic party leadership co-operated with him, the Senate
would recess briefly for the November 8 Congressional elections, rather than
close off its agenda with a formal adjournment, on October 7, as is normal
in advance of elections. Under this plan, Senators would then return after
the elections for a rare 'lame duck' sitting to pass the legislation.
The legislation, which was delivered to Congress on Tuesday, is expected to
pass swiftly through the House of Representatives, which would not have to
return after the elections. It passed two House committees yesterday.
The president's statement followed a move yesterday by Senator Ernest
Hollings, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, to delay the
legislation until after the Congressional adjournment set at present for
October 7.
As chairman of the committee, Senator Hollings has partial jurisdiction over
the legislation, which enables him to hold hearings on it for 45 days. He
said he planned extensive hearings and that the legislation would not come
to a vote this year.
Senator Hollings is a self-proclaimed protectionist who represents US
textile producers. It is possible that having made his point, he will hold
hearings for a few days or weeks and let the legislation come to a vote
before the elections.
The administration, weakened by partisan attacks on the president, has made
trade a centrepiece of its foreign policy. A defeat on Gatt could be more
serious over the long run than the devastating loss of the president's
healthcare legislation.
Delay in ratifying of the Uruguay Round deal has worried multinational
exporters who stand to gain the most from implementation of new trade rules.
In the environment of national cynicism, opponents have fanned the flames of
protectionism. If the Uruguay Round legislation is not passed this year, it
could face a more Republican and protectionist Congress.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Insults fly as Adams and Mates clash in TV debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was riveting political theatre. But at the end of last night's
unprecedented public confrontation between a Sinn Fein leader and a
government emissary there appeared to have been no progress along the road
to a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland.
The 15-minute televised debate between Mr Gerry Adams and Mr Michael Mates,
the former Northern Ireland minister, sent to the US to counter the Sinn
Fein president's two-week propaganda offensive, quickly degenerated into
point-scoring and insults.
For anyone viewing the encounter as a dry run for the talks that could take
place between the government and the IRA's political wing as soon as
December, the portents were not encouraging.
When it was all over, the clearest impression was that Mr Adams, whose voice
was until recently prevented from being heard on the British media by the
government's broadcasting ban, still had much to learn in terms of
communicating his message effectively on television.
To that extent, last night's event was a success for the more restrained Mr
Mates and went some way to vindicating the government's decision to dispatch
him to the US.
In the course of the bad-tempered exchanges, broadcast on BBC's Newsnight,
Mr Adams again refused to be drawn on whether the IRA's four-week-old
ceasefire was permanent, saying only that as far as he was concerned 'we are
in the final phase of this struggle'.
He tried to put pressure on the government to lift its exclusion order
preventing him from visiting the British mainland, saying it was 'silly and
bizarre' that the debate had to take place in New York. 'Why can't I come to
London to discuss this?' he asked. 'The banning order should be stopped
immediately.'
Mr Mates suggested that the ban could in time be lifted.
On the question of consent to an eventual settlement, there was no hint of a
narrowing of the gap between the two sides. Mr Mates said Northern Ireland's
future had to be settled with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland.
Mr Adams retorted that Britain should leave it to parties in Ireland and
Northern Ireland to decide how their right to self-determination was
exercised.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Fears for reform as Russian rouble falls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A further plunge in the value of the Russian rouble yesterday raised fears
that the country's economic reforms could be derailed and that the growing
confidence of foreign investors would be undermined.
The rouble fell 6 per cent on the Moscow interbank currency exchange,
closing at Rbs2,631 to the dollar. The latest fall means that the rouble has
lost 16.5 per cent against the dollar this month. The central bank, which
has spent Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.58bn) supporting the currency, has said it
will stop intervening to preserve the estimated Dollars 5bn hard currency
reserves.
The depreciation, which is expected to fuel an inflation rate of around 8
per cent this month after a low in August of 4 per cent, may force the
government into panic measures. It also risks delaying aid from
international financial institutions, which are likely to be wary of giving
money to a government which may no longer be seen to be in control of its
finances.
A senior western financial official in Moscow said: 'We may get a crisis
earlier than we expected because of what has happened on the rouble front .
. . it's starting to feel like loss of control.'
Senior officials in Washington, where Russian president Boris Yeltsin
discussed economic issues with US president Bill Clinton yesterday, echoed
the promise made on Monday by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, that
Russia could expect up to Dollars 10bn in immediate aid, mainly from the
International Monetary Fund, if it adopted a tough reform programme.
Muscovites yesterday queued at exchange points to change their roubles into
dollars at prices which at some points dropped to 2,750 to the dollar. Some
of those waiting said they no longer trusted the government to protect the
value of the rouble.
The fall in the currency was the largest since the 7.3 per cent drop which
came when Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister, left the government of
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin in January. The crisis may force the central bank to
push up interest rates, despite its wish to reduce rates to encourage
growth.

The creation of a new World Trade Organisation was put in jeopardy yesterday
after US legislative approval ran into serious difficulties.
The World Trade Organisation, a cornerstone of the deal reached last
December at the end of the seven-year Uruguay Round of multilateral trade
negotiations, was to have come into existence in January 1995.
Enactment of the deal is delayed in the European Union and Japan. Yesterday,
its ratification was threatened by the decision of the chairman of a
powerful US Senate committee to hold it up till the end of the present
Congressional session.
The US administration, weakened by partisan attacks on the president, has
made trade a centrepiece of its foreign policy. Defeat of the Uruguay Round
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal could be more serious in
the long run than the loss of President Clinton's healthcare legislation.
Senator Ernest Hollings, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which
has partial jurisdiction over the legislation, said there is 'no chance at
all' that the Senate will vote on the bill before it adjourns on October 7
for congressional elections.
The World Trade Organisation, agreed as part of the Uruguay Round and due to
supercede the GATT in January 1995, will be threatened by US delay. The
other main trading countries, including Japan and European Union members,
have also still to approve the Uruguay Round deal.
Delay has worried other governments and US exporters, the most politically
significant supporters of the trade agreement. Opponents have fanned the
flames of protectionism and isolationism. Gatt legislation next year may
face a more Republican and more protectionist Congress. Lawyers say it may
be difficult to re-introduce the legislation under the special fast-track
rules, which prohibit amendment.
Mr Clinton has met Senator Hollings, protectionist and longtime defender of
US textile producers, to urge his co-operation. The senator said yesterday
that he is planning 'a series of hearings' which will keep the bill stifled
in his committee. Under Senate rules, he can hold the bill up for 45 days.

FT  29 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Alcatel Alsthom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The news at Alcatel Alsthom goes from bad to worse. Not only were net
profits for the first half of 1994 a third lower than in the first half of
1993; the group expects second-half profits to stay at the same depressed
level. This means full-year profits will be down 40 per cent or more - much
worse than the 10-20 per cent decline forecast by the group in January.
The problems are in telecoms equipment, particularly in Germany. Deutsche
Telekom, which in the past has been an easy source of profits for Alcatel,
is driving harder bargains with suppliers as it prepares for privatisation.
Capital expenditure is being reined in and margins are being squeezed. The
snag is that margin pressure is not confined to Germany. It is only a matter
of time before other large Alcatel customers such as France Telecom and
Telecom Italia demand similar price cuts. As competition spreads through the
telecoms services market, operators can no longer afford to feather-bed
their suppliers.
The long-term prospects are not all bleak. Alcatel has a good position in
broad-band technology, which should prove a growth market as the race to
build multimedia superhighways gathers pace. It has also gained a leading
position in China, another fast-growing market. But China is a fiercely
competitive market with slim margins. Moreover, despite recent cost cutting,
Alcatel's organisation remains bloated. The group's shares, which have
dropped 37 per cent from their January peak, still look overvalued.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft has developed into the OJ Simpson saga of the German
corporate world, with each new lurid development subject to fascinated media
attention. Damaging headlines this week include a clash with a Nobel
prize-winning economist over the handling of last year's derivatives crisis
and a sharp profits downgrading from Deutsche Bank's research arm. The
shares revived yesterday but at DM134 they have fallen by more than a third
since the beginning of the month.
This performance reflects profound doubts about the pace of MG's recovery.
Nine months after his appointment as chief executive, Mr Kajo Neukirchen is
still fire-fighting. Recent deals, notably the unscrambling of MG's bizarre
ties to Castle Energy Corporation in the US and the sale of the group's
mining operations, have capped potential liabilities and raised cash. But,
as the group hinted earlier this month, a fresh injection of equity capital
is likely to be required before too long.
That is not the only concern. What is left after the succession of disposals
in the past nine months is an unexciting collection of low-margin
businesses, in sectors such as metals smelting, trading, plant engineering
and specialty chemicals. The modest returns will hardly allow a speedy
restoration of the dividend, especially given the need for further
rationalisation in smelting. It is small wonder investors are losing
patience.

FT  29 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: US bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult to see why the US bond market should have been in a positive
mood yesterday. The Federal Reserve's decision not to raise interest rates
on Tuesday night cannot be more than a temporary reprieve. Yesterday's
durable goods data may have been distorted by the auto and aircraft sectors,
but they still show underlying strength in manufacturing. On the most
pessimistic reading, the Fed is now dithering while the economy strides
ahead. There cannot be much comfort for the bond markets in that.
One explanation for yesterday's gains is that the market now believes in a
trade deal between Japan and the US which will remove the threat of
sanctions and allow the yen to fall. A weaker yen would be good news for
bond markets everywhere because it would encourage Japanese institutions to
step up their investment abroad. But for the time being, this scenario
smacks of wishful thinking. There would be a much greater chance of a weaker
yen and a robust Japanese recovery if the Bank of Japan were to cut interest
rates aggressively.
The chances are therefore that the bond markets will soon revert to their
old anxieties about the Fed's intentions. The question is now one of timing.
A welter of data in the second week of October will shed fresh light on
employment, capacity use and inflation. The Fed will then be under pressure
again to show its muscle. As before, a small increase would simply leave the
markets worrying about more rises to come. A large increase which signalled
the end of the tightening process would be the only real comfort.

FT  29 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Wellcome wobbles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Food and Drug Administration's warning letter to Wellcome about
manufacturing triggered painful memories of the crisis that engulfed Fisons.
However, Wellcome's FDA-related difficulties appear far less perilous. And,
unlike Fisons, it could supply products from elsewhere if forced to halt US
production. There are doubts about Wellcome, but complying with
manufacturing standards is among the least of them.
The most important question hanging over the company is whether it has a
viable independent future. Such doubts have been behind the bid speculation
that has driven up its share price by 32 per cent since April. Wellcome is
only the 24th largest drugs group in what is clearly an over-fragmented
industry. Within three years it will have to face the US patent expiry of
Zovirax, its biggest selling medicine. And its ability to launch new
products to compensate for Zovirax is in doubt; three drugs have dropped out
of the pipeline in recent months.
Such arguments are not compelling. Wellcome controls a commanding position
in the fast-growing anti-viral segment. Because of its near monopoly, the
group is almost wholly protected from the recent changes in the US market.
The company also has an impressive strategy for generating non-prescription
revenues from Zovirax after patent expiry. Finally, there are enough
promising products in the pipeline to carry the group forward after 1997.
Competitors may well look on with envy. Investors, disillusioned by the 18
per cent fall in the share price since the 1992 share issue, should show
more patience.

FT  29 SEP 94 / More skeletons in the closet: As the extent of its troubles
are revealed, David Buchan and Andrew Jack examine the malaise at Credit
Lyonnais
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the second time in six months, Credit Lyonnais, the embattled French
banking group, has been forced to call in its owner, the French state, for
help. This week, it set aside further heavy provisions against bad debts,
reporting a first half net loss of FFr4.5bn (Pounds 540m), proportionately
worse than the 1993 annual loss of FFr6.9bn.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, Credit Lyonnais chairman, conceded that the millstone
of the late 1980s and early 1990s - when the bank had made an uncontrolled
plunge into bad property lending, speculative film finance, and high-risk
and low-yielding investments in other state companies - was too heavy for
the bank to support alone.
Unless buoyed up again by the state, the ship of Credit Lyonnais would
almost certainly sink below the plimsoll line of the internationally agreed
solvency ratio of 8 per cent, and would almost equally certainly have great
difficulty in rising into profit in the near future.
The new rescue, like the one in March, is likely to be in the form of a
further capital injection and extra loan guarantees by the state. Even with
this summer's FFr4.9bn capital increase by the government and other
state-owned shareholders, the first-half loss has depressed the bank's
solvency ratio of shareholder funds to loan commitments to 8.1 per cent,
dangerously near the minimum. The state has now agreed that it would
recapitalise the bank if the latter incurred any further loss in the second
half of this year, Mr Peyrelevade said.
The chairman said the government had also agreed that, if this year's
overall loss threatened to exceed last year's FFr6.9bn level, the state
would step in to take further bad loans and risks off the bank's balance
sheet. In March some FFr40bn in doubtful property loans were put in a
special state-backed company, whose potential losses are underwritten by the
state to the tune of FFr14bn.
So the French government is already lumbered with a rescue package whose
potential cost nearly equals that of the FFr25bn by which it is hoping to
cut the 1995 budget deficit for the entire country.
In addition, some analysts are still sceptical that Mr Peyrelevade has
announced anything like the provisions he will have to make to cover the
legacy of the past.
'We feel that the process of going through the books by the management is
not yet rigorous enough, and the full provisions are not yet reflected in
these results,' Ms Susan Sternglass of Goldman Sachs said yesterday. With
last week's reports suggesting the bank may need to make further provisions
of up to FFr25bn, the government may yet be called on to make up much of the
additional shortfall.
Cynics would say that Mr Peyrelevade has played a game of high-stakes poker
with his shareholder, and won handsomely.
Certainly, it looked like poker. Three days before Credit Lyonnais was
initially scheduled to report its first-half results, Mr Peyrelevade went to
see the French Treasury which was expecting a pro forma meeting with the
bank chairman. But he apparently surprised and dismayed the Treasury
officials by telling them he could not finalise the bank's accounts, because
the need to make vastly higher provisions had just emerged. The new auditors
would only certify the accounts if the state promised new help, he added.
After a week of bargaining, the government gave in, and promised the help.
Cynics, again, would say that Mr Peyrelevade was exploiting the fact that
the French government could not possibly let the country's biggest bank go
under, with a balance sheet of nearly FFr2,000bn, equivalent to a quarter of
its gross domestic product.
Precisely the same concerns of systemic risk weigh, too, with those in the
European Commission charged with the general task of vetting state aid. They
are aware that a crash by Europe's biggest banking network would reverberate
throughout the EU.
A few French private banks moaned about state aid last March to Credit
Lyonnais, but they have kept quiet since, aware of how the group's problems
have helped drag down their share prices. In contrast to the airline sector,
where there is always British Airways to cry foul at aid to Air France,
Credit Lyonnais's banking competitors have stayed silent.
But Mr Peyrelevade has his price to pay, too, in personal pride and group
assets. This week he conceded 'a double error' of judgment when he took over
the banking group last November after the disastrous mismanagement of his
predecessor, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer. He said he had been wrong in thinking
that 'the latent risks (arising from the Haberer-era activities) could be
absorbed by Credit Lyonnais's current (banking) profits. But these profits
in 1994 look like being FFr2bn less than we estimated'. The other error was
to think that provisions against these risks could be 'staggered', a hope
that Mr Peyrelevade said the bank's new auditors had disabused him of.
Mr Peyrelevade also talked this week for the first time of selling off
parts, admittedly peripheral parts, of his group's core banking empire in
addition to the sales of its industrial holdings already in train. In the
first seven months of this year, Credit Lyonnais has shed FFr6.8bn in
non-bank assets. Mr Peyrelevade's target of selling FFr20bn of Credit
Lyonnais's FFr50bn industrial holdings now looks like a minimum. The smooth
withdrawal of such a big investor from the French market will not be easy,
with France still lacking capitalised pension funds to take up the slack.
But the Credit Lyonnais affair highlights other structural failings in
French banking groups, and in their regulation by the state. Defending
himself against the accusation that, for tactical reasons, he deliberately
kept the government in the dark until the last moment about the bank's
persistent problems, Mr Peyrelevade said: 'We told them (the government)
everything we knew, when we knew it.'
He had taken the long-overdue step early this year of instituting a
centralised risk-control committee for the Credit Lyonnais group to ensure
better future control. But he is still finding it difficult to keep track of
all the past skeletons falling out of the cupboards.
There are some specific reasons for this. One is Altus, a high-risk
investment house which is part of the group. Mr Jean-Francois Henin, who ran
Altus from 1990-93, prided himself on the fact that he had multiplied its
balance sheet many times over without increasing its staff. The result was a
chaotic back office, out of which dubious dossiers are still tumbling.
Credit Lyonnais said this week it was busily engaged in getting out of as
many of Altus's contracts as possible.
Another factor is its Societe de Banque Occidentale subsidiary's continuing
problems with recouping loans made to Mr Bernard Tapie, the deeply indebted
businessman-politician.
But perhaps the biggest reason for the accelerating clean-out of Credit
Lyonnais is the way in which the bank's branch managers and its new auditors
were responding to what Mr Peyrelevade termed 'the new climate'. They were
bringing to the surface all the bad loans and dud investments of the past.
Certainly, the push for more rigorous control appears to be coming from them
rather than from external regulators such as the Bank of France and its
Banking Commission, which were criticised by this summer's parliamentary
inquiry for being slow in diagnosing and acting on Credit Lyonnais's
problems.
Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the Bank of France governor, told MPs in May that he
had not wanted to present the problem publicly before announcing a solution.
He said that the authorities had felt it important 'not to announce the fire
before revealing the fire extinguisher'.
Mr Trichet said he smelt smoke in September 1992 when he was director of the
Treasury. But it was almost a year later before the Bank of France, as the
organisation formally responsible for banking supervision, wrote to the
government demanding that it rescue its bank.
As for the Banking Commission, it said it had started getting suspicious in
1991 after seeing Credit Lyonnais's balance sheet increase by 30 per cent
over the previous two years, with a 200 per cent rise in industrial
holdings.
However, the Credit Lyonnais affair raises doubt about the capacity of the
commission's 350 staff to keep track of hydra-headed institutions such as
Credit Lyonnais with 550 subsidiaries.
The commission put 10 people on to Credit Lyonnais, starting with its
subsidiaries. But they seem to have hit an information problem with CLBN,
the bank's Rotterdam subsidiary which, among other ventures, bankrolled the
ambitions of some dubious Italian financiers to buy MGM in Hollywood. Such
is the legacy of these ventures that they still accounted for a tenth of the
new FFr10.1bn provisions announced this week. Credit Lyonnais has now
retained the expensive services of Mr Henry Kissinger to help it find a
buyer for MGM.
Neither French nor Dutch regulators will elaborate on their exchanges about
CLBN, except that the Dutch central bank sought in 1989, and eventually got,
extra guarantees from Credit Lyonnais in Paris on CLBN loans, while the
French banking commission did try to get some information from its Dutch
counterparts.
Mr Jean-Louis Butsch, head of the Banking Commission, implied to the
parliamentary in-quiry that this was not very satisfactory. It was, he
noted, only at the start of 1993, when the European Union's Second Banking
Directive came into force, that 'professional secrecy vis-a-vis our EU
counterparts was lifted'.
Another effect of that directive has been to transfer prudential supervision
of a bank's branches to its country of origin. But that would not have
helped at CLBN which, as a separately incorporated subsidiary, stays under
Dutch control.
Mr Butsch's team has moved from one troubled subsidiary to another since
November 1991, finally advancing on Credit Lyonnais's headquarters on the
Boulevard des Italiens a year later for a six-month investigation. Even
then, however, the 1992-93 deterioration in the economy required the team to
make return visits to subsidiaries.
In general terms, the Banking Commission still sees no need to change its
regulatory procedures. But commercial banking sources said yesterday it
might have to respond to the example set by Credit Lyonnais's new auditors,
by publishing tougher and clearer general guidelines on provisions for other
French banks and their auditors to follow.
Out of Credit Lyonnais's problems may yet come another useful precedent for
other banks to follow. With first-half operating results down by 25 per cent
from the same period of 1993, the group appears to have a significant
problem in raising profitability on its core banking business. It shares
with other French banks working conditions still largely governed by
legislation dating from the 1930s. These treat bank employees like civil
servants, more or less guaranteeing them progressive promotion and firmly
setting their working hours. The managements of the main banks tried to
change this in 1989, but their common front against the banking unions
crumbled when Mr Haberer's Credit Lyonnais broke ranks.
'Peyrelevade now has the chance to use the shock of Credit Lyonnais's
problems to change our over-staffing and old-fashioned working rules, and to
provide better services,' said a commercial banker yesterday. In Mr
Peyrelevade's quest to reduce operating expenses, most of the headlines have
gone to the 1,000 job cuts he is making this year in the group's French
network.
But he has also negotiated a small experiment with his unions to let Credit
Lyonnais branches in Toulouse stay open in the evenings and on Saturday
mornings. With so much else about Credit Lyonnais that is execrable, this is
one area where it may prove exemplary.

Is England's oldest Roman Catholic school, St Edmund's College, about to
exchange its motto - Avita pro Fide (For the Ancient Faith) - for a new
catchphrase, 'Fill 'er Up'?
The Hertfordshire school, which has been providing a Catholic education
since 1568, is seeking planning permission for a petrol station and roadside
cafe next to a proposed bypass for the busy A10 London to Cambridge road.
Still, the diversification would fit in neatly with St Ed's advice to
departing pupils: they should 'have regard to the welfare of others and be

The state-owned BBC continues to do its bit for the development of
commercial radio. A recent triumph has been the moving of The Financial
World Tonight from Radio 4 to Radio Five Live at a later 11.45pm time slot.
The programme, which used to be required bed-time listening for City types,
had already lost fans when its slot was moved from 11.15pm to 9.45pm.
Since its latest move, the programme's weekly audience in the important
London market has dropped from 120,000 to about 26,000. All of this has
opened up an opportunity for London News, the successor to LBC. It has
poached BBC presenter Richard Shackleton to launch a nightly The Business
World Tonight. Tune in next Wednesday at 10.30pm.

Francisco Pizarro. The conquistadors of Mexico and Peru respectively were
ultimately responsible for flooding the country with gold and silver, thus
sapping Spain's 16th century industry and prostrating its economy with
soaring price rises.
Latin American central bank governors, gathered in Madrid for the IMF's

FT  29 SEP 94 / Observer: Say Hello to Jack's halo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jack Welch, boss of General Electric and patron saint of American
management, is under the media microscope. Time, Newsweek and Forbes all ran
lengthy pieces on him this week, and Fortune did a job on him a few weeks
back. All dealt with the same basic theme: whether the alleged fraudulent
trading at GE's broking subsidiary Kidder Peabody, which has cost GE
hundreds of millions of dollars, is evidence that Welch's halo has slipped.
This week's stories are mostly anodyne, and have an air of damage
limitation. The earlier Fortune cover story was hard-hitting; it blamed the
Kidder case squarely on GE's corporate culture and linked it with earlier
examples of corporate wrongdoing. Welch's hard-driving style, the piece
implied, might be forcing GE executives to cut corners.
Time, by contrast, interviewed Welch and concluded that he was still
basically OK. Forbes did the same and concluded he was absolutely fabulous.
Round one to Fortune, round two to GE's media relations people.
In fact, Fortune's case looks to be based on a false premise: that without
Welch, GE would be white as snow. Like many another old-established company,
GE has its roots in the days of cartels and monopolies. A recent book on
Welch, Control Your Destiny or Someone Else Will, remarks that when GE lost
its first anti-trust lawsuit in 1948 it only got its wrist slapped.
'Subsequently,' the book says, 'some GE middle managers imagined themselves
immune to punishment, expecting their bosses to wink at wrongdoing that
helped a business grow. Partly as a result, the company was caught many
times in illegal actions.'
Over the years, Welch has done a great deal to change the GE culture. The
job of GE people, he once told shareholders, is 'to set and meet aggressive
targets - always with unyielding integrity'. One more push, perhaps.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Paying for equality
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The courts are better at legal principles than they are at actuarial
science. The attempt to combine the two can lead to a muddle, as it did
yesterday when the European Court of Justice pronounced on a number of
issues arising in the wake of the Barber case, which involved sex equality
in pensions, on which the judgment was handed down in 1990.
Headline reactions are likely to focus on the issue of retrospection, under
which part-time employees are entitled to reinstatement in company schemes
as far back as 1976. This could cost UK companies up to Pounds 10bn on worst
case estimates. On closer inspection, however, these costs turn out to be
highly hypothetical, though still enough to worry certain financial
companies, like banks and insurance companies, which run non-contributory
schemes.
The more important consequence of the process of pension fund equalisation
is that women are, perversely, rather likely to end up worse off. For
instance, the Coloroll pension scheme trustees can now go ahead with paying
out equalised benefits, which means that at least in respect of service
after May 1990 women will receive slightly less of the available funds. Many
other terminated schemes of insolvent companies are in the same position.
Core workers
In many cases pension schemes have never been designed by employers to be
'fair', but to create discriminatory incentives intended to be in the
interests of the company - for instance, to direct extra benefits towards
core long-term workers rather than to temporary staff or part-timers. Where
such discrimination is based upon sex - but not on other factors - it is now
outlawed. But although discrimination against mostly female part-timers may
have been a practical consequence of their exclusion, it will never have
been explicitly recognised by the employer and may never even have been
intended.
Although part-timers excluded from pension schemes are now able to claim
retrospective inclusion, the employer will still be able to claim that no
sex discrimination was involved and this will have to be tested in the
national courts. Opinions vary on whether they will find it easy to make
their cases stand up.
So the apparent victory of the part-timers may yet prove pyrrhic, but even
so, the principle that employers should be subject to retrospective
judgments going back 18 years is obviously unacceptable. So long as
employers behaved reasonably in terms of general opinion and practice at the
time, they should not be vulnerable to unpredictable bolts from the
legalistic blue. If the European Court continues to behave like this, it
will be seen to have increased the risks of doing business in the EU, with
little justification.
Retrospective demands
Paradoxically, the original Barber judgment was implemented without
retrospection (only, however, after the separate Ten Oever case in 1993).
But part-time workers can now claim 18 years' worth of reinstatement. The
difference in treatment depends upon a distinction the European court has
drawn between benefits paid by a scheme and the right to join a scheme in
the first place. The latter happened to have been covered by another
judgment in 1986 which in turn related back to the 1976 judgment on the
enforceability of Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome. None of this
Euro-legalism will make much sense to the average British or German company
now faced with costly retrospective demands from part-timers.
Similarly, the rigid application of legal principles has led the court to
rule out any provision of transitional relief for women who find that the
Barber judgment has disadvantaged them. The reason is that the transitional
provisions would themselves involve sex discrimination. But this is not the
way in which employer/employee relations can be harmoniously conducted.
Nevertheless, the series of rulings published yesterday does at least
clarify many previously outstanding issues. That legal constraints should be
placed upon pension schemes in order to protect the interests of otherwise
vulnerable employees is sound enough in principle. But the European court
must find more flexible ways of handling such detailed and complex
commercial problems if it is not to become discredited.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Leading Article: An end to the rail strike
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Strikes are a no-win proposition in any industry. Once begun, however, the
rule for ending them is that everyone must emerge a winner. Yesterday's
welcome end to the rail signalworkers' dispute was no exception, with the
three main players all claiming victory. In truth, the battle has cost both
union and management dear. And the government for its part has no cause for
self-congratulation.
For the chairman of Railtrack, the state-owned company that runs British
Rail's track and signalling operations, the deal agreed with the
signalworkers' union in the early hours of yesterday morning was a 'victory
for commonsense'. For Mr Jimmy Knapp, union leader for the striking
signalworkers, it was his members' persistence that had won the day.
The package, like the dispute itself, is complicated enough for each claim
to have some merit. In the long term, Railtrack has won most, perhaps, in
achieving the much-needed reform of signalworkers' pay and conditions. The
workers are receiving less in return than the RMT first demanded, but can
claim to have delivered, by striking, an 8 per cent rise in average
earnings, if only for the current year.
Whatever the immediate tally of gains and losses, the entire industry will
suffer the effects of the dispute for years to come. Customers have had four
months to discover alternatives to rail transport; demand may never fully
recover.
Less appetising
That, and the Pounds 200m losses suffered by the rail operating companies,
will make rail franchises a considerably less appetising prospect for
private investors than previously hoped.
Clearly, things could have been worse. Had the dispute continued into next
week, striking signalworkers stood to lose valuable pension rights from
October 1 onwards. As far as Railtrack is concerned, restructuring of
working practice has always been an essential first step in building a
modern and profitable national rail network. Disputes about implementation
had already been simmering for seven years: allowing them to boil over
later, when privatisation was already in full swing, would doubtless have
been even more damaging.
Yet things could also have gone far better, had it not been for the
government's ill-judged interventions. In fact, the dispute could have ended
in early June, when both sides agreed a package, which Railtrack was
subsequently forced to retract.
A private company would always have chosen an early end to the dispute,
offering larger pay increases and recouping the extra cost with further
efficiency gains once employees were back at work. British Rail had not been
able to do this. Allowing BR's successor to strike such a deal at the
beginning of the summer would have vividly made the government's own case
for rail privatisation.
Problem-laden
But rather than using it as a test of its rail privatisation plans, the
government instead chose to view the affair as a test of its problem-laden
approach to constraining public sector pay.
The government claims that the agreed package for the signalworkers conforms
to the two central requirements which that policy imposes. The 3.7 per cent
addition to Railtrack's paybill pays for itself in efficiency gains, while
the basic 2.5 per cent pay increase is well within standards set earlier in
the year by pay rises in the rest of British Rail and elsewhere in the
public sector.
Deals which appeared to deliver much larger 'headline' pay increases to
individual workers could not be accepted by the government for fear of the
lessons which other public sector workers might draw. But this merely shows
how difficult it is for the government to combine its desire to broaden the
scope for a more flexible approach to individual public sector pay
agreements with the blunt instrument of its three-year freeze on public
sector pay bills overall.
Holding down public sector labour costs is central to the chancellor's
medium-term fiscal strategy. The post mortems on this sorry dispute will
drag on. But the chancellor has not been helped by being involved, even if
indirectly, in a needlessly drawn-out and unpopular strike.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Poll is not a blow to Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL RICHARDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The recent Newsnight/NOP poll was reported by you with the headline
'Blow for Labour in economy poll' (September 27).
Polling is not a precise science. Like gazing at tea leaves, much is left to
interpretation. The NOP poll reveals, for example, that 57 per cent of the
sample believe that personal taxes would either stay the same or go down
under a Labour government.
The poll shows that 63 per cent believe that the economy will be either
stronger, or about the same.
There is no room for complacency in the Labour camp, of course, but this
evidence was collated after the long summer parliamentary recess, before
Labour's conference, and only a few weeks after Tony Blair's election as
leader.
It is slightly unfair to report 'a blow' to Labour's economic credibility
when there has been no public platform as yet for Mr Blair's new approach.
As Labour's team begins to tackle the key issues of taxes and spending, the
NOP poll shows that Labour is starting from a credible base.
After all, even in 1992 Labour gained support from some unlikely quarters.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER J IRELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We couldn't agree more with Charles Batchelor's assessment (Survey of
Logistics, September 21) that corporations must apply the same cost-control
efforts to their logistics operations as they do to their other business
functions, if they wish to remain competitive in the 1990s. Just one glitch
in the distribution, inventory or customer delivery networks can mean the
loss of millions of dollar in profits and, perhaps just as important, of
customer confidence.
At my company, where costs associated with getting our products to customers
have increased in recent years relative to other costs, we've undertaken
what we call a 'Pathfinder' project to find more direct pathways to
customers and simplify logistics.
We've set a target of reducing costs by up to Dollars 80m by 1996. We will
do this by applying to our logistics operations the same work process
analyses that helped us overhaul our maintenance operations during the last
four years, with expected savings of about Dollars 60m a year. Early results
from the Pathfinder have been equally encouraging. By the end of the summer
we had identified 26 projects to improve our operations, and have already
realised annualised savings of nearly Dollars 5m.
Through this effort we expect to improve loading, scheduling and inventory
control and provide better customer service.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Book Review: Powerful threat of German weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY AND EUROPE: The Crisis of Unity
By David Marsh
William Heinemann, 236 pages, Pounds 17.99
Published in German as
Der zaudernde Riese: Deutschland in Europa,
C. Bertelsmann, 256 pages, DM39.80
German politicians, particularly Chancellor Helmut Kohl, grossly
underestimated the problems of transforming East Germany, and then made the
task harder still through misjudged policies, argues David Marsh in his book
on Germany and Europe.
In a shrewd and imaginative analysis of the impact of unity, Marsh develops
a persuasive underlying thesis - the main threat to Europe comes not from
German strength but from German weakness.
As Financial Times Bonn correspondent from 1986 to 1991 and European editor
since 1991, Marsh witnessed German unification and the hesitant moves
towards greater European unity at first hand.
The author provides a powerful account of how the decisiveness with which
Kohl seized the opportunity to merge the two Germanys politically deserted
him when it came to economic union.
In 1990, Kohl talked of 'flourishing landscapes' in the east within three or
four years, and promised unity without pain - 'no one will be worse off'.
The reality was different. The combination of monetary union at a one-to-one
rate, instant membership of the European Community, unrealistic wage rises
and the shrinkage of eastern markets led to the almost immediate collapse of
east German industry.
Economist Holger Schmieding described the impact on east Germany as
'probably the greatest economic crisis ever to befall an advanced industrial
economy in peace time', with a spectacular fall in output and employment.
Marsh describes how Kohl decided on immediate union overnight and then
forgot to, or decided not to, inform the Bundesbank. 'Seldom in the field of
economic history had a step of such consequence been prepared with so little
forethought.'
Against the advice of Karl Otto Pohl, then Bundesbank president, the
government went for a one-to-one conversion rate 'which gave 16m east
Germans the opportunity to satisfy their pent-up yearning for western
consumer goods, but simultaneously stripped them of the means to earn the
future incomes necessary to pay the bill'.
Disastrously, Kohl and his coalition government promised west Germans that
unification could be achieved without tax increases. When east German
industry collapsed, annual public transfers of DM150bn were needed from the
west to prop up income and consumption. This was largely financed by
borrowing (though, after the election, taxes were also increased) - so much
so that the public sector borrowing requirement soared from 1 per cent of
west German gross domestic product to 7 per cent in 1994.
This was not the only consequence of the failure to put the financing of
unification on a proper footing. The Bundesbank - taking, as required by
law, a strict view of its anti-inflationary responsibility - increased
interest rates three times in 1992 and again in July 1993. The west German
economy, the growing uncompetitiveness of which had been disguised by an
immediate consumption splurge, was plunged into a deep recession.
Marsh shows how the Bundesbank's tough policies, which may have been
necessary for Germany, fed through into other European economies where they
were inappropriate. High German interest rates prolonged European recession
and led to two exchange rate crises which weakened the European Monetary
System and delayed further the goal of European monetary union.
Marsh records a revealing telephone conversation that took place in October
1990 between John Major, at that time UK chancellor of the exchequer, and
Pohl before Britain joined the European exchange rate mechanism. The
Bundesbank made it clear that it thought sterling was overvalued at DM2.95.
Major replied that Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, insisted on going
in at that rate.
The author's judgment on Maastricht was that it was an understandable
attempt, led by the French and enthusiastically supported by Kohl, to bind
the new unified Germany into a 'European framework to make, in Thomas Mann's
phrase, 'a European Germany not a German Europe' '. But because unification
proved so much more difficult a task and had a much greater impact on the
rest of Europe than most European politicians had believed, it was
undermined almost from the start. Marsh argues that 'Europe will not be
united until Germany is united', and that Germany should concentrate on
making a success of unification.
The author presents a relatively optimistic scenario for the future. The
German system of corporate and social consensus will adapt itself to
necessary economic and industrial change. Self-sustaining growth will begin
in east Germany. The European Union, led by Germany, will shift its focus to
the eastern half of Europe and prepare to admit Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic. Plans for European economic and monetary union will be
postponed, although a D-Mark zone will emerge with the prospect of a single
currency in the form of the D-Mark.
'A prerequisite for an effective and self-confident Europe is an effective
and self-confident Germany with the ability to set the EC agenda along with
its main European partners, France and Britain,' the author concludes.
But how is that to come about if Germany is so preoccupied with its internal
problems, if France resents German leadership, and if Britain continues with
its traditional posture of continental reluctance? Maybe that is the subject
for another book.
The reviewer is Labour MP for Durham North. His own book on post-unification
Germany will be published next year

FT  29 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Government creating a PO problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report that ministers are 'determined' to go ahead with a 51 per
cent share sale of Royal Mail and Parcelforce - thus breaking the link with
Post Office Counters - must concern those who fear for the future of the
nationwide network of post offices ('Ministers determined to sell Post
Office stake', September 23).
Nearly all informed opinion, including large mail users, has been that this
preferred government option does not adequately respond to the needs of post
office customers, who must have continued access to some 19,000 outlets
nationwide.
Central to this is a concern that separating the Post Office will allow
Royal Mail to seek alternative outlets for its products. This will slowly
drain Post Office Counters' income, which will in turn force the business to
look closely at its 10,000 subsidised sub-post offices. We recently revealed
Post Office projections of 1,050 sub-post office closures by 1999.
The government has sought to generate enthusiasm for these plans by
guaranteeing the automation of benefit payments in sub-post offices.
Automation is welcomed and in urban areas will cut down on fraud and improve
efficiency. What automation cannot do in rural areas is increase the number
of customers who go into the local sub-office - there the number of
transactions is certain to decline as Royal Mail plc moves further away from
the separated counters business which it currently supports.
The green paper deliberately avoids foresight and imagination. It
concentrates on the issue of ownership when it should have proposed a
unified Post Office with genuine commercial freedoms to meet the changing
needs of customers.
We, like most other interested organisations, have argued that ownership of
the Post Office was never a problem - the government now intends to make it
one.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: The precise point of Irish interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr A J MCEVOY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Joe Rogaly, commenting on the future constitutional arrangement of the
'island nation(s)', ('Breakaway Britain', September 23) should start from
some minimal precision concerning the present arrangement. Constitutionally,
of course, 'Britain' does not exist.
In its beginnings, to consolidate the kingdom as it emerged from the Wars of
the Roses, England absorbed Wales; there remains a distinction on the rugby
field and linguistically, but a uniform legal system is accepted.
Later, to secure the Williamite coup and eliminate Jacobite pretensions,
Scotland was associated with England to form 'Great Britain', though some
distinctively Scots legal, ecclesiastical and educational structures
survive.
The 'United Kingdom' incorporating Ireland finds its origin in the Act of
Union, 1801, passed as a security measure during the French Revolutionary
and Napoleonic wars. With partition of Ireland and of Ulster, since part of
that province is in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland succeeded to
the role previously assigned to the whole island. Evidently that union,
between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which defines the present United
Kingdom lacks the antiquity, the consensus and the stability found within
Great Britain. And even there, the status of each nation is different.
It is interesting to compare the treatment of Scotland at the present day
with that administered to Ireland during the Repeal and Home Rule periods of
the 19th century, and speculate on its eventual consequences. Therefore,
aside from the lack of selfish economic and strategic interests in Northern
Ireland (Downing Street Declaration), there can be no doubt of London's
constitutional and political interest.

Sir, Lex ('Deferred tax', September 28) suggests replacing 'partial
provision' for deferred tax by 'full provision', with or without
discounting. But if the American standard is any guide, this could be very
complicated.
Deferred tax means income smoothing, which is often frowned on; and it fails
to meet the Accounting Standards Board's definition of a liability.
A better and simpler approach towards accounting for deferred tax is . . .
don't.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Calling the bond market bluff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Nobel Prize-winning American economist, Paul Samuelson, once said the
stock market was good at predicting economic downturns; so good that it had
predicted five out of the last three recessions.
His point was, of course, that although financial markets contain useful
information, they can often be wrong and should not be followed blindly. It
is time to make the same point more loudly in relation to bond markets,
financial futures markets and all the other markets which deal at one remove
or another with fixed interest rate securities of varying maturity.
One sometimes has the impression that the whole of economic policy is a play
acted in front of a financial market audience. A Treasury permanent
secretary, whom I visited in the pre-Thatcher days of 'unbelieving
monetarism', had a pile of reports on his desk from the leading city
monetary analysts of the day. The permanent secretary probably did not
believe a single word, but he wanted to read them because he feared they
influenced the price of sterling.
The markets that are now putting the fear of God into central bankers and
finance ministers are no longer the foreign exchange markets but the bond
markets. The latter are said to be afraid of the resurgence of world
inflation, in spite of widespread evidence of an anti-inflationary climate
in which intended price and pay increases are difficult to implement. The US
is further along the economic cycle and displays more evidence of
inflationary tendencies than Europe - let alone Japan where deflation is the
main threat. But the Federal Reserve deserves some cheers for making its own
decisions on the pace and extent of monetary tightening and for not simply
reacting to the bond markets and their spokesmen.
How good are the bond markets at predicting inflation? The top chart shows
UK inflationary expectations, based on the difference beteen the yields on
conventional gilt-edged securities and the yield on indexed bonds. Because
the inflationary expectation relates to a 10-year average, caution is
required. But if the gilt-edged market is correctly signalling an increase
in inflation, it is likely that recorded inflation rates will start to rise
before too long.
The forecasting record of UK gilts is decidedly mixed. In the late 1980s,
inflationary expectations were above actual inflation, but the gilt market
forecast gave no warning of an inflationary boom until that boom had almost
burst in 1990. Nor did the gilt-edged market anticipate the steepness of the
fall in UK inflation in the early 1990s.
In earlier years there were no indexed gilts to provide independent evidence
of real interest rates. But nominal yields gave little warning of the lax
monetary and fiscal policies of the early 1970s, until 20 per cent-plus
inflation was almost upon the UK. Once positive real yields reappeared in
the 1980s they gave little clue to the inflation cycle but were just
erratically following actual events.
I could not resist looking for comparison at an indicator that does not
claim to peer ahead, but which does provide insight into what is actually
happening: namely, some measure of total spending in nominal terms.
Reflection suggests that the least bad measure is not nominal gross domestic
product, but a variant known as domestic expenditure. This has two principal
advantages for policy purposes. First, it excludes net exports (that is
exports minus imports) and concentrates on domestic monetary flows that
national authorities can influence. Second, an objective for domestic
expenditure alone will leave room for an improvement in the balance of
payments, without having any specific target for that balance.
Some economists regard the mixture of real and inflation variables in a
domestic expenditure target as a drawback. But from a policy point of view
it is an advantage. For it recognises that official monetary policies can
only help provide the conditions for non-inflationary growth. How far a
given flow of spending translates into more real output and jobs, and how
far it is dissipated in price and pay increases, depends on the actions of
economic agents such as businesses and trade unions.
The result of plotting domestic expenditure is better than anything that
could have been be expected. The third chart, which is a half-yearly moving
average, shows that this measure uncannily tracks the course of the 1990
recession, the subsequent recovery and the fact that domestic ex-penditure
is still only grow-ing at just over 5 per cent a year.
One should avoid a monomanic approach. For instance, the third chart
suggests that the UK is on course for a moderate non-inflationary expansion
and does not on its own support a base-rate increase. But if it is taken in
conjunction with material and commodity prices, industrial capacity surveys
and other forward-looking indicators (including bond yields as one indicator
among many), there is some justification for the pre-emptive moderate
base-rate increase that took place earlier this month.
Precisely because the third chart appears too good to be true, the fourth
chart plots the cruder year-on-year domestic expenditure increases over two
and a half decades. The fit is still reasonable. It shows, for instance, the
quickening pace of the boom from 1985 onwards, even though the impact was
first borne by the balance of payments and the effect on measured inflat-ion
did not appear until 1988-90.
Obviously there would be difficulties in practical monitoring. National
income statistics are published with a lag and are afterwards revised. But
they could be improved if there were sufficient interest; and they can be
estimated for recent and current periods where there are still no published
figures.
Some defeatists nevertheless suppose that governments and central banks have
no alternative but to follow financial-market expectations. For instance,
forward contracts suggest that the UK base rates will be 7 per cent early
next year and will then rise towards 9 per cent.
Central banks are not, however, compelled to do what the bond markets appear
to be telling them to do. Since the beginning of 1994 world long-term bond
yields have risen by 2-3 percentage points. About 1 percentage point
represents a rise in real interest rates, perhaps reflecting a world capital
shortage - which was prematurely diagnosed two or three years ago.
The remainder of the rise in bond yields represents the increased inflation
premium. Market opinion here deserves to be taken seriously, but not
followed as if it were the word of God. The bond markets may be fighting the
last war when they see inflation round every corner. Bondholders and dealers
can still be as wrong as economic forecasters or finance ministers. Central
bankers can and should be prepared to buck the market so long as they
realise that, if they are wrong and the markets are vindicated, there will
be a high price to pay in lost public standing. This time round central
bankers will not be able to make scapegoats of governments or finance
ministers.
In the end, either bond rates will come down or short-term interest rates
will rise to meet them. If the Bundesbank or Bank of England is convinced
that bond markets are wrong and inflation will not on average be much above
2 1/2 per cent a year, then they should act on their beliefs - which means
doing as little as possible. If they are not so convinced, they should
tighten policy until they are.

Two rather momentous events today, one of which may already have passed you
by. Chris Evans makes his final appearance on The Big Breakfast this
morning. His manic, cartoon-like, personality, as subtle as a Big Mac, may
not charm everyone but it lifted Channel 4's breakfast programmes out of the
doldrums and gave the nation a new cult figure. Fortunately he is leaving to
spend more time with the unmissable Don't Forget Your Toothbrush.
Then this evening at 10pm, also on Channel 4, there is the long awaited
return of Drop the Dead Donkey. This sitcom set in the offices of Globelink,
the satellite TV channel, is a triumph because of its strong
characterisation: tough media men, and women, whose egos hide very
precarious personalities. The worst bits are the topical jokes that the
writers feel they must pop in to make the setting ring true.
If the Greeks have a word for it one wonders how they describe Louise, the
tough Lancashire girl who left Blackburn to become a holiday rep in Crete.
She works Malia, the wildest resort on the island. Inside Story (BBC 1
10.00) is her's.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Arts: Le Cirque Invisible reopens Riverside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SOPHIE CONSTANTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Riverside Studios, the West London Arts venue which closed its doors in
April, has reopened after the first phase of an extensive redevelopment
programme. Gone are the corner bookshop and hotchpotch of small gallery
spaces. A new, glass-fronted entrance (on Crisp Road) leads directly into a
deep, brightly lit, grey and white foyer where a long counter houses both
box office and reception. The cafe and bar area, although transitionally
streamlined, remains unresolved - the dark wood, bistro-style tables and
chairs an irritatingly anachronistic element within the plain and rather
industrial-looking interior.
But what of the studios? Seating capacity has been increased - to 500 (from
370) in Studio 1 and 400 in Studio 2 - at the expense of comfort. Studio 3,
redesigned for small scale projects, can accommodate an audience of just
over 100. The seats are of the small, shallow-backed, red plastic variety
and the tightly packed rows offer minimal leg room. Should you actually lean
back, it is likely to be against someone's knees. When Riverside's director,
William Burdett-Coutts, decided to add Robert Lepage's epic The Seven
Streams of The River Ota to his autumn programme, he must surely have
blanked out any thought for the comfort of his audience.
Le Cirque Invisible, the show with which Burdett-Coutts has chosen to reopen
Studio 1, lasts almost two hours, yet it is not the kind of event which
compels viewers to sit quietly rigid. This self-contained mini-circus
founded by Victoria Chaplin and Jean Bapiste Thierree (her husband) some 20
years ago (as Le Cirque Bonjeur and, subsequently, Le Cirque Imaginaire) is
not really a vehicle for conventional, sawdust-ring skills and turns.
Indeed, it features Chaplin treading the high-wire and the couple's
acrobatic son, James, on elasticated trapeze and on various custom build
cycles. But Chaplin and Thierree subvert the whole character and vocabulary
of circus performance and, in doing so, multiply its essential magic and
fun.
As the show's prize clown, Thierree injects the simplest tasks and ideas
with totally absurd humour: pulling off a wig of shaggy grey hair only to
reveal his own, identical mop; placing an open book in front of a dozy
rabbit; accidentally 'amputating' his finger whilst chopping carrots and
celery at high speed. These antics - or maybe just Thierree's small but
wildly inappropriate gestural flourishes - leave you weak with laughter. But
Thierree also has an extensive solo repertoire of surrealist, chameleon
characters, such as the Magritte-inspired zebra man and tapestry man. The
latter, dressed from head to foot in needlepoint-realised pastoral scenes,
carries a tapestry covered suitcase and peels a tapestry-skinned banana.
As a conjuror, Thierree freely dabbles in the coloured handkerchief school
of magic. Not that he aimed for - or achieves - the usual results: 'a dog,'
he announces, letting a square of silk waft to the ground and lifting it to
reveal a plastic turd. He also treats his props with a schizoid combination
of brutish disregard and motherly care: metal objects are tossed into the
empty wings; a dropped satsuma is recovered with a napkin. Of Thierree's
Gallery of walk-on/walk-off joke characters, the most brilliantly perverse
is an overcoated figure who clutches a spherical, newspaper wrapped object
to his chest and rips away the covering to reveal Thierree's bobbing,
chattering head.
The perfectly assessed brevity of these episodes contrasts with the more
sustained quality of Chaplin's solos - most of which rely on the laboriously
precise manipulation of large and heavy costumes for their clever, illusory
effects. The most organic of Chaplin's designs is a free-standing, full
length skirt structure in which she is hidden and which drifts and rolls
precariously around the stage, like some decapitated Georgian dancer.
While Chaplin works slowly and methodically, transforming herself into the
unidentifiable creatures of a vivid imagination, Thierree tends towards more
prosaically human roles embracing both deliberate incompetence and irascible
silliness. His comic mime take on the Pearlfishers duet - Thierree dressed
as a medieval monarch and grinning like a village idiot, mouthing the words
and tugging discreetly at the jaws of the singing puppets on his knees - is
rib-achingly funny. After her husband's tomfoolery, it is easy to treat
Chaplin's contributions as mere recovery time, but her more modest presence
should not be underestimated. Together, Chaplin and Thierree have created a
dream circus full of wondrous eccentricities.
At Riverside Studios until October 16. (081-741 2255).

LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD (18)
Ken Loach
BAD BOY BUBBY (18)
Rolf De Heer
SPEED (15)
Jan De Bont
THE RED SQUIRREL (18)
Julio Medem
The seeing-double title of Ken Loach's new film, Ladybird, Ladybird, sets
the mind musing on a question. Are there two different Ken Loaches? They
obviously look and sound identical: the pixie features with finely ruffled
hair and saintly unblinking eyes, the wisp of Midlands in the voice. But the
two men seem to make totally different films.
Ken One makes those ironic, touching social comedies like Riff Raff and
Raining Stones: all about Britain trying to smile through its dole-drums.
Ken Two makes those strident message movies, loud with special pleading and
pamphleteering, like Hidden Agenda and now Ladybird, Ladybird.
K1 is a seducer, K2 is an agitprop rapist. If beguiling and reasoning do not
work, Ken Jekyll turns into Ken Hyde and throws us to the ground, forcing
open our defences. The new film's heroine is Maggie, a quadruple unmarried
mother (four children by different fathers) whose offspring keep being
dragged off into care: even, in one scene, straight from post-natal bliss in
a maternity hospital.
But though she is both neurotic and neglectful - first seen accidentally
imperilling her brood when she locks them in their hostel room shortly
before a fire breaks out - she is not the demon in Loach's drama. That role
is reserved for the social workers: presented without exception as
bureaucratic harpies sticking to the letter of an unfeeling law. Their job
is to be always one step ahead of our heroine, nipping her dreams of
full-time parenthood whenever they look like ripening.
Emotionally, the film is so weighted towards Maggie that the welfare drones
have no chance. She is played with scenery-chewing passion by newcomer
Crissy Rock. A dumpy blonde with sandpaper voice and rumpled face, she looks
permanently as if she has just emerged from a detox clinic. In fact Maggie
has surfaced from something just as bad - life with battering boyfriend Ray
Winston - and is now learning how to batter, emotionally, her own new
boyfriend, a do-gooding Paraguayan refugee called Jorge.
As played by Vladimir Vega, a sweet, drained, soft-spoken presence, Jorge is
the only recognisable human being in the film. But even he wears a Loach
placard round his neck. Ex-freedom fighter in his own country, his function
is to nag us gently, insistently, into equating British welfare bureaucracy
with Latin American totalitarianism. He even has a speech - Loach stops the
film in its tracks so we can listen - about governments needing to create
misery in order to exercise power over their people.
This equation is so outrageous that Loach should be hauled up and hung by
the toes by all the children who have been rescued from genuinely abusive
parents by genuinely concerned social workers.
Instead in Ladybird, Ladybird the cardboard carers are condemned by their
patient voices and needling questionnaires. And mother-earth Maggie is
sanctified by her screaming devotion to her tots and her flair for hurling
invective at social visitors over the tea and biscuits.
That Maggie can be a pain in the neck and a paradigm of bad parenting even
Loach and screenwriter Rona Munro admit. But they do not seem to consider
that a dent in their argument. In a sense they are right. For there is no
argument, dentable or otherwise, in a film like this: you cannot have a
human issues debate without two sides that inhabit a human dimension. In
Ladybird, Ladybird Maggie and her Paraguayan Galahad are presented as flesh
and blood or more than flesh-and-blood. Everyone else is a cipher, or a mark
on Ken Two's well-peppered polemical dartboard.
*
What fine kismet decided that Bad Boy Bubby should open in the same week as
Ladybird, Ladybird? Rolf De Heer's black Australian comedy, honoured with
Silver Lion at last year's Venice Film Festival, is about an emotionally
arrested young man (Nicholas Hope) escaping from decades of house arrest
under a mercilessly 'loving' Mum.
This fat old crone - the sort of mother Loach's Maggie might turn into given
a minor increase in her possessive hysteria - has kept Junior at home as her
pet, her baby, her lover. And home is a surreal, Beckettian hell of grey
walls, mouldering food and free-range cockroaches. Watch Bubby eat one;
watch actor Hope do it for real.
In the absence of caring social workers, all frightened off the planet by
Ken Loach, what can a poor boy do? Murder mother and briefly-returning Dad;
smother them both in clingwrap. Then step into the outside world which not
surprisingly, in this inside-out film from down under, is a kind of wacky
Hades: Streets Of Fire meets Blade Runner. It is scarcely less
claustrophobic than the home our hero has left.
But De Heer has a catchy Candide humour. He is soon staging witty
confrontations between his all-innocent wild child and the special-interest
groups that run planet earth. Bubby brings his perceptual innocence and
untutored morals to the Salvation Army, a grunge rock group, a cerebral
palsy ward. The film turns from horror comedy to satire, and the change is
so deft that we hardly notice when it happens.
*
Speed is a triple-jeopardy thriller about public transport. Mad bomber
Dennis Hopper plants the TNT on a crowded elevator, a city bus and a subway
train - in that order - while SWAT cop Keanu Reeves runs about with the
gloves and pliers and the gale-force warnings.
The long central bus sequence is so suspenseful that you never want it to
end. The vehicle cannot dip below 50 mph or it will explode. Therefore, with
a beautiful female passenger (Sandra Bullock) taking the wheel from the
injured driver, and Reeves ranting instructions at her side, we plough on
through rush-hour traffic and minor obstacles (a pram, a truck, a 50-foot
gap in the raised freeway), sure in our hearts that neither petrol nor
plausibility will run out.
The audience's patience certainly does not. Speed is near-perfect Hollywood
action fare, directed at the double by a Dutchman (ex-cinematographer Jan De
Bont) and scripted by Graham Yost as if under the influence of unnatural
stimulants. If Keanu Reeves is taking over the action hero franchise from
Sly and Arnie, we welcome his fresh, youthful, Zen-buddyist approach.
Bullock is a tough, funny heroine. And Hopper is a natural for mad bomber
roles. That bulbous, smouldering, no-neck head only needs a coat of black
paint and a fuse to terrify unwary commuters into believing it is the real
thing.
Julio Medem's The Red Squirrel is a strange, tiresome fable from Spain. Boy
(suicidal ex-rock singer) meets girl (amnesiac motorbike-crash victim) and
takes her off on a campsite holiday, claiming he is her longtime lover. The
premise is interesting enough to explain why Hollywood optioned the film for
a remake. But nothing that follows is of interest at all. The fey, fidgety
script wanders squirrel-like round the single location, finding and storing
ideas and then seemingly forgetting where it put them. Minor characters
remain minor; there is some silly animal symbolism; and we look back fondly
to Medem's last feature, the daringly surreal Vacas (Cows), wondering where
he buried and forgot the talent that went into that.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Arts: National Power Piano final - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday the National World Power Piano Competition - no, sorry: the
National Power World Piano Competition - came to its finals in the Royal
Festival Hall. The label does not trip off the tongue, and it sounds
curiously displaced, which may be a negative asset in promoting it as a
world-class contest.
It was being held for the second time, after a 1991 start which culminated
with four deeply unremarkable finalists. For the final 1994 event the
Competition fielded not only Dirk Bogarde (as languid presenter) but the
Princess of Wales (among the audience), which might seem like missing the
point; on the other hand, this year's jury was properly laden with real
pianists, not the multi-national pedagogues of 1991. On the strength of this
last concerto-round, they identified more promise - though I do not know
what the whole field of candidates was like, nor did I hear the crucial
semi-final solo recitals.
Each contestant had to be ready to play either of two concerti, one to be
selected by the jury. Whether its choice was determined by
programme-desiderata or by guesses about what each pianist might play best,
we were not told. The eventual result seemed to exclude the first
possibility, since it crowded the programme with three of the longest
concerti in the standard repertoire.
Evgene Mursky, the 19-year-old Uzbekistani who won, played Tchaikovsky No. 1
with spirit, flair and much brilliance - hit-or-miss: there were a lot of
wrong notes, too many for the patience of most recording engineers.
Naturally enough, he cannot yet stamp every fustian passage with authority,
and relied upon his conductor Jean-Claude Casadesus to guide the
Philharmonia firmly through the piece.
Popular opinion takes this concerto for grand pianism, but it is not very
pianistic at all - not in the sense in which master composer-pianists write
'pianistic' concerti, with idiomatic piano trouvailles. Tchaikovsky borrowed
and devised a lot of ingenious, mechanical colour-effects for some abstract
pianist's fingers, hoping that a real pianist might bring them off. Mursky's
fingers brought off many of them.
Paul Lewis, 22 and British, played Rakhmaninov no. 3, another warhorse, with
more calculated assurance and a modicum of brilliance. Unfortunately nearly
everyone - perhaps the judges too - remembered the performance by Artur
Pizzarro that won him the last-but-one Leeds, and for fluent, committed
passion Lewis was not in the same league. The American Jeremy Denk, 24,
delivered Brahms One tidily and in modest, decent taste, without intruding
any fresh thought upon it. His semi-final recital must have been much
better.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Arts: A Pounds 1.5m boost for West End theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The West End theatre will receive a shot in the arm where it matters most
today, in the balance sheet. It will announce a deal with a group of
companies who are collectively investing Pounds 1.5m in the London theatre
over the next three years.
The agreement has been put together by the Society of London Theatre, which
represents the leading producers and theatre owners. Seagram, Radisson
Edwardian Hotels, and Grolsch are the contributors to date, and other
companies are expected to add to the kitty soon. It could rise to Pounds 3m.
The money wll be spent on promoting West End theatre, and bursaries for
young actors and would-be producers. Some of the extra cash will go to the
Theatre Investment Fund, which supports plays put on by new producers.
But the main impact of the sponsorship will be the West End Proms when, for
a month, perhaps next September, 150,000 tickets will be offered at
substantial discounts. The aim is to attract under-25s to the theatre.
For Seagram and Grolsch there will be promotional spin offs but also the
practical gain of having their brands on exclusive sale in around 70 per
cent of West End theatres. Radisson Edwardian becomes the society's official
hotel partner. This is the first big sponsorship deal gained by the society
and comes at a time when the West End is holding its own fairly well. Ticket
sales this year are on a par with 1993, which set a record.

FT  29 SEP 94 / People: Glaxo replaces Sir Paul with Sir Colin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Colin Corness, chairman of building group Redland and of the Nationwide
Building Society, is to add to his list of chairmanships that of Glaxo, the
pharmaceutical company.
Sir Colin, 63 next month, replaces Sir Paul Girolami who retires at the agm
on November 18. The changeover will take place on May 17 next year when Sir
Colin retires from Redland after 30 years there.
Born into a wealthy Scots family, Sir Colin (right) has had a stellar
commercial career largely in construction and finance. He is now firmly part
of the establishment with among other things, directorships of the Bank of
England and of SG Warburg, the merchant bank.
He trained as a barrister before joining construction company Taylor Woodrow
as a director at the age of 30. Within three years he switched to building
materials company Redland, moving through the post of managing director of
Redland Tiles in 1967, becoming chairman and chief executive of the whole
company from 1977. He built a reputation for innovative energetic management
and an ability to pick able associates.
His appointment ends a long search by Glaxo for a non-executive chairman to
work alongside deputy chairman and chief executive Sir Richard Sykes.
Sir Colin's salary, of around Pounds 200,000, is a fraction of the Pounds
1.4m package Sir Paul was paid in his last year as executive chairman.

Hilary Wild, 45, who has been with Kleinwort Benson Investment Management
since 1990, has been appointed managing director of Kleinwort Benson
Charities, the firm's fund management division, where she will be
responsible for managing funds in excess of Pounds 500m.
Wild's career is evidence that being a chartered accountant does not
necessarily lead to a dull life; she spent time in Greece - between 1981-84,
as country representative for Marine Midland bank - and New York, where from
1986-1990 she was chief of finance at the United Nations Children's Fund.
At UNICEF, which she found a very dynamic entity, Wild was primarily
involved in overseeing the Dollars 350m short-term investments of the
organisation, as well as keeping a close eye on cash-flows of the 100-plus
field offices.
Joining Kleinwort Benson, she first was involved again in shipping finance,
before taking over as sales director of leasing and asset finance. She
became a director of Kleinwort Benson Ltd in 1992.
In her new role she will be looking after the funds of more than 80 medical,
educational, religious and other charities. In July this year Kleinwort
launched two funds, the Chariguard UK Equity Fund and the Chariguard Fixed
Interest Fund, the first an index-linked fund, the second a more
conventional fund investing in government securities.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Technology: Tackling insider dealing with fuzzy logic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fraud investigators at the London Stock Exchange are testing pioneering
'intelligent' technology in an attempt to crack insider dealing rings.
The exchange recently conducted a pilot study with an automated insider
dealing detection system, codenamed Monitars (Monitoring Insider Trading and
Regulatory Surveillance), installed by SearchSpace, a company that uses
University College London's research in intelligent systems. The aim is to
detect dealing rings of several individuals, or one individual with several
accounts.
The problem, which is extremely difficult to solve using conventional
techniques, such as statistical analysis, involves spotting the 'signature'
of certain traders from a vast amount of electronic camouflage, explains
Jason Kingdon, a UCL researcher.
It is an example of a pattern recognition problem that can be skilfully
handed by a neural network, a computing device which has similarities with
the structure and function of nerve cells in the brain.
The neural network is used in conjunction with several other 'intelligent'
techniques. For example, it uses fuzzy logic, a mechanism for dealing with
imprecise information, in order to be able to cope with some inconsistencies
in the patterns picked out.
It also uses genetic algorithms, which use mechanisms inspired by biological
evolution to search very large data sets.
In the Monitars systems, a genetic algorithm is used to allocate resources
by working out which lines of inquiry seem most promising. The machine is
adaptable in that it starts with very precise criteria of what it should
look for, which it gradually relaxes over time.
It is also capable of working autonomously, since it can set its own
objectives.
The London Stock Exchange has yet to decide whether to install the system
permanently. 'It is one of several means of analysing share movements which
we are looking at to strengthen our regulatory operations here.'

FT  29 SEP 94 / People: A welcome for Coats' Walls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome has found a finance director almost four months after the last man
in the job, John Precious, said he was leaving 'to pursue other
opportunities'.
The new incumbent is Russell Walls from Coats Viyella. Walls has been group
finance director at Coats for four years during which time he helped
transform the reputation of the company in the City by adding an
unprecedented level of openness to the company's accounts.
Earlier this summer he and Coats swept the board at the first Investor
Relations awards for best results presentations.
Walls leaves the textiles industry after almost 30 years. After graduating
from Glasgow University in pure science, he joined Coats Paton in 1966 at
the age of 22. He held a variety of posts in the UK and overseas before
joining the main board in 1990.
He joins Wellcome at a tricky time; chairman and chief executive John Robb
has come under pressure for holding both posts, and the com-pany's second
biggest product, Aids drug Retrovir, has had mixed fortunes in long-term
clinical trials.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Technology: The magic way to keep in touch - The latest
personal communicators promise a wide range of new functions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is 'take two' for personal communicators, as a new set of players takes
the stage with the launch in the US this week of Sony's 'Magic Link', a
second-generation of hand-held devices combining communications and personal
computer functions.
Unlike the first 'personal digital assistants', such as Apple Computer's
Newton, which failed to live up to the expectations of their makers, Magic
Link owes much of its wizardry to an advanced data communications network
called PersonaLink, provided by AT&amp;T.
While Apple's Newton is primarily a personal organiser, with some
communications functions, the Magic Link is, first and foremost, a
communicator. Weighing 20 oz, and measuring 7 1/2 ' by 5 1/4 ', the device
automates many of the chores of communicating by electronic mail, pager,
telephone or fax.
The Sony product, and others from Motorola, Matsushita of Japan and Philips
of the Netherlands which are expected to follow, are access devices for this
new network.
PersonaLink, which began operating in the US this week, is 'a foundation, or
platform for an electronic community,' AT&amp;T says. Similar to established
computer on-line services such as Prodigy and Compuserve, PersonaLink allows
users to send and receive electronic mail, access news services and go
'electronic shopping'.
PersonaLink is the first commercial network to support the use of
'intelligent agents'. These are mobile programs that can be instructed to
travel the network performing tasks such as searching for a particular
product or data. 'Agent' technology is the creation of General Magic, a
Silicon Valley company backed by Apple Computer, Matsushita and Philips as
well as Sony and AT&amp;T.
Magic Link uses General Magic's 'Magic Cap' graphical interface, which
presents functions in familiar scenes: the desktop, complete with telephone,
notepad, Rolodex cardfile, and postcards that can be used to send brief
messages; a hallway with doors to rooms such as the library, for reference
materials; and 'downtown', with buildings that represent services such as a
travel agent for booking airline flights.
Initially, PersonaLink will primarily be a messaging service - with a
difference. The service will offer users the ability to order incoming
messages according to priority. PersonaLink also addresses another drawback
of electronic mail - the need to know electronic mail 'addresses', for which
there is no central directory. PersonaLink subscribers can send messages to
each other simply by name. An agent will automatically search the directory
of subscribers, deliver the message and bring back complete addressing
information to the originator.
Later this year subscribers will also have access to the PersonaLink Market
Square, an electronic shopping mall. Through gateways to other electronic
mail services, including the Internet, PersonaLink subscribers will be able
to reach and be reached by millions of people. They will also be able to
send (but not receive) facsimile messages.
For now, Sony's personal communicator offers only limited wireless
communications via the SkyTel satellite paging network. An optional plug-in
card adds paging. In January, Motorola announced the 'Envoy' personal
wireless communicator, also based on General Magic software, with a planned
sale price of Dollars 1,500, (Pounds 950) but it has yet to come to market.
Sony's less ambitious approach, using conventional telephone lines rather
than wireless services has helped keep the list price below Dollars 1,000.
It is expected to sell at about Dollars 700.
Aimed initially at 'technologically optimistic mobile professionals', Magic
Link and PersonaLink could lighten the load of business travellers who carry
a notebook computer, cellular telephone and pager around in their bulging
briefcases.

<TEXT>
After a year-long search, Thames Water has appointed a managing director for
its international contracting and consulting arm.
Tony Eckford, a qualified engineer and deputy chairman and chief operating
officer of the process and energy division of construction group Amec, will
take over from next month.
Eckford will be expected to continue the process begun by Thames's chief
executive, Mike Hoffman, of bringing together the company's non-regulated
international businesses into one division.
Thames, like other water companies, has been pursuing international
contracts to operate waste and water plants as a way of building
non-regulated income. The company is particularly keen to strengthen its
presence in the Far East, South America and, eventually, eastern Europe.
There, the pace of economic activity is creating increased demand for water
and waste services.
Thames found the search for an international managing director difficult. It
has been forced to pay a generous remuneration package, including
performance-related bonuses and share options. Eckford will be on a rolling
contract of at least two years.

A new generation of computing tools is being pressed into service in some of

behaviour in the way information is sifted and responses made. They include
neural networks, which are interconnected computing units that loosely
resemble the function of neurones in the human brain; genetic algorithms,
which help find the best solution from large amounts of data; and fuzzy
logic, a tool for dealing with imprecise information.
They are being used in a range of applications, including credit assessment,
fraud detection, forecasting and portfolio management. Banks believe they
have the potential to sharpen their competitive edge, since their
adaptability and skill at manipulating large amounts of data often surpass
traditional statistical techniques.
Almost every large financial business in Europe and the US is experimenting
with these tools, according to Sergio Focardi, a partner of the Intertek
Group, a Paris-based research organisation which has conducted a survey of
advanced computational methods in 80 international banks. This research, in
which banks are typically investing up to Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.8m) a year,
is viewed as highly promising, he says.
Some bankers are very enthusiastic. 'The potential is incredible,' says Bill
Edisbury, manager of emerging technology at TSB bank.
The TSB has been experimenting for five years with building models using
neural networks' ability to learn from experience. TSB General Insurance in
Newport uses such a model to set premiums for personal loan protection
insurance, based on data from national unemployment statistics and claims
histories. The bank, together with University College London, has also
exploited the pattern-recognition ability of neural networks by building a
model that was 57 per cent successful in forecasting the direction of the
long-dated gilts market.
But for every enthusiast, there is a sceptic. Many financiers believe that
these computational techniques promise more than they can deliver. Moreover,
the secrecy that surrounds most banks' experiments in the field is believed
often to hide disappointing results. 'It is a triumph of optimism over
experience. People's experience has been mixed to poor,' says one banker.
The performance of these tools depends largely on where and how they are
used. Intertek's Focardi believes that the success of the tools in
forecasting markets' behaviour lags behind their success in dealing with
relatively simple questions in credit assessment, fraud detection and
marketing, where 'the results are consistently good'.
He says: 'Forecasting is a more difficult subject because of the intrinsic
complexity of markets' behaviour, the possibility of structural change and
the lack of data.'
Even enthusiasts such as Edisbury believe that the take-up of these tools by
the financial markets may be slower than originally expected.
The tools are not necessarily expensive or difficult to apply. One package,
devised by Right Information Systems, a software house, which is used in
several banks, costs Pounds 10,000 and can be used by anyone with
spreadsheet skills. This system can run on a standard PC, although some
users prefer high-performance computers.
However, many people are reluctant to use neural networks because of the
difficulty in seeing how a particular decision was reached. This is a
particular problem in loan evaluation work, where it is often necessary to
explain why a loan has been turned down.
Another problem is 'overfitting', where the model finds spurious patterns in
a given set of data. 'Neural nets are so easy to abuse,' says Konrad
Feldman, a researcher at UCL. 'The fact they have learned something doesn't
mean they can generalise.'
One way in which these weaknesses can be overcome is by combining neural
networks with other innovative techniques in hybrid systems. For example,
the parameters used by a neural network model can be refined using genetic
algorithms, which attempt to breed the best solutions from a set of random
solutions in a manner analogous to the mechanisms of biological evolution.
They are being used to construct useful trading rules from a set of
plausible rules and in portfolio management to find an ideal combination of
assets.
Neural networks and genetic algorithms can also be used in conjunction with
fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic provides a mechanism for handling imprecise
concepts, such as 'small', 'big', 'high' and 'low', which is particularly
useful in loan evaluation and portfolio selection.
Japanese banks have been in the forefront of these techniques. For instance,
Yamaichi Securities uses fuzzy logic to make decisions for an investment
fund; Nikko Securities uses a neuro-fuzzy system for a bond-rating
programme.
To a greater or lesser degree, all these computational tools are difficult
to apply. Paul Refenes, an expert in financial engineering at London
Business School, doubts that there have been been any 'wholesale' successes
in applying these tools to the management of money, and says that
difficulties in quantifying risk will make banks reluctant to hand over
large sums of money to these machines.
Yet even if their scope to manage money autonomously proves limited, they
are expected to have a greater role in aiding research. 'They could replace
certain expert areas in the financial services sector,' says Edisbury, while
Refenes says: 'They will become a tool that traders and investment managers
will have to use.'

FT  29 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The fast way to a
Japanese stomach - Emiko Terazono explains why Pillsbury succeeded where
others failed in a challenging market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cracking the Japanese market is daunting enough for foreign food processing
companies at any time; doing so in a period when demand is sluggish is even
more challenging.
Pillsbury Japan, the Japanese arm of the US food processing company, has
managed to clear both hurdles by forming business relationships
Japanese-style and introducing innovative products at lower prices.
The company has seen strong growth in Japan at a time when most domestic and
foreign food companies are struggling amid a sluggish economy and increasing
competition.
Building on its 'Green Giant' brand canned corn, Pillsbury Japan has carved
itself a niche in the canned and frozen vegetables market, and sales have
grown from Y2bn (Pounds 13m) in 1987 to Y10bn last year.
Part of the success, says Toshi Mitamura, president of Pillsbury Japan, has
been in maintaining good relations with its Japanese partners, businesses
involved in product distribution and PR companies.
It is essential to form a strong relationship with a company's management -
even if it means late night drinking sessions and karaoke  - and to involve
them in marketing plans from an early stage, he says.
This aspect of doing business in Japan has been the Achilles heel for many
foreign food makers. Forays into the Japanese market by companies which
tried to go it alone such as Borden, the ice cream maker and Campbell Soup,
have failed.
But while establishing a favourable relationship with QP, which handles its
canned vegetable line, and Nissui, a frozen foods company, which distributes
Green Giant frozen vegetables, Pillsbury says it was careful to retain
control of product development and the marketing of its brands.
Another important factor, says Mitamura, is empowerment to the local head
from the parent company.
'Japanese companies will not take you seriously if the local president is
not given full authority over decisions.'
Mitamura, who gained his expertise in the food industry at Morinaga, a
Japanese dairy goods maker, and Mister Doughnuts of the US, adds that
knowledge of the complex distribution system, the speed of introducing new
products and knowing how to handle red tape at the Ministry of Health and
Welfare is also important in the food business.
Once in the Japanese market, expanding business has also been a challenge.
Although Japan's Y32,152bn food processing market is one of the world's
largest, growth has stagnated over the past few years.
Pillsbury has tried to overcome this by introducing frozen vegetable
products designed for the Japanese market. One product which other frozen
food companies have followed is the burdock and carrot vegetable mix, often
used in Japanese cooking.
The research and development has paid off and the company now has 43.5 per
cent of the frozen vegetable market.
'Product development is always necessary,' says Mitamura, adding that there
is danger in total reliance on the parent company and the brand name.
Mitamura says foreign food companies have an advantage over domestic
companies because they can offer cheaper imports.
With discounting already a trend in the Japanese retail sector, foreign
companies can attract consumers without hurting profit margins by bringing
in low-priced products processed in their manufacturing bases abroad.
Lower import prices as a result of the yen's recent rise have therefore
helped Pillsbury expand its product range in Japan. This month it will start
offering its Dough Boy baking products, and last month it opened a food
research and development centre - its first overseas technology centre
outside the US - to target the Japanese and Asian markets.
The expansion in the region comes at a time when growth in the US food
market, Pillsbury's core market, is slowing and companies are being forced
to look for earnings growth overseas.
The fast-growing Asian economies present profit opportunities because a
company can develop products in Asia and then offer them to the growing
Asian population in the US
Some analysts point out the danger in rapid expansion in new areas at a time
when the Japanese economic recovery is at an early and tentative stage.
'Although market research may show demand, many foreign food companies have
found themselves in trouble when trying to introduce new products,' says
Patricia Horvath, foods analyst at brokers UBS Securities in Tokyo.
At the same time this is a good moment to invest, says Mitamura. Most
Japanese companies are reducing capital investment. Construction orders and
property prices are on the decline, which made it easy for Pillsbury to find
a contractor to build its new technology centre.
However, he adds that the environment surrounding food manufacturers in
Japan is becoming increasingly tough because of the rise in retailers'
low-priced, private-brand labels.
'In order to survive, food manufacturers have two choices. Either become a
sub-contractor for a retail group, or become a manufacturer with brands that
offer innovative products at competitive prices,' he says.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Living life to the
Max - PepsiCo has combined an ambitious promotion with a plan to squeeze
suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Club Med in Ibiza has temporarily assumed a new identity: the entire
1,000-bed operation has been taken over and rebranded Club Pepsi Max, as
Pepsi-Cola mounts what must be one of the most ambitious pan-European
promotions ever attempted.
A total of 1,400 competition winners, most of them in their late teens and
early twenties, have been flown from all corners of eastern and western
Europe, for a week's all expenses-paid holiday. To get there, they had to be
successful in a variety of Pepsi Max promotions, from finding lucky-number
ring-pulls, to composing slogans - the exact competition details have been
left to Pepsi marketers in each country.
Prizewinners are playing basketball with Magic Johnson, receiving tennis
coaching from former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash and receiving fashion
advice from supermodels Linda Evangelista and Karen Mulder, who have all
been flown in by Pepsi. The entire multi-million dollar event has been
designed to complement Pepsi Max's sporty positioning as a low-calorie cola
drink for youths wanting to 'live life to the Max'.
The Ibiza event, gigantic in scale though it is, with Pepsi still adding up
the millions of entries to the promotion across Europe, could be the start
of something even bigger for Pepsi's parent company, PepsiCo. For the US
group - which has in its stable Pizza Hut, KFC (formerly Kentucky Fried
Chicken), as well as snack foods such as Walkers Crisps - has also used the
event to unveil plans for European growth and co-operation between its
hitherto autonomous business divisions.
Using the Ibiza venue during the weekend before the first batch of lucky
prizewinners arrived, PepsiCo invited more than 600 trade customers,
including supermarket, petrol station and leisure park operators, to sample
Club Pepsi Max hospitality and to listen to presentations about the
company's plans.
In particular, the company wanted to get over the message that PepsiCo has
more to offer than a brown fizzy drink.
For example, it wants to see petrol stations and retailers who may currently
stock Pepsi, also considering their snack products and even wanting to site
quick-service KFC or Pizza Hut outlets on their premises.
Says Charlotte Pinder, marketing director for Pepsi Max Europe: 'We've been
quite poor at working together with some of our sister companies in the
past. We've always been encouraged to be autonomous units.'
This has had its benefits in encouraging competition between PepsiCo's
businesses, but it has also meant, says Pinder, that best advantage has not
always been taken of the 'huge overlap in target audience' between the
businesses.
Also under-exploited has been the overlap between the goods and services
purchased by all the separate businesses. For the last year, PepsiCo's
European heads have been meeting to see what economies of scale across
operations might yield.
The target is to save Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) a year across Europe, out of
costs of about Dollars 2bn, by using the combined muscle of the separate
businesses. All this is due to happen within a year.
According to Paul Steele, Pepsi-Cola's vice-president, sales and marketing
in Europe: 'When we went through the list it was surprising. For example,
Pizza Hut buys an enormous quantity of cardboard for their boxes; Pepsi-Cola
buys cardboard for soft drinks trays. We're looking at whether we can
leverage that scale.'
The same potential economies of scale could apply to the purchase of flour,
salt, spices, cooking oil and TV advertising airtime, say the heads of
PepsiCo's different divisions. Says Steele: 'The businesses developed very
separately. We didn't have the scale to do this before, but it has suddenly
become a very exciting proposition.'
The building of this scale in Europe, which was outlined for the first time
to trade customers in Ibiza, is intended to take PepsiCo over the next six
years from an organisation which reaps 80 per cent of its profits from the
US, to one which is reliant for only 50 per cent of its business on the home
market.
As an example of the kind of growth to be expected, David Williams, who is
responsible for Pizza Hut in Europe, says there are plans to invest over
Dollars 100m in his operation over the coming year; from 1,000 units today,
the aim is to build to 6,000 across Europe by the end of the decade.
Purchasing specialists agree the target of Dollars 100m-worth of savings by
co-operation between businesses on purchasing - equivalent to about 5 per
cent off PepsiCo's European bills - looks realistic, when compared with
other companies' experience.
Mark Ralf, group purchasing director for SmithKline Beecham worldwide, and a
member of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, agrees that 'you
can generate huge benefits out of this kind of focus'.
His purchasing operation has taken about Pounds 200m over three years out of
about Pounds 3bn of the group's costs world wide. But, he warns, PepsiCo
could discover what many companies have found: 'Identifying the savings is
one thing, actually making them happen is another.'
Another specialist in the area points out: 'Americans have a relatively
naive view of what happens in Europe. They tend to believe that getting
synergies across Europe is the same as getting synergies across the US. As
well as cultural differences, there just aren't the integrated supply chains
that you have across America. They expect Europe to be the United States of
Europe.'
At Club Pepsi Max over the past few days, PepsiCo is convinced that it has
found the pan-European youth dream. Consumer research conducted by Pinder
throughout Europe for the promotion resulted in 'surprise within the company
that teenagers in different countries are a much more homogenous group than
anyone had imagined,' she says. There was universal excitement among young
people about the idea of being a star for a week in the company of
celebrities.
The next year will see how far suppliers and trade customers can be
persuaded to share PepsiCo's pan-European dreams and ambitions.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Managers 'fail to stem car as perk'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Managements seeking to dispense with the company car are offering too little
in cash alternatives, a report says today.
The report by Wyatt, consultants and actuaries, found that in spite of tax
changes that reduced the value of a car as a company perk, 95 per cent of
employers were offering company cars compared to 98 per cent a year ago.
About 46 per cent of employers running company cars used lease or contract
hire cars while 54 per cent bought them.
The report says that more companies are trying to buy back company cars with
cash alternatives - 39 per cent of the 264 organisations in the study
compared with 28 per cent last year.
But take-up of the cash alternatives was low - only 10 per cent. Wyatt
suggests this was because employers were offering too little as an
alternative. Mr Mike Landon, senior consultant at Wyatt, said the average
alternative on a car valued at Pounds 20,000 was Pounds 6,000 a year.
He said: 'An employee would need Pounds 10,000 to operate the same car out
of after-tax earnings without being worse off, which explains why most have
decided to stick with their cars.'
Another cash alternative under consideration by many employers is the
adoption of flexible benefits schemes, enabling employees to choose a
variety of benefits in exchange for part of their pay.
Only 5 per cent of the employers in the survey had introduced such schemes,
but half of those had done so in the last 12 months. Of employers who did
not operate a flexible benefits scheme, more than 40 per cent were
considering doing so, although administration was regarded as a barrier.

FT  29 SEP 94 / BNFL will set up decommission fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BNFL, the nuclear fuel reprocessing company, is to set up a special fund to
cover decommissioning and other long-term liabilities. It has earmarked
Pounds 1bn as an initial contribution.
The company disclosed its decision yesterday as it published its submission
to the government's nuclear review.
It follows criticism from nuclear industry opponents who say BNFL and other
companies are putting decommissioning plans at risk by investing funds meant
for that purpose in other nuclear projects.
BNFL said it had decided independently that the fund would ensure that the
'necessary financial resources will be available when liabilities become due
many years into the future'.
Provided ministers approve the company's plans, the government would hold
the fund. A newly created BNFL subsidiary would have access to the fund and
would take over responsibility for Pounds 10bn of current and future nuclear
liabilities arising at its sites. It would have 30 staff.
BNFL strongly opposes a proposal by the Atomic Energy Authority that one
company manage all the nuclear industry's liabilities. Mr John Guinness,
BNFL chairman, said this would create a large bureaucracy and his company
preferred a competitive approach.
In its review submission, BNFL says privatisation is an issue for government
but it seeks 'avoidance of bureaucratic interference and double guessing of
the company's commercial judgment'.
The submission makes no judgment about pleas by Nuclear Electric and
Scottish Nuclear for privatisation. However, Mr Guinness said yesterday that
his company supported their view that privatisation would provide a much
better opportunity for building new power stations.
BNFL wants nuclear power stations to be built. It says there are 'no
credible alternatives to take nuclear power's place if global energy
requirements, environmental targets, energy conservation and sustainable
development policies are to be achieved'.
The company calls for a 'level playing field across the energy industry
which fully reflects environmental costs'.
In a joint submission to the review, electricity unions said that UK
dependency on gas for electricity generation could rise to 90 per cent by
the year 2020 if no new power stations were built using other fuels.
The unions call for the government to authorise the construction of Sizewell
C, a planned 2,500MW nuclear station on the Suffolk coast, through a
partnership between the private and public sectors. The unions oppose
privatisation.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Bank share of home loans falls by 23%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fresh evidence that the share of new lending held by UK banks in the
relatively subdued mortgage market has slipped came yesterday with figures
released by the British Bankers' Association, Alison Smith writes.
The seasonally adjusted figures for banks' new net lending show a 23 per
cent fall between the Pounds 607m figure for last month and the Pounds 785m
for August last year. The statistics show that new gross lending by banks in
August was Pounds 1.78bn, compared with Pounds 1.81bn in the previous month
and Pounds 1.77bn in August last year.
However, Lord Inchyra, director-general of the association, contrasted the
rise in the number of new loans approved but not yet undertaken by banks
last month with the fall in the similar set of figures for building
societies.
He suggested that this might reflect customers' anticipation of the rise in
interest rates this month, as they sought to take advantage of the
fixed-rate mortgages being promoted by banks.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Range Rover steers towards luxury niche
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Land Rover, the leading European maker of four-wheel-drive sports/utility
vehicles, is moving into new territory with the launch today of a new
generation Range Rover.
Developed in a four-year, Pounds 300m investment programme as a luxury
flagship for the Rover group, the new Range Rover is aimed at moving the
company into direct competition with established luxury car producers such
as Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, BMW and Lexus (Toyota). It is priced between
Pounds 31,950 and Pounds 43,950 and with a top speed of 125mph (200kph).
Mr John Towers, Rover group chief executive, said: 'The major business
opportunity is to appeal to a much wider group of traditional luxury saloon
owners.'
The only vehicle in the world to have been exhibited at the Louvre in Paris
as a work of art, the Range Rover, launched in 1970, is already a classic in
the world motor industry - an executive/luxury car with polished wood trim,
but with the capability of crossing fields, streams, deserts and jungles.
The off-road capability is being maintained, but Land Rover has spent
heavily to develop the new Range Rover's on-road credentials as a luxury car
to allow it to move into more rarified territory.
The new Range Rover is only one element in an ambitious strategy being
developed by Rover - a subsidiary of BMW of Germany since early this year -
which could more than double Land Rover production by the late 1990s.
The company is moving for the first time to establish a presence at the
lower end of the market. Behind the scenes it is developing a range of
smaller Land Rover vehicles as part of the Rover group's Pounds 1.5bn,
five-year new model investment programme.
Rover is reluctant to comment on future product plans, but Mr Towers said:
'It is sensible and right to consider a business proposal to allow Land
Rover to spread its net and create an ability below Discovery prices to
attract people into the Land Rover fold.'
Output at Land Rover's plant at Solihull, near Birmingham totalled less than
50,000 a year before the launch of the medium-priced Discovery at the end of
the 1980s.
Production, expected to reach a record 85,000 this year, is forecast to
exceed 100,000 for the first time in 1995, as sales are boosted by the
launch of the new generation Range Rover and by the moves into new markets.
The Discovery, priced in the UK between Pounds 17,600 and Pounds 26,800,
accounted for 50 per cent of Land Rover sales last year. The launch of a
small Land Rover could have a similarly dynamic effect - increasing sales to
between 150,000 and 200,000 by the late 1990s.
With the new Range Rover - the biggest single investment at the Solihull
site - the company has started to lay the foundations for the much
lower-cost manufacturing operation needed for higher volume output of a
smaller vehicle.
Mr John Hall, director of the Range Rover project, said that the new vehicle
'takes little more than half the time to build compared with the previous
model', in spite of its greater complexity.
About Pounds 70m has been spent to modernise the manufacturing facilities in
the body welding, paint, final assembly and engine shops.
The number of parts for the new Range Rover axles, for example, have been
reduced from 338 to 214, and the axles take 30 per cent less time to
assemble.
Rising output has created extra jobs at Solihull in spite of the greater
efficiency of the manufacturing operation, and the workforce has grown to
9,700 from 8,100 two years ago.
Land Rover is planning output of 640 a week of the new Range Rover on a
single shift, but has already moved to two-shift working this year for both
its Discovery and Defender ranges.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Bank share of home loans slips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fresh evidence that the share of new lending held by UK banks in the
relatively subdued mortgage market has slipped significantly came yesterday
with figures released by the British Bankers' Association.
However, Lord Inchyra, the director-general of the association, contrasted
the rise in the number of new loans approved but not yet undertaken by banks
last month with the drop in the similar set of figures for building
societies.
He suggested that this might reflect customers' anticipation of the rise in
interest rates which took place earlier this month, as they sought to take
advantage of the fixed-rate mortgages being promoted by banks.
Building societies' lending suffered in the summer from the attractiveness
of banks' fixed-rate mortgage offers.
The statistics for new net lending show that banks have lost market share.
The seasonally adjusted figures show a 23 per cent drop between the Pounds
607m figure for last month and the Pounds 785m for August last year. The
statistics show that new gross lending by banks in August was at Pounds
1.78bn, compared with Pounds 1.81bn in the previous month and Pounds 1.77bn
in August last year.
Figures for building societies' lending showed new gross loans at Pounds
3.45bn last month - 22 per cent higher than the Pounds 2.83bn undertaken in
August last year.
Non-adjusted figures for societies' new net lending show an increase between
August last year and this year of 39 per cent, from Pounds 814m to Pounds
1.13bn.
The more encouraging signs for the banks came in the figures for new
mortgages approved - an important forward-looking indicator. The number of
loans approved in August rose 8 per cent compared with July to reach 31,047.
The total new lending approved was Pounds 1.61bn - 7 per cent higher than
the July figure.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Tax 'widens savings gulf': Research indicates concessions
aid rich and exacerbate inequalities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The distribution of wealth across the UK is extremely unequal, with most
households having no substantial savings other than their houses and
pensions, an economic study has shown.
A further factor that may exacerbate inequalities is that the savings of the
poor are apt to be taxed more than those of the rich, the research suggests.
The study, by the Institute for Fiscal Studies for the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation, says the tax discrepancy is due to the different savings methods
used by the rich and poor.
According to the survey, the average amount of wealth held by households is
about Pounds 3,000, excluding pensions and housing. This overall figure is
skewed by a small number of very wealthy individuals - about half the
households have savings of less than Pounds 450, the report notes.
Poorer households tend to attract higher rates of taxation, primarily
because their savings are concentrated in interest-bearing accounts at banks
and building societies that are taxed more heavily than other forms of
wealth.
The poorer half of the population, for example, holds some 60 per cent of
its assets in interest-bearing accounts.
The richest part of the population, by contrast, holds much of its wealth in
specialised financial assets which are given generous tax treatment. Shares,
personal equity plans and other investments such as unit trusts account for
about half the savings of the richest 5 per cent.
The report, which drew on a five-year research programme by NOP involving
almost 20,000 individuals, notes that this profile has shifted slightly in
recent years, with a fall in the proportion holding interest-bearing
accounts.
Meanwhile, measures of wealth that include housing and pension funds show a
more equal distribution pattern, partly because many owner-occupiers with
low financial wealth benefited from house-price rises in the 1980s, the
report adds.
However, the institute concludes: 'Stocks of housing and pension wealth are
the most important - often only - forms of wealth for most households. Only
the minority of households have enough liquid financial wealth to provide
for unexpected hardship, such as unemployment, before they actually retire.'

FT  29 SEP 94 / Ministers to review energy trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers will soon consider options for rescuing the troubled Energy
Savings Trust, a central component of the government's energy-efficiency
policy.
A report by officials from the Treasury, the Department of Trade and
Industry, and the Department of the Environment on a fundamental review of
the trust's long-term funding is understood to be near completion.
The trust was established two years ago to promote energy efficiency as part
of the UK's international commitment against global warming. Its Pounds 700m
budget up to the year 2000 was supposed to be funded by levies on gas and
electricity consumers.
But this year Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas industry regulator, stymied the
scheme by refusing to authorise a levy on the grounds that it was a form of
taxation. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, has
authorised Pounds 25m a year for four years but recently declined to
increase this.
Among options considered by the interdepartmental review are new legislation
to make it a regulator's duty to raise a sufficient levy to fund the trust
in the long term.
Ministers made clear yesterday that although the options would include
cutting back the trust's activities, they would also explore ways of
expanding its role.
An early ministerial decision would allow funding measures to be included in
November's Budget.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Political Notebook: The perils of the press
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major should not read this. No, it is not another of the media's
all-too-familiar attacks on the prime minister's leadership. As it happens
Mr Major is doing quite well these days.
Peace in Ireland is no small prize. He has just returned from a mishap-free
trip to South Africa. With just the odd finger touching the wood of their
Whitehall desks, colleagues are predicting a low-key party conference. He
looks safe from a November leadership challenge.
But he still spends far too much time reading the newspapers. So for that
matter do most of his colleagues. The result: politics is infected by a
self-perpetuating short-termism. Ministers judge themselves on that day's
headlines and the media feels free to praise or, more often, abuse them on
the basis of that day's performance.
The prime minister's friends insist he has been weaned from the worst of his
addiction. The barrage of personal abuse since the 1992 sterling debacle -
matched only by that meted out to the then Mr Harold Wilson after the 1967
devaluation - has toughened what was a very thin skin. Mr Wilson, of course,
was renowned for his obsession with the front pages.
Mr Major has cut down on his newspaper order. On foreign trips he has
dropped chummy socialising with the Westminster lobby in favour of more
infrequent and formal encounters. He watches carefully for stray
tape-recorders. But he still spends his late evenings reading the first
editions. On Saturday afternoons in Huntingdon he checks the headlines on
Ceefax. 'What will the press make of it?' has become the most ingrained
reflex of this administration.
Let's not be partisan, though. By all accounts Mr Tony Blair is not content
with the distinctly complimentary treatment he has received during a
three-month leadership honeymoon. He still gets agitated by the occasional
criticism tucked away on page 10. His complaints are not restricted to what
appears in the national dailies. An unflattering headline in the Northern
Echo prompts the despatch of the party's spin-doctors to convey his
displeasure.
There are plenty available to do the job. The Labour leader's office has no
fewer than four people designated to deal with the press and broadcasters.
Mr Blair is in for a nasty shock when the hacks decide it is time to turn
against him. If he is sensible he will follow the advice of Mr Clement
Attlee who told colleagues in his post-war administration to follow his
example and make a point of not reading the newspapers. But he won't.
Mr Paddy Ashdown does not have the resources to bombard newsdesks with
complaints. But the Liberal Democrat leader cannot resist getting up at dawn
to monitor the Today programme on BBC Radio. And yes, he reads all the
papers at breakfast, checking in particular how many column inches his party
has secured in The Guardian.
The politicians, of course, blame the media for the short-termism. The
advent of instantaneous electronic news, intense commercial pressures in the
newspaper industry and the fashionable cynicism of the 1990s have shortened
the focus of today's journalists. Politics must be reported in terms of
triumphs or disasters. Newspapers and television news refuse to inject
historical context or an understanding of the limits of modern government.
President Bill Clinton (another newspaper junkie) has the same problem.
Admiral William Crowe, newly appointed US ambassador to the Court of St
James, made the point eloquently in his first speech in London this summer.
The British press, he had quickly discovered, emulated its US cousins in
preferring to give instant judgments over the more difficult task of
offering long-term perspective. The media was full of self-appointed
coroners. The only consolation was that they had chosen journalism over
medicine. Admiral Crowe, a shrewder successor to Mr Ray Seitz than some in
Whitehall expected, has a point. Journalists have always relished their
power to build up political leaders as a prelude to their demolition.
Amplification of the routine ups and downs of politics sells newspapers.
But by and large the media takes its cue from the politicians. As long as
ministers eschew strategic thinking in favour of demanding instant
recognition of their triumphs, they will pay also an immediate price for
failure. Tactical politics invites tactical journalism. Mr Major would
disagree. But then he will not have read this far. Nor, of course, will
Messrs Blair or Ashdown.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Bucket shops may gain rules leeway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Civil Aviation Authority is considering scaling down plans to regulate
airline ticket 'bucket shops' in spite of support for tougher legislation
from consumer bodies and trading standards officers.
The authority proposed in June that anyone other than an airline who
accepted payment for air travel would either have to produce a ticket
immediately or show that it had an Air Travel Organiser's Licence.
The shops, which sell airline tickets at a discount, told the authority they
would have difficulty meeting the licensing requirements. The tougher
proposals were supported by tour operators, consumers bodies and trading
standards officers.
The authority said it was now considering granting bucket shops licences
under less onerous conditions than those which have to be met by tour
operators. To receive a licence, tour operators have to arrange a bond
equivalent of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of their turnover. The
bond is used to compensate customers if the operator goes out of business.
The authority said that if airlines were prepared to undertake to honour
tickets once they had been issued by bucket shops, the shops could arrange
bonds of about one-third of those required from tour operators.
The authority said it would also be prepared to grant a special class of
licence to air ticket vendors without a bond. It would only do this,
however, if airlines selling through these vendors entered into a legally
binding agreement with the authority to honour tickets.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Public funds are speeded up to help rescue private hospital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A private hospital set up to cater for patients from overseas has been saved
from the brink of receivership by its bankers and by the Scottish Office
only three months after opening.
One lender to Health Care International, a Pounds 180m hospital at Clydebank
near Glasgow, is understood to have become alarmed at the small number of
patients being treated in the hospital. A consortium of banks agreed two
weeks ago, however, to advance more money and the Scottish Office speeded up
payment of a grant to ensure the company's survival.
Labour last night demanded a Commons select committee investigation into the
government's role in funding the hospital. Unison, the public-sector union,
also demanded an inquiry.
About Pounds 29m in public funding has been paid or committed to the
project, including regional selective assistance, capital allowances due to
its construction in an enterprise zone, and loans and equity from Scottish
Enterprise, the development body.
In addition, Pounds 9.3m was spent by the Scottish Development Agency on
clearing the site, which had been contaminated with asbestos.
The 260-bed hospital offers acute treatment to patients who are unable
easily to obtain treatment in their home countries and who cannot afford to
go to the US for treatment. The project was conceived by two Harvard
professors, Dr Angelo Eraklis and Dr Raphael Levey, who obtained equity and
loan financing through the City of London.
It is understood that ING Bank, one of the leading banks in the Netherlands,
became alarmed at the hospital's trading position since its opening in June.
The fear that it might put the company into receivership led to concerted
action by the other banks in the lending syndicate to save the company.
The syndicate, which had advanced a total of Pounds 90m, made more funds
available to HCI. Its other members are Samuel Montagu, Midland Bank, Credit
Lyonnais and Royal Bank of Scotland.
HCI is trying to raise a further Pounds 15m in equity by October 14 to
reassure the banks.
HCI said it approached its equity investors three months ago for money in
addition to the Pounds 35m already invested, in order to strengthen the
balance sheet and fund other projects abroad.
The equity investors are led by Harvard Management, which invests money for
Harvard University. Others are Montgomery Medical Ventures, Samuel Montagu,
John Laing, Abu Dhabi Investment Company, British Aerospace and Drake &amp;
Scull.
Mr Andrew Gordon, one of the hospital's executive directors, said: 'We have
nothing to fear from any investigation of the support the government had
given us, which is completely above board.'
He confirmed that the venture had decided to seek an extra Pounds 15m but
denied that it had been thrown into crisis by a shortage of patients.
Mr Gordon said: 'We are either bang on or fractionally ahead of our budget
for patient admissions. That is not to say we are full, but we did not
expect the build-up to be quick.'

FT  29 SEP 94 / Guidelines on directors' option schemes issued
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Accounting Standards Board, which regulates financial reporting in the
UK, yesterday issued non-mandatory guidelines on the disclosure of
directors' share-option schemes.
In June this year the ASB's urgent issues taskforce put out a draft proposal
to encourage greater disclosure amid an increasingly controversial debate on
executive pay.
It recognised at the time that when it was eventually published the code
would not carry the force of law and could not be enforced by the Financial
Reporting Review Panel.
However, the urgent issues taskforce has sought to give the abstract some
teeth by urging both the government and the Stock Exchange to back the code
by modify-ing company regulations.
It is urging the Department of Trade and Industry to update its company law
review and the Stock Exchange to include disclosure in its listing
requirements.
The ASB hopes that the abstract will add significantly to the pressure on
companies to comply with what it sees as best practice and publish details
of share option schemes.
The board points out that greater disclosure of executives' remuneration was
urged by the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate
governance in its report published at the end of 1992.
Companies are being asked to show option information for all directors, and
separately listed for individual directors.
They should also reveal the exercise price and the prevailing share price of
any options exercised during the financial year to which the accounts refer.
The original aim was to make its recommendations compulsory. However, they
were caught by a loophole in the law. The 1985 Companies Act calls for
disclosure of emoluments payable to directors, including 'the estimated
money value of any benefits . . . otherwise than in cash.' But the drafting
of the law means that if the benefits cannot be precisely quantified, they
do not have to be disclosed at all.
For most companies, the proposals will require extra effort, although some,
including SmithKline Beecham, British Petroleum and Reuters Holdings,
already provide quite extensive disclosure of the value of share options as
part of the data on directors' remuneration.

British oil production averaged 2.44m barrels a day in August, up from 2.39m

Natural gas output was 6 per cent up from July, when demand is usually

The average daily value of production fell to Pounds 33.8m from Pounds 34m
in July because of lower world oil prices.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Saga seeks more youthful line in pensioners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You no longer have to be 60 to play Scrabble with pensioners in Torquay,
roll your woods along the bowling greens of Bournemouth or go ballroom
dancing on the cruise ship Canberra.
Saga, the travel group which sells holidays to pensioners, is breaking with
a 45-year tradition and lowering the minimum age of its customers from 60 to
50.
Mr Roger De Haan, Saga's chairman and the son of its founder, said yesterday
he had originally opposed the change but had accepted that his group should
cater to the growing number of pensioners under 60.
The change will lead to a large increase in the size of Saga's market. There
are 12m UK residents over 60 and a further 6m between 50 and 60.
Mr De Haan said: 'I reckon there are going to be 6m deeply depressed people
contemplating the thought that they qualify for Saga holidays.'
Mr De Haan, who turns 46 next month, said that research into 15 large
occupational pension schemes earlier this year showed that two-thirds of
employees were now retiring before they reached the age of 60. In four of
the schemes, 40 per cent retired before they were 55.
Research among Saga's customers found little opposition to lowering the
minimum age. Some travellers in their 70s said that they had long wanted to
take their 50-year-old sons and daughters on holiday with them.
Saga, which is privately owned, does not reveal how many customers it has.
Mr De Haan said, however, that the group sells about Pounds 100m worth of
holidays a year.
He said lowering the minimum age would not result in any change in Saga's
established policy of ensuring its holidays were accessible even to the most
frail.
The group has always promised that its customers would not have to climb a
hill to reach their hotel. There are porters present to carry guests'
luggage. All travellers have telephone access to a 24-hour reception desk.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British oil production averaged 2.44m barrels a day in August, up from 2.39m
b/d in July, according to figures issued yesterday by the Royal Bank of
Scotland.
Mr Mark Smith, the bank's energy economist, said the August level was 26 per
cent higher than a year ago.
He noted that UK oil output has remained above 2.3m b/d in every month this
year, compared with an average 'well below 2m barrels per day' in the same
period last year.
Natural gas output in August was 6 per cent up from July, the month in which
demand is usually lowest.
North Sea revenues fell in August in spite of rising production because of
lower world oil prices. The total average daily value of production was
Pounds 33.8m, against Pounds 34m in July.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A call for quango board members to be made personally liable for costs if
they act in unlawful ways which have a financial effect on their agency, was
made yesterday.
Local government leaders from the West Midlands said quango board members
should be liable in the same way as local councillors.
Mr Brian Clack, leader of Coventry City Council, pointed out that quangos
spend Pounds 50bn of public money a year. He said: 'We should know much more
about how this money is spent and how we, as elected members, can call to
account these local quangos.'
He and other West Midlands metropolitan authority leaders yesterday
published a 10-point code of good practice which they urged the government
to have adopted by quangos, the agencies appointed and often financed by
Whitehall.
The code, based on a University of Central England study of practice among
quangos in the West Midlands, was published at the annual conference of the
Association of Metropolitan Authorities in Newcastle upon Tyne.
The council leaders want the ombudsman system to cover quangos. They also
want quangos to conduct their financial affairs in line with the principles
the Audit Commission applies to local government.
The proposed charter suggests quangos should make a commitment to open
meetings of their boards, adopt a complaints procedure, publish a list of
board members' pecuniary interests and appoint a monitoring officer to
ensure compliance with the law.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Companies' Pergau role is censured
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday censured three of Britain's leading industrial
companies for their role in helping to build Malaysia's Pergau dam.
But, in a formal response to a recent Commons report on Britain's offer of
Pounds 234m to help build the dam, the government played down the part of
Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, in negotiations over the
project.
The three main companies involved in the scheme - Balfour Beatty, Trafalgar
House and GEC - were criticised for providing the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher
with incomplete information over the deal's financing.
The government did not question the judgment made earlier this year by the
Commons foreign affairs committee that Lord Younger, the former defence
secretary, had acted in a 'reprehensible' way by signing a protocol on arms
sales that committed the UK to offer civil aid to Malaysia.
But the government response rejects the committee's claims that a series of
ministerial replies on dam funding - including one from Mrs Thatcher - were
'less open and less informative' than the Commons had a right to expect.
Instead the government directs clear criticism at the consortium of
companies that advised Mrs Thatcher on how much it would cost them to build
the dam before negotiations with the Malaysian government in March 1989.
The committee had noted that the consortium led by Balfour Beatty had 'put
pressure' on Mrs Thatcher to make a firm offer to fund the Pergau project at
a cost of Pounds 316m. Shortly after the deal was struck, the consortium
increased the cost to Pounds 397m. This raised the amount of cover required
under Britain's aid and trade provision.
The government stated yesterday: 'It would have been helpful if the
consortium had been forthcoming about the risks of a significant price
increase while lobbying . . . for an offer of support from (aid and trade
provision).'
The government also said that the aid was for a 'valid development project
which would produce much needed peak-time power in an environmentally
friendly and sustainable way'.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Party sticks to quotas ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's national executive committee yesterday decided to stand by one
strand of its tough policy on discrimination in favour of women - increasing
the prospects of a serious battle over quotas at next week's party
conference.
The committee warned 11 constituencies exempted from rules requiring female
representation on delegations that the regulations would be sternly enforced
next year. 'It is pretty ridiculous that constituencies say they cannot find
a woman delegate,' said a senior official.
However, the NEC sought to defuse tensions on the second strand of the
discrimination policy by endorsing a flexible interpretation of the rules on
the selection of women for winnable parliamentary constituencies. The
decision was in line with a compromise approach developed by Mr Tony Blair,
party leader.
It was decided not to insist on the selection of all-women shortlists in 50
per cent of winnable seats without a sitting Labour MP, as required under
rules approved by conference delegates last year.
Members were told that the flexible approach has already been applied in the
south-west, where all-female shortlists have been accepted in four of nine
winnable constituencies, allowing one constituency party to disobey the
rules.
Officials said they expected that a similarly trouble-free process in the
rest of the country would lead to agreed women-only shortlists in up to 35
other winnable seats - potentially more than doubling the number of female
Labour MPs.
However, the ruling on delegations will harden the determination of critics
to repeal rules they regard as demeaning to women and discriminatory against
men.
The NEC also approved plans to invite Mr John Hume, leader of the
nationalist SDLP, to address the conference immediately before a crucial
debate on the future of Labour's 13-year-old commitment to campaign for a
united Ireland by consent.
Supporters of a more neutral approach fear that the timing of his speech
will bolster support for the party's nationalist wing.
An NEC statement is expected to endorse the policy while stressing the need
for northern unionists to consent to constitutional change and acknowledging
that the leadership must respond to the developing Ulster peace process.
The NEC was told that party membership has increased by 25,000 to 288,000
since Mr Blair was elected leader in July. The total is well short of the
record membership of more than 750,000 in the early 1950s, but marks a solid
recovery from 260,000 in mid-1993 when membership stood at 260,000.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Labour faces minimum wage row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour made clear yesterday that it would not allow its party conference to
decide the level of minimum wage to be adopted by a future Labour
government.
Instead, it made it clear that its Economic Commission, chaired by Mr Gordon
Brown, shadow chancellor, would fix the level of a minimum wage after it has
completed its findings next year.
But the TGWU general union, the largest union affiliated to the party,
intends to force the issue to a debate on the first day of the conference in
Blackpool next week, setting the scene for a battle with the party
establishment. The union wants a minimum wage of at least Pounds 4 an hour.
Ms Ann Clwyd, a senior Labour frontbencher who speaks on employment, said
the party would 'take the TGWU's view into account'. But she warned that a
minimum wage would be set only by the Commission.
Ms Clywd, who published a survey underlining the party's support for a
minimum wage, said: 'We are not talking about levels or a formula,' she
added. 'We will not put a figure on it.' She declined to specify her
personal preference.
However, a vote in favour of a minimum wage at conference would be an
significant embarrassment to the party's leadership. Mr Tony Blair, party
leader, and Mr Brown, are understood to want to reduce the party's previous
commitment to setting the minimum wage at a half of male median earnings.
The TGWU warned that the party's existing policy was clear. 'Anyone who
wants to change it will have to make a strong case to conference.'
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU, warns in an article in next
Monday's New Statesman that the 'army of working poor' looks to Labour for
hope and that the party should adopt a Pounds 4 minimum.
'That's just Pounds 160 before tax for a 40-hour week,' he writes. 'If this
figure is open to criticism, it should be on account of its excessive
modesty. No one is going to live the high life working for Pounds 4 an
hour.'
She strongly opposed the Liberal Democrats' support for a regional minimum
wage, criticising it as divisive, although her own survey showed big
geographical differentials in the average gross weekly wage. Ms Clywd added:
'The introduction of a minimum wage will help lead people out of dependence.
Labour's aim is to create a nation at work.'

FT  29 SEP 94 / Intricate compromise a model for the railways: Signal
workers' earnings rise by average 8% - Hours cut to 37 / New duties include
cleaning signal boxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The complex deal hammered out over the past seven days of intense
negotiations to settle the four-month rail dispute appears to have pleased
everybody.
'A victory for commonsense,' said Railtrack chairman Mr Robert Horton. 'An
excellent package by any standards,' said Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT transport
union's general secretary.
Many observers wondered why such a settlement could not have been achieved
in the early summer before disruption of the rail network began.
Analysis of the intricate details of the deal suggests that Railtrack, the
state-owned company in charge of the infrastructure, should be pleased with
the longer-term outcome of what has been achieved, while RMT negotiators
were able to bargain a productivity package which gives signal workers a big
boost in their pay packets, at least for this year.
Railtrack has achieved most of what it wanted in the modernisation of
working practices that will produce annual efficiency savings amounting to
Pounds 7.6m while adding only 3.4 per cent to its annual paybill.
The company insists that it has not conceded any of the RMT's claim for an
interim rise for past productivity that sparked off the strikes. None of the
package will be backdated.
The signal workers have certainly secured pre-tax pay rises of a minimum of
Pounds 15 a week for the next two years. This year their earnings will rise
on average by 8 per cent while their basic rates will increase on average by
20 per cent.
A basic 2.5 per cent pay increase backdated to April in line with other
Railtrack staff along with a one-off lump sum payment averaging Pounds 480 -
mainly to buy-out working practices - will provide most signal workers with
a substantial pay boost. This should ease some of the pain caused by the
loss of more than Pounds 1,000 each they have suffered because of the
strikes.
On top of their pay increase, the signal workers have secured a cut in their
basic working week from 39 hours to 37 hours. If they vote to back the deal
in their union's telephone poll by Friday, an extra Pounds 50m will be
allocated to their new pension scheme.
In return, many working practices are to be transformed. The deal means the
introduction of flexible rostering with turns of duty from six to up to 12
hours - although Railtrack has dropped its demand to include Sunday as part
of the normal working week.
Signal workers will also have to take on a wider range of duties, such as
cleaning the signal boxes and using new equipment. Many old allowances are
being bought out. They will also be expected to accept more efficient relief
working, the introduction of job evaluation, annual development reviews and
flexible career structures.
These reforms were all covered in Railtrack's original restructuring package
presented to the RMT in July. The company has not insisted on a complete
upheaval - signal workers will continue to be paid premiums for overtime and
unsocial hours.
The RMT leadership says the deal it has negotiated is better than might have
been expected. The union faced the serious prospect of a revolt among many
of the well-disciplined signal workers if the strikes had dragged on for
much longer.
It had been clear for some weeks that the strike was failing to bite. By the
most recent strikes about half the rail network was operating normally and
few people were being disrupted. But in spite of the pressures building up
on an increasingly isolated RMT, the union's negotiators were able to
extract more than a face-saving formula.
The exhausted negotiators who emerged from the conciliation office as dawn
broke yesterday morning could still squabble in public about the meaning of
the deal they had reached. But enough common ground had been found between
them to produce a deal that satisfies all sides.
There has been no surrender or climbdown - it was a compromise. But the
conflict has done enormous damage to the railway industry which will take a
long time to overcome. Moreover, it is just the beginning in changing the
culture of railway industrial relations. The deal for signal workers will be
a model for other groups on the railways, which must modernise to survive.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Satellite group aims up-market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eutelsat, the European satellite organisation, is planning to target the UK
in a campaign designed to take satellite television more up-market.
Until now the British market has been dominated by channels on the Astra
satellite system, particularly the subscription channels of British Sky
Broadcasting.
Eutelsat hopes to use new English language channels on its Hot Bird
satellite, due to be launched at the end of November, to reach UK viewers.
Dow Jones has decided to use the Eutelsat satellite for its 24-hours a day
European Business News, as has NBC SuperChannel, which is being revamped in
January to concentrate on business programming during the day.
Two new BBC channels to be launched early next year will also use Eutelsat.
They are to be run by the BBC in a joint venture with Pearson, owners of the
Financial Times. One will be a 24-hour television news channel, the other
entertainment.
Mr Giuliano Berretta, commercial director of Eutelsat, said: 'We are
concentrating on quality, free-to-air television.' Eutelsat is owned by the
main telephone organisations of Europe.
From early next year Eutelsat will have seven channels in English, including
MTV, Euronews and Eurosport as well as television channels in French and
Polish.
Eutelsat believes its channels are received on around 300,000 UK satellite
dishes.
At the end of June BSkyB said it had 3.45m subscribers - 74 per cent of them
on satellite dishes.

FT  29 SEP 94 / 'We have lost people to coaches and the airlines'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's fledgling privatised railway industry has spent more than half its
young life under siege. The agreement reached in the early hours of
yesterday morning between the RMT transport union and Railtrack heralds an
end to hostilities - but raises serious questions about the long-term future
of the network.
British Rail handed over formal responsibility for its trains, track and
stations to more than 50 semi-independent subsidiaries on April 1. The
expectation was that managers could begin preparing their businesses to move
into the private sector but two and a half months into this process the
signalling staff began strike action.
The train operating companies saw their plans to improve the operation of
trains and the marketing of their services thrown into disarray. Their
collective losses rose to Pounds 200m and a nonsense was made of their
accounts, which were crucial if investors were to be found to back these
companies.
Railtrack, facing a strike bill of Pounds 100m, has been forced to cut back
on maintenance and divert management time from planning ambitious projects
such as the modernisation of the West Coast main line between London and
Glasgow.
And just when the expansion of high-speed train services around the world
seemed to herald a new era for rail travel, Britain's railways seemed mired
in a 1970s-style dispute. Passengers and freight customers were forced to
shift to other means of transport.
'There are no two ways about it. The strike has caused us damage and we have
lost people to the coaches and the airlines,' commented a spokesman for one
of the train operating companies, South West Trains.
'The dispute has had a corrosive effect on the services we offer,' said an
official of the East Coast main line, which runs from London to Edinburgh.
'Instead of growing the business over the next two years we will spend time
getting back to where we were.'
Investors who were considering backing management buy-outs have been forced
to reconsider the proposition. 'On the minus side the dispute will mean it
will take the train operators longer to demonstrate they have established a
sustainable financial record,' said Mr Roger Brooke, chairman of Candover, a
buy-out specialist.
It will also raise fears in the minds of investors about the possibility of
another strike in one small part of the railway empire damaging the other
parts, he noted.
It will certainly endanger the very tight privatisation timetable which aims
to get half of railway services into the private sector by April 1996 -
before the next general election begins to complicate the issue. Many Tory
MPs would be reluctant to push through privatisation in the months ahead of
a general election while a victory for the Labour party could stall the
whole process.
In spite of all the problems which remain to be overcome, there is some
cause for optimism in both the timing of the strike and its conclusion.
Coming almost at the beginning of the privatisation process, the dispute has
raised - and hopefully resolved - the question of restructuring working
practices before investors had made any serious commitment to the railway.
'It's a bit early in the process for fund managers to start looking at
investing in the railway,' commented one analyst. It will be next April
before the train-operating companies produce their first annual set of
figures.
By agreeing a more sensible set of working arrangements with the signal
workers now, Railtrack should be able to reduce its costs.
No other group of workers will have quite the power of the signal workers to
shut down the entire network in future. Drivers will be employed by
individual train operating companies while maintenance and modernisation
work will increasingly be carried out by private-sector companies.
Some train operators point to their success in maintaining services as proof
of the robustness of their businesses. 'We have seen how our business can
stand up to this sort of disruption,' said Mr Rob Mason, managing director
of Gatwick Express.
Some passengers have deserted to coaches and airlines while freight
operators have shifted some consignments to road. But the convenience of
rail means most will return, the operators believe.
The end to the strike will mark the start of some tough negotiations over
compensation to the train operators and to freight customers. It will also
focus attention on the rail industry's plans to put in place a risk-sharing
scheme to spread the cost of strikes and other calamities.

FT  29 SEP 94 / The European Pensions Ruling: Judges clarify uncertainties
over sex bias - Netherlands voices strongest reaction / A look at how the
many questions that arose from a legal landmark decision in 1990 were
resolved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FT reporters analyse yesterday's decisions of the European Court of Justice
which are expected to form a definitive framework under which employers and
scheme trustees can provide equal pensions for men and women
In the six judgments given yesterday, the leading judgment involved the
Coloroll group pension schemes. Coloroll, a UK wallpaper and furnishings
group, collapsed in 1990 leaving independent trustees in charge of
maintaining and administering several employee pension schemes. The trustees
were unsure of the effect, if any, of the Barber decision on schemes run by
independent trustees and asked the English High Court for its views. The
High Court referred the issues to the Luxembourg court.
The trustees asked the court whether the equal treatment rules in article
119 applied to independent trustees of occupational pension schemes or just
to employers.
The court reminded the Coloroll trustees that in its 1990 Barber judgment,
having decided occupational pension schemes were covered by the equal pay
rules, it had ruled that the conclusion remained valid even where the scheme
had been set up in the form of a trust and was administered by trustees who
were formally independent of the employer. This was because article 119
applied to consideration or pay received indirectly from the employer.
The court said the employer could not therefore avoid the obligations
imposed by article 119 in respect of pensions, by setting up a scheme in the
legal form of a trust.
The trustees, although not a party to the employment relationship, were
required to pay benefits which did not as a result lose the character of pay
within the meaning of article 119. They were therefore bound in paying those
benefits to do everything within the scope of their powers to ensure
compliance with the principle of equal treatment.
The Coloroll trustees next asked the court whether article 119 precludes
actuarial factors differing according to sex from being taken into account
in calculating contributions in occupational pension schemes. Since women
live on average longer than men, their future pensions are more costly than
those of men and require the employer to pay higher contributions. As a
result of such actuarial factors being taken into account, the sums to which
male employees are entitled, in particular where part of the pension is
converted into a lump sum to buy an annuity, are lower than those to which
female employees are entitled.
The court said it had already ruled last year in the Neath case (another
case arising from Barber) that the use of actuarial factors differing
according to sex in funded defined-benefit pension schemes (where the
benefits to be received in the form of periodic pension payments are clear
from the outset) did not fall within the scope of article 119 principles.
Companies can continue to use differing actuarial factors in these types of
schemes.
But the court said in money purchase schemes, where a lump sum was used to
buy an annuity, the schemes were contributory with funding provided by
contributions from both employer and employee. Moreover employee
contributions were an element of their pay since they were deducted directly
from salaries. The amount of those employee contributions therefore had to
be the same for all employees, male and female, in order to comply with the
requirements of article 119. The court said the principle of equal treatment
applied to all pension benefits paid by occupational schemes and did not
differentiate between different types of contributions.
In the second British case dealt with by the court yesterday, Smith v Avdel
Systems, five women brought a test case on behalf of 78 women employed by
Avdel Systems of Welwyn Garden City, Herts, who complained they were left
financially worse off when the company equalised the retirement age to 65 on
July 1 1991 to comply with the terms of the Barber judgment.
They asked the court if it was inconsistent with article 119 for an employer
to adopt a pensionable age of 65 for men and women, to the detriment of
women, so as to eliminate sex discrimination in an occupational pension
scheme in respect of benefits accrued for service after the equalisation
date of July 1, 1991 and for periods between May 1990, the date of the
Barber judgment, and the equalisation date.
The court said it followed from its previous rulings on discrimination in
pay cases that once discrimination in pay had been found to exist and so
long as measures for bringing about equal treatment had not been adopted,
the only proper way of complying with article 119 was to grant the
disadvantaged class of persons the same advantages enjoyed by those in the
favoured class. That meant in the present case for the period between the
Barber judgment and the equalisation of pension ages on July 1 1991, that
the pension rights of the men in the scheme had to be calculated on the same
retirement age as that for women.
For benefits accruing before May 1990 there was no requirement to ensure
equal treatment. But for periods after the equalisation date, article 119
did not preclude measures which achieved equal treatment by reducing the
advantages of the class previously favoured, the judges said.
In two Dutch cases decided yesterday the court said the right to join an
occupational pension scheme was covered by the equal treatment principle in
article 119. The first case, Vroege, looked both at the rights of part-time
workers and married women to join a scheme.
The court said it followed from an 1986 decision of the court that article
119 covered not only entitlement to benefits but also the right to be a
member of an occupational pension scheme. The same was true in the second
Dutch case, Fisscher, which involved the right of access to a pension scheme
which excluded married women. The court said an occupational scheme which
excluded married women entailed discrimination directly based on sex.
The court was also asked in these two cases to determine the effect in time
of the Barber judgment.
It said the reason for limiting the effect of the Barber judgment in time
was because derogations allowing the deferment of the implementation of the
principle of equal treatment in the social security field had reasonably led
employers to conclude that article 119 did not apply to pensions paid under
contracted-out schemes.
The court said the temporal limits of the Barber judgment only applied to
those kinds of discrimination which employers and pension schemes could
reasonably have considered to be permissible because of those derogations in
the social security area.
As far as the right to join an occupational scheme was concerned, the court
said there was no reason to suppose the professional groups involved could
have been mistaken about the applicability of article 119.
The direct effect of the article could be relied on retroactively, and this
could be done as from April 1976, the date of the court's Defrenne judgment
in which it held that article 119 had direct effect.

FT  29 SEP 94 / The European Pensions Ruling: Muted welcome from life
insurers - Some disappointment by Coloroll ruling / FT reporters analyse
yesterday's decisions of the European Court of Justice which are expected to
form a definitive framework under which employers and scheme trustees can
provide equal pensions for men and women

Some progress, but could have done better: UK life companies gave the court
judgments a muted welcome.
As life insurers sought to assimilate the implications of the rulings, it
was already clear that not all the questions on which they had been hoping
for decisions had been answered.
'It has removed a lot of the uncertainty, but we are not at the end of the
line,' was the comment from Standard Life.
Mr Peter Timberlake, marketing manager at Legal &amp; General, called for the
case to be incorporated into UK law through the pensions legislation which
is expected to be brought before parliament in the new session, in order to
give trustees of schemes a legal framework on which they could rely.
He believed there was such emphasis in the Coloroll judgment on defined
benefit pension schemes that there would need to be another case to settle
the position of money-purchase pension schemes. These are schemes where
money is invested annually on an employee's behalf.
Mr David Linnell, group actuary and compliance officer at Prudential
Corporation, expressed disappointment that the court did not appear to have
framed the Coloroll judgment in terms that would apply to all schemes. He
also said that aspects of the position for part-time workers were still
unclear.
There was some good news for life companies as trustees of insolvent schemes
are able to proceed to winding up the schemes. On winding up, most schemes
buy deferred annuities from insurance companies in order to pay out the same
level of benefits to current and potential pensioners.

FT  29 SEP 94 / The European Pensions Ruling: The six cases behind the
decisive ruling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
All six cases involve issues of sex equality in pension schemes arising from
the European Court's May 1990 landmark decision in Barber v Guardian Royal
Exchange - that Community rules outlawing pay discrimination between men and
women applied to benefits under private occupational pension schemes and
that retirement ages should be equalised. In the Dutch Ten Oever case last
year, the court ruled the Barber judgment did not apply retrospectively. The
outstanding issues were settled by the court yesterday.
COLOROLL
Trustees of the pension schemes of Coloroll, the UK wallpaper and home
furnishings group which collapsed in 1990, have been unable to wind up the
schemes because of uncertainty as a result of Barber. The trustees asked the
European Court several questions:
Q: Are pension scheme trustees bound by the equal treatment principles set
out in Barber, or just employers?
A: Trustees are bound to apply the equal treatment rules.
Q: Where pensions are received as a lump sum funded by contributions from
employer and worker and are used to buy an annuity, is it OK for employers
to make equal contributions for men and women or must the employer ensure
equal benefits? Should trustees have regard to actuarial factors showing
women live longer than men when calculating contributions and benefits?
A: Equal treatment rules are satisfied provided employers pay equal
contributions. The use of actuarial factors varying according to sex is not
covered by the European equal treatment rules.
Q: In equalising pensions are trustees allowed to equalise down the benefits
of men and women? Do they have to improve benefits for men accruing between
May 1990 and whatever date the company took action to implement equal
pension rights?
A: Yes and Yes.
Q: In men-only schemes, can men claim improved benefits they might have
expected as a result of the Barber judgment if there had been women members?
A: No.
SMITH v AVDEL SYSTEMS.
A test case brought by five women, backed by the Equal Opportunities
Commission, who worked for Avdel Systems, an engineering company based in
Welwyn Garden City, Herts. They were among 78 who brought claims before the
industrial tribunal complaining they were financially worse off by the
raising in July 1991 of their retirement age from 60 to 65 following the
Barber ruling.
Q: The court was asked whether it was legitimate for employers to worsen
pension provision for women in equalising pensions?
A: For periods of service after implementation of equal pension rights,
employers may raise the retirement age of women to that of men worsening
their pension provision. This may not be softened by ancillary measures
designed to minimise the adverse consequences. For periods between May 1990
and implementation of equal pension rights, advantages enjoyed by women as a
result of lower retirement age may not be reduced.
VROEGE v NCIV
A Dutch case about rights of access to pension schemes by part-time workers.
Q: Do the European equal treatment rules apply to access to pension schemes
and, if so, is the right limited in time to the date of the Barber judgment?
A: Yes. The right is not time-limited by the Barber judgment and stretches
back to April 1976.
FISSCHER v VOORHUIS HENGELO
Another Dutch case on a similar point.
Q: Do the equal pay rules apply to access to a pension scheme which excluded
married women?
If a worker can join a scheme retroactively must she pay back-contributions
if the scheme is a contributory scheme?
A: Yes. That right is not limited in time to the date of the Barber
judgment. If a worker wishes to join a scheme retroactively she must pay
contributions covering that period.
VAN DEN AKKER v SHELL
In 1985 Shell equalised retirement ages at 65 but said it would protect
pension rights of existing women scheme members by allowing them to keep a
pensionable age of 60.
Q: After the date of the Barber judgment was it legal for women to continue
to enjoy better benefits than men, and can companies ring fence and protect
the rights of existing members of a pension scheme in this way?
A: No. For periods between the Barber judgment and equalisation, conditions
for male workers would have to be improved.
ABP v BEUNE
Q Is the Dutch civil service occupational pension scheme covered by the
equal treatment rules?
A: Yes. It is not permissible for such a scheme to discriminate against
married men.

FT  29 SEP 94 / The European Pensions Ruling: Analysts beg time to digest
judgment - FT reporters analyse yesterday's decisions of the European Court
of Justice which are expected to form a definitive framework under which
employers and scheme trustees can provide equal pensions for men and women
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
An 84-page court judgment takes a good while to come through the fax
machine, let alone to digest. Many companies, trade unions, pension funds
and associations therefore reserved comment yesterday. 'We have to study the
document carefully,' was a typical remark.
The European Commission was a prime example. It noted that several
provisions of a July 1986 directive providing for equal treatment for men
and women in occupational social security schemes were now inoperable. As a
result, the commission would propose certain changes.
But beyond that Brussels declined to comment. The commission statement
resorted to the time-honoured formula: officials would have to study the
judgment in detail. A fuller response is only planned for next Monday.
The private sector, even in the countries most affected by the court's
ruling, was no more prepared. The benefits officer of one leading UK
retailer admitted: 'I haven't even heard of it.'
The London stock market was largely oblivious to the event. One retail
analyst at an international investment bank described the whole subject as
'rather arcane'. He said it was only yesterday morning that any of the
firm's equity salesmen had questioned him on the issue.
That was in the UK, the European country with the most developed - and
exposed - private pensions industry. Some other European countries responded
to the European Court judgment with what amounted to indifference.
The BDA employers association in Germany said the ruling would have less
impact in Germany than in the UK.
The French government and employers said the ruling would have little
implication for their pension schemes, mainly because most pensions are
covered by the state system. The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs said
that under existing pensions legislation there was no discrimination between
part-time and full-time employees, nor between male and female retirement
conditions.
'I do not see that these rulings will affect our existing system; it is not
really a French issue,' said an official at the Patronat employers'
federation. He said, however, that reforms of the state system aimed at
enabling companies to create private pension schemes would have to take
account of the rulings.
The French government plans to reform the existing system to ease the burden
on the current pay-as-you-go state scheme. But the reform has been delayed,
partly because of political sensitivity.
The legal change may not be a French issue, nor a German one, nor one for
most Continental countries. Still, few could compete in ignorance or
indifference with one UK retail analyst. European Court of Justice? Pensions
ruling? He asked: 'What ruling?'

FT  29 SEP 94 / The European Pensions Ruling: Outcome represents 'a nasty
knock for schemes' - People can be made to work to 65 / FT reporters analyse
yesterday's decisions of the European Court of Justice which are expected to
form a definitive framework under which employers and scheme trustees can
provide equal pensions for men and women

Employers reacted anxiously to yesterday's ruling by the European Court of
Justice that female part-timers could claim pensions retrospectively if they
had been excluded from company schemes.
'The costs are substantial,' said Mr Robbie Gilbert, employment affairs
director of the Confederation of British Industry.
The CBI highlighted a government actuary's report that backdated pension
demands by part-timers could alone cost companies and their pension funds
about Pounds 7bn. Beyond that there is the administrative expense of tracing
employees who might have left a company nearly 20 years ago. 'There is a
practical difficulty of tracking people down,' said Mr Gilbert.
Analysts have stressed that the numbers represent a theoretical maximum. Mr
Paul Moloney, pensions officer of the GMB general union, went further and
yesterday described the Pounds 7bn figure as 'nonsense'. He added: 'If
employers had been prudent over the last few years and set aside some of the
pensions surpluses they reaped then there would not have been any costs.'
Anxiety in business remains nevertheless. Ms Hilary Langley of Watson
consulting actuaries said: 'People are very concerned by the judgment. It
will be a nasty knock for employee pension schemes.'
The strongest reaction to the European Court's move came not from the UK but
from the Netherlands, which has one of the highest rates of part-time
working in Europe.
The Netherlands' VB association of corporate pension funds said the change
could cost Dutch pension funds up to Fl1.2bn (Pounds 436m). At least 100,000
workers, and perhaps as many as 165,000, may have been excluded from their
companies' pension schemes in the Netherlands because they worked part time.
The Federation of Netherlands Industry noted reports that the statute of
limitations of each individual country would apply. In the Netherlands,
employees have five years to claim back pay from an employer. With the
European Court equating pensions with pay, the same five-year limitation
might apply to pension rights, reducing the bill to industry.
Business sectors responded to the resolution of the court cases with varying
degrees of anxiety. 'The burden will not fall evenly,' said Mr Gilbert of
the CBI. 'The main burden will fall on those companies with relatively high
numbers of part-timers.' Retailing and financial services would be hardest
hit.
'It's not very good news,' said Mr Nick Bubb, retail sector analyst at US
investment bank Morgan Stanley. 'If it became law it would have a very
significant impact on food and food retailing.'
Part-time workers make up 40 per cent of staff costs in non-food retailing.
Mr Bubb thought a retailer such as WH Smith, with a large pensions surplus,
could afford to finance back pensions better than some of its competitors.
Kingfisher, the retailing group, said its scheme was open to part-time
employees but only to those working 16 hours or more a week. 'That is not
fixed,' said Mr Peter Styles, group benefits manager. 'We are looking
gradually to ease that.'
Kingfisher has a contributory scheme and therefore could expect that
employees would be cautious about making the retrospective contributions
that would entitle them to retrospective pension payouts.
A manager at one Dutch company in the catering business said: 'It's not good
for business if we're confronted with surprises dating back from the 1970s.
The ruling would effectively be rewriting the pay-and-conditions agreements
we signed 20 years ago.'
Most UK retailers played down the impact the court's verdicts would have, at
least on their pension funds, if not on their competitors. Tesco, the food
retailing chain, said its non-contributory pension scheme had been open to
all part-timers for several years.
Marks and Spencer said the decision would have no impact on its provision of
pensions for part-timers. M&amp;S opened its scheme to part-timers in 1975 while
the court ruling only addresses the period after 1976. 'I could see that for
other companies it might make for financial difficulties,' said Mr John
Peachey, group pensions manager. 'It does not matter for us. We are lucky in
that respect because we grasped the nettle many years ago.'
Vendex, the leading Dutch non-food retailer, said it expected to feel only
limited effects from the ruling, in spite of the large number of part-time
workers in its workforce. Until the Barber case in 1990, part-time employees
who worked less than 840 hours a year were excluded from the company's
pension fund. 'All our part-timers are now in the pension fund and have been
since 1990,' the company said. 'We don't expect any great interest among
people who worked just a few hours a week in the past to pay the premiums
that would allow them to draw a pension.'
Trade unions such as the GMB and MSF welcomed the ruling on part-time
workers. 'We have always said that part-timers have a right to join a
pension scheme and it makes sense that it is backdated,' said Mr Moloney of
the GMB.
But employees' organisations criticised the decision of the European Court
that equalisation of pensions could in some circumstances involve the
worsening of terms for women. 'When people speak of a Pounds 7bn cost to
employers on the issue of part-time workers they fail to realise that
companies are going to save many times that on the second ruling,' said Mr
Moloney.

wait - Employers fear backdated costs of Pounds 7bn / FT reporters analyse

FT reporters analyse yesterday's decisions of the European Court of Justice
which are expected to form a definitive framework under which employers and
scheme trustees can provide equal pensions for men and women
Employers throughout Europe have been awaiting the definitive word on sex
equality in pensions for four years.
In May 1990 the European Court of Justice ruled in the landmark Barber v
Guardian Royal Exchange case that pensions are a form of deferred pay.
Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome, dealing with sex discrimination by
employers, says men may not be paid more than women, or vice versa. But
women's pension entitlements have traditionally been higher than men's
because they have usually been allowed to retire earlier - although women
are typically paid less than men.
But the court gave no guidance on how employers were to carry out its
judgments, and a series of cases came before it.
European employers, particularly those in northern Europe with big
occupational pension schemes, have waited for a series of decisions which
could cost them billions.
Yesterday the court put to rest most of the outstanding issues and, for the
most part, provided answers likely to limit the cost to employers of
equalising pension benefits.
But the court made one ruling that surprised pensions consultants, opening a
loophole allowing elements of inequality to continue in the calculation of
benefits.
In the Coloroll case the court ruled that employers could continue to rely
on 'sex-based actuarial rates' for the calculation of transfer values and
commutation values for those leaving the scheme. These take into account an
actuarial assumption that women outlive men and will give rise to lower
payments for men.
Mr Martin Miles, pensions consultant at the actuarial firm of Bacon and
Woodrow, said: 'To some extent, this would seem to make a mockery out of
equalisation.'
But commentators felt that in other respects women had not benefited from
yesterday's rulings. Mr John Cunliffe, partner at solicitors McKenna and Co
and lead lawyer for one of the cases, said the general effect of the sex
equality rulings had been detrimental to women. He said: 'These judgments
have had the effect of reducing benefits for that portion of the population
which is the lowest paid anyway.'
In the UK between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of pension payments are made
to men.
One element of the ruling has significant implications for employers,
particularly in the UK, Ireland and Germany.
The court ruled that employers will have to admit part-time workers to
pension schemes if barring them constitutes an indirect form of
discrimination. The court said employers had known since its judgment in
1976 that barring part-time workers from pension schemes is frequently sex
discrimination and should have ended it long ago.
The court ruled that part-time employees can claim retrospective benefits in
respect of periods of employment dating back to 1976.
That judgment has produced howls of outrage from employer groups. They say
that their provision of pension schemes is voluntary and that there is no
point in forcing them to bear higher costs.
But pensions lawyers and actuaries say the cost of the ruling may not be
nearly as much as might appear. Mr Cunliffe said: 'These cases will have to
be tested before the courts in each member country.'
The judgment says article 119 of the Treaty of Rome 'is contravened only if
the exclusion affects a much greater number of women than men, unless the
employer shows that it may be explained by the objectively justified factors
unrelated to any discrimination on grounds of sex'.
Thus, part-time workers will have to ask a court to determine whether the
employer has had an 'objective justification' for barring them from schemes.
In the 1976 case on which the court based its initial decision the employer
argued - and the court accepted - that part-timers were barred from the
scheme because they had less commitment to the company and the employer
wished to discourage hiring them.
Mr Cunliffe said: 'I think it will be very different as a practical matter
to convince UK courts of that.' However, the presence of large numbers of
full-time women in the pension scheme or large numbers of men among the
part-timers would certainly aid an employers' case.
Mr Cunliffe said it appeared unlikely that part-timers would take up the
option to participate in a contributory pension scheme, even if they were
offered it.
He said: 'Most part-timers are not going to want to join their pension
scheme because their pay is so low in the first place.'
Mr Roger Key, partner at consulting actuaries R. Watson and Co, said the
bill for retrospective benefits for part-timers could be as high as Pounds
10bn in the UK.
As a practical matter, however, most of that liability occurs in
contributory schemes and the court yesterday ruled that any employee wishing
to claim retrospective benefits would have to pay retrospective
contributions. Mr Key said part-time workers were unlikely to have the sums
necessary to buy retrospective benefits.
Without the contributory schemes, Mr Key estimates UK employers' liability
for retrospective benefits at Pounds 1bn to Pounds 2bn. He added: 'However,
that is concentrated among a relatively small number of employers.'
About 20 per cent of the UK workforce is part-time, concentrated in banking,
financial services and retailing. Many big UK supermarket chains have
started admitting part-timers since the key sex equality ruling in May 1990
but employers in those sectors could still be hit with a significant bill.
Mr Key said employers might be able to argue objective justification in
barring part-timers because of administrative costs. Part-timers, he noted,
had rapid job turnover and frequent changes in the numbers of hours worked
each week. The costs of administering pensions could be so great it would be
unreasonable to force employers to include them in a scheme.

FT  29 SEP 94 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Experts give some unusually
outspoken advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is unclear whether it is the effect of global economic recovery or the
heady sensation of celebrating its 50th birthday: but the latest World
Economic Outlook from the IMF is more straightforward in the policy advice
it gives its members than previous issues.
It is particularly outspoken about the need for the US to raise interest
rates further.
Early in its report, it declares that 'further increases in policy-related
(US) interest rates are needed. . . if overheating and a rise in inflation
expectations are to be avoided'.
The Fund later declares that 'virtually all indicators now suggest that
little or no slack is left in output and labour markets' in the US. It
writes: 'Given the current cyclical position, there is an increasing need to
move US monetary policy to a neutral position consistent with potential
growth of about 2.5 per cent a year by raising rates further.'
Explaining this advice, Mr Michael Mussa, director of the IMF's research
department, said yesterday the Fund was not advocating a sharp rise in US
rates. But it thought more tightening would be needed over the next six,
nine or 12 months. Central banks, such as the US Federal Reserve, needed to
be leaders, not followers, in financial markets.
The Outlook points out that, in spite of recent increases, both short- and
long-term US interest rates remain low compared with the 1980s as a whole,
and even with the mid-1980s. The Fund maintains that, in real terms, US
short rates averaged 4.5 per cent and long rates 6 per cent in 1985-90,
against 1.5 per cent and 4.25 per cent in mid-1994.
The IMF also urges the US to take further steps to reduce its budget deficit
to put its debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward trend.
The Fund appears more satisfied with Japanese and German monetary policies.
Although Mr Mussa said a small further drop in German rates was possible if
the recovery slackened or inflation fell, the bottom for this business cycle
had nearly been reached.
The IMF warns Japan it will have to resume fiscal consolidation over the
medium term, 'including a comprehensive social security and tax reform to
forestall an unsustainable increase in public debt as the population ages'.
Some of its toughest words are reserved for Italy, which yesterday put
forward new budget plans. 'Credible efforts to put the unsustainably high
debt ratio on a declining trend during the balance of the decade are
essential for Italy's longer-term financial stability and growth prospects,'
it says.
The IMF envisages a jump to 5.5 per cent in three-months' US interest rates
next year from 4.4 per cent this year, against a rise to 2.7 per cent from
1.9 per cent for yen rates. It expects the three months' D-Mark rate to slip
slightly to 4.8 per cent from 5.2 per cent.

output is set to expand

The International Monetary Fund has at last dared to call an end to the
recession. Its latest World Economic Outlook says the broadening and
strengthening of recovery in the industrialised countries marks the end of
the 'long and unusually severe downturn' in recent years. It expects world
output to expand 3.1 per cent this year and 3.6 per cent in 1995, or at
twice the rate for 1990 to 1993.
The industrialised countries are forecast to grow by an average 2.7 per cent
this year and next, reflecting an increase of 0.4 percentage points in
forecast growth for 1994, against the IMF's last forecast in May and a
slight upwards revision of 0.1 points for 1995. The developing countries
should grow at more than twice this rate: by a forecast 5.6 per cent this
year and next.
The IMF draws comfort from stronger signs of a turnaround in continental
Europe and more tentative signs of recovery in Japan. It has raised its
forecasts for German growth to 2.3 per cent this year and 2.8 per cent in
1995, up 1.4 and 0.6 points respectively from the forecasts published five
months ago.
It expects France to grow 1.9 per cent this year and 3 per cent next. Its
projections of 3.3 per cent and 3 per cent growth for the UK in 1994 and
1995 respectively are more bullish than the British government's.
Canada and the US are seen as the fastest growing of the Group of Seven
industrial countries this year, with forecast growth of 4.1 per cent and 3.7
per cent respectively. While Canada's growth is expected to slow to 3.8 per
cent in 1995, the US's will decelerate to 2.5 per cent next year. This
deceleration, which the IMF expects because of monetary tightening, would
push US growth below the 2.7 per cent average projected for G7 nations and
the industrial world as a whole.
The IMF's growth forecasts for Japan have been raised 0.2 percentage points
for this year and next to 0.9 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively. A
'particularly positive' aspect of world economic developments remains the
rapid expansion of many Asian and some Latin American developing nations,
such as Argentina, Chile and Peru.
The IMF draws comfort from large margins of slack between actual and
potential output in many countries. Apart from the US, where little or no
slack is left in output and labour markets, 'output gaps' ranging from an
estimated 1.7 per cent in Germany to 5.6 per cent in Japan reduce inflation
dangers.
The report states all this gives no grounds for complacency. Areas exist
where output continues to fall, as in the former communist states of Russia,
Ukraine and Belarus. Despite signs of improvement, economic conditions
remain difficult in much of Africa. In the industrial countries, policy
makers are faced with difficult tasks if they are to secure a strong,
long-running expansion with low inflation and high investment that can help
cut unemployment.
They must avoid the policy failures of the 1980s and safeguard a high degree
of price stability. That means acting promptly to raise interest rates in
anticipation of inflationary pressures as recovery takes hold, and
strengthening efforts to cut fiscal deficits.
'A critical policy requirement is the need to deal with the large fiscal
imbalances that have lifted gross debt in the industrial countries as a
group to nearly 70 per cent of gross domestic product from 40 per cent in
1978.'
Fiscal imbalances have contributed to high real interest rates and weak
private investment over the past decade. Governments recognise the problem
and are acting, but consolidation plans 'in most cases. . . appear to be too
modest'.
The IMF draws a moral from the recent rise in worldwide bond yields, which
hit countries with large fiscal imbalances such as Italy, Sweden and Finland
hardest. Here, an urgent need exists to strengthen the fiscal outlook, to
establish greater credibility.
But macroeconomic measures alone will not solve the world's economic
problems. Reducing structural unemployment, which is Europe's big problem,
will need fundamental labour market reforms, 'including lowering and
restructuring unemployment benefits and related programmes, lowering minimum
wages in some countries, reducing non-wage labour costs, liberalising
employment and wage-setting practices, and strengthening training
programmes'.
The Uruguay Round needs to be implemented. More liberalisation of markets is
needed in many industrial countries. All countries must introduce reforms to
curb rising budgetary costs of health care and pensions. The IMF predicts
strong overall growth in the developing countries, but notes conditions
vary. The most successful have created a stable macroeconomic environment,
encouraged domestic savings and implemented structural reforms that increase
efficiency.
The Fund worries that the rise in private capital flows to developing
nations over the past five years could in some cases backfire. In 1989, net
outflow from developing countries totalled Dollars 14bn; last year it
exceeded Dollars 130bn.
Not all countries benefiting from capital inflows have done so because of
investment opportunities or strong fundamentals. Some may have been
beneficiaries of a 'general enthusiasm for emerging financial markets'. For
them, 'the risk of sudden changes in market sentiment is particularly
serious'.
Those former communist countries such as the Baltic states, the Czech
Republic, Hungary, Poland, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Albania and
Mongolia which implemented market reforms, 'are now growing, or appear to be
on the threshold of recovery, and prospects for continued growth are good.'
In others, including Russia and the Ukraine, output continues to contract
and more must be done to control inflation. Enormous difficulties must still
be faced over structural reform in Russia and some other 'transition'
countries.
Many banks and companies are insolvent. Large payments arrears have built
up. Progress on land reform and farm privatisation has been limited.
Subsidies and cheap credits distort market signals. The framework for a
market economy, including business laws, accounting standards, and a modern
banking system, is only gradually being put in place. 'Widespread corruption
and crime threaten to undermine support for market reforms.'
The World Economic Outlook: to be published next month.

FT  29 SEP 94 / IMF World Economic Outlook: UK told to cut public spending
targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The IMF last night told Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, that he should
cut public spending targets in his November budget to increase the
credibility of Britain's economic policy.
Mr Michael Mussa, director of the IMF's Research Department, also warned
that further UK interest rate increases would be needed at some point
following this month's half percentage point increase in bank base rates.
In its latest World Economic Outlook, the Fund said expenditure restraint
was critical to the government's objective of eliminating public borrowing
by the end of this decade.
It said that the decisions taken in last year's two budgets to consolidate
the UK's fiscal deficit had already brought a sizeable reduction in both
actual and structural deficits this year. 'Reducing nominal spending
ceilings in the upcoming budget to reflect lower-than-expected inflation
will be important to enhance policy credibility,' it added.
The IMF's comments suggest that the government's control totals in 1995/96
and 1996/97 should be cut from the Pounds 263bn and Pounds 272.3bn agreed
last November. The remarks could prove helpful to Mr Jonathan Aitken, the
chief secretary, who is currently negotiating with spending departments to
keep public spending for 1995/96 and subsequent years inside the
government's limits.
It is unclear how far the chancellor will be inclined to follow the IMF's
advice. So far he has maintained that hitting the spending targets in this
year's public expenditure round would be tough.
According to IMF estimates, the government's consolidation plans should
stabilise the UK's ratio of net debt to gross domestic product at about 40
per cent by 1997.
The IMF painted a generally upbeat picture of the UK economy. It forecast it
would grow by a real 3.3 per cent this year and 3 per cent in 1995 - well
above the government's forecast of 2.75 per cent growth for each year.
It said that output growth in Britain began recently to outpace potential.
It estimated the output gap - a measure of spare capacity expressed as a
percentage of GDP - at a relatively high 4 per cent, adding that it would be
eliminated only in the medium term.
However, it also predicted that inflation, measured by the government's
'underlying' measure of retail price inflation excluding mortgage interest
payments, would average 3.1 per cent next year. That would be higher than
the 2.5 per cent anticipated by the IMF for this year, and in the top half
of the government's 1-4 per cent target range.
In predicting a future interest rate rise, Mr Mussa told a news conference
he was not talking in terms of weeks or months. However, some form of
tightening of monetary conditions would be needed in the course of the
expansion.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Inquiry begins into alleged Tutsi massacres: Reports of
revenge killings which have exposed the failure of the UN in Rwanda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Nations experts flew into Rwanda yesterday to investigate whether the
victorious Tutsi army has been involved in reported massacres of returning
Hutu refugees.
The allegations of systematic revenge killings were first made by the UN
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) at the weekend. They have been denied
by the army-installed government in Kigali and have seriously embarrassed
other UN agencies working with Rwanda's new authorities.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, has ordered a news
blackout on reports of the revenge killings, which have exposed the failure
of the UN assistance mission in Rwanda to protect the lives of Hutu
civilians.
More than 2m Hutus fled Rwanda in July, when the Rwandan Patriotic Front, a
Tutsi-led guerrilla army, defeated a Hutu government guilty of directing
massacres against the country's minority Tutsi population. Human rights
groups estimate up to 1m Tutsis were killed in the final three months of
Rwanda's civil war.
The new government says it wants Hutu exiles to return. Without them, it
cannot rebuild Rwanda's war-shattered economy or create stable political
structures. The government fears the teeming refugee camps in Zaire and
Tanzania could prove fertile recruiting grounds for the remnants of a
defeated Hutu army intent on revenge.
But UNHCR officials suspended the repatriation of Hutus this week after a
team of investigators uncovered evidence of recent mass graves and heard
witness accounts of atrocities allegedly committed by soldiers of the
Rwandan Patriotic Front. 'As an agency which protects refugees we cannot in
all conscience send Hutus back,' a UNHCR official said yesterday in Geneva.
While the new team of UN investigators investigates further the conduct of
the Rwandan Patriotic Front, several human rights groups have begun to
criticise the failure of the UN to deploy security troops inside Rwanda and
to start international legal proceedings against those who masterminded the
genocide of Rwanda's Tutsi community.
Only 26 human rights monitors have been deployed inside Rwanda, despite Mr
Boutros Ghali's pledge to send 147 in August. UN-appointed human rights
officials , briefed to gather evidence of war crimes, have been denied the
personnel and financial resources they need to proceed with investigations.
The Paris-based International Federation of Human Rights, in a letter to Mr
Boutros Ghali, asks: 'Do these inadmissible delays by the international
community mean Africa should be considered a second-class continent and that
genocide against Africans is less serious than genocide in Europe?'
Another report*, published today by African Rights, a London human rights
group, argues that the UN is 'squandering a golden opportunity to stop the
cycle of impunity in Rwanda'. The 442-page document includes dozens of
testimonies of Tutsi survivors, and argues that enough evidence has been
amassed to extradite those guilty of genocide from Zaire and other
countries.
It reminds the UN of its legal obligation under the Genocide Convention to
bring prosecutions for crimes against humanity. Ms Rakiya Omaar, a
co-director of African Rights, says she hopes the report will shame the UN
into action. '

<TEXT>
Egyptian security forces yesterday rounded up more than 30 suspected Islamic
militants in Hurghada, 500km south of Cairo, following an attack by two
gunmen late on Tuesday in which a German tourist and two Egyptians were shot
dead.
A second German shot in the attack was said yesterday to be 'stable' after a
bullet was removed from his stomach. Witnesses said two men drew up in a
lorry, then opened fire with automatic weapons on a group of tourists in
Hurghada's market, before fleeing into an adjacent residential area.
The attack has raised fears of a renewed campaign by Islamic militants
against tourist targets following a five-month lull - the result largely of
a tough and concerted security operation which the Egyptian government
claimed had broken the back of militant Islamic groups.
Egypt's Red Sea resorts until now have been free of incidents throughout the
Gamaa al-Islamiyya's two-year-old campaign to put pressure on the government
by ruining the tourism industry.
The attack comes at a damaging time for tourism, which had begun a revival,
aided by the peaceful passage in Cairo of the recent International
Conference on Population and Development.

Nigeria's military rulers squandered more than Dollars 12bn of oil revenue
without proper accounting between 1988 and June 1994, an official report
said, Reuter reports from Lagos. The money had been placed in accounts set
up in 1988 for special projects and to receive a windfall of oil revenue
from the Gulf War, said Pius Okigbo, chairman of the panel on the reform and
reorganisation of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
He called the handling of the accounts 'a gross abuse of public trust'.
Money from the accounts was spent in less than six years on what could
neither be adjudged genuine high priority nor truly regenerative investment,
he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robert Gallucci, US ambassador-at-large, and Mr Kang Sok-ju, North
Korea's first deputy foreign minister, met yesterday morning in a bid to
unblock stalled negotiations on eliminating Pyongyang's nuclear capability,
Frances Williams writes from Geneva
The US said afterwards there had been 'an extensive exchange of views' while
North Korea described the discussions as 'serious and businesslike'. The two
sides plan to meet again today.
US officials had hoped to wrap up a deal with North Korea this week granting
the isolated communist state safer atomic reactor technology in return for
full disclosure of its nuclear activities, current and past. But additional
demands by Pyongyang, going well beyond an outline agreement reached last
month, quickly brought the talks to a standstill.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Indian plague cases soar to 1,400
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Plague cases multiplied in India yesterday as the authorities struggled to
control the deadly disease and assuage domestic and international concern.
The total of reported cases of suspected plague rose to 1,400, with about
500 new cases yesterday, mainly in the western city of Surat, where
pneumonic plague broke out a week ago, and in the remote eastern part of
Maharashtra state, where bubonic plague first struck a month ago. The
government's national institute for communicable diseases also recorded
three more deaths, taking the official toll to 47, though unofficial
estimates ran as high as 100.
The health authorities were anxiously watching for signs that 300,000-plus
people who have fled Surat have spread the disease. About 30 suspected cases
have been recorded in Delhi, more than 40 in the tourist mecca of Rajasthan
and about 50 in Bombay, the country's commercial capital which lies close to
Surat. Further isolated cases have been reported as far away as Calcutta.
Other countries have taken precautions against the disease. Pakistan has
banned flights from Bombay and is considering suspending services from
Delhi. Saudi Arabia yesterday banned all flights from India, forcing a
Jeddah-bound Air India jet to turn back in mid-flight.
The UK, US, Germany, and France are among countries which have started
monitoring visitors from India and urging them to report to a doctor if they
develop fever-like symptoms. Some governments, including the UK, have also
urged their nationals to avoid travelling to Gujarat state, which includes
Surat.
In Germany, which has put out the strongest warning, at least two tour
groups have cancelled holidays to India, raising fears that the outbreak
will affect the Indian travel industry.
The plague has also seriously disrupted business in Surat, a city of 2m with
important textile, chemicals and diamond polishing industries. The Gujarat
Chamber of Commerce and Industry estimates the city is losing about Rs500m a
day in turnover, due to the absence of owners, managers and workers who
fled.
The plague has prompted bursts of public anger at the failure of the health
services to provide adequate care, particularly in Surat, where protestors
have stoned private clinics abandoned by their owners.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Opposition forms voting bloc in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Nine Japanese opposition parties and groups yesterday formed a parliamentary
voting bloc, a decisive step towards creation of the first strong opposition
party in nearly 50 years.
The new Kaikaku, or Renovation, group commands 187 lower house seats,
slightly less than the 200-member Liberal Democratic Party, the biggest
member of the three-party government coalition of conservatives and
socialists.
Renovation's birth fruit of intensive backroom negotiations over the summer
puts pressure on the three-month-old government as it prepares for its first
parliamentary session, due to start tomorrow. Group members aim to turn
themselves into a party proper in November, once they have settled on a
leader. Former Premiers Tsutomu Hata and Toshiki Kaifu are top contenders, a
TV poll showed yesterday.
Mr Ichiro Ozawa, who brought together the previous two government coalitions
and helped form the group, will take behind-the-scenes control of Renovation
as chairman of its action committee, similar to a chief whip. He is unlikely
to stand for the party leadership, preferring to exercise influence from the
wings.
Renovation's moderate policies are close to those of the government, though
its leading members lean toward a slightly more assertive foreign and
defence stance. A statement yesterday promises to pursue 'a politics of
responsibility that does not postpone problems'.
Its members broadly support the most important bills due to come to
parliament this autumn, on electoral and tax reform, but will seize on any
weaknesses in the government coalition to woo defectors.
Mr Ozawa's 62-seat Japan Renewal Party, dominant member of the previous two
coalition governments, is Renovation's largest member, followed by the
52-seat Komeito (Clean Government) party, supported by Soka Gakkai, a
cash-and-vote-rich Buddhist organisation.
Renovation's arrival springs partly from the financial and political
incentives for the opposition to close ranks before a new political and
electoral system takes effect at the turn of the year.
From January, political parties will qualify for a Y30.5bn (Pounds 198m)
annual public subsidy, designed to reduce their dependence on corporate
donors. Larger parties will qualify for a disproportionately larger subsidy
than smaller ones, because the share-out is determined by parties' spending
in the previous year.
The parties in Renovation have little chance of a combined majority if they
individually fight a general election under the new system, voting
projections by the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper show.
How much power to be accorded Mr Ozawa is another issue yet to be clarified.
before the merger can be consummatedMr Ozawa's allies value his political
skill but this is tinged with wariness of being dominated by him. Soka
Gakkai's position is sensitive because of Japan's separation of state and
religion.

FT  29 SEP 94 / China's leaders line up for succession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's ruling Communist Party, the world's largest mass political
organisation, has approved a blueprint aimed at bolstering its hold on power
at a sensitive moment in the transition to a new generation of leaders.
The Central Committee document emphasised the role of President Jiang Zemin
as the 'core' of the leadership and successor to Deng Xiaoping, China's
90-year-old senior leader.
The resolution, adopted by the Central Committee meeting in Beijing,
reflected growing concern about a weakening of central control and a
crumbling of communist authority, especially in rural areas where unrest has
become common.
China's rulers stressed the need to strengthen 'grass-roots organisations'.
This indicated recognition of the party's poor standing among rural dwellers
who account for about 80 per cent of the population of 1.2bn. Party
membership nationwide stands at about 40m.
'The party's grass roots organisations are the foundations of the party's
operations and its combat effectiveness,' the document said.
The four-day plenary session of the 14th Central Committee concluded just
three days before China celebrates, on October 1, the 45th anniversary of
the revolution. It coincided with persistent reports of Mr Deng's failing
health.
China's leadership has been in transition for the past two years. Mr Deng's
expected demise has fuelled worries about the ability of a new generation to
assert its authority.
The central committee document referred to 'all the hazards' the party was
encountering in the new phase. This was an acknowledgment of the
difficulties of managing the transition from a centrally-planned to market
system.
China's leaders, in their call for a re-invigoration of central authority,
revealed deep-seated concerns about emergent regionalism with the growth of
powerful provincial interests and a corresponding loss of authority in
Beijing.
'Our country is currently undergoing extensive and profound social changes,
and this requires our party to do better in upholding and improving
democratic centralism,' the statement said. It was 'necessary to safeguard
central authority, and forcefully implement the party's line, principles and
policies.' The central committee called for a renewed campaign against
corruption. Public confidence has been shaken by the spectacle of greedy
officials prospering from the economic boom.
China's emphasis on a collective rule in the new era exposes official
concerns about a possible leadership vacuum that might follow Mr Deng's
death. The spectre of post-Deng factional strife looms in the minds of
Chinese leaders.
China's leadership session, the first meeting of the more-than-300 Central
Committee members since last year, also coincides with growing worries about
rising prices and dangers of social unrest among the disaffected.
A nervous ruling elite is seeking to arm itself with the necessary weapons
to combat expected turbulence. Strengthening lacklustre party institutions
is part of this process.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese consumers' growing appetite for discount shopping contributed to a
decline in turnover at high-priced department stores and supermarkets last
month.
Sales at large retailers fell 1.7 per cent in the year to August, more than
wiping out a 1.2 per cent rise in July that had appeared to break a 25-month
run of declines.
Department stores were hardest hit, with a 3.6 per cent sales fall, the
International Trade and Industry ministry said. Supermarket sales stagnated.
Discount stores have been the main beneficiary of a rise in consumer
spending. Yet they are not included in government statistics on retailing,
nor in official inflation measures.
Consumer goods prices are falling by 0.4 per cent annually, twice as fast as
shown by the latest government data, for July, a survey by Sanwa Research
Institute shows. Sanwa estimates discounting is depressing GDP by 0.3 per
cent a year. The rise in cheap imports is depriving Japanese manufacturers
of 0.8 per cent of production, worth Y1,800bn (Pounds 11.6bn) a year, Sanwa
believes.

FT  29 SEP 94 / 'Favours' blamed for putting Indonesia in second division:
Accusations of politically motivated protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most economists agree that Indonesia is poised to join its neighbours in the
newly industrialised economy ranks. Average annual economic growth of 6.6
per cent over the last 25 years has earned the country a reputation for
stability and promising growth.
However, disgruntled Indonesians say public and private monopolies that
enjoy high tariff protection are an impediment to faster growth.
With nearby Thailand and Malaysia averaging growth rates of between 8 and 10
per cent a year, and an even faster pace in China, they are saying that 6.6
per cent is not good enough.
Most recently, they point to a presidential decree giving tariff protection
to a Dollars 1.7bn petrochemical plant in West Java, called Chandra Asri.
The plant, due to come on stream next year, will produce olefin products for
the first time in Indonesia. The decree prevents cheaper olefin products
from entering the country.
It emerged that the plant is jointly owned by Mr Prayogo Pangestu, a
well-connected tycoon with a majority stake in the big timber company PT
Barito Pacific Timber, and President Suharto's son, Mr Bambang Trihatmodjo.
Private-sector economists and opposition parties complain that decisions on
protection are arbitrary, with policy-makers favouring their close contacts.
Protection, they complain, depends on political favouritism rather than
economic logic.
Economists point to several of the country's largest industries, such as
food processing, petrochemicals and pulp and paper, all of which have been
protected for decades by tariff barriers and import bans. They say that this
could be costing the economy as much as 2 per cent in annual growth.
'In the context of Indonesia, which is seeking to become a more competitive
exporter, these barriers have a very important knock-on effect because they
increase the cost of raw materials to downstream industries,' says a
Jakarta-based economist.
The government has stood its ground on protection for the Chandra Asri
plant. Mr Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, state minister for investment, says the
tariff protection is necessary because industries such as Chandra Asri take
a long time to make adequate returns on their investments. President Suharto
says protection for industries is a temporary measure.
The issue is made more sensitive by the fact that most of the largest
Indonesian conglomerates are controlled by ethnic Chinese and there is
growing resentment at their dominant role in private business.
There is also a more general assault on the role of 'big business' in
Indonesia's economy. Monopolies in key sectors are being seen as preventing
smaller companies from setting up, thus limiting the benefits of growth to a
small portion of Indonesia's 187m people.
'It should be a level playing field but those who are benefiting the most
are the big players,' says Mr Laksamana Sukardi, a prominent member of the
opposition Democratic Party, the PDI. 'That has accelerated the accumulation
of wealth in a few hands.'
The government is not immune to these criticisms. Efforts have been made to
reduce tariffs and liberalise the economy. Earlier this year a trade
liberalisation package cut import duties on 739 goods, lifted non-tariff
barriers on 27 commodities and removed import surcharges in 108 items.
Many market-skewing measures remain, however. In the food-processing
industry, for example, the government controls the price of sugar, which
keeps the cost of a key raw material artificially high.
The pulp and paper industry is another that comes under intermittent attack.
The domestic industry is dominated by the Sinar Mas group, Indonesia's
second-largest conglomerate. The influence of Sinar Mas and other Indonesian
paper manufacturers has been sufficiently strong to ensure a 40 per cent
tariff on imported paper. Indonesian printers complain that paper accounts
for 70 per cent of their production costs, and many smaller printers have
been forced to close.
'There needs to be further deregulation but this has been met with a lot of
resistance in the government because (many) areas of the economy deliver
huge profits to key economic players,' says a Jakarta-based economist.
The government is aware of the complaints and ministers advise patience: 'We
are going in the right direction,' says Mr Tunky Ariwibowo, minister of
industry. But economists complain that there is no timetable for phasing out
tariffs.
'It does moves slowly here compared with other south-east Asian economies
but deregulation has been a consistent policy,' says a Jakarta-based
consultant. 'You have to remember that in a 10-year period Indonesia has
moved from a highly-protected import substitution economy to an
export-oriented economy.'

<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, yesterday called for
concerted international action against money laundering.
'Money laundering poses a threat to every member of the Commonwealth,' said
Mr Clarke in a speech to the Commonwealth Finance Ministers' meeting in
Malta. He said it allowed drug traffickers to develop and expand their
operations, illegal arms dealers to spread more and deadlier weapons to
terrorists, and international fraudsters to bleed economies dry.
Rough estimates of the total amount of criminal money which may be laundered
run up to Dollars 500bn (Pounds 333bn) a year.
Mr Clarke said finance ministers should take forward the recommendations of
the Financial Action Task Force, set up by the Group of Seven countries in
1989.
They should ensure financial institutions know their customers and do not
operate anonymous bank accounts, he said. Financial institutions should also
pay attention to large, complex or unusual transactions, and develop
programmes against money laundering.
Finally, supervisory authorities should ensure financial institutions have
adequate procedures in place to combat the laundering.

An Indonesian campaign against prostitutes, beggars and suspected criminals
in Jakarta ahead of November's Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit has
led to increased human rights abuses, Amnesty International said yesterday,
Victor Mallet writes from Bangkok.
The government had put in 15,000 military and police officers 'to clear the
streets of political and criminal 'undesirables',' Mr Pierre Sane,
secretary-general of the London-based human rights group, said in Bangkok.
Excessive force had been used in breaking up peaceful demonstrations, with
scores of alleged criminals shot dead, Amnesty said.
Jakarta residents could not confirm how many extra troops had been sent to
the capital, but said government forces had been seen clearing beggars off
the streets to improve Indonesia's image for the summit meeting, to be
attended by President Clinton. Amnesty, which yesterday launched a report*
on Indonesia's human rights record, wants rights and labour issues raised
during the summit.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Mexican ruling party official assassinated: Stock exchange
falls sharply as fragile political peace is shattered

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The secretary-general of Mexico's ruling party, Mr Jose Francisco Ruiz
Massieu, was shot dead yesterday in the centre of Mexico City, shattering
the fragile political peace following last month's presidential elections,
writes Ted Bardacke in Mexico City.
Mr Ruiz, number two in the Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) and
former governor of the state of Guerrero, was last week named head of the
PRI's majority delegation in the Chamber of Deputies. He was also said to be
in the running to become interior minister, in charge of internal security
and politics.
Mr Ruiz was shot in the neck as he was driving his car away from a breakfast
meeting with PRI deputies.
The alleged assailant, who witnesses said was armed with a semi-automatic
weapon, was being held by federal agents.
Mexican financial markets fell sharply on the news. The stock market was
down 53 points, a fall of 1.9 per cent, at the close. It had fallen as much
as 3 per cent during the day. The peso fell 1.1 centavos against the dollar
to 3.3965.
The attack came just over six months after the ruling party's presidential
candidate, Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, was shot dead in Tijuana.
Mr Colosio's murder, the first assassination of a senior government figure
in Mexico since the 1920s, together with the still unresolved Indian peasant
uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, led to concern that more
political violence might follow.
His replacement, Mr Ernesto Zedillo, won the August 21 election, in spite of
continuing frustration in Mexico that the motives behind Mr Colosio's death
have yet to be explained.
Mr Ruiz, a graduate of Essex University, had been named as a negotiator for
Mr Zedillo in the talks over political reform expected to begin next month.
At the breakfast Mr Ruiz was attending before the attack, he explained to
new PRI deputies the framework of both national political reform and
internal reform of the ruling party.
These called for eight months of consultations culminating in changes to
internal PRI structures, including the method of selecting candidates.
Mr Ruiz was known as an advocate of internal primary elections as well as a
more powerful and independent legislature.

The House of Representatives foreign affairs committee yesterday voted to
back the US military intervention in Haiti but to demand a handover to the
United Nations by March 1, writes George Graham. The committee rebuffed the
Clinton administration's pleas that any time limit could endanger the
operation, but Republican members still voted against the measure. They said
it provided retroactive congressional backing for a misjudged policy.
Republican senators have submitted a similar resolution requiring the
withdrawal of US troops before December 31, but Senate leaders do not expect
a vote for a binding time limit.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Russia and US reach N-accord: Summit fails to resolve rift
on Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Russia agreed yesterday to speed up the dismantling of their
nuclear arsenals and reached a 'conceptual agreement' on ending Russia's
controversial arms sales to Iran.
After a two-day summit in Washington President Bill Clinton and President
Boris Yeltsin said they had agreed to implement the nuclear cuts agreed in
the Start 2 missile reduction treaty as soon as the pact was ratified by the
two countries.
The Start 2 treaty, signed by Mr Yeltsin and former President George Bush in
January 1993, provides for the elimination of 15,000 of the 21,000 nuclear
warheads in the two countries' arsenals, but allows them until the end of
2002 to complete the task.
'By doing it right away we can save at least seven and perhaps more years,'
Mr Yeltsin said at a White House press conference after the summit ended.
Mr Yeltsin said he had also agreed with Mr Clinton on a deal that would
bring an end to Russian sales of military equipment to Iran and allow Russia
to become part of the successor regime to the Cocom system which regulated
arms exports from the west during the cold war.
An existing contract signed in 1988 would be honoured, Mr Yeltsin said, but
thereafter no new contracts would be signed and no new weapons would be
supplied. 'That is the principle on which Bill Clinton agreed to let us
participate in the post-Cocom regime,' Mr Yeltsin said.
Mr Clinton hurriedly noted he had reached only 'conceptual agreement' with
his Russian counterpart. 'We have to work through the details.'
The US and Russia remained at odds over whether to lift the embargo on arms
deliveries to Bosnia, even though the Bosnian government's request for a
delay has at least put the issue on ice. Mr Yeltsin yesterday repeated his
opposition to lifting the embargo.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Tight guard as Haiti MPs weigh amnesty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A special session of Haiti's parliament, protected by US soldiers armed with
machine guns, got under way yesterday to consider an amnesty law for the
country's outgoing military regime.
The parliament had less than two hours' debate after a ceremonial opening,
and the business of drafting the amnesty law will resume today.
In a fresh burst of violence, a pro-democracy demonstrator was shot and
wounded by a Haitian paramilitary gunman just a few blocks from the
parliament building.
Witnesses said the man was shot in the chest as a crowd advanced towards the
headquarters of a paramilitary group. They said nervous members of the
paramilitary group, fearing the crowd was seeking revenge, fired to disperse
the demonstrators.
The Haitian legislature's meeting was the first in over a year, an
achievement that seemed to owe more to US efforts to secure the parliament
buildings and fly some exiled deputies into Port-au-Prince than the
resilience of the democratic institutions.
The Haitian deputies appeared deeply divided on whether to endorse a
wide-ranging amnesty for crimes committed by the regime that ousted
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide three years ago.
'I can't give an amnesty to assassins,' said one of 12 pro-Aristide senators
as he was flown in from Miami with an armed guard. But others said only a
broad amnesty would allow Haiti to move forward.
Crowds outside the barbed-wire-ringed parliament building were boisterous
and cheered returning deputies.
But inside the assembly, relations were strained. As Mr Jean-Louis Firmin,
president of the Senate and National Assembly, welcomed the return to
constitutional order and thanked President Bill Clinton for making the
re-opening of parliament possible, one deputy erupted: 'It is a shame. It is
a national embarrassment.'
The special session was convened by Mr Aristide, who is still in exile in
the US. The military leadership under General Raoul Cedras is expected to
step down once the law is passed, opening the way for Mr Aristide to return
to office.
The deployment of US troops around the parliament buildings was a sign of
the significance the Clinton administration is placing on the amnesty law,
which would not only mark the end of military rule but could pave the way
for reconciliation of Aristide supporters and Cedras loyalists.
The conspicuous US presence has led to criticism in the Haitian press that
the nation's democratic institutions are being violated. As a result, there
is to be no US army presence inside the chamber.
The 82-person Chamber of Deputies has not mustered the necessary 42 members
to achieve a quorum in 16 months, as many members were in exile or in
hiding.
President Aristide, in convening parliament, has called on the assembly to
debate not only the amnesty but also six other pieces of legislation,
including the separation of police and army powers.
Meanwhile, continued looting of humanitarian foodstores elsewhere in
Port-au-Prince was a further cause of concern to US officials yesterday. A
US embassy spokesman confirmed that the surge in pillaging showed the
breakdown of local policing. 'Clearly we are seeing some police stepping
back and letting the law and order situation evaporate,' he said.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Yeltsin pledges 'lasting peace': Summit fails to resolve
rift on Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday promised a lasting peace between
his country and the US as he approached the end of his two-day summit with
US President Bill Clinton.
'There are people in my country, though few, who say that our relationship
with the US is transient and that an era of confrontation will return. But I
would like to tell you that we have never fought the US and I believe, and I
can say as president of Russia, that we will never fight the US,' he said.
At the Library of Congress, where the two presidents opened an exhibition on
the Russian Orthodox Church and the indigenous peoples of Alaska, Mr Yeltsin
continued the bonhomie and back-slapping that has marked this summit.
'There are some extremist radicals from my country - people of poor
education, I think, and of very low origins - who demand Alaska back for
Russia. But I don't think this is serious stuff,' Mr Yeltsin said, referring
to the call sometimes made by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian
nationalist leader, for the return of Alaska, which the US bought from
Russia in 1867 for Dollars 7.2m.
Some differences between the two countries remain unresolved, although one
of the sharpest disagreements, over whether to lift the embargo on arms
deliveries to Bosnia, has at least been put on ice by the Bosnian
government's request for a delay.
Mr Yeltsin yesterday repeated his opposition to lifting the embargo. 'Now
the Bosnian Moslems think they have to wait six months. Let's wait for six
months and then perhaps we can decide once and for all that this should not
be done.'
US officials said some agreement was expected on another issue that has
caused friction between the two countries: Russian sales of military
equipment, especially submarines, to Iran.

FT  29 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Japan to press EU over vehicle imports -
Negotiators want agreement with Brussels revised upwards to reflect market
changes
</HEADLINE>

Japan will press for an increase in vehicle exports to the European Union
this year due to stronger than expected growth in demand. The request will
be made when trade negotiators meet for consultations in Brussels today.
During the two-day talks, Japanese trade negotiators are expected to request
that an agreement to maintain exports of Japanese vehicles to the EU at
984,000 units be revised upwards to reflect market changes.
'The market is expected to grow more than we anticipated in March. The basic
policy is to increase exports if the market grows,' an official at the
Ministry of Trade and Industry said.
Under an agreement reached in 1991, Japan is committed to keeping its
vehicle exports to the EU within an agreed level each year until the end of
1999, when the EU automobile market is to be fully liberalised.
The level of Japanese vehicle exports to the EU is determined through
consultation and depends on an agreed forecast for regional demand. The two
sides have also agreed that if demand varies significantly from initial
forecasts, the agreed level of exports could be revised.
The Japanese authorities agreed in March to keep Japanese exports to the EU
this year at 984,000 units on the basis of a forecast for overall market
growth of 2 per cent. That would have represented a nearly 18 per cent
decline from the level of Japanese vehicle exports to the EU in 1993.
However, Miti now expects the EU vehicle market to grow 5-6 per cent this
year and wants the level of Japanese exports increased accordingly. Vehicle
registrations in the EU between January and July have already risen 5.8 per
cent to 7.5m units.
Increasing the level of Japanese vehicle exports to the EU is likely to
unsettle European vehicle producers. The Japanese share of the European
market is expected to top 15 per cent by 1998 from nearly 12 per cent in
1992, according to DRI, the UK-based analysts.
But it is unlikely that Japanese vehicle exports to the EU will actually
increase significantly even if the quota is raised, as the strength of the
yen has eroded the price advantage of Japanese cars exported to the EU.
Japanese vehicle manufacturers have boosted manufacturing capacity in Europe
in recent years, with Japanese plants already accounting for more than a
fifth of British car production.
The overall result has been that in the first eight months of this year,
Japanese vehicle exports to the EU fell nearly 30 per cent to 561,156 units.

FT  29 SEP 94 / US durable goods orders rise sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US durable goods orders rose sharply in August, the Commerce Department
reported yesterday, signalling that the US economy is continuing to expand
steadily.
The Commerce Department announced that new orders for manufactured durable
goods rose by 6 per cent last month to Dollars 154bn, a slightly steeper
increase than had generally been expected.
The increase provoked short-lived fears in the financial markets that the
Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates further to bring the pace
of economic growth back to a steadier and less inflation-prone level.
But the jump was not much larger than had been anticipated and was set
against a 4 per cent decline in July. After an initial flurry markets
settled back to watch other indicators.
The Federal Open Markets Committee, which sets the Fed's interest rate
policy, made no announcement of any change in interest rates after its
meeting on Tuesday. Financial markets have interpreted this absence of any
clear signal as meaning that the FOMC gave Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed
chairman, considerable leeway to raise interest rates if economic data
before its next meeting in November show the economy still growing faster
than can be sustained without an upsurge in inflation.
But the Fed chairman was not expected to respond so soon after the FOMC
meeting to one apparently strong economic statistic, particularly one as
volatile as durable goods orders, which can bounce wildly because of a
handful of new aircraft orders.
Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the durable goods data indicated
investment was still an important factor behind economic expansion. He
called this 'a positive sign for productivity growth prospects and for
sustained moderation in inflation'.
The commerce department said motor vehicles and parts contributed to over
half both of the rise in orders in August and of the fall in July because
some car makers had retooled for the new model year a month earlier than
usual.
Transportation equipment, including aircraft, rose 19.1 per cent in August
after dropping 14.8 per cent in July.

US telephone company Telegroup has launched a toll-free callback service for
European subscribers which it says will more than halve weekday phone calls
inside Europe, Reuter reports from Brussels. The service, called Global
Access, allows subscribers in Europe to route calls through telephone
switches in the US and Europe to take advantage of lower prices.
Telegroup says it has 30,000 subscribers worldwide, of which half are in
Europe. To make a call the subscriber dials the Global Access network in New
York, using a touchtone phone, enters a code corresponding to his telephone
number, and then hangs up. The subscriber is called back in a few seconds,
receives a dial tone and then makes the call.

FT  29 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Callback services help reverse Asia
charges - Phone services that undercut monopolies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only the most profligate managers could fail to be tempted: businesses in
thrall to national telecommunications monopolies in Asia are being offered
savings of up to 50 per cent on international telephone calls by US
'callback' companies.
Such companies have already made an impact in Latin America and Europe. In
south-east Asia, the growing popularity of money-saving callback services
has been highlighted in recent weeks by protests from the state-controlled
monopolies in Singapore and Thailand.
Aimed at first at US expatriates and travellers seeking to avoid exorbitant
international telephone rates and hotel surcharges outside the US, the
callback services are finding new customers in stockbroking firms and other
businesses with high volumes of international voice and data calls.
Customers typically save money by dialling a designated number in the US and
hanging up after one ring. A computer from the callback company immediately
rings back - a call from the US to Thailand is much cheaper than from
Thailand to the US - and allows the customer to dial on anywhere in the US
or abroad.
Seattle-based Kallback, one of the leading US 're-origination' services,
says that a caller from Thailand dialling the UK via Kallback in the US
would make savings of 38 per cent over the rate charged by the
Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT) on an average call; a call to
Australia from Thailand using Kallback would be 23 per cent cheaper than a
conventional call by direct dialling.
'It's an arbitrage situation between countries,' said Mr Joel Eisenberg,
Kallback's chief executive. 'We have found a new market developing among
businesses in countries that have very high rates like Thailand.'
Most of Kallback's customers worldwide are individuals, but companies
account for more than half its call volume. In Thailand, where traffic
congestion in Bangkok keeps business executives in their cars for hours at a
time, half Kallback's accounts are for mobile telephones.
The state-owned CAT shares revenue with foreign tele-communications networks
on calls both out of and into Thailand, but on outgoing calls it uses its
monopoly control of all international traffic to add hefty premiums.
Officials from the CAT, an organisation with close links to the Thai air
force, recently denounced callback services and said they undermined
Thailand's national interest.
Similar protests were made in Singapore; international charges there are
more moderate than Thailand's, but the partly privatised Singapore Telecom
(ST) has a monopoly until the year 2007. 'It became a major issue,' said Mr
Eisenberg. 'They said it (callback service) was illegal. Now Singapore
Telecom has backed down.'
The Singapore government decided that ST should respond to the challenge by
offering better service at competitive prices, although the callback
companies, which already have about 40,000 users on the island, are not
allowed to advertise in the Singapore media because they are not licensed to
operate there.
In Thailand the CAT has accused the callback companies of breaking the law,
but no-one can find any law they are violating and the companies have been
advertising their services in the press.
'Thailand will probably have to do something similar to Singapore,' said a
Bangkok stockbroker whose company recently subscribed to Kallback, 'which is
to admit that it's part of the service. The CAT are more concerned about
their bonuses at the year-end rather than the consumer.'
There have been some cases around the world of national telecommunications
monopolies harassing callback companies by dialing their numbers repeatedly
and jamming their systems, but Mr Eisenberg said this had not happened to
Kallback.
He added that it was probably not worthwhile for monopolies to alienate
telephone users by attacking callback companies, given that the callback
services still account for less than one per cent of the total international
market.
Thai monopolies do not give up easily, however. The Telephone Organisation
of Thailand (TOT) - another body influenced by the armed forces which has
the monopoly of all domestic fixed-line traffic in Thailand - is attempting
to enforce a concession agreement giving a company called Lines Technology
the exclusive right to provide domestic on-line data services.
Critics of the TOT have ridiculed the deal, pointing out that several
companies, including banks and business information companies, are already
providing data services to their customers via TOT lines and are unlikely to
stop.
The CAT, as it tries to stifle competitors in its international fiefdom, has
vowed to use unspecified 'protection techniques' against the callback
providers, although it has yet to act.
'Thailand has still maintained the CAT monopoly and the CAT is fighting
tooth and nail to hold that,' said Mr Daniel Fineman, a senior stock analyst
at stockbrokers Jardine Fleming Thanakom. 'I see no sign that they are
willing to give it up any time soon.'

rise

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese vehicle exports are likely to record a rise again in September,
having seen a temporary decline in August, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The
Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association (Jama) said vehicle exports fell
8.8 per cent from a year earlier to 325,174 units in August. In July they
edged up 0.3 per cent from a year earlier to 405,578 vehicles, the first
year-on-year gain in 15 months. Last month's decline was partly due to
higher exports of new Honda Accords to the US in August 1993, Jama said.
'August posted a short-lived decline. Exports in and after September are
likely to mark a year-on-year increase again, said Mr Hiroshi Suemasa, a
senior analyst at Kankaku Research Institute.
However, Nissan reported that August exports marked the first year-on-year
decline in three months, due to poor demand in Europe where domestic
carmakers boosted their sales by providing incentives. Nissan's vehicle
exports fell 11.7 per cent from a year earlier to 45,364 units.

Mr Jack Valenti, chairman of the US Motion Picture Association, yesterday

In a speech to be delivered at the American Chamber of Commerce in Paris, Mr
Valenti said the US wants to see 'a dynamically successful French
audio-visual industry'. The stronger the French industry became, the larger
the French audience would be, he said. The US would get a share of the
larger audiences. Co-operative efforts between European producers and the US
film industry were already under way, he said. Referring to French efforts
to limit US television programming in the EU, he said that new technologies
'will defy restrictive regulation.
'Barriers, protectionism, hedge rows are out of place in a world of creative
competition and expanding visual choice. He who builds walls to keep others
from coming in soon discovers that he has difficulty getting out,' he added.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Haitian MPs fly back to draft amnesty law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US efforts to achieve the first quorum of the Haitian legislature in more
than a year looked set to be rewarded as a dozen exiled parliamentarians
were flown in for the ceremonial opening of parliament yesterday afternoon.
The special session was convened by elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide
primarily to pass a law granting amnesty to General Raoul Cedras and the
army generals who seized power in a coup three years ago. The military
leadership is expected to step down once the law is passed. The meeting
yesterday was ceremonial and the business of drafting an amnesty law is due
to get under way today.
The deployment of US troops around the parliament buildings is a further
illustration of the significance the Clinton administration is placing on
the amnesty law, which would not only mark the end of military rule but
could pave the way for the reconciliation of Aristide supporters and Cedras
loyalists.
The conspicuous US presence has led to criticism in the Haitian press that
the nation's democratic institutions are being violated. As a result, there
will be no US army presence inside the chamber.
The delicacy of respecting Haitian sovereignty while sending in servicemen
to secure its legislature even tripped up the deft Mr Stanley Schrager, US
embassy spokesman, who said: 'We need a quorum, no, they need a quorum.' He
added: 'It (the parliament) is a Haitian institution. It's a convocation of
the very important Haitian parliament.' As well as the deputies and senators
returning from the US and Canada yesterday morning, US officials were hoping
that some of the 13 parliamentarians in hiding in Haiti would also attend.
The 82-person Chamber of Deputies has not mustered the necessary 42 US
servicemen working side-by-side with Haitian police officers guarding the
legislature were expected to bar the 11 senators elected in January 1993 in
a poll which the US, among others, believes to have been stage-managed by
the Cedras regime.
There was considerable interest outside the parliament buildings yesterday
as to whether Gen Cedras, who as Haiti's commander-in-chief has the
constitutional right to attend the opening of parliament, would come to the
session.
Mr Bernard Sanzaricq, president of the Senate, was understood to be
preparing a draft of the amnesty law, although another draft that was due to
be debated last year before its author, the then Justice Minister Guy
Mallory, was assassinated, has found favour with a number of deputies and,
unofficially, with US embassy officials.
President Aristide, in convening parliament, has called on the assembly to
debate not only the amnesty but also six other pieces of legislation,
including the separation of police and army powers.
Continued looting of humanitarian foodstores elsewhere in Port-au-Prince was
a further cause of concern to US officials yesterday. The embassy announced

give a date when the lines would be reopened.
US army officials would not promise non-governmental organisations army
protection, but pledged that the 'US military will not stand idly by while
this looting goes on'.
Mr Schrager confirmed that the surge in pillaging was a reflection of the
breakdown of domestic policing. 'Clearly we are seeing some police stepping
back and letting the law and order situation evaporate,' he said, 'but I
can't tell whether it's by design or happenstance'.

Production in three of General Motors' North American plants stopped
yesterday as a parts shortage began to be felt following a walk-out on
Tuesday by 11,500 workers at a parts plant in Flint, Michigan.
The dispute threatens to stall most of GM's North American plants. It has
focused attention on the company's hiring practices in the wake of soaring
production volumes this year. The United Auto Workers union says the company
is forcing its members to work increasing overtime to raise production,
rather than hiring new workers.
As part of its effort to plug growing labour shortages in some plants, GM
has also offered incentives to encourage workers to move to plants which are
understaffed.
The company has cut its hourly workforce in North America by around 50,000,
to 250,000, in the past three years in an effort to bring these operations
back into profit.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Brussels pressure grows over networks

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Karel Van Miert, EU commissioner responsible for competition policy, said
yesterday he was considering the use of special powers to force through the
liberalisation of alternative telecommunications infrastructure, such as
cable, energy and transport networks.
His announcement followed the failure of EU industry ministers to support
commission efforts to set a deadline by which member states would have to
throw open their networks to competition. The decision reflects growing
frustration within Brussels and certain member states at the slow pace in
embracing new information technology.
It is not yet clear that the commission will back Mr Van Miert's intention
to use so-called Article 90 powers to force the shake-up, which would allow
private operators to use alternative networks for the provision of services
already open to competition. This does not include 'voice' telephony, which
according to an earlier agreement, will not be opened up to competition
until January 1, 1998.
Yesterday Mr Van Miert said there was considerable support for the
liberalisation of alternative networks from member states, even if
significant differences remained over the liberalisation of traditional
telephone networks, most of which remain under monopoly control.
'We will push ahead with alternative infrastructures,' said Mr Van Miert.
'The proposals will be on the table by the time of the next telecoms council
meeting in November.'
Earlier, backed by Germany and the UK, Mr Martin Bangemann, commissioner
responsible for industry, failed to persuade member states that they should
set a deadline by which all existing networks should be deregulated and
private enterprises freed to build their own infrastructures.
Ministers from certain countries, notably Belgium and Spain, said they did
not want to discuss detail until the commission had presented a green paper
on liberalisation of infrastructures, expected by the end of the year.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Parliament yesterday rejected by an overwhelming majority the
prospect of a multi-speed Europe, but said at the same time that if
recalcitrant member states like the UK continued to block further EU
integration they should be by-passed.
In spite of the strong endorsement of a carefully drafted resolution,
yesterday's debate highlighted the confusion and division inside the EU over
the future shape and pace of integration.
Yesterday's resolution was backed by the two large Socialist and Christian
Democrat blocs. It addressed the ideas mooted this month by Germany's
governing Christian Democrats and the French government, about a 'hard-core'
of Germany, France and the Benelux countries moving faster towards economic,
monetary and political integration, while their partners followed more
slowly in their wake.
MEPs from Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal expressed their countries' fear
of exclusion, but still, in the main, backed northern MEPs' denunciation of
blocking tactics by countries such as the UK. The parliament said: 'It would
be inconceivable to exclude' member states ready and able to pursue
integration with 'equal rights and duties'.
But it warned that if a small minority of member states attempted to block
all progress in 1996, ways would have to be found of allowing member states
which want to pursue their efforts to achieve European integration to do so.
The Maastricht treaty review conference in 1996, which will decide on the
extent to which the Union must tighten its links in order to bring in new
east and central European states, will still see governments in the driving
seat.
The resolution, alluding to recent UK government comments about a
multi-speed EU, also denounced the British and Danish opt-outs from the
Maastricht treaty as the root of 'dangerous speculation about an a la carte
Europe', in which member states can dissociate themselves from policies they
dislike.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Rouble fall threatens to undo everything
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian and foreign experts agree that if what is driving the fall of the
rouble - which dropped a further 6 per cent yesterday - is not corrected,
the government's economic achievements over the first eight months of this
year will be set at nought.
In danger, now, is the future of its economic strategy, of further
assistance from the international financial institutions, and even of the
government, they say.
However, some dealers and bankers view it differently. One said the rouble's
fall - by more than 16 per cent this month alone - was merely the Central
Bank of Russia's way of driving down the rate in order that it can sell hard
currency to help pay the government's debts, especially delayed wage bills.
Another said the central bank periodically adjusted its rate by intervening
or (as now) refusing to intervene until a rate which suits it is reached -
'and then the rouble becomes relatively stable there'.
A third, more worriedly, said: 'It should not get much worse. But if it does
then the situation may run out of control very quickly.'
The less sanguine analysis is that it will get out of control quickly. Mr
Yegor Gaidar, former prime minister, leader of the main liberal party
Russia's Choice and head of the Institute for the Study of Problems of the
Transitional Period, said yesterday that the rouble's fall reflected the
rise in money supply which had been going on since April and was only now
working its way through in higher inflation because of the long time lag
between credit expansion and inflation. The period in the summer when people
had found it more profitable to keep their money in roubles had ended, he
said, and there was now a flight to the dollar driven by fears of rising
inflation.
'This is dangerous . . . .because it carries the risk of long term
stagnation which would not be ended by the time of the (parliamentary)
elections at the end of 1995.'
'The trouble is that everyone tends to move one way in Russia,' said a
western finance official, 'and this increases the speed of a collapse. And
if you get the rouble falling rapidly, few governments can sit back and
watch it without attempting to clamp controls, like suspending trading.'
The immediate effect of the drop will be a feed-through to higher prices for
imported goods, and an upward twist to inflation already said to be rising
this month from last month's low of 4 per cent to a level estimated by the
government at 7 to 8 per cent and by others to be up to 10 per cent.
Mr Gaidar said that a rise this month and the next two is 'inevitable' even
if the government immediately tightened its monetary policy.
The finance ministry, supported by the prime minister, has tried hard to
screw down on spending - though extra credits were issued over the summer
totalling Rbs7,000bn and Mr Gaidar said that monetary growth doubled in the
second quarter of the year compared with the first.
Already, the energy and military lobbies have opened the first rounds of the
fight for more credits and the government's hopes of getting the 1995 budget
through the parliament with the same ease as it did the 1994 budget earlier
this year seem certain to be dashed.
The danger signals come just as the International Monetary Fund is staging
its annual meeting, in Madrid, where it will entertain Russian demands for a
standby credit and other support.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, said in Washington on Monday
that Dollars 8bn-Dollars 10bn could be available from the international
financial institutions plus a further Dollars 6bn later to stabilise the
currency - if the Russian government managed to adopt and stick to a reform
programme more rigorous than their present one.
'The IMF should go to Russia and see what the situation is, see if there is
something to support. Clearly it can't support any old programme,' said one
US official yesterday.
However, the difficulty for the IMF, as for the Group of Seven advanced
industrial nations, is to risk losing the present government if it is not
supported with more aid - or to lose the aid if it is applied to a defective
programme.
Mr Gaidar, in comments yesterday, appeared to believe the Fund should be
cautious. Asked what he would advise the IMF to do, he said: 'I would look
very carefully at the credit expansion in Russia in the past three to four
months. I would look at the planned expenditure of the budget and the real
possibilities of financing that expenditure - that's the fundamental problem
and if it's not solved then support could be ineffective.'
As Mr Yevgeny Yasin, an economic adviser to President Boris Yeltsin, warned
last week, 'the government is standing on a very narrow strip of ground and
can easily be pushed off it'.

The European Parliament yesterday rejected by an overwhelming majority the

In spite of the strong endorsement of a carefully drafted resolution,

be inconceivable to exclude' member states ready and able to pursue
integration with 'equal rights and duties'.
But it warned that 'if a small minority of member states attempted to block
all progress' in 1996, 'ways would have to be found of allowing member
states which want to pursue their efforts to achieve European integration to
still do so'.
The Maastricht treaty review conference in 1996, which will decide on the
extent to which the Union must tighten its links in order to bring in new
east and central European states, will still see governments in the driving
seat.
But the Strasbourg parliament, with new powers under Maastricht, won the
right to take part in the 1996 review by threatening this spring to block
the current enlargement process, designed to bring the Nordic countries and
Austria into the EU next year. The parliament is increasingly showing that
it is willing to use its veto and vetting powers to make its views heard.
The resolution, alluding to recent British government comments about a
multi-speed Union, also denounced the British and Danish opt-outs from the
Maastricht treaty as the root of 'dangerous speculation about an a la carte
Europe', in which member states can dissociate themselves from policies they
dislike. All but two of the 18 UK Conservative MEPs remaining in Strasbourg
abstained, regarding the debate as 'premature', as Tory Euro-MP Brendan
Donnelly put it.
But amid the welter of multilingual mixed metaphors about ships and convoys,
hares and tortoises, concentric circles, menus and 'variable geometry',
disgust at the ability of one state to use a veto to delay decisions
outweighed distaste at an elitist 'hard-core'.
The former Belgian minister and liberal MEP, Mr Willy de Clercq, said that
'if one speed means standing still that cannot be'. Former French Socialist
prime minister Michel Rocard dismissed much of the debate as hypocrisy,
pointing out that after Maastricht there is already a two-speed Europe, but
'the mistake is to think this is permanent'.
Ms Elisabeth Guigou, the former French Socialist minister for Europe, said
an a la carte solution would be divisive, 'but we cannot allow one country
or group of countries to block progress.' Mr Gunter Rinsche, a German
Christian Democrat leader, defending his party's floating of a 'hard-core'
built round the Franco-German axis, argued that the Union should use
flexible formulas as the cement constructing integration.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Russia seeks overhaul of diamond pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The leading official in Russia's diamond industry said that his country's
present agreement with South African diamond group, De Beers, was 'far from
satisfactory' and would have to be radically changed.
But Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, chairman of the committee on precious metals and
stones, emphasised that Russia wanted to work with De Beers, dispelling
fears that the relationship between the group that controls more than 80 per
cent of world rough (uncut) diamond sales and one of the largest producers
was near to collapse.
Mr Bychkov wants the present agreement, which runs until the end of next
year, to be substantially modified, and wants to sign an agreement after
1995 'on a completely new basis'.
Earlier this month, De Beers seemed to believe that the relationship was in
danger and that the prospect of excluding Russia from the monopoly because
of allegedly unsanctioned sales of diamonds would have to be considered.
Mr Bychkov also resolutely denied the estimations, tabled by De Beers in
talks between the two sides this year, that 'leakages' of diamonds from
Russia outside of the agreement had totalled Dollars 500m (Pounds 316.4m)
this year. Mr Bychkov said that Russia had sold only Dollars 120m worth of
diamonds independently from De Beers - and that had been covered by
agreements with the company.
'Everything else sold is just small change. We know who is dealing illegally
in diamonds here and what they are selling is very little,' he said.
While Mr Bychkov would give few details of the negotiations between the two
partners, he indicated that he wanted Russia's quota within De Beers'
Central Selling Organisation (CSO) to be raised from its present 26 per cent
of total CSO sales because of growing production in Russia,
'We are producing more from Yakutia (the diamond producing region) than last
year and next year we expect to produce more than this. So we want our quota
to be raised,' Mr Bychkov said.
A rise in Russia's quota would mean a fall in that of the other member
countries - which include South Africa, Botswana and Australia.
Another area of negotiation and dispute between the two sides concerns the
joint ventures which Russia has formed with companies, especially from
Belgium and Israel, to send diamonds abroad for polishing. De Beers
considers that these consignments are exports - while Russia believes that,
since the diamonds remain the property of Russia and are returned to it,
they cannot be counted as exports.
The De Beers agreement allows Russia to sell freely only 5 per cent of the
diamonds it produces, while the remainder goes to the CSO. Mr Bychkov said
that 'the present agreement must be improved, and a future agreement made
mutually advantageous, which it is not at present'.

Almazy Rossii-Sakha, Russia's biggest diamond mining company, is seeking
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) to invest in two new diamond mines over the next
10 years, Mr Vladimir Piskunov, company vice-president, said in London
yesterday. The deposits are in the Prilensk and Daldyino-Alakitsk regions,
writes Kenneth Gooding, Mining Correspondent. He said that the company's new
Jubilee (or Ubilinnaya) diamond mine, which cost about Dollars 500m, would
be in production next year. Mr Piskunov said the mine needed only Dollars
10m more. Western analysts pointed out that this implied the start-up would
be at least three years behind the original schedule.

<TEXT>
The ESB, Ireland's state electricity company, plans to shed 2,900 jobs,
nearly one third of its workforce, and has given trade unions until the end
of next month to agree a five-year rationalisation programme. The programme,
intended to cut costs by IPounds 100m, was drawn up after a review of the
ESB by consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. The bulk of the jobs, 1,475, are to go
in power generation, with another 1,000 jobs to be lost in customer services
and 400 in head office administration. McKinsey concluded that the ESB was
efficient in the areas of fuel purchase and fund management but it did not
match international standards of efficiency in other areas. The ESB trade
unions said they would seek fewer redundancies. They opposed McKinsey's
approach of comparing the ESB with larger more efficient North American
utilities. The ESB shake-up is the latest in a series of crises at Irish
state-owned companies.

Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said yesterday that Luxembourg's
days as a tax-free haven were numbered as pressure grew within the European
Union to bring the Grand Duchy's tax regime in line with other countries. An
estimated DM300bn (Pounds 123bn) of German funds have been switched to
Luxembourg in recent years following tax changes in Germany. 'Free movement
of capital only makes sense if you don't have any tax oases,' he said. The
German finance minister has talked to the Swiss and the Austrians, who also
manage exiled German funds, and said the Luxembourg government was ready to
reach a 'constructive solution'. Mr Waigel also underlined his determination
to make the D-Mark part of a common European currency but suggested the
process could be made easier if the future currency had a different name.
'We are bringing the D-Mark into a European currency and we could perhaps
refer to it as the Euro-Mark, or refer to the Dutch currency as the
Euro-Guilder. Such psychological measures should be thinkable to allay
peoples' fears,' he said. 'We cannot go on talking about getting rid of the
D-Mark.'

France's Bull group has settled the arson case brought by its insurers in an
Illinois court this week, and has received a 'substantial' but undisclosed
payment from the insurance companies. New Jersey-based Allendale Mutual
Insurance Company and its London-based affiliate, Factory Mutual
International agreed to withdraw their claim that Bull had deliberately
burned a Zenith Data Systems warehouse at Seclin, France, in 1991, resulting
in the loss of large computer inventories. In return, Bull has withdrawn its
claim that Allendale and FMI acted in bad faith to avoid paying Bull's
insurance claim. The two sides are still in dispute over the amount of
insurance coverage Bull had at the time of the fire. That dispute will be
decided in Illinois in early January. The settlement of the arson charges
ends nearly three years of wrangling, and came two days before the presiding
judge would have ended arguments in the case.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italian trade union leaders yesterday called for countrywide protests in the
run-up to a general strike on October 14 against proposals in the 1995
budget. The date for the four-hour stoppage was confirmed yesterday in the
wake of Tuesday night's breakdown in talks between the government of Mr
Silvio Berlusconi and the unions over pension reform and spending cuts. Mr
Berlusconi, presenting the 1995 budget at a press conference yesterday,
described the general strike as 'an error' and insisted the budget had
sought to spread the burden of sacrifices fairly. However, Mr Berlusconi's
coalition partners, the populist Northern League, struck a discordant note
on pensions. A League statement dissociated itself from one of the most
controversial aspects of the government's pension reform - the reduction in
benefits for those retiring before the normal pensionable age, even though
they made the requisite contributions.
Mr Berlusconi also announced a new privatisation timetable yesterday. He
said Ilva, the state steel concern already partly privatised, and the
remains of SME, the foodstuffs group, would be sold off this year. By the
spring, the rest of INA, the insurance concern, would be sold. Stet, the
telecoms group, and Enel, the electricity authority, would be sold soon
after in the summer.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Tragedy leaves Swedes in shock

<TEXT>
News of the Estonia ferry disaster yesterday instilled a deep sense of shock
across Sweden, a country unaccustomed to such a jolting catastrophe.
'Nothing like this has ever happened to us before,' said a journalist on a
leading newspaper. 'We have not been involved in the great wars of this
century, we have not suffered from natural disasters. We have not even lost
one of our soldiers in the Bosnian peacekeeping operation. It will take a
long time for the country to get over this.'
Both Mr Carl Bildt, the outgoing prime minister and his successor, Mr Ingvar
Carlsson, described the ferry sinking, as 'the greatest catastrophe in
Sweden's modern history.' Over 500 of the victims, numbering at least 800,
were Swedish. The dismay in Sweden has eclipsed even the shock of the
assassination of prime minister Olof Palme in 1986.
Sweden, often joked about for its northern reserve and tranquillity, is more
used to mobilising its aid agencies to help the victims of disaster in
faraway places than to coping with trauma at home. Yesterday, crisis groups
were set up in many cities and towns to offer support and counselling for
bereaved families.
The sheer scale of the fatalities had a profound impact on a nation of 8.5m
people. The shock was heightened by the popularity of Baltic cruises among
ordinary Swedes, thousands of whom take short excursion trips on similar
ferries to Finland, St Petersburg and the newly independent Baltic states.
The victims yesterday included a group of 53 pensioners from the eastern
city of Norrkoping, 44 retired trade unionists from the western town of
Borlange, 70 office workers from the Stockholm county police and 20 pupils
from a bible school in the central city of Jonjoping.
Mr Bildt, like many Stockholmers, recalled he had himself sailed on the
Estonia and said he knew several people aboard the ship when it sank.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Safety rules that failed the Estonia: It was a modern ship,
well maintained and partly Swedish owned. But are even the best ro-ro
ferries vulnerable?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If regulation alone could prevent ferries sinking, then the Estonia would
never have gone down in the icy waters of the Baltic.
Shipping safety has engaged the attention of dozens of committees sitting
for thousands of hours in recent years and the conventions which roll out of
the London headquarters of the International Maritime Organisation are
constantly being revised and upgraded.
All this earnest activity has still not prevented heavily laden ferries
sinking in the coastal waters of the Philippines, Indonesia and Bangladesh
in recent years with enormous loss of life. The regulations are
international in their scope but the losses have been their most severe in
the developing world.
It took the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise with the loss of 193
lives in March 1987 to show that standards needed to be raised even in the
traditional shipping nations.
An official inquiry concluded that the British ferry, owned by P &amp; O, sank
because a crewman left the bow doors open. The ship's officers failed to
notice because of a culture of 'sloppiness' throughout the P &amp; O subsidiary
that operated the ship.
The inquiry recommended a series of safety improvements, such as higher
vehicle decks, closed circuit TV supervision of bow and stern doors, better
emergency lighting, loading and stability checks, and passenger and vehicle
listing.
The loss of the Herald of Free Enterprise prompted the British government to
push for a stricter interpretation of the international safety rules than
most countries were prepared to accept.
The result has been that the UK and nine other European nations, including
Sweden, have imposed tougher regulations on the stability of ferries and
have insisted on their more rapid application to existing, as well as to
new, vessels. These rules come into effect in two days' time.
These stability rules are unlikely to have had any impact on the Estonia,
however, which was regarded as a well found vessel designed to operate in
the frequently ice-bound Baltic. Investigators will undoubtedly be looking
closely at how the crew carried out their duties.
And for all the wealth of safety legislation there has been little progress
in overcoming the biggest single safety problem on roll-on roll-off ferries
 -the open vehicle decks running from one end of the ship to the other,
usually with doors at one or both ends.
One survivor of yesterday's sinking suggested that one of the forward
loading ramps of the Estonia had not shut properly while another report
suggested that the loading door seals were faulty.
Shipowners maintain that ro-ro ferries are viable only if large numbers of
vehicles can be loaded and unloaded quickly, allowing rapid turnround times
and frequent sailings.
This means that neither space nor time is wasted, but comparatively small
quantities of water entering the vehicle decks can cause the ship to develop
a heavy list, and capsize.
This problem, called the free surface effect, was what sank the Herald. It
can be prevented, but only by inserting vertical bulkheads across the
vehicle deck, which would slow loading.
For all the good intentions transformed into international safety
agreements, the IMO and governments around the world have come to realise
that effective enforcement of the rules is still woefully lacking.
The IMO is shifting its attention to ensuring that its many maritime
agreements are enforced and recently reached agreement to give port
authorities greater powers to inspect visiting shipping. Traditionally the
country under whose flag a ship sails is responsible for ensuring that the
vessel is well built and well maintained. But the failure of many 'flags of
convenience' to take these duties seriously has seen power shift to the
authorities in the port where the ship docks.
The west European countries work together to enforce shipping standards
through their port organisations while similar regional groupings of 'port
states' are being put together in other parts of the world.
Estonia, newly independent after the break-up of the Soviet Union, has yet
to establish a track-record in the supervision of the ships which sail under
its flag. But the Swedish involvement in the ship's ownership is seen as a
guarantee of quality.
It will be some time before the official enquiries which are just beginning
provide an explanation for the loss of the Estonia. But the loss of a
relatively modern vessel in rough but not unusual seas raises worrying
questions about the effectiveness of the regulations and their enforcement.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Nato rallies to call of 'expand or die': The alliance
meeting in Seville today will focus on enlargement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just over a year ago, US Senator Richard Lugar warned Nato there was only
one way it could survive without a communist threat.
It must go 'out of area' - gear up for peacekeeping or peace enforcement
operations outside its own geographical limits - or else go 'out of
business'.
That was last year's slogan. When Nato defence ministers gather today in
Seville, they will hear a new rallying cry, a new formula for extending
Nato's area of operations. It is called enlargement.
Instead of venturing beyond its frontiers, the alliance will be called on to
extend those frontiers - to include Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and
Slovakia (known as the four Visegrad countries) and possibly others.
The calls will be led by Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister who is
the most outspoken advocate of early enlargement, and wants a firm
commitment to incorporate Poland by the year 2000.
Mr William Perry, the US Defence Secretary, is also impatient. US officials
want preparations for expansion to move into high gear this autumn, and they
have started speaking about enlargement with the same missionary zeal that
they brought until recently to the 'out-of-area' slogan.
They are suggesting that Nato will have no reason to exist, or to expect US
support, unless it expands soon. In the pithy language favoured by Senator
Lugar, the new US message is something like 'expand or die'.
In practice, however, the 'out of area' slogan has not proved to be a
panacea for Nato, and enlargement is also likely to spark some acrimonious
debate in Seville.
Nato's most spectacular 'out of area' operation - policing the skies over
Bosnia - is still proving to be a trying experience for the alliance.
The problem is that by most legal interpretations, Nato can only go 'out of
area' under a mandate from another organisation, such as the UN or the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.
And Nato's US commanders have barely concealed their fury over the cautious
attitudes of the British and French generals who command the UN ground
forces in Bosnia. Only after some very blunt soldier-to-soldier exchanges
over the past two weeks have tempers cooled. One of the first fruits of this
frank dialogue over tactics in Bosnia was last Thursday's air strike against
a Bosnian Serb tank.
A second problem with 'out-of-area' operations, highlighted in a study by
left-wing defence analysts in Washington, London and Berlin, is the contrast
in the peacekeeping doctrines used by European and US armies. While British
generals distinguish clearly between keeping peace by consensus and imposing
peace by force, the US military tends to blur the two.
If 'out-of-area' operations have been contentious, the emphasis on
enlargement promises to be even more so. There are sharply contrasting views
on the issue among German and US officials, and also within the Nato
bureaucracy.
In Washington, Bonn and other Nato capitals, the enthusiasm of some
politicians for expansion is tempered by the caution of military officers,
who are all too aware of the huge outlay of equipment and money that would
be needed. Generals, more than politicians, remember that embracing new Nato
members is more than a political gesture: it is a commitment to treat an
'attack on one as an attack on all'.
The thorniest issue ministers will face is how far Nato should go in defying
Russia, which in June became the 20th country to join Partnership for Peace,
the Nato-inspired military co-operation programme.
Moscow has made plain that it would view Nato's expansion to include the
Visegrad countries - particularly Poland - as an unfriendly act, unless the
alliance also embraced Russia, something which would transform Nato's
character.
There are senior US, German, and British officials who see Moscow's
hostility as a reason for treading carefully on enlargement. Supporters of
this view use two arguments.
One is that Nato should take seriously - as a basis for discussion - Russian
proposals for a grand partnership between a Russian-dominated Commonwealth
of Independent States and Nato.
This view may be anathema to cold warriors but it has its backers,
especially in the German foreign ministry.
Another argument for caution is that by incorporating the Visegrad countries
too quickly and slamming the door, Nato will appear to abandon both Ukraine
and the Baltic states to Russian influence.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, said yesterday Russian
membership of Nato was 'not a serious proposition'. He stressed Britain's
commitment to the sovereignty of Ukraine, calling it a 'country whose
independence plays a crucial part in the new geography of Europe'. he
A wild card in the debate is Turkey. Ankara fears that Moscow's consent to
Nato enlargement in northern Europe might be 'bought' with concessions to
Russian influence on its borders.
So Turkey, while supporting the idea of embracing the Visegrad four, is also
suggesting that Romania, Bulgaria and Albania be admitted. But most of the
ministers meeting in Seville would need to drink plenty of sangria before
they viewed that idea with any relish.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Economic Watch: Swiss consumer prices stable
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Switzerland's September consumer price index was unchanged after a 0.4 per
cent gain in August, giving an annual inflation rate of 0.6 per cent, the
Federal Statistics Office said. The rise in year-on-year inflation reflected
the so-called basis effect, namely that prices were stable in September this
year while they fell by a month-on-month 0.1 per cent in September last
year. Compared with September 1993, Swiss-made goods rose by 1.0 per cent in
price this month, while imported products fell by 0.5 per cent. Prices for
food, drink and tobacco products increased 0.4 per cent in September from
August, while rents and energy prices declined 0.1 per cent. Transport and
telecommunications prices, meanwhile, also fell 0.1 per cent.
Belgian September year-to-year inflation edged up to 2.46 per cent from 2.44
per cent in August, provisional official figures showed.
Finland's preliminary current account was in balance in August after a
revised FM2.9bn (Pounds 360m) surplus in July, according to figures released
by the Bank of Finland. July's surplus was revised down from a FM3bn surplus
reported last month.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Lost symbol of economic rebirth in Baltics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Estonia was until yesterday's disaster a powerful symbol of blossoming
trade and political ties between the Nordic countries and the newly
independent Baltic states.
Sweden and Finland especially have built up economic and political links
with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania since the three became independent in
1991. They have strongly supported the three in their efforts to remove
Russian troops from their countries and have been the quickest among western
countries to establish joint ventures and other trade connections.
Estline, the company which operated the Estonia, is jointly-owned by the
Swedish shipping company Nordstrom &amp; Thulin and the state-owned Estonian
Shipping Company. It was set up with a 10-year monopoly concession on the
Stockholm-Tallinn route in 1990 as the two sides anticipated a rapid
expansion of links when Moscow's hold over Estonia loosened.
Although passenger and freight demand was initially disappointing, Estline
began to take off two years ago and bought the Estonia early last year as
its prestigious flagship, replacing a smaller ferry. The cost of Dollars 42m
(Pounds 26.5m) was largely financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development.
The ship's role as a high-profile symbol of Estonia's emerging economy was
reflected in its name and its additional function as a training centre for
the Estonian hotel and restaurant industry.
The growing passenger and freight tonnage using the Estonia was in line with
the fast-growing trade between Sweden and Estonia. Estline passenger numbers
tripled from 91,700 in 1990 to 280,000 last year, prompting the company to
charter a second ship to double its capacity.
At the same time, Swedish exports to Estonia jumped from SKr92m (Pounds
7.7m) in 1991 to SKr850m in the first half of this year alone, while imports
from Estonia reached SKr500m in the first six months of this year, compared
with just SKr60m in all of 1991.
Economic ties between Estonia and Finland have grown even faster, with
Finnish exports to Estonia expected to approach FM3bn (Pounds 375m) this
year, compared with less than FM400m in 1991. At least three Estonian and
two Finnish shipping companies now operate regular services on the 75-mile
Helsinki-Tallinn route.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Pensions ruling will put costs on employers: Part-time
workers could get benefit rights for first time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European employers face costs of billions of pounds after part-time workers
 -mostly women - won a significant victory in the European Court of Justice
yesterday, with a ruling that could give many of them pension rights for the
first time.
Despite this additional expense, employers' groups in the UK expressed
relief at other elements of the judgment which will reduce future pension
costs. This is because employers who have typically allowed women more
generous benefits through retirement at 60 may now cut these and force women
to work until they are 65, the same as men.
The landmark rulings, part of a series of judgments in Strasbourg, came
after years of uncertainty about how employers should equalise pension
rights for men and women.
The court ruled that barring part-time workers from pension scheme
membership could amount to indirect discrimination against women, and that
it must be stopped. Moreover, it said employers should have realised this in
1976 following a previous ruling by the same court.
Because that decision was ignored, part-timers should have the right to
claim benefits for past service dating back nearly 20 years, the court said.
The UK government's actuary has calculated that, at worst, yesterday's
ruling on part-time workers could cost British industry Pounds 7bn. In the
Netherlands, where over 30 per cent of the workforce is part-time, employers
face a bill of up to Fl 1bn (Pounds 366m).
The six separate cases decided yesterday were brought by individuals and
pension fund trustees seeking clarification of the court's key Barber v GRE
ruling in May 1990. This concluded that employers could not offer members of
one sex better benefits than the other. But it has been unclear since then
just how equality should be applied.
The effect of the court's rulings will be to encourage employers to reduce
pension rights for women, said Mr John Cunliffe, partner at McKenna and Co,
one of the UK law firms involved in the case. 'Barber is a man's judgment,'
he said.
Pension consultants said the ruling may not impose as harsh a burden as
employers' groups fear. Employers who can provide 'objective justification'
for barring part-timers from joining their pension schemes will not be
required to do so for either future or past service.
Also, the court ruled, pension scheme members claiming retrospective
membership in schemes requiring employee contributions will have to pay all
past contributions to receive benefits.
Attacking the decision on part-time employment, Mr Tim Melville-Ross,
director-general of the UK Institute of Directors, said: 'The judgment will
cost British industry billions of pounds but will have little effect in
other member states which do not have the great advantages of Britain's
funded company pensions.'
He added: 'Many companies have already voluntarily extended their pension
schemes to part-time workers. This should be encouraged but not imposed.'

FT  29 SEP 94 / IMF sees higher growth in industrial nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Forecasts for growth in the industrialised world were yesterday revised
upwards for the first time this decade by the International Monetary Fund,
which declared that the recession and the slow growth of the early 1990s
were over.
Describing the upwards revisions as a 'happy event', Mr Michael Mussa,
director of the IMF's research department, told a news conference that the
prospects for the world economy were brighter than at any point in the past
three to four years.
The IMF expects the economies of the industrialised nations will grow by 2.7
per cent this year and next compared with its previous forecasts, published
five months ago, of 2.4 per cent for 1994 and 2.6 per cent for 1995.
According to its latest World Economic Outlook, published last night ahead
of the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank, global output is
expected to expand by 3.1 per cent this year and 3.6 per cent in 1995, or
close to the trend rate of growth of the past two decades.
After revising upwards its estimate of last year's world trade growth to 4
per cent from 2.4 per cent, the IMF expects continued strong expansion in
the years ahead. It expects world trade will grow by about 7 per cent this
year and just under 6 per cent in 1995 and therefore at a faster rate than
the average 5 per cent annual growth of the past 20 years.
Mr Mussa said the recovery in the industrial world was accompanied by
encouraging signs of growth in Africa and a continued strong performance in
Asia and some Latin American countries.
Growth in the developing countries as a group is expected to be twice as
strong as in the industrial countries this year and next. Although problems
exist, notably in the former Soviet countries, activity is beginning to pick
up in central and eastern Europe while recovery in the Middle East is
expected in 1995.
Mr Mussa said unemployment now seemed to have passed its peak in continental
Europe and was 'on the downslope' some months earlier than expected in
April.
Mr Mussa also praised this month's increase in UK bank base rates to 5.75
per cent from 5.25 per cent as a 'highly desirable initial step to contain
future growth of inflationary pressure'.
He said Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was right to give priority to
controlling public expenditure before considering tax cuts.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Tube strike looms as rail deal looks set to be accepted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The deal hammered out to settle the 15-week rail dispute is expected to win
overwhelming endorsement from the signal workers over the next two days.
But in a separate dispute members of the RMT transport union are still
threatening to bring London Underground to a halt for 24 hours tomorrow.
The package accepted by the union executive and negotiated with Railtrack,
the state-owned company that operates the network's infrastructure, is being
put to a telephone poll of union members today and tomorrow. The result is
expected tomorrow evening. The main points of the deal are:
an average increase in signalworkers' total earnings, including overtime and
supplements, of 8 per cent this year;
a 20 per cent average increase in basic rates;
a one-off lump sum payment averaging Pounds 480;
a further 2.5 per cent annual pay rise this year backdated to April.
The first three elements of the deal are linked to future productivity
improvements. They do not include any payments for past efficiencies, the
demand made by the union that led to the dispute.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said yesterday the deal was an
'excellent' one for the signal workers as well as being a 'sound investment
for Railtrack and the railway industry generally. It is a victory for the
steadfastness of the signal workers'.
Mr Robert Horton, Railtrack chairman, said he bitterly regretted it had
taken 'many weeks of needless strikes' before the deal had been achieved.
'At last we have reached an agreement to modernise the working practices in
the railway industry,' he said.
He questioned Mr Knapp's assertion that the signal workers would have an 8
per cent average increase in earnings. He claimed the actual figure was 3.4
per cent.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, also welcomed the agreement. He
said it was 'fully consistent with the government's approach to public
sector pay' as well as being self-financing and containable within
Railtrack's overall pay bill of just over Pounds 800m a year.
But as both sides were congratulating themselves on solving one transport
dispute, a new one loomed as the RMT executive was meeting yesterday evening
to discuss tomorrow's industrial action on the Underground.
The union is demanding a rise of at least 4 per cent for its Underground
members after they rejected a 2.5 per cent offer in a ballot. The other five
unions whose members work on the Underground have accepted the 2.5 per cent
offer.
Mr Knapp said no further talks were planned to try to resolve the dispute
and tomorrow's strike was likely to go ahead. However, London Underground
said it expected formal notification today from RMT that it was ready to
delay the strike to allow time to reach an accord.

FT  29 SEP 94 / Bow doors leak reported after 800 die in Baltic ferry
sinking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Officials from Sweden, Finland and Estonia yesterday began investigating the
cause of Europe's worst maritime disaster since the second world war amid
reports that water flooding in through the bow doors caused the ferry
Estonia to capsize.
More than 800 lives were lost when the 21,794 tonne ferry, sailing from the
Estonian capital Tallinn to Stockholm, sank within minutes early yesterday
morning in the Baltic Sea 40km south west of the Finnish island of Uto.
There were 964 passengers and crew aboard, and a full cargo of cars and
heavy trucks.
The sinking of the Estonia is expected to lead to renewed calls for
improvements to ferry safety despite recent international efforts to raise
standards. Roll-on roll-off ferries present particular problems because of
their large open car and truck decks. These lack dividing bulkheads, which
give extra protection against capsizing to other vessels.
The world's shipping nations agreed on tougher rules governing the stability
of ships in 1990, although Britain, Sweden and eight other European nations
have agreed higher standards which take effect on October 1.
Last night, Mr Raimo Tiilikainen, the leader of the Finnish rescue
operation, said teams of helicopters and ships had rescued 141 people and
recovered 42 bodies. But he said 781 people were missing and officials said
there was little hope of finding anyone alive in the cold Baltic waters.
Estline, the joint Swedish-Estonian operator of the ship, said it could not
explain the sudden capsize and sinking. It said the last radio message from
the bridge reported the engines had failed and the ship was listing badly.
However, a member of the crew, Mr Henrik Sillaste, said he saw water burst
into the car deck past the bow loading ramp shortly before the vessel
foundered. 'On the TV monitor in the machine room, we could see water
rushing in on the car deck,' he told reporters.
Two Swedish maritime inspectors who saw the vessel in Tallinn on Tuesday
said the rubber seals around the bow doors were partly damaged, but not to a
dangerous degree. They were quoted as saying: 'We saw ageing and worn-out
lashings and seals which had been damaged. But none of the faults was so big
it could have caused the disaster.'
The 14-year old German built vessel was regarded as being well designed to
deal with tough conditions in the Baltic Sea.
The speculation that the disaster was caused by water coming in through the
bow doors raised alarming comparisons with the sinking of the Herald of Free
Enterprise outside the Belgian port of Zeebrugge in 1987. The Herald
capsized with the loss of 189 lives after the bow doors had not been closed
properly.
Some 500 of the Estonia's missing and dead were Swedes and most of the rest
were Estonians. Both countries declared a national state of mourning.
The Estonia began sailing between Stockholm and Tallinn in February 1993 for
Estline, a company jointly owned by the state-owned Estonian Shipping
Company and Sweden's Nordstrom &amp; Thulin. It was reported to have been
insured for Pounds 38m, about half of this through the London marine market.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures recover after
early setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee futures prices suffered a sharp setback in London and New York
yesterday following rainfall that brought light relief to drought-hit coffee
plantations in Brazil.
But prices recovered later in the day as prospects of further dry, warm
weather kept the market in fairly bullish mood about the prospects of a
substantial shortfall in next year's crop.
The second position robusta contract in London was down Dollars 128 a tonne
at one stage, following an overnight fall in New York. But it rallied to
close only Dollars 58 lower at Dollars 4,025.
In New York, the December arabica contract was 3.65 cents lower at 222.95
cents a pound in afternoon trading after trading 7 cents lower.
One trader said speculators had sold long positions after prices had failed
at several attempts to break decisively into new high ground.
'There's been a little clear-out, led by New York, but the background hasn't
changed,' he said.
The sharp recovery in prices this year to near nine-year highs on the back
of two severe frosts in Brazil in June and July has led to expectations that
producers will increase output.
At a meeting of the International Coffee Organisation in London yesterday,
Mr Guy-Alain Gauze, commodities minister for Ivory Coast, said his country
planned to raise output from about 147,000 tonnes to 250,000 tonnes in the
next two to three years.
A new five-year international coffee agreement, due to come into effect on
Saturday, is designed to encourage a greater flow of information on coffee
trade between producer and consumer countries. However, it is not yet clear
whether enough countries have ratified for it to enter into force
automatically.

FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: India to relaunch international
sale of telecom equity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India is preparing to revive the postponed international equity offering by
VSNL, its international telecommunications monopoly, following the recent
successful issue by Pakistan Telecom which attracted Dollars 900m from
international investors.
In meetings in Bombay this week, VSNL - which is 85 per cent state-owned -
provisionally agreed for the issue to be relaunched by the winners of the
original mandate, Kleinwort Benson and Salomon Brothers, and Jardine
Fleming, whose handling of the Pakistan Telecom sale has been widely
praised.
The bankers have indicated that they are ready to underwrite VSNL's offer of
17.5m shares at between Rs1,100 (Dollars 35) and Rs1,200 a share. This
figure is well below the price of Rs1,400 which the government saw as a
minimum when it launched the offer last May.
It seems that Indian officials have reluctantly accepted that investors
regarded the original offer as overpriced, and they now seem ready to agree
to the lower figure.
The original issue failed partly because of the ambitious pricing but also
because investor sentiment turned against emerging markets following the
rise in interest rates in the US.
Investment bankers now see a window of opportunity but warn that VSNL will
have to move quickly because it was essentially relaunching a stale deal.
'It would be better to go sooner rather than later because the demand might
not be there in a couple of months,' said one banker.
At the lower price, the government will receive about Dollars 650m from the
offering - significantly less than the Dollars 1bn it had hoped to raise in
May. If investor demand is sufficiently buoyant, a 'green shoe' option of an
additional 2.5m shares will be exercised.
Bankers hope the Indian cabinet will approve the issue in the next few days.
The board of VSNL is expected to rubber-stamp the deal at a meeting
tomorrow.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Rulings today on sex equality in pensions: A look at what
will be the definitive word from the European Court of Justice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice takes the unprecedented step today of ruling
simultaneously on six cases, each involving sex equality in pensions
schemes.
The rulings are expected to provide the definitive word on how employers and
scheme trustees are expected to provide equal pensions for men and women -
an issue which has been before the court since the end of the 1980s.
In May 1990 it ruled that because pension benefits are in effect a form of
deferred pay, the European employers' tradition of offering more generous
pension terms to women violated sex equality laws.
But having made its ruling, the court found it was flooded with cases asking
how the ruling is to be applied.
Last October, it settled what was probably the most contentious of those
questions before it, ruling that no employer could retrospectively be
required to provide equal pensions for men and women for periods of
employment before May 1990.
But numerous issues remain outstanding and they are not simply academic.
Billions of pounds of expenditure by employers or billions of pounds of
benefits to scheme members throughout Europe hang in the balance.
One of the cases, Vroege v NCV Institut, asks the court whether employers
who do not allow part-timers, mostly women, to obtain pension benefits are
discriminating on the basis of sex. If so, actuaries at UK-based consultants
R Watson calculate that part-timers could claim retrospective benefits as
far back as 1976, which would cost UK employers alone some Pounds 10bn.
Employers in other European states, notably the Netherlands, Ireland,
Germany and Belgium could face similar bills. Particularly hard hit will be
employers who did not require their employees to contribute any portion of
their pay to the pension scheme. While women in contributory schemes may be
deterred from claiming retrospective benefits if they have to make
retrospective contributions, women in non-contributory schemes are unlikely
to have such inhibitions.
However, other pension experts note that the court has taken a tough stand
on retrospective rights and consistently agreed that employers did not need
to provide them before May 1990.
Moreover, the court is expected to confirm an opinion last year of its
Advocate General that although employers may equalise pension benefits by
worsening conditions for women, they will have to improve what they offer
men for employment service between May 1990 and whatever date the scheme
instituted equal pension rights.
The outcome of the ruling could have significant implications for the
European insurance industry which sells annuities to those on the brink of
retirement.
The lead case before the court is that of Coloroll, a UK home furnishings
and fabrics company which became insolvent in 1989, leaving independent
trustees in charge of maintaining numerous employee pension schemes.
Among the questions the court must resolve is whether it is the trustees of
the scheme or the employer itself which has the obligation to equalise
benefits.
For an insolvent employer such as Coloroll, improving benefits for men means
penalising female members of a scheme.
The question is particularly thorny for UK, Irish and Dutch pension schemes.
In the UK, hundreds of employers had become insolvent in the recession of
the early 1990s and their pension schemes have been unable to be wound up
until this issue is resolved.
Another issue arising from the Coloroll case is whether so-called defined
contribution schemes - those in which final pension benefits are based on
the investment returns of contributions - require employers to make equal
contributions for men and women. Because women typically live longer than
men, a woman will need a larger lump sum to purchase an annuity from an
insurance company which will provide income until she dies.
For the UK, the judgment will allow hundreds of pension schemes of insolvent
employers such as Coloroll to be formally wound up. Legal and General, the
UK life insurer, estimates that these schemes hold assets of Pounds 800m to
Pounds 900m which are likely to be invested in so-called deferred annuities
to pay pensions for thousands of workers.
Other questions before the court are whether employers can 'red circle'
existing female scheme members to protect their benefits, whether married
women can be barred from participating in occupational pension schemes and
whether the occupational scheme for Dutch civil servants is a social
security scheme.

FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Sales recovery helps put
Marzotto back in black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marzotto, Italy's largest textile and clothing group, yesterday forecast a
'considerable increase' in full-year profits, after a return to
profitability in the first half of 1994.
The company, which is seeking to increase its exports, has begun to reap the
benefits of a weak lira and gradual economic recovery. It reported group
consolidated net profit of L9.8bn (Dollars 6.3m) for the first six months of
this year, against a loss of L5.2bn in the equivalent period last year.
Operating profits rose 50 per cent to L76.4bn.
Marzotto's thread, yarn and textiles divisions were the main contributors to
the recovery, but the clothing division also lifted profits.
In 1993, Marzotto relied on a strong contribution from Hugo Boss, the German
menswear company it controls, to offset disappointing results from the
Italian market. However, in the first six months of this year, the company
said the Italian clothing activities had also shown a 'slight improvement',
as the decline in domestic consumer demand bottomed out.
Group sales for the first six months of 1994 rose to L986bn, against L959bn
last time.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Debt plan set for controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Commonwealth finance ministers are likely to welcome the UK's initiative on
debt relief when they issue a communique at the end of their meeting in
Malta today.
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, has proposed that
the debt burden of poor countries be relieved by extending the Trinidad
terms, which cover bilateral debt, to debt owed to supra-national financial
institutions such as the International Monetary Fund.
The debt relief programme would be financed by sales of up to 10 per cent of
the IMF's Dollars 40bn of gold reserves.
The proceeds would be reinvested in income-producing assets, and only the
revenue earned from those assets used to finance the scheme. The overall
value of the IMF's reserves would not be altered.
While the support of the Commonwealth countries will be welcomed by the
British government, it is likely to face serious opposition from countries
represented at the IMF meeting in Madrid next week.
Some nations will be cautious about the gold sales, since this will be
perceived as weakening the creditworthiness of the IMF.
Mr Chris Liebenberg, finance minister of South Africa, which is an important
gold producer, said yesterday that a gold sale might also have inflationary
consequences. However, Mr Liebenberg said he was in principle not against
the proposal which needed more investigation.
In his speech to the Malta meeting, Mr Clarke said: 'For some of the poorest
countries even full Trinidad terms tomorrow would not allow them to escape
from an unsustainable debt burden.'
'The IMF has played a key role in helping developing countries in both its
lending and policy advice. But it must be on terms which countries can
afford.'
Mr Clarke's proposals would concentrate on poor, heavily indebted countries
'which have displayed a credible and durable commitment to economic reform,'
the chancellor added.
Mr Clarke proposes that the IMF's enhanced structural adjustment facility
(ESAF) should be extended and lending made on easier terms, by lengthening
the period over which the debt has to be repaid.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Morocco in more state sell-offs

Morocco will sell its stakes in five enterprises with a total turnover of
Dirhams 3.85bn (Dollars 438.4m) this year, the Privatisation Ministry said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Rabat.
The state has 35-99 per cent of the five groups: Banque Marocaine du
Commerce Exterieur (BMCE), the Simef diesel and electric motor maker, the
Sonasid steel mill, the Somas oil company and the Sochepresse publication
distributor.
'We expect to put on the market our stakes in these units before the end of
the year,' the ministry said.
Privatisation Minister Abderrahman Saaidi stated on Monday that the five
units 'will be ceded as soon as the Societe Nationale d'Investissement, the
state investment agency, is privatised.'
The government calls for bids today for its 67 per cent stake in SNI, of
which 16 per cent will be placed on the Casablanca bourse before the end of
October.
Since January, 12 state-owned enterprises have been sold off, officials
said. 'Earnings from privatisation are estimated at Dirhams 900m in the
first nine months of 1994,' the minister added.
BMCE and Sonasid have turnovers of Dirhams 1.969bn and Dirhams 1.603bn
respectively and will be sold off quickly, Casablanca brokers said.
When presenting the budget earlier this year, the Finance Ministry said the
current privatisation programme would bring the state treasury an estimated
Dirhams 3.5bn in 1994.
'We are on the right track. I am optimistic. We hope to reach the target by
the end of the year because our plan is to privatise up to 40 enterprises
before January 1994,' Mr Saaidi declared.
The Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development has made a
Dollars 72.5m-equivalent loan to Morocco towards financing electricity and
irrigation projects under accords signed in Rabat on Monday.
A first loan will finance 23 per cent of the cost of connecting the Spanish
and Moroccan electricity grids. A second will cover 36 per cent of the cost
of completing an irrigation network on the north bank of the Loukkos River
in north Morocco.
Both loans are for 17 years with five-year grace periods and carry 4.5 per
cent interest, officials said.
Since 1975, the fund has contributed finance to 26 projects in Morocco for
the equivalent of Dollars 966m.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Iraq prices increase after food rations are cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BAGHDAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A rush on staple foods is pushing up prices in Baghdad as Iraqis scramble to
cope with a government decision to cut rations by as much as half, Reuter
reports from Baghdad.
The government decided on Sunday to reduce food rations, blaming a poor
harvest and continuing UN trade sanctions, imposed to punish Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
Meagre as they were, the rations staved off starvation and made available
around half a person's basic needs at giveaway prices .
'It is very worrying, particularly for children in poor families,' said Mr
Thomas Ekval, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) representative in
Iraq.
He feared an increase in malnutrition.
Each Iraqi will now receive every month 6 kg (13 lb) of flour instead of
nine, 1.25 kg (2.7 lb) of rice instead of 2.5 kg, 750 grammes (1.6 lbs) of
sugar instead of 1.5 kgs, and 625 grammes (22 ounces) of cooking oil instead
of 750.
The UN hands out its own food rations to about half a million Iraqis it
terms 'destitute persons' and almost twice that number in northern Iraq, now
under Kurdish rebel control.
Mr Ekval said the cut-back would reduce each person's daily intake of
calories and protein by as much as half.
Civil servants and members of the armed forces will receive 2,000 dinars a
month each to meet the shortfall. But the decision had an immediate impact
on prices which reached unprecedented levels yesterday.
Prices almost doubled, making it impossible for salaried people to make up
for the cut in their rations.
The official exchange rate is about 500 dinars to the dollar and the illegal
black market rate is between 600 to 700.
Flour almost doubled to nearly 200 dinars a kg (100 dinars a pound), sugar
from 230 dinars a kg to about 500.
Prices of items left out of the new rationing system, such as razor blades,
matches, shaving cream, salt and toothpaste, also doubled.
The government said the measure was to 'organise economic conditions' and
urged Iraqis to remain 'steadfast' and be patient.
But it seems the decision, the harshest since sanctions came into force more
than four years ago, was taken when it became clear that the embargo would
not be eased or lifted soon as earlier thought.
The official press lambasted the US, which it said was behind efforts to
maintain the stiff regime of sanctions intact, despite Baghdad's
co-operation with the UN on dismantling its big weapons.

It will bear the costs of switching into the Singapore clearing and

levy a maximum commission charge of 0.5 per cent on retail transactions in
shares of Jardine companies.
Shareholders will still find the cost of dealing more expensive than in Hong

<TEXT>
GTE, the US telephone company, has agreed to form a joint venture with GF
Bancomer, Mexico's second largest financial group, and VISA, a large
industrial holding company, to provide telecommunications services in
Mexico.
The three companies have signed a letter of intent to form a company that
plans to apply for a long-distance telephone licence.
The long-distance monopoly enjoyed by Telefonos de Mexico, Mexico's national
carrier, expires in 1997, and Mexico's ministry of transport and
communications is expected to publish the regulations governing the
concession of new long-distance licences in the near future.
GTE joins MCI and Sprint, the two US long-distance carriers, in forming
joint ventures with Mexican partners to provide long-distance services from
1997.
MCI has formed an alliance with GF Banacci, Mexico's largest bank, and
Sprint with Iusacell, Mexico's largest non-Telmex cellular company.

FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: CRA rules out deal over 'three
mines' plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CRA, the Australian mining group in which Britain's RTZ has a 49 per cent
stake, yesterday refused to make concessions over its industrial relations
policy in return for a possible easing of the country's restrictions on
uranium mining.
The issue had arisen at the ruling Australian Labor party's conference in
Hobart, where there has been talk of delegates approving a relaxation of
Australia's long-standing 'three mines' policy. This limits uranium mining
to three mine sites, one of which is now worked out.
If the policy was changed, CRA would be one of the mining companies holding
known uranium reserves which might then be developed.
Some union delegates who hold key votes have sought to link concessions on
uranium mining to CRA's industrial relations policy, which has encouraged
employees to move towards individual staff agreements and away from
centralised awards.
Yesterday CRA said that 'the company's policy of offering the choice to its
award employees, at some locations, to work under staff conditions would not
be affected by current debates about the future of the ALP's 'three mines'
policy'.
CRA considered the two issues be be 'unrelated', and added that 'the use of
uranium policy as a backdoor means of achieving industrial relations
objectives' was 'wrong'.
The stand-off seems to suggest that any revision of the three mines policy
is unlikely, although it is possible that the expansion of uranium mining to
other non CRA-owned sites might still be considered.
Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian steel and resources group, has won a
second licence for the construction of a steel roll-forming plant in China.
Work on the ADollars 12m (USDollars 8.8m) plant will begin in October in the
Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development district.

national health service.
Patients will have to pay for the drug, at FFr142.5 (Pounds 17.10p) per
injection plus the pharmacist's mark-up. This is about the amount paid by
the UK National Health Service.
Sales of Imigran, which promises to become one of Glaxo's biggest sellers,
were Pounds 243m last year.
France has among the lowest drug prices in Europe but the largest per head

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Patients with severe mental illness are being pushed out of London
hospitals, posing a possible risk to the public, the government's Mental
Health Taskforce said yesterday.
A severe shortage of emergency hospital beds in the capital meant that
patients were being discharged early to make way for others even more
chronically ill, it said.
In many cases there was little community support waiting. The taskforce
found that health authorities in many districts did not know how many
mentally ill they were responsible for.
Mr Alan Langlands, NHS chief executive, said: 'We recognise there are very
great pressures on mental health services in London. We are determined to
ensure action to deliver better services for patients.'

<TEXT>
Senior US army officials were yesterday investigating the death of a US
soldier, who was found with gunshot wounds in a northern suburb of
Port-au-Prince. The serviceman was thought to be clearing out a guest house
for exiled parliamentarians returning for today's convening of the National
Assembly.
The first death among American troops came as the US army took a visible
initiative to restore democracy in Haiti yesterday by deploying troops and
armoured vehicles to secure the parliament buildings before the assembly
convened by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide votes on an amnesty law.
Under the agreement between the US and the Haitian military the generals who
usurped power from Mr Aristide will step down on October 15th or when the
amnesty law is passed, whichever comes first.
Swift passage of the legislation could bring an end to the rule of Gen Raoul
Cedras, Haiti's military leader, The amnesty is seen as a critical
precondition for the reconciliation of Aristide supporters and those still
loyal to the military regime. The US was yesterday due to fly back the 10
members of the Chamber of Deputies and the two senators in exile.

Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic retreated last night from demands for a
lifting of the UN arms embargo against his country, saying he would agree to
six months' delay in lifting the ban, writes Michael Littlejohns in New
York. He conceded that even this delay would still be unacceptable to some
members of the five-nation contact group on Bosnia who were worried about
lifting the ban. In an address to the UN General Assembly, Mr Izetbegovic
insisted on his country's right to self-defence. He warned that if his
agreement to a delay in lifting the arms embargo was rejected, he would see
'from our friends that this embargo be lifted unilaterally'.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Rail union leaders on brink of backing peace plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rail union leaders were locked in discussion early this morning on the final
details of a deal to end the four-month dispute which had been hammered out
in seven days of talks at the conciliation service Acas.
After many hours, the executive committee of the RMT transport union had
still not been able to agree on whether to accept a complex productivity
package presented to it by its negotiators.
It was still expected that a deal could be put to the 4,600 Railtrack signal
workers, possibly averting the further 48-hour stoppage planned to start at
midnight tonight.
The package would give the signal workers a substantial increase in their
basic rates of pay, as well as improved benefits. In return, they would have
to accept sweeping new working practices.
If the union's executive backed the deal, it would be put to an immediate
referendum of the signal workers, with the result expected within a few
days.
Railtrack, which operates the network's infrastructure, is believed to have
required that the 48-hour strike should be called off as part of a
settlement.
Last night Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, was called in during
the final hours of the marathon talks along with his 21-strong executive to
approve the negotiated package.
The left-dominated executive, which has remained united during the dispute,
demanded that any deal for the signal workers should meet all their
grievances, including a pay rise for past efficiencies.
Meanwhile, as the signal workers' dispute appeared to be coming to an end,
the RMT executive will turn its attention to the looming conflict on London
Underground. This begins on Friday with a 24-hour stoppage that seems likely
to paralyse a large part of the network. There are no immediate plans for a
resumption of talks over the pay issue.

FT  28 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved higher yesterday, and although trading volume was
low - at under 10,500 contracts - the market's broad undertone was said by
dealers to be much improved.
Ahead of the FOMC meeting in the US, it was mostly a day of waiting on
events, with just 10,453 contracts traded in the December FT-SE 100 future,
down from 16,295 on Monday.
The independent traders mostly had the field to themselves and as a result
the December contract moved around sharply at times.
Dealers said the most encouraging aspect of the session was the solid,
general support shown when the contract touched 3,000 around midday.
Once or twice the premium to the cash market extended to some 20 points,
which put the premium, briefly, in excess of fair value for the first time
in weeks.
December peaked at 3,030.0 just before the afternoon close and ended nine
points up at 3,018. At this level the premium to the cash market is 9 1/2
and the premium to fair value around 18.
Traded option volume was 34,570 lots, down from a previous 39,507. FT-SE
turnover was 10,776 but the Euro FT-SE was barely traded. British Gas was
easily the most active individual stock option with 3,040 contracts. HSBC
managed 1,955 lots and BP 1,705.

FT  28 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: BA pressured
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways shed 7 to 364p following further skirmishing in the
trans-Atlantic air fares war with the news that Northwest Airlines has put
out a special five-month offer, cutting rates by up to 50 per cent.
Northwest is the fourth largest US carrier and its aggressive price move
sparked trading volume of 3.2m BA shares.
Bus operator Go-Ahead was 10 higher at 143p on the back of a buy
recommendation from Panmure Gordon following last week's strong interim
results.
News of yet more share buy- backs by the regional electricity companies
failed to trigger any outperformance by the stocks involved.
Seeboard slipped 3 to 417p in spite of saying it had bought in 750,000
shares at that price, while South Wales acquired 476,000 at prices between
795p and 803p. South West, steady at 749p, said it had bought in 250,000
shares at 752p.
De La Rue, the banknote printing group, was among the FT-SE 100's best
performers, racing up 21 to 927p after buy recommendations from UBS and SG
Warburg Securities.
Ahead of this morning's City meeting with analysts, Williams Holdings
advanced 9 to 337p. Turnover in the shares was 4.4m, but the most active
diversified industrial was Tomkins with 7.3m changing hands and the shares 3
firmer at 209p. The story among dealers was that a major securities house,
possibly NatWest Securities, had finally cleared a big overhang of Tomkins
stock.
British Steel moved up 3 to 165 1/2 p on 8.7m shares dealt, with Goldman
Sachs said to be especially active in the company's stock options, where the
equivalent of 1.2m shares were traded yesterday.
Some smaller engineering stocks had a bad day, Whessoe plummeting 21 to 96p.
Transfer Technology tumbled 14 to 54p following weak half-year results and a
cautious forecast about full-year earnings.
Johnson Matthey fell 13 to 551p in spite of the generally bullish tone of
its US presentation to analysts.
Turnover in Anglo-US conglomerate Hanson rose to 9.9m and the shares gained
3 1/4 at 234p after NatWest Securities recommended the stock and upgraded
profits expectations.
Raising its current year forecast by Pounds 30m to 980m, NatWest held its
estimate for the following year at Pounds 1.34bn. The securities house said
recent weakness in the stock due to technical selling by US investors now
provided a good buying opportunity for the shares.
A poor interim results meeting with analysts left retailing group Sears 1
1/2 lighter at 106p.
However, Hoare Govett continues to favour the stock and analysts at the
broker said: 'We think Sears has managed the process from pure recovery to
growth well. The mid-term earnings growth potential looks encouraging.'
House Of Fraser, which reported interim figures for the first time, put on 4
at 211p.
A strong recommendation from NatWest Securities boosted Body Shop, the
shares advancing 9 to 218p. Advising investors to add to holdings, NatWest
said: 'The restructured management and retail focus is unlocking the
international growth potential.'
A broker's recommendation helped the leading stocks in the food retailing
sector shake off some of the recent gloom that has brought a slide in share
prices as fears of an impending price war took hold.
Credit Lyonnais Laing said the recent retreat in the top stocks in the
sector had been overdone and current levels provided a good buying
opportunity. Argyll Group hardened a penny to 266p and Tesco put on 2 at
230p. J. Sainsbury, down sharply in recent sessions, closed 3 ahead at 394p.
Hazlewood relinquished 5 to 120p as Hoare Govett became the latest
securities house to downgrade profits expectations. Hoare cut its forecast
by Pounds 6m to Pounds 39m for the year to March 1995, citing 'the sharp
increase in potato prices and other competitive pressures in the non-food
division'.

<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil was the pick of an otherwise subdued oil sector, the shares
moving ahead 7 to 387p after sustained buying interest from Goldman Sachs,
the influential US investment bank.
Goldman was said to have pinpointed Enterprise as the cheapest oil stock in
the world, after Saga Petroleum, on the basis of a prospective cash flow
multiple for 1995. The investment bank was also said to have highlighted the
potential for further upgrading of Enterprise's Scott and Nelson oil fields.
Other oil sector analysts said Enterprise shares were at the low end of the
trading range and oversold.

FT  28 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy fall in Sharelink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lingering worries that the recent poor performances and extreme turbulence
in bond and equity markets could have taken a heavy toll on dealing profits
around the trading desks of the City's merchant and clearing banks suddenly
increased after Sharelink, the Birmingham-based stockbroker, warned that it
would make a Pounds 500,000 interim loss.
Sharelink plunged 51 to an all-time low of 187p - compared with a peak 434p
reached in November last year - following the warning of the loss, which it
said was caused by expenditure on development projects. More worrying for
market analysts was news that low UK market volumes throughout the first six
months of the financial year had caused Sharelink to trade at below break
even for the first third of the year. But the company said it expected to
make operating profits of Pounds 200,000 for the first half.
The Sharelink news caused ripples of selling among other stocks involved in
market trading activities. Smith New Court, London's leading marketmaking
firm, retreated 14 to 400p.
Merchant banks were affected by a bearish research note published by NatWest
Securities which took the view that the market is expecting too much in
terms of mergers and acquisition activity.
Mr Stephen Kirk, NatWest Securities' merchant banks analyst, said: 'Future
profits are likely to disappoint and we retain our negative stance on the
sector.' Schroders, which dropped 30 to 1403p, is NatWest's only straight
sell in the sector, although it recommended reducing holdings in Kleinwort
Benson, marginally firmer at 467p, and Hambros, a penny easier at 268p.

FT  28 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares steadier ahead of FOMC rates
decision - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Selling pressure lifted somewhat in the UK stock market yesterday and,
although investors remained cautious ahead of news from the US Federal
Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting, the FT-SE 100 Index managed to
regain the 3,000 mark.
Traders said that technical pressures had slackened, and that marketmakers
had largely succeeded in passing on the lines of stock left with them by the
recent spurt of trading programmes. But two more, albeit smaller, programmes
were reported yesterday and nervousness over the medium term outlook for
equities continued to restrain trading volume.
A firm opening on Wall Street, more than 15 Dow points up in UK hours,
helped London at the close, as did a steadier trend in bond markets.
However, the chances that yesterday's FOMC meeting could have led to a
tightening of Federal Reserve credit policy had continued to overshadow
London trading.
The FT-SE 100-share Index closed 8.7 up at 3,008.5, having touched 3,011.3
earlier. The market's return to relative health was also encouraged by a
better tone in stock index futures, where the December contract on the
Footsie traded briefly during the day at a genuine premium, in contrast with
its recent performance.
The improvement in the market's technical position may help share prices
rally over the immediate term - provided that some investment support for
equities reappears. However, few analysts believe that the clouds have
lifted in any permanent sense.
Market concern that institutional investors are downgrading their equity
holdings was further increased when Mr Barton Biggs, strategist at Morgan
Stanley, the US investment bank, reduced the weighting of European stocks in
his global portfolio by 2 percentage points to 6 per cent.
The two trading programmes spotted yesterday appeared to range across the
full breadth of the stock market, taking in non-Footsie as well as blue chip
issues. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, drawing less benefit from stock index
futures than the FT-SE 100 Index, slipped 3.9 to 3,517.5.
Trading volume improved only slightly, the day's Seaq total of 544.9m shares
comparing with 515.8m in the previous session. Monday's retail business was
worth Pounds 1.22bn, at the low end of daily averages but still a healthy
figure from the point of view of the London based securities industry, and
an indication that the big institutions are not absent from the London
equity market.
Trading statements from leading British companies produced some features but
again failed to encourage the stock market as a whole. In the construction
sector, good figures from Tarmac stimulated confidence in the progress of
recovery in the domestic economy but brought out profit-takers in the
shares.
In a generally uncertain retail sector, the first-half report from Sears was
followed by increased activity in the shares although no lasting improvement
in the share price.
Recoveries in bank shares, in the leading pharmaceuticals and in selected
consumer stocks was ascribed to the clearing away of the debris left behind
by the recent selling bout.
These sectors featured in the series of selling programmes reported since
the middle of last week and are also closely linked to activity in the
Footsie stock index future contract, which has been leading the market
lower.
Marketmakers are believed to have cleared their trading books, for the time
being at least, and would therefore respond readily to any sign of buying
interest in equities. But the market is likely to be poised for any reaction
on Wall Street to the FOMC meeting.

FT  28 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil sees foreign sales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sao Paulo dipped 0.9 per cent in moderate trade as foreign investors
continued to sell ahead of the first round of Brazil's presidential
elections on October 3. The Bovespa index closed 476 down at 52,175.
Analysts commented that the market remained confident that Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, the centre-right candidate, would tie up the elections in
the first round; but some sceptical investors apparently preferred to take
profits after a new opinion poll showing that the popularity of the leftist
candidate Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had risen.
The market was also waiting for the results of new opinion polls expected to
be released soon. There were unconfirmed rumours that Ibope and Datafolha
could publish new surveys as early as today. Remarks by economy minister
Ciro Gomes that October inflation could be around 2.0 per cent also weighed
on shares.

FT  28 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Lack of Fed rates move boosts
Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Blue chip stocks improved yesterday afternoon after the Federal Reserve
decided to delay any move to tighter money, writes Frank McGurty in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 13.80 higher at 3,863.04, while
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 added 1.25 at 462.07. But the Nasdaq composite
edged 0.26 lower to 755.37 and the American SE composite eased 0.36 to
453.42. Volume on the New York SE came to 290m shares.
After weeks of anticipation by the markets, the big event proved to be
somewhat anticlimactic. It was the day when the Fed's Open Market Committee
met in Washington to decide whether to sanction a sixth increase in
short-term interest rates this year. Most economists had expected the
central bank to opt for delaying its move to more restrictive credit for a
month or two. That position was vindicated when the meeting adjourned with
no announcement of a policy change.
Beforehand, the stock market was handed some evidence that the economy was
cooling. The Conference Board said its September index of consumer
confidence had fallen from its August level.
It was a hopeful sign for investors, some of whom were concerned that the
prospect of an accelerating economy would prompt the Fed to lift rates
immediately. Still, the Dow industrials were able to make some progress in
the morning.
Later, when it became evident a rate increase was not forthcoming, bond
traders began to push the price of the inflation-sensitive 30-year issue
down. The Dow quickly retreated in sympathy. But when the damage to bonds
was contained at moderate levels, the blue chips climbed back.
The individual gains were fractional, with a few exceptions. Alcoa's stock
climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 87 1/8 , lifted in part by a 'buy'
recommendation from PaineWebber. International Paper moved ahead Dollars 1
3/4 to Dollars 79 3/8 , while Goodyear Tire advanced Dollars 1 to Dollars 33
1/8 with the help of favourable comments by Mr David Garrity, an analyst at
Smith Barney. Merck appreciated Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 36.
Elsewhere, share prices were mixed. Declines on the Big Board held a slight
edge over advances.
In telecommunications, Nynex strengthened Dollars 2 to Dollars 38 after
submitting a seven-year framework plan for regulating phone services in New
York state, its primary market. A coalition of telecom providers, including
MCI and AT&amp;T, is offering active opposition to the proposal.
Micron Technology, the semiconductor supplier, shed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars
35 1/8. Trading in the shares was brisk following a CS First Boston
downgrade on Monday. Texas Instruments firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 68 5/8
as Morgan Stanley placed it on its 'buy' list.
Insurance group 20th Century Industries, hard hit by the Californian
earthquake last winter, jumped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 11 1/8 on news that
American International Group had agreed to help shore up its financial
position as part of a broad strategic alliance. AIG lost Dollars  1/8 at
Dollars 89 7/8.
On the Nasdaq, the technology sector rode out the session with little
movement in either direction. But Lotus Development was set back Dollars 1
3/4 to Dollars 35 1/8.
Canada
Toronto gained ground in moderate trading as US central bankers took no
action on interest rates. After a day of mixed trading the TSE 300 index
staged a rally late in the session, sparked by the Fed news.
The index closed 19.36 ahead at 4,360.78. However, declines led rises by 392
to 349 after volume of 57.8m shares.
The consensus among analysts is that the Fed has decided to wait a while
longer before making a move on interest rates, especially in the face of
ongoing trade talks with Japan and heavy economic data coming down the pipe
in the coming weeks.

FT  28 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Biggs cuts Japan, US in portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that Morgan Stanley had reduced the weighting of equities in Japan, the
US and Europe in its new, global model portfolio made its first impact in
Tokyo trading on Tuesday, Reuter reports.
However, details came too late to have an effect on Monday's Wall Street
performance.
Mr Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's global strategist, reduced the weighting
of large US stocks by 2 percentage points to 11 per cent, and of small US
stocks by 1 percentage point to 7 per cent.
He lowered the weighting of European shares by 2 percentage points to 6 per
cent and Japanese issues to 5 per cent from the previous 8 per cent.
Mr Biggs said he saw the Federal Reserve in a 'tightening mode', which meant
that stocks could languish at best, and at worst could be in the second leg
of the bear market that began in February.
'Central banks are so obsessed with fighting the last war, the inflation
war, that they choke off what could be a new era of growth by raising
interest rates,' he said.
Mr Biggs raised the weighting of gold to 4 per cent from 2 per cent,
commenting that the charts of the various commodity indices were very
bullish. 'I want to have 8 per cent in cash and 4 per cent in gold, just in
case,' he added.
Mr Biggs maintained the weighting of emerging markets equities and debt
positions, because 'the fundamentals are steadily improving and the money
flows are still staggering', he said.

FT  28 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa picks up from low
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg picked up from the day's lows in late afternoon trade as
investors returned to key stocks after the recent hefty declines.
Analysts cautioned, however, that future direction would depend on the
country's credit ratings, expected shortly from the leading credit agencies,
and South Africa's weighting in key emerging market indices.
They added that the market had now absorbed Friday's discount rate rise and
poor August inflation data.
The overall index finished 34 down at 5,583, having earlier touched 5,556,
for a two-day loss of 172 points.
The gold shares index was 26 softer at 2,422 and industrials gave up 32 to
6,171.
De Beers slipped to an early R97 before recovering to close 50 cents firmer
on balance at R99.50. Anglos finished R2.50 weaker at R235 and SAB improved
R1.50 to R81.

FT  28 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Most bourses falter, short of
initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lack of a decision on US interest rates during European market hours
left most bourses short of initiative, writes Our Markets Staff.
AMSTERDAM was on hold, the AEX index rising just 0.19 to 400.66 with shares
receiving a slight boost from gains in the Dutch bond market and in German
bunds.
Aegon was Fl 2.40 lower at Fl 99.40 after news that the company planned an
early redemption of a convertible bond which could inflate the number of
shares outstanding by as much as 8 per cent.
Heineken and Unilever put in firm performances as investors turned from
cyclical to defensive stocks. Each gained Fl 2.00, at Fl 238.30 and Fl
196.50 respectively.
Philips closed unchanged at Fl 54 after the Dutch goverment said it intended
to give the company a Fl 100m research grant for digital radio and
television, and the European Commission said it intended to take a
favourable view towards a joint venture being set up by Philips Lighting and
Osram, of Germany.
PARIS spent a day waiting, not very happily, for the FOMC and results from
its own corporate sector. The CAC 40 index fell 1.44 to 1,901.28 in turnover
of FFr2.49bn.
Its mood looked negative: Monday's forecast of a 'very, very sharp' 1994
recovery from Peugeot was greeted with a fall of FFr21 to FFr772; the Canal
Plus acquisition of 24.9 per cent in the German television channel Vox left
the French company's shares down FFr25 at FFr802.
The main results of the day fell after hours. Societe Generale, just after
the close, saw at least unchanged 1994 profits; the shares eased FFr1 to
FFr534. Credit Lyonnais, some minutes later, fell into the expected range
with a first-half net attributable loss of FFr4.5bn; here, the certificates
fell another FFr13 to FFr374.
On the plus side, Eurotunnel recovered 80 centimes to FFr21.90 after
Monday's salt water leak scare, and Alcatel Alsthom rose FFr6 to FFr560
although the industrial conglomerate is expected to report sharply lower
first-half net attributable profits this afternoon.
FRANKFURT caught up with Monday's post-bourse losses during the session, the
Dax index declining 9.96 to 2,058.73; but turnover stayed thin, investors
awaiting the Washington rates decision and thought unlikely to take firm
decisions on the market before the October 16 elections.
Attention focused again on Metallgesellschaft, down another DM14.70 to
DM118.50 after a low of DM100 in Ibis trading. The shares were quoted at
DM211 only four weeks ago, but the latest falls came in big turnover and
dealers yesterday thought it too early to call the turn in this downslide.
Turnover eased from DM5.3bn to DM5.0bn. After hours, Siemens showed a rise
on the day of DM5 to DM652.70 after weakness inspired by a magazine article
on Monday; the group said yesterday that it was considering spinning off
parts of its plant-technology division.
MILAN put in a strong performance on expectations that Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's government would finally unveil the 1995 budget last night,
with cuts of up to L48,000bn from public expenditure.
The Comit index rose 8.77 or 1.3 per cent to 680.91 as Mr Berlusconi also
held out hopes that the government might be about to publish a new calender
of privatisations, or revenue targets from disposals.
One Milan dealer commented that the market was prepared to overlook the
threat of a national strike by trade unions, which had earlier rejected
proposed reforms to cut the cost of of the country's pensions system. 'If
that is the price that we have to pay for a strong budget, then so be it.'
He added that the market was also supported by expectations of positive
six-month figures from the telecommunications companies and from Fiat.
Fiat led the market higher, picking up L101 to L6,793, while Telecom Italia
rose L109 or 2.5 per cent to L4,435 and Stet added L131 or 2.8 per cent to
L4,752.
ZURICH adopted a weaker bias, the SMI index slipping 5.1 to 2,581.0, with
investors unwilling to open new positions.
Registered shares in Sulzer, under pressure last week, picked up from early
lows to finish SFr1 easier at SFr923 after the group released lower than
expected first-half net profits. However, analysts commented that the
positive outlook for the full year and the perception that the first-half
figure, while low, was also influenced by seasonal factors, helped to
support the stock.
Ciba gave up SFr8 to SFr745, while BBC was one of a few blue chips to move
ahead, rising SFr6 to SFr1,171.
MADRID tried to go higher but ended flat, with the general index just 0.07
firmer at 297.24. Turnover amounted to Pta20.6bn, boosted on the day by
block trades arrranged by JP Morgan.
Strength in Repsol was the most consistent feature of the session, the
shares rising another Pta40 to Pta3,190, but in the banking sector Bankinter
and Popular came late with gains of Pta200 to Pta11,750, and Pta110 to
Pta15,310 respectively.
BRUSSELS ended mixed, with the Bel 20 index easing 0.86 to 1,384.95 in thin
turnover of BFr1bn.
The Luxembourg-based steelmaker Arbed stole the show with a rise of BFr270
to BFr4,770 after it said that a private offering of 1m shares had been
priced at BFr4,550, and oversubscribed.
WARSAW accelerated its recent declines in thin trading, the Wig index
falling 405.5 or 4.5 per cent to 8,705.2. Turnover shrank by 26.7 per cent
to 371.6bn zlotys.

FT  28 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls below
19,500 to five-month low
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Stocks plummeted in thin trading to their lowest levels since April as
arbitrageurs unwound positions following a plunge in index futures prices,
writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average fell 345.47 to finish at 19,468.89, the first close
below support at 19,500 since April 4. After reaching the day's high of
19,822.16 during the morning, the index declined to a low of 19,404.18 in
the final half-hour of trading.
On September 19, when the Nikkei 225 last approached the 19,500 mark, public
funds moved in to arrest the decline. This time, public funds, comprising
state run postal savings and insurance, seemed to remain on the sidelines.
Volume was an estimated 231m shares, little changed from Monday's 239.41m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 22.46 to 1,562.75, while
the second section lost 5.59 at 2,231.43 in volume estimated at 5.99m
shares. Losers surged ahead of winners by 769 to 227, with 159 issues
unchanged. But in London the ISE Nikkei 50 index gained 2.63 at 1,279.43.
As on Monday, most traders stayed on the sidelines, reflecting uncertainties
surrounding the US-Japan framework talks and Tuesday's meeting of the US
Federal Open Market Committee. Yesterday was also the last trading day for
delivery of September index futures.
The thinness of the market made it vulnerable to a wave of afternoon selling
that began with futures traders closing positions. The ensuing decline in
futures prices triggered dumping of speculative stocks and unwinding of
arbitrage positions. The resulting price slide was accelerated by
index-linked selling and rumours that Morgan Stanley was cutting the
weighting of Japanese stocks in its portfolio.
Japan Telecom, being closely watched ahead of next month's listing of Japan
Tobacco, fell Y30,000 to another low of Y4.02m. Other telecommunications
stocks were mixed. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone dipped Y1,000 to Y884,000,
but DDI, which lost Y8,000 on Monday, rallied Y7,000 to Y878,000.
Steelmakers suffered losses in some of the heaviest trading of the day.
Nippon Steel, the volume leader, edged down Y2 to Y385. Kobe Steel slipped
Y5 to Y326, Kawasaki Steel lost Y6 to Y432 and NKK ticked down Y1 to Y289.
Electricals also came under fire. Matsushita Electric Industrial receded Y30
to Y1,600, Fujitsu Y10 to Y1,040, Hitachi Y10 to Y955 and Oki Electric
Industrial Y5 to Y755.
In Osaka, the OSE average slid 257.66 to 21,843.87 in volume of 36.3m
shares.
Roundup
Lassitude afflicted several of the region's equity markets, as investors sat
on their hands in advance of yesterday's FOMC meeting in Washington.
However, there were one or two winners.
HONG KONG closed mildly weaker in drowsy trading, the Hang Seng index easing
33.39 to 9,610.24 in turnover down from HKDollars 3.50bn to HKDollars
2.85bn.
HSBC, the most active issue, lost 25 cents at HKDollars 87.50. It was
followed by Hongkong Land, down 10 cents at HKDollars 19.35, while Hong Kong
Telecom was 10 cents off at HKDollars 15.50.
Sino Land, the most active of the new index entries on Monday, retreated
12.50 cents to HKDollars 8.625, and Johnson Electric declined HKDollars 1 to
HKDollars 21.50.
SYDNEY was nervous about interest rates as the All Ordinaries index dipped
16.2 to 2,013.8. Resources issues were dragged down by falls in the golds
sector following a bullion price decline in New York, and by lower commodity
prices in the US.
The gold shares index dropped 46.5, or nearly 2 per cent, to 2,343.8.
Newcrest Mining lost 29 cents at ADollars 6.50 and Placer Pacific 5 cents at
ADollars 3.93.
SINGAPORE took a last minute dive and the Straits Times Industrial index
relinquished 9.97 to close at 2,289.84. The fall was caused mainly by a loss
of 60 cents in Cycle &amp; Carriage to SDollars 12.80, and a 30-cent retreat to
SDollars 11 by Sembawang Corp.
Before that, investors seemed to believe that the Federal Reserve meeting
could yield at most a 50 basis-point increase in interest rates, and that
this would be acceptable.
MANILA combined fears of another rise in US interest rates with worries
about delays in the implementation of the value added tax (VAT), which could
put more pressure on the Philippine government deficit. The composite index
ended 9.93 down at 2,934.27.
BOMBAY, also risk-averse, fell on fears of a plague attack in western India.
Following Monday's halt in trading, the BSE 30-share index lost 51.97 at
4,444.56.
SEOUL registered a strong rebound in blue chips as the composite index
finished 6.89 better at a new closing high of 1,052.01. In spite of the
rise, declining issues outnumbered gainers by 452 to 367.
KARACHI, similarly, majored on index heavyweights as the KSE 100 index rose
17.48 to 2,237.65. Investors took positions in energy and synthetics, said a
dealer.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Dollar edges downward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar eased against the D-Mark and the yen in late trading yesterday
after the US Federal Open Markets Committee, the policy-making arm of the
Federal Reserve Board, did not announce an interest rate rise at its monthly
meeting, writes Motoko Rich.
Against the yen, the dollar closed in London at Y98.1350, down from Y98.70.
Against the D-Mark, it finished at DM1.5470 from DM1.5551. In late trading
it had dropped below Y98.00 and DM1.54. The US currency ended in New York at
Y98.105 and DM1.5435.
The D-Mark strengthened slightly on the European crosses, although political
uncertainty in advance of the October 16 general election limited the upside
of the German currency.
The markets bounced the Italian lira around as they focused closely on the
progress of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's attempts to pass a suitably
tough deficit-cutting budget for 1995.
The market had been on tenterhooks throughout the day, in anticipation of an
FOMC announcement on interest rates. Most analysts expected that the Fed
would not act at this meeting.
Still, some corners of the market had priced in as much as a 50 basis-point
rise, and the failure of the Fed to produce such a move drove the dollar
down.
It regained some footing as markets seemed to take the news with equanimity.
'The fact that the Fed has not done anything yet does not mean it will not
do anything before the next meeting,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham, currency
economist at UBS. 'It is bad, but not disastrous, for the dollar, since the
Fed will probably maintain a bias towards tightening.'
Meanwhile, the markets continued to await the outcome of trade talks between
the US and Japan before the September 30 deadline for sanctions.
Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's trade minister, arrived in Washington
yesterday and indicated that Japan would make an effort to reach a deal on
the auto sector, the area which has been the most likely target for
sanctions. The dollar moved positively against the yen on the back of these
comments and analysts became increasingly optimistic that a reasonable
compromise would be reached.
Although political concerns kept the market apprehensive about the D-Mark,
thin trading helped the German currency maintain, and even strengthen, its
position against most other European currencies.
Against the French franc it closed unchanged at FFr3.417. Against the Danish
krone it finished at DKr3.928, up from DKr3.926, and against the Swiss franc
it ended at SFr0.829 from SFr0.828.
The D-Mark is unlikely to get any inspiration from tomorrow's meeting of the
Bundesbank council. In recent days the central bank's officials have been
making comments which suggest that a cut in rates, which has been
anticipated in some quarters, is improbable.
Bundesbank council member Mr Reimut Jochimsen said the bank should pursue a
cautious monetary policy while a further reduction in inflation may prove
difficult because of rising commodity prices.
In addition, yesterday's preliminary national cost of living figures for
September came in at 2.9 per cent, basically flat against 3 per cent for
August.
These factors contributed to a market expectation that the Bundesbank will
hold its fire tomorrow. But Mr Cunningham said: 'There is still scope for
rate reductions if the trend in inflation continues to go down and the money
supply shows a deceleration of growth.'
The lira slipped against the D-Mark to as low as L1009.50 in early trading
as markets responded negatively to the failure of the Italian government to
reach an agreement with trade union leaders on a pension reform plan.
But hopes that ministers could pass a budget as early as last night raised
optimism about the lira. The Italian currency was further bolstered when Mr
Berlusconi said the deficit reduction in the 1995 budget could exceed the
previously planned L45 trillion.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economist at Bank of America, commented: 'If the
government stands up to the unions, even if they go on strike, that should
be good for the lira in the long term. The markets want to see a government
that has the strength of its convictions.'
The lira ended in London at L1006 per D-Mark, unchanged from Monday's close.
Sterling tracked the dollar down in late trading, but was relatively steady
throughout the day. The pound closed in London at Dollars 1.5770, up from
Dollars 1.5743, and at DM2.4396, down from DM2.4482.
The December short sterling contract saw 16,350 lots traded and finished
unchanged at 93.19, allowing for a short-term interest rate of 6.81 per
cent.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of
Pounds 155m after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 300m. Overnight rates
traded between 4 3/8 and 6 1/4 per cent.
German call money was quoted between 4.30 and 4.40 per cent.

<TEXT>
Reuters, the information and media group, yesterday announced that it was
forming a joint venture with a farmers' co-operative in the US to market
commodity information to North American commodity businesses.
The venture, which will be based in Kansas City, will bring together Reuters
America and Farmland Industries, one of the biggest farmer-owned
agricultural marketing and manufacturing co-operatives in the US, Reuters
said.
The 50-50 venture will be called Market Communications Group, offering price
quotations and analysis of commodity news, weather and markets, primarily by
satellite.
Reuters has been taking advantage of the sharp price rises for many
commodities this year, expanding editorial coverage in Asia, Europe, Africa
and the Americas.

FT  28 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper and aluminium lead
afternoon rally at LME - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All base metals clawed away from earlier lows in afternoon trading at the
London Metal Exchange yesterday when flurries of renewed speculative
interest emerged after copper and aluminium held above support.
COPPER snapped to a high of Dollars 2,562 a tonne for three months delivery
before drifting back to Dollars 2,558, still down on Monday's Dollars 2,564
close but up from its low of Dollars 2,554.
Continuing consumer interest and support just below Dollars 1,600 a tonne
saw the three months ALUMINIUM price chase higher on the back of
short-covering. It finally settled at the day's high of Dollars 1,615, a
gain of Dollars 7 from Monday's close.
NICKEL prices moved higher with copper but the market never fully recovered
from its earlier mauling following the announcement of another sizeable LME
stocks rise.
ZINC followed the same pattern and climbed from its low of Dollars 1,026 a
tonne to end the day at Dollars 1,031 a tonne, a Dollars 14 loss overall.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Singapore link to extend oil
futures trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A move to link oil futures trading in London and Singapore was announced
yesterday in a development that will extend trading of the Brent crude oil
contract to about 18 hours a day.
The International Petroleum Exchange in London and the Singapore
International Monetary Exchange said that they would establish a mutual
clearing system in which Brent contracts opened on one exchange could be
liquidated on the other.
An additional benefit would be that members of the respective exchanges
would be able to trade on the other without buying a seat on that exchange.
Mr Peter Wildblood, the IPE's chief executive, said that the link-up, which
is expected to be in place by the second quarter of 1995, 'should eventually
broaden the trading base of the Brent contract,' the current daily volume of
which is about 50,000 contracts.
The co-operative arrangement should ensure 'instant liquidity' in the
Singapore market, according to Mr Wildblood.
At present there is no Asian benchmark crude that investors in the region
can trade in their own time zone.

The Nigerian cocoa season is getting off to a slow start after heavy rains
and a crippling national political crisis, traders and farmers said
yesterday, reports Reuters from Lagos.
'Farmers have begun drying their beans. But initially there was far too much
rain,' said Mr Omojeso Femi, administrative secretary of the Ondo State
Farmer's Congress.
Nigeria's annual cocoa output is about 130,000 tonnes.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Trans-World leads Russian
aluminium rush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A battle for ownership of Russia's biggest aluminium smelters is being waged
now that they have been privatised, according to western traders.
Trans-World Metals, a London-based company, is reputed to be leading the
attack in order to protect its commercial position. Trans-World is now
probably the biggest trader of Russian aluminium and also a substantial
exporter of alumina, an intermediate material, to Russia,
Mr David Reuben, chairman of the Trans-World group, said yesterday
suggestions that his organisation had taken a controlling interest in two
Russian smelters were wide of the mark. However, consortia organised and
prompted by Trans-World had accrued substantial shareholdings, in the order
of one third, in the four biggest Russian aluminium smelters. Between them
these smelters account for about two-thirds of Russia's aluminium production
capacity.
They are Bratsk, the world's biggest aluminium smelter with an annual
capacity of 850,000 tonnes; Krasnoyarsk (760,000 tonnes); Novokuznetsk
(280,000 tonnes) and Sayansk (270,000 tonnes).
Mr Reuben said: 'We are working with many companies and funds in Russia to
assist our situation there. We have put a huge investment into Russia in the
past three years'. He said shareholders' meetings might be called in order
to promote changes at some smelters. He also stressed, however, that
Trans-World's direct shareholdings in the smelters were small. 'We see this
as a long-term investment,' he said. 'I believe in the future of Russia and
would have no hesitation in investing more there.'
Mr Reuben said Trans-World had been interested in acquiring shares in the
Russian smelters since the privatisation process started two years ago. (All
the smelters are now joint stock companies but the central government
retains a 20 per cent interest). A consortium lead by Trans-World had built
a 20 per cent shareholding in the Bogoslovsk smelter (160,000 tonnes a year)
but sold this a few months ago. Another consortium, in which Trans-World was
not involved, had built up a controlling interest in the Volvograd smelter
(170,000 tonnes).
Trans-World has been very active in the past few years establishing joint
ventures, trading partnerships and co-operation with metal suppliers,
refiners and smelters across what was once the Soviet Union. Its most
important relationship is with Transis, in which it has no shareholding but
has contractual arrangements for Transis to operate on Trans-World's behalf
in Russia and for Trans-World to work for Transis outside the country.
Trans-World takes credit for coming to the rescue of both Bratsk and
Krasnoyarsk three years ago when they were in danger of running out of vital
raw materials because of shortages of foreign currency. Trans-World put up
cash to 'kick-start' production again.
Consequently, Trans-World became the biggest supplier of raw materials to
these smelters, which they mainly paid for with aluminium for export.
Trans-World also helped Bratsk set up a joint venture company, Rosal, in
London to raise capital and possibly get better terms for its aluminium.
In May bulk alumina handling facilities costing 'several million dollars'
were opened at the east coast port of Vanino by a company jointly owned by
Trans-World and the port authority. This has opened up one of the
bottlenecks that restricted alumina imports to Russia and has provided a
logical link between Australia, the world's biggest alumina supplier, and
Siberia's big aluminium smelters.
Analysts point out that the position of trading houses like Trans-World is
less secure following the recent international trade agreement between some
of the big aluminium producing nations that promised funds to the Russian
industry if it joined in a worldwide cut in production. For example, both
Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa), the world's biggest aluminium group,
and Pechiney, Europe's biggest, have recently confirmed that they are
talking to Krasnoyarsk about upgrading the smelter, particularly with a view
to reducing pollution.
'Having a big shareholding in the smelter would help protect Trans-World's
toll smelting operations there if one of the big western producers moved
in,' said one trader.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bigger world sugar crop
forecast despite beet problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RATZEBURG, GERMANY, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Statistics agency FO Licht estimates the world's 1994-95 sugar output at
113.453m tonnes, up from last season's 110.378m, reports Reuters from
Ratzeburg, Germany.
Licht yesterday forecast beet sugar production at 36.389m tonnes, down from
last season's 39.404m, while putting saw cane sugar output at 77.064m
tonnes, up from 70.974m in 1993-94.
The total, while sharply above last season's, remained well below the 116.2m
tonnes produced three years ago, it noted.
Licht expected the general supply situation to tighten, despite its higher
production estimate. 'Consequently another drawdown in stocks will be
needed, but the gap may not be sufficient to upset the market greatly,' it
suggested.
While warning that higher prices would hurt demand it suggested that 'most
producers can probably look forward to another year of satisfactory prices.'
Analysts remain conservative on European Union sugar output after exhausted
crops mostly failed to make up for bad weather, reports Reuters from Paris.
An unusual combination of rain and drought attacked yields in member
countries, bringing output back towards 'normal' levels after two record
seasons, they said.
'Apart from France and Belgium, where the latest beet tests show some
catching up, we might now scale down our output estimates a bit,' said C.
Czarnikow analyst Mr Christopher Pack.
The London broker recently predicted EU beet output of 15.627m tonnes (raw
value) compared with 17.408m in 1993-94.
Rain delayed spring sowings in Europe and a summer heatwave put severe
stress on crops in July. Although August rain brought relief, cool and wet
conditions in September limited root growth, analysts explained.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries retreat as Fed leaves rates
unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Longer-dated US Treasury bonds retreated yesterday afternoon after it became
apparent that the Federal Reserve had decided against an immediate increase
in short-term interest rates.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  9/16 lower
at 96, with the yield rising to 7.841 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was off  1/32 at 99 17/32 , to yield 6.492 per cent.
In the early hours, traders were reluctant to make fresh commitments as the
Fed's Open Market Committee was meeting in Washington to discuss monetary
policy.
The waiting ended at 2pm when the central bank issued a terse announcement
that the meeting had adjourned. There was no statement on policy, which led
observers to conclude that the committee had opted to delay its next move to
tighter credit conditions.
Only a minority of analysts had expected a policy change yesterday. Most
believed the Fed would wait until after the November elections, despite a
recent spate of stronger than expected economic data.
Still, prices on longer-data securities backtracked on the announcement,
amid concerns that the Fed was falling behind in the race to keep ahead of
inflation.
Early on, the market was presented with data suggesting the contrary. The
Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence had fallen this month
to 88.4, against a reading of 90.4 in August.
The index, which had been expected to show no change, encouraged the notion
that inflation at the consumer level was still not a threat.
However, the report was not enough to lift bond prices, with traders
preoccupied with the possibility of impending policy decisions.
Positioning ahead of an afternoon auction of Dollars 17.25bn in new two-year
notes was also depressing the market during the morning. Dealers had hoped
to wrest concessions from the Treasury when it awarded the securities.
In the event, the bidding proved to be lacklustre and the notes were issued
at a yield which slightly exceeded expectations. But with the Fed revealing
its hand just a few minutes later, the event was quickly forgotten.
Trading in European bond markets was very thin yesterday, with few investors
prepared to commit themselves before knowing the impact on US interest rates
of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in the US.
German government bonds shrugged off data showing that year-on-year
inflation in the month to mid-September was 2.9 per cent, a fall from the
previous month's figure of 3 per cent.
'The market is waiting on the FOMC and has completely ignored these good
inflation figures,' said Mr Pio de Gregorio, European economist at NatWest
Markets in London.
The market will be watching today's Bundesbank council meeting for a change
in interest rates, but Mr de Gregorio said that he did not think there would
be a change in rates before the German election on October 16.
The December bund future was around 89.01 in late trading, up 0.09 points on
the day.
The yield on 10-year Italian government bonds fell 7 basis points to 11.76
per cent yesterday.
Mr Andre de Silva of PaineWebber said the optimism was prompted by hopes
that trade union agreement on a cut in spending on pensions would allow the
government to reduce its deficit.
UK government bond trading languished in the shadow of the FOMC meeting and
today's 10-year gilt auction.
Mr Robert Thomas at NatWest Markets said he expected the auction to meet
with good demand, but added that other gilts were being sold in order to buy
the auction stock. He said: 'This is not new money coming into the market.'
Mr Kevin Adams at BZW expected the auction to be covered between 1.5 and 2
times, but added that the switching out of other gilts may mean 'the
after-market may be very heavy water'.
This meant that if the Fed had increased rates, the market could gain in the
morning, but trade off in the afternoon. The spread of gilts over bunds
could widen to 165 basis points, he said, against 151 yesterday.

FT  28 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Taiwan may scrap GDR offering
for China Steel
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan may cancel a planned issue of global depositary receipts in state-run
China Steel Corp in favour of domestic offerings.
Amid discord over the pace of privatisation of the island's biggest
steel-maker, a 450m share offering - 6 per cent of the company's equity - to
overseas investors has been postponed indefinitely, Mr Yen Chi-li, spokesman
for China Development Corp, which served as the lead underwriter for
previous domestic offerings, said yesterday.
The Dollars 350m to Dollars 400m GDR offering was to have been launched by
the end of this year. Instead, the Commission of National Corporations under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs has proposed offering another 950m shares
to local investors first. The proposal awaits Cabinet approval.
If the market can successfully absorb so large an offering, the government
will likely scrap the GDR issue in favour of further domestic offerings.
The government must sell 1.3bn more of its shares to achieve privatisation.
Following several tranches of sell-offs, China Steel is now 67.1 per cent
government-owned, with the Ministry of Economic Affairs holding most of the
government's shares.
Merrill Lynch, which was to manage the GDR issue, could not be reached for
comment.
Observers believe market conditions could allow the privatisation to be
completed domestically as the stock market traditionally rallies leading up
to elections. Key provincial and mayoral elections will be held in early
December.

FT  28 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Indover Bank launches three-year FRN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a dearth of new eurobond issues yesterday, with bond markets
nervous ahead of the US FOMC monetary policy meeting.
Syndicate managers said conditions have worsened in recent days, with
eurobond spreads over the underlying government bond market widening most
markedly in the dollar and sterling sectors.
'The dollar market has recently been underpinned by good retail flows but
these have now slowed,' said Mr Tim Skeet, senior vice-president at Kidder
Peabody.
'The dollar market is suffering from uncertainty caused by the FOMC,
quarter-end considerations and the fact that retail flows out of Switzerland
and Benelux countries have slowed, particularly at the long-end of the
market,' he said.
Attention today is likely to turn to Lebanon's debut eurobond offering of
Dollars 300m of three-year fixed-rate notes, increased yesterday from
Dollars 150m due to unexpectedly strong demand.
The bonds are expected to carry a coupon of around 10 per cent, yielding
around 325 to 350 basis points over US government bonds.
Indover Bank, a Dutch subsidiary of the Indonesian central bank, launched
its first foray into the international capital markets with a Dollars 125m
offering of three-year floating-rate notes, offering a spread of 67 1/2
basis points over three-month Libor.
Lead manager HSBC Markets said 70 per cent of the bonds were sold into
Europe, with the remainder placed in South East Asia. 'This is the bank's
first transaction and it was anxious to come into the mainstream of the
market, which at the moment is the short-term, floating-rate dollar sector,'
it said.
The Kingdom of Belgium's DM1bn offering of five-year bonds, which was
launched on Monday, was priced yesterday to yield 25 basis points over
German government bonds, which some syndicate managers said was expensive.
Hongkong International Terminals, a subsidiary of Hutchison Whampoa, is
expected to launch a Dollars 1.74bn offering of 10-year floating-rate notes
in the next 10 days.
The notes will carry a coupon of Libor plus 85 basis points, with a call
option at the end of the fourth year.

FT  28 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: France plans to raise FFr20bn
in retail bond sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government yesterday unveiled details of its plans to open the
government bond market to individual investors, announcing that it will sell
FFr20bn of bonds to the public in the year from the beginning of October.
The government had intended to offer about FFr10bn in the scheme but strong
demand from banks which will serve as the retail network has prompted an
increase.
The French economy ministry said that the aim of the scheme was to encourage
long term savings by individuals and to provide a facility which is already
available in many industrialised economies.
In the US, for example, savings bonds represent about 5 per cent of federal
debt. Under the French scheme, foreign individuals will also be able to
subscribe to the issues.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, denied the move was aimed
at reducing the country's dependence on foreign investors, who have reduced
their holdings of French bonds this year.
'You have to look at the amounts involved. The total borrowing programme for
1994 is for FFr500bn. In raising FFr20bn from private investors the state is
not trying to find a new means to finance its debt,' he said.
Mr Alphandery added that he thought the sale of French bonds by foreign
investors was a temporary phenomenon, which was normal in a period of bond
market turbulence.
Under the terms of the scheme, investors are to be offered 10-year bonds
with a face value of FFr2,000. They will pay banks a fixed commission of 2
per cent. The first bonds to be sold to individuals will have a coupon of
7.5 per cent, while the annual yield is expected to be about 7.8 per cent
after commission costs. This compares with a forecast inflation rate of 1.8
per cent for 1995, and a return of just under 5 per cent on money market
funds, the most popular savings instrument in France.

FT  28 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Bank of Montreal and Bancomer
set up fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO, MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of Montreal and Grupo Financiero Bancomer, Mexico's second-largest
financial services group, are setting up a jointly-managed mutual fund.
It will invest in US, Canadian and Mexican companies which stand to benefit
from the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
The fund, to be known as the Nafta Advantage Fund, will be managed by the
brokerage arms of Bank of Montreal, Bancomer and Harris Bankcorp of Chicago,
Bank of Montreal's wholly-owned subsidiary in the US.
The mutual fund will be open to investors in all three countries.
To satisfy regulatory requirements, the fund will in practice comprise
separate pools of assets in each country. Each pool, however, will have
precisely the same mix of investments.
Each of the three participants will nominate managers to select shares from
their own country. The fund will be required to invest at least 20 per cent
of its assets in companies based in each country.
Bank of Montreal said the fund was predicated on the assumption that
companies taking advantage of Nafta would generally outperform those which
stick to their home market.
According to Mexican figures, two-way trade between the US and Mexico surged
by 17.5 per cent in the six months after Nafta came into force on January 1,
compared to a year earlier.
Canada-Mexico trade flows jumped by 33 per cent, albeit from a relatively
low base.
Trade between the US and Canada, the world's two largest trading partners,
has also grown appreciably since the implementation of a bilateral free
trade pact in 1989.
The fund is the latest in a series of links between Canadian and Mexican
financial institutions since the Nafta negotiations began three years ago.
Bank of Nova Scotia purchased a minority stake in Inverlat, the Mexican
financial services group, while Bancomer opened an office in Toronto earlier
this year.

FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Thai property tycoons take to
the rails - A look at two developers switching from satellite cities to
skytrains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Two rival Sino-Thai brothers known for their grandiose property development
schemes are again courting controversy in Bangkok with plans to build
Dollars 4bn worth of elevated urban railways across the Thai capital.
The move into transport projects by Mr Anant Kanjanapas, 52, president of
Bangkok Land, and his brother Mr Keree Kanjanapas, 44, executive chairman of
Tanayong, comes at a time when properties in their satellite cities on the
outskirts of Bangkok are proving difficult to sell to the public.
The brothers say they are business visionaries; their critics claim their
business ventures are often too ambitious and poorly executed.
The satellite cities - the core of both companies - are being built on land
acquired in the 1960s and 1970s by the patriarch of the family, Mr Mongkol
Kanjanapas, now 73, a Chiuchou Chinese who immigrated to Thailand in the
1930s.
Tanayong and Bangkok Land were listed in March 1991 and February 1992
respectively, after the brothers returned to Thailand from an extended
period in Hong Kong. Much of the family business is still in Hong Kong,
where the family name is Wong.
Inspired by the success of Hong Kong's satellite cities, each brother
developed a new town in Bangkok dominated by high-rise buildings, but Thais
appear reluctant to move into such complexes.
Bangkok Land's 640-hectare Muang Thong Thani city, on the capital's northern
outskirts, is planned as a self-contained community with a hotel and a
university; Tanayong's 243-hectare Thana City includes a prominent golf
course.
Mr Anant says: 'By the end of this year there will be more than 10,000
families in Muang Thong Thani . . . there will be tremendous life and 50,000
jobs. It will be the best part of Bangkok in every respect.'
But one property analyst for a Bangkok stockbroker recently wrote that Muang
Thong Thani is 'a dreadful place lacking character and soul.
'The fact that no one's living there doesn't help.'
The largest project - 27 'popular condominium' towers containing 26,000
apartments for low-income earners - is nearly completed, but only about 10
per cent of the units have been occupied.
Similar and cheaper homes in more modest schemes are available nearby.
Bangkok Land has been giving away a car worth Bt160,000 (Dollars 6,400) with
every Bt513,000 apartment to attract buyers.
Only two of eight 'industrial condominium' towers have been transferred to
the buyers, although the project was completed in June 1993 and subsequently
reported by Bangkok Land to be 100 per cent sold.
'They are too good for Thai manufacturers who aren't used to multistorey
factories,' says Mr Anant. Two of the industrial buildings are to be
converted into commercial complexes 'with a convention centre as big as
Singapore's', he said.
Bangkok Land, like Tanayong, has previously booked partial payments as
complete sales in its accounts, a practice which could punch awkward holes
in the companies' cash-flow if large numbers of buyers walk away from their
often modest initial payments.
Bangkok Land reported a 3 per cent rise in consolidated net profits to
Bt5.03bn for the year to end-March 1994, but total sales for the year fell
25 per cent to Bt12.7bn from Bt16.8bn in 1993, while net debt grew to Bt20bn
in March from Bt16bn in December.
Accounts receivable (money promised by buyers but not yet paid) stood at
Bt26.8bn - nearly all on completed property.
By one stockbroker's estimate, 45 per cent of Bangkok Land's 1994 gross
profit may have come from sales from its extensive land holdings.
Tanayong's net debt is a relatively comfortable Bt500m and accounts
receivable amount to Bt6.2bn, but Mr Keree admits he was forced to relaunch
Thana City, on the eastern side of Bangkok.
'We've had to make them more affordable after the property market's
consolidation,' he said. 'Unless and until the traffic situation improves
people are going to find it easier to live in more accessible areas.'
Tanayong's consolidated profits dropped 53 per cent in the year to March
1994 to Bt257m; there is also still no sign that significant strategic
diversification - promised at the time of its flotation - will come about
soon.
Tanayong and Bangkok Land have both rediscovered the virtues of the city
centre: Tanayong's three 'Regent' towers, with a total of nearly 1,200
apartments, have sold quickly. Meanwhile, Bangkok Land has launched 'Grand
Metro' - three towers of 2,000 apartments with extensive retail space.
Despite their unresolved difficulties with the Bangkok property market, both
companies have plunged into the swamp of bureaucratic in-fighting and
planning inertia that has delayed the development of mass transit railways
in the capital for decades.
Mr Keree says the move into transport is 'quite logical. We realised a long
time ago that infrastructure problems were hindering our business, hindering
the country.'
City mass transit systems around the world rarely if ever make a profit. Yet
Tanayong's 24km inner-city rail franchise is unsubsidised and has no
significant sweeteners in the form of concessions to develop property along
the route, unlike some other schemes.
Siemens, of Germany, recently replaced the Anglo-French GEC Alsthom
consortium as lead contractors for the train system. Tanayong's transport
subsidiary said GEC Alsthom could not provide a satisfactory financing
package.
Mr Anant of Bangkok Land has spoken of plans to build Asia's tallest
building - a 90-storey office and residential tower over the depot of
Bangkok Land's 20km 'Skytrain' franchise.
The two brothers and their companies could profit from rapid flotations of
their transport subsidiaries on the Thai stock exchange.
'With BoI (board of investment) tax privileges they can be listed
immediately on the stock market without any earnings or a track record,'
says Mr Neil Semple, research manager for HG Asia in Bangkok.
But both transport projects - designed independently of each other - have
been delayed in recent months by demands from environmentalists that the
railways go under rather than above ground.
Mr Anant remains defiant in the face of criticism of housing and railway
schemes. 'Leave me alone. Let me do it,' he says. 'I will deliver. Let me
prove it.'

FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Jardine outlines terms of
Singapore trading

<TEXT>
Jardine Matheson, the holding company for the diversified group of Jardine
companies, yesterday outlined the arrangements it has put in place for
investors to trade on the Singapore stock exchange following its withdrawal
from Hong Kong.
Jardine companies have been listed on the Singapore exchange for three years
but have never been traded there. However, Jardine directors believe this
will become the natural market for trading from Hong Kong because the two
markets are in the same time zone. Other listings are in London, Luxembourg
and Australia, but stock is only traded in London and the colony.
The company will bear the costs of switching out off the Hong Kong clearing
and settlement system and into the Singapore system.
It has further arranged with nine local brokerages to levy a maximum
commission charge of 0.5 per cent on retail transactions in shares of the
companies. Normally, foreign brokers would need to pay this amount to the
Singaporean brokerage, but under the Jardine arrangements selected
brokerages say the Singaporean party will take 0.25 per cent.
Shareholders will still find the cost of dealing more expensive than in Hong
Kong, where the normal trade levy is 0.42 per cent including stamp duty and
transaction levy at participating brokerage GK Goh Securities.
Singapore charges a clearing fee of 0.05 per cent on the transaction value,
but non-Singaporean investors are exempted from other fees.
The arrangements initially effect shareholders of Jardine Matheson and
Jardine Strategic, which delist on December 31. They will extend to Dairy
Farm, Hongkong Land and Mandarin Oriental International when they switch on
March 31 next year.
Jardine's directors dismiss concerns of illiquidity in the Singapore market,
which at the end of July had a market capitalisation of USDollars 137bn
compared with Hong Kong's USDollars 312bn. Average daily turnover in
Singapore - at SDollars 675m (USDollars 456m) according to Jardine - is not
far off current Hong Kong levels, but half of that achieved in the final
quarter of last year.

Eko Stahl

<TEXT>
The Bremen-based Hegemann group has put in a formal bid to buy eastern
Germany's largest steel mill from the Treuhand privatisation agency,
Treuhand officials said yesterday.
However, unlike Cockerill Sambre, the Belgian steel producer, which earlier
this week confirmed that it was interested initially in acquiring a 60 per
cent stake in the mill, Hegemann appears prepared to buy the entire Eko
Stahl complex, which is based in Brandenburg state.
Officials said that Hegemann, which has interests in construction, steel and
shipbuilding, would guarantee about 2,300 jobs directly in the mill and
invest between DM1.1bn (Dollars 710m) and DM1.2bn, but the level of
investment would depend on the amount of state and government subsidies it
receives.
The attraction of subsidies, as well as a wish to stem foreign competition,
could be one of the reasons why Hegemann is interested in Eko Stahl, a steel
analyst said.
The Treuhand is expected to reply to Cockerill Sambre's bid by October 10,
but the agency would not say when it would be replying to Hegemann.
The east German mill produced 900,000 tonnes of steel last year, a fall of
nearly 1.2m tonnes since it was placed under the agency's control in 1990.

marketing war

<TEXT>
International Business Machines and Hewlett-Packard, the two largest US
computer companies, are engaging in a gloves-off brawl over leadership in
the Dollars 43bn mid-range computer market.
HP threw the first punch last week when it announced an aggressive marketing
program to lure customers away from IBM's AS/400 computers with discounts of
up to 30 per cent for those willing to trade their IBM models for HP
machines.
In magazine advertisements HP is claiming that the future of the AS/400, one
of IBM's most profitable product lines, is in doubt. 'But I see no clear
future here,' says a fortune teller gazing at a black box, the trademark
colour and shape of the IBM computer.
HP also claims it has persuaded 11 of the top 15 software developers to
rewrite programs designed for the AS/400 to work on HP computers, removing
the biggest barrier to switching from IBM to HP computers.
IBM struck back this week with its own two-page newspaper advertisements,
challenging HP's claims and vowing to match HP price discounts. 'Nice try,
HP,' the advertisements read. 'To become number one in the business computer
market it takes more than just shooting at the leader.'
IBM, which is also distributing a seven-page 'fact sheet' to customers,
business partners and its sales force, claims HP's minicomputer line is
facing the end of its technological life cycle, prompting the discounts.
Intense competition is nothing new in the mid-range computer market, where
HP, IBM, Digital Equipment and others have been dueling for many years. This
specifically target marketing battle is, however, unprecedented and reflects
HP's determination to overtake IBM in a lucrative, high-growth segment of
the computer market.
HP dismissed IBM's counter attack. Its claims that HP technology was running
out of steam, 'sounds like something a desperate product manager put
together over the weekend', the company said.
HP is attempting to hit IBM at a time when the market leader is most
vulnerable. IBM's AS/400 sales weakened in the first half of this year.

FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: AIG steps in to bolster
loss-making Californian insurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

   NEW YORK

<TEXT>
American International Group, the US insurance group, yesterday stepped in
to support 20th Century Industries, a Californian insurer whose capital base
had been strained by an estimated Dollars 815m of losses from the Northridge
earthquake.
AIG said it was injecting Dollars 200m immediately into the company in the
form of convertible preference shares. It is also acquiring warrants to buy
another 16m shares in the company. These arrangements, together with an
option over a further 15 per cent of 20th Century's shares, would give the
US's biggest property/casualty insurer rights to nearly 40 per cent of the
company's ordinary share capital.
AIG will also take over some of 20th Century's liabilities through a quota
share reinsurance agreement. It has also provided a stop-loss policy to cap
the company's earthquake losses for a period, said Mr Richard Baum,
California's chief deputy insurance commissioner.
20th Century was the worst-hit of the insurers affected by January's
earthquake in southern California. At first, it put its losses at only
Dollars 160m, but has since increased that estimate several times. The total
insured losses from the disaster are now put at about three times the
insurance industry's original estimate of Dollars 7.5bn, as all insurers
have discovered deeper structural damage to property than originally
expected.
20th Century's finances reached a critical point at the start of this month,
when it announced the latest increase in anticipated earthquake losses. It
was asked by regulators to formulate a plan to boost its capital base. Under
an agreement with California regulators, 20th Century had already been given
permission to retreat from the homeowners' insurance market in California,
the source of its problems.
For AIG, the deal represents a way into the automotive insurance market in
California, the largest in the US. Under the plan, which will involve AIG
naming two directors to the company's 11-person board, the insurers will
expand through joint ventures outside California.

FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Henkel to be president of German
industry body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hans-Olaf Henkel, who resigned unexpectedly three weeks ago as European
head of International Business Machines, the US computer manufacturer, will
be elected president of the Federation of German Industry in November.
He is sole candidate for the post, considered to be the most important and
influential in German industry. Mr Klaus Asche, chief executive of the
Hamburg-based Holsten Brewery, had been the frontrunner for the job but
stepped down when Mr Henkel declared an interest.
Mr Henkel is believed to have been the unanimous choice of the Federation's
seven vice-presidents, each representing an important sector of German
industry.
The Federation (Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie or BDI), however, is
smarting from what it sees as the indifference of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
administration towards German industry.
The organisation has sought to get politicians to lobby harder for German
companies on trips abroad, pointing to the contracts won by British and
French companies who have enjoyed more political support. Mr Henkel's
election is seen as a move to give the organisation a sharper edge.
The appointment should also dampen speculation that he left IBM, recovering
after several years of losses, because of disagreements with Mr Lou
Gerstener, IBM chairman, over corporate strategy.
Observers questioned whether IBM's new structure, which emphasises
commercial sectors over country management, would have weakened his
authority.
Mr Henkel has told analysts that such speculation was nonsense, pointing out
that he will remain chairman of IBM Germany after taking up the BDI
presidency on January 1.
Mr Henkel, 54, takes over from Mr Tyll Necker, who is stepping down after a
third two-year term. Mr Necker, 64, came to the rescue of the organisation
after Mr Heinrich Weiss, his predecessor, left - furious that the BDI was
being paid so little attention.
The BDI's determination to choose a leader with clout is underlined by Mr
Henkel's atypical background. He has been neither head nor owner of a large
German company and will be the first senior executive from an international
company to hold the post.
He has already built a reputation in Germany for decisive action by taking
IBM out of the nationwide collective wage talks run by the IG Metall Union,
and by introducing Sunday working, an example of workplace flexibility which
is almost unheard of in Germany.
In contrast, Mr Necker, head of a Mittelstand company making cleaning
machinery, was known as a man who preferred a less confrontational approach.
Yesterday it became known that Mr Henkel has also accepted the post of
chairman of the Berlin airports authority, a job which will also wield
considerable political influence.

FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Mercedes merger to cut cost of
components
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz is to spin off its German engine valve factory into a DM530m
(Dollars 344m) ground-breaking joint venture designed to reduce component
costs.
In the third such deal in as many months, its Bad Homburg works, which
provides valves for all the group's cars and commercial vehicles, will be
merged into a new company, MWP.
The move follows agreements under which Keiper Recaro is to take charge of
car seat manufacture at the Daimler Benz subsidiary's Bremen factory, and
Mercedes' own production of power-steering units is to be merged with that
of ZF.
The deals are the earliest results of a shift in the group's components
supply and manufacturing strategy, outlined earlier this year by Mr Werner
Niefer, chairman.
They will reduce the degree of vertical integration within Mercedes,
generate cost reductions as a result of greater economies of scale, and
ensure that the vehicle maker can maintain direct control over quality.
MWP, for example, will combine the various component operations of
Mahle-Wizemann and Pleuco with those of Mercedes, and manufacture complete
valve systems to be installed as a single unit on the assembly line.
The so-called 'system supplier' grouping, with aggregate annual sales of
DM530m and 3,100 employees, will supply other customers as well as Mercedes
from factories in Europe, Asia, and North and South America.
Although the Mercedes factory employs only 650 people, it is the third
largest engine valve supplier in Europe. Pleuco is market leader in the US
and Europe for valve seatings, turbo-charger parts and other components.
Earlier this month, Keiper Recaro management moved into the car assembly
plant at Bremen and took over its seat manufacture operations.

Sulzer, the Swiss heavy engineering and medical technology group, yesterday
reported a depressed SFr34m (USDollars 26.5m) net profit for the first half
of 1994, on sales up 3 per cent at SFr2.68bn.
As it was the first full interim income statement published by the group, no
comparative figures were given.
Mr Erich Muller, finance director, said sales were abnormally low in the
first half, mainly because there was no large contract invoicing by the
engineering divisions. He foresaw a better second half, but feared the
negative impact of the strong Swiss franc.
Mr Fritz Fahrni, chief executive, softened his forecast, saying net income
would at least reach last year's level. In the spring he forecast an
increase.
Order intake rose 3 per cent in the first half to SFr3.2bn, a 6.5 per cent
rise in local currencies. Mr Fahrni said the positive trend had continued so
far in the second half.
Ruti, the troubled textile machinery subsidiary, is expected to make an
operating profit this year, thanks to lower costs and steady sales. The
Infra building equipment division has suffered a 10 per cent slide in
orders, but is likely to maintain its profit. Sulzer Medica, which makes
artificial human body parts, raised first-half sales by 4.4 per cent, in
spite of the pressure in many countries on health care costs. Its sales and
profit growth is expected to follow the recent trend.
The Winterthur division, which makes locomotives and hydraulic turbines, was
held back by restructuring charges.

Societe Generale, one of France's largest banks, yesterday reported
consolidated group net profits up 3.8 per cent to FFr2.24bn (Dollars 420m)
for the six months to June 30.
Mr Marc Vienot, chairman, said the group's diversified structure helped
offset declines caused by the uncertainty in global markets.
The bank reported a substantial decline in provisions, down 22 per cent to
FFr2.74bn. Exceptional charges amounted to FFr80bn against FFr6bn.
Mr Vienot said the provisions reflected charges against loans to small and
medium-sized business, specialist subsidiaries and international credits.
There was a 41 per cent drop in income from financial instruments and
currency transactions during the first half, reflecting declines in interest
rates and a reduction in equity activity.
However, the bank stressed the decline was lower than those of many of its
competitors during the period, and was offset by specialist investment and

FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Telecom Italia's first-half
Dollars 1.4bn eases way for sale

<TEXT>
Telecom Italia, the main asset in Italy's state-owned telecommunications
sector, yesterday reported strong first-half results, easing the way for the
long-awaited privatisation of Stet, its parent company.
Indecision about the telecoms sell-off has cast a pall of uncertainty over
the immediate future of the two companies. Directors of IRI, the state
holding company which controls 65 per cent of Stet, indicated yesterday that
privatisation could take place before the middle of 1995, but the decision
lay with the government.
Telecom Italia made a profit of L2,175bn (Dollars 1.4bn) before tax in the
first half of 1994. However, the results are difficult to compare with
previous figures because the company was only formed earlier this year,
following a merger between Sip, the main telecoms operator, and four other
state telecoms companies. In the first half of 1993, a profit of L991.6bn
was reported by Sip, which accounts for nearly 90 per cent of the new group.
Telecom Italia forecast that further rationalisation would allow the group
to report full-year results 'clearly better' than those of 1993. Telecom
Italia forecast a reinforcement of its balance sheet, and an improvement in
income, which increased to L14,276bn in the first half.
Mr Francesco Chirichigno, managing director of Telecom Italia, said the
results showed it was a force among Italian and international companies.
Telecom Italia and Stet, which owns about 60 per cent of Telecom Italia as
well as other telecoms operations, are quoted on the Milan stock exchange.
In terms of overall market capitalisation they are bigger than Fiat, the
largest private-sector industrial company.
Before Stet can be privatised, the government must establish a regulatory
authority for the sector, and decide how to carry out the sale. Politicians
have talked about a merger between Telecom Italia and Stet, which would
simplify the structure of the telecoms sector, but take time to achieve.
In the first half, Telecom Italia cut financial charges to L757.7bn, against
L1,225bn for Sip in the equivalent period, thanks to a reduction in debt and
lowering of interest rates. Cash flow improved 41 per cent to L6,625bn
compared with the first half of 1993.
Investment spending was L3,680bn which Telecom Italia claims is the highest
in absolute terms in the European telecoms sector.

FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: BPM plunges after provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banca Popolare di Milano, one of Italy's larger retail banks, yesterday
blamed past management errors for exposing the bank to heavily indebted
Italian companies such as Ferruzzi, the large holding company.
Mr Francesco Cesarini, chairman since the spring, said the bank had to
provide for bad credit risks in its first-half accounts, plunging BPM into a
loss of L352bn (Dollars 220m), against profits of L17.7bn in the equivalent
period.
About L429bn was provided against bad loans, compared with L152bn in the
first half of 1993, but Mr Cesarini said this would not affect the solidity
of the bank, or its ability to compete in the overcrowded Italian market.
BPM, which has paid heavily in the last few years following the collapse of
its leasing operations, will concentrate on providing service to 'economic
players of small dimensions,' Mr Cesarini said.
In 1993, BPM had to renounce about L63bn of credits to Ferruzzi-Montedison,
the industrial group which came close to collapse last year, but Mr Cesarini
said the bank had also suffered from its exposure to other indebted Italian
companies.
Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, another of Italy's biggest banks, announced
first-half results yesterday which were affected by the less favourable
market conditions.
Profits reached L90.3bn for the first half, up only L2bn on the equivalent
period, after tax, writedowns, depreciation and provisions of L323bn against
L242bn.

A Dollars 700m plan for restructuring the Czech Republic's petroleum
industry is close to approval by the government, clearing the way for
foreign investment in the sector.
The cabinet is meeting today to discuss the industry following a
recommendation by the council of economic ministers that four international
oil groups, Shell, Conoco, Agip and Total, be allowed to enter negotiations
with the country's two oil refineries. This is something they have been
seeking for more than two years.
The companies were confident yesterday that their proposal, which calls for
splitting refining capacity from the petrochemicals division, would be waved
through.
They have jointly offered to pay Dollars 180m for 49 per cent of the two
refineries, at Litvinov and Kralupy outside Prague, and are committed to a
Dollars 520m five-year investment programme.
Fierce domestic opposition to the proposal has led to several delays in
reaching a decision on the industry's future. Chemapol, the monopoly Czech
importer of Russian oil, on which the country is dependent, has tabled a
rival offer which promises to keep the two divisions together. But the lack
of finance guarantees in its proposal has undermined its attempt to win
control of the industry.
The government originally supported Chemapol's offer, but Mr Vaclav June,
the company's chief executive, became the target of allegations that he was
a secret police informer during the communist era. Senior ministers became
concerned the controversy was damaging the Czech Republic's image abroad.

FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Canal Plus takes 24.9% Vox stake

<TEXT>
Vox, the German satellite television group that went into liquidation in
April, received a lift yesterday when Canal Plus, the French subscription
television group took a 24.9 per cent stake.
Canal Plus has negotiated the same terms as Mr Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation which took a 49.9 per cent stake in the channel in July,
according to sources.
Neither group has paid anything for the stake nor taken on any of the
estimated DM450m (Dollars 290m) debts of the channel since its was launched
at the beginning of last year by Bertelsmann, the large international media
group and other German partners.
Canal Plus and News Corporation will invest in the future of the channel and
make their programming expertise available.
Mr Marc Tessier, Canal Plus executive vice-president for corporate
development said yesterday the company had become an investor in Vox
'because it's a good partnership - Murdoch, Bertelsmann and ourselves'.
Vox, which has to provide news and current affairs as a condition of its
licence, was billed as 'television for university graduates'. The
advertising-financed channel managed to get only an audience share of about
2 per cent although it is available to 73 per cent of the German population
through cable, satellite and by broadcast on terrestrial frequencies.
Canal Plus which runs subscriptions channels in France and with partners in
Spain, Germany and Africa, has never invested in advertising-funded
television. 'We felt that it was worth making an exception in the case of
the German market,' Mr Tessier said.
In spite of the difficulties of the channel, it is believed there were other
potential bidders, including Viacom, owners of MTV Networks and GS Capital
Partners, an investment fund run by the US securities house Goldman Sachs.
Canal Plus had advantages in such a competition. The French group is an
investor with Bertelsmann in Premiere, the German subscription television
channel and in July signed an agreement with Bertelsmann to development
jointly new pay television channels for Germany and other European markets.
After a number of Vox investors pulled out Bertelsmann was left with more
than the 24.9 per cent stake it was allowed to hold because of its other
German TV interests. The stake which has gone to Canal Plus was being held
in trust until a buyer was found.
Mr Tessier emphasised last night that Canal Plus was not holding the shares
on Bertelsmann's behalf.

FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Argentaria in 25% retail
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentaria, the Spanish state-controlled banking corporation which was
partially privatised last year, is to raise its domestic branch network by
about 25 per cent to nearly 2,000 offices with a three-year, Pta35bn
(Dollars 273.4m) plan.
The retail expansion follows Argentaria's failure to take over Banesto, the
troubled bank group which was recapitalised earlier this year and acquired
by Banco Santander in a public auction.
Argentaria has a comparatively low number of domestic outlets. Rival bank
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, BBV, which also bid unsuccessfully for Banesto, has
announced plans to add 250 offices to the 2,900 units of its branch network.
The Argentaria investment is viewed as preparing a growth strategy in
advance of a global share offering, expected next year. Argentaria claims
the expansion will lift its domestic customer base to 6m clients from 5m.
In the course of two offerings last year, the government raised Dollars
2.2bn by reducing public equity in the banking group to just over 50 per
cent. The planned Argentaria Three disposal could place a further 25 per
cent of the state's shareholding on the market.

Lafarge Coppee, the French construction materials group, yesterday announced
net profits of FFr1.04bn (Dollars 190m) for the first half, an increase of
50 per cent compared with the same period in 1993.
The increase was achieved on a rise of 8 per cent in sales to FFr15.4bn and
reflected a strong improvement in many of its business sectors and a
reduction in financial charges. Earnings per share rose by 20 per cent to
FFr13.50.
Lafarge Coppee said the first half saw significant recovery in prices and
margins in the North American market, an improvement in the Spanish market
and increased profitability of its plaster operations in Europe,
underpinning a 38 per cent increase in operating profits to FFr2.01bn.
Performance was further improved by lower financial charges following a
reduction in the company's debts. At the end of June this year, net debts
stood at FFr4bn, compared with FFr5.4bn at the beginning of the year. The
reduction partly reflected net gains of FFr2.1bn from asset sales.
The building materials group revealed a sharp increase in investments for
the first half of the year, increasing expenditure by 22 per cent to
FFr2.36bn.

shareholding venture

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two large Polish banks yesterday announced plans to purchase cross
shareholdings as part of the continuing consolidation of the sector inspired
by the government's bank disposal programme.
Under the agreement, the state-owned PowszechnyBank Kredytowy, based in
Warsaw, is to increase its 8.5 per cent stake in the private Kredyt Bank to
between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of the bank's equity following a new
share issue.
Meanwhile, the Kredyt Bank, founded four years ago, has pledged to buy up to
25 per cent of the PBK's equity when it is privatised.
The PBK which is capitalised at 3,975bn zlotys (Dollars 176m) is Poland's
second largest bank and one of the nine commercial banks hived off from the
central bank in 1989. Two of these have since been privatised and a third,
Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy (BPH), based in Krakow, is to be sold later this
year. The remaining six are to be sold off by the end of 1996.
The PBK said yesterday the move formed 'the basis for establishing a strong
Polish financial group able to compete with foreign banks which are becoming
increasingly active in the domestic market'.
The Kredyt Bank, which floated its shares on the Warsaw stock exchange
earlier this year, is capitalised at 1,011bn zlotys.
The PBK share purchase would come out of a planned new stock issue of
between 3m and 11m shares with the Kredyt Bank's strategic partner pledged
to buy between 1.9m and 4.4m shares.
Kredyt Bank has 11.4m shares priced at 137,000 zlotys each.
After six months of this year the PBK reported a net profit of 1,532.8bn
zlotys on a balance sheet worth 46,602.1bn zlotys while the Kredyt Bank's
net profit reached 81.6bn zlotys on a balance sheet worth 6,304.3bn zlotys.

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft's shares tumbled to another low yesterday as analysts
raised estimates of this year's losses in the face of confusion about the
troubled German company's prospects.
Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the chief executive brought in to stem the losses and
put the engineering, trading and chemical company on a recovery path, denied
rumours that banks no longer supported its recovery plan. He repeated that
an operating profit of at least DM100m (Dollars 64m) was expected next year
and said the recovery programme would be pursued.
The continued drop in the shares brought the closing price to DM118.50 - at
one stage, they slid to DM101 - down DM14.70 on the day. This was a decline
of 11 per cent - the same as Monday. At the start of this month they stood
above DM200.
One source of downward pressure was an estimate by Deutsche Bank Research
putting the loss per share this year at about DM210, implying a total loss
of DM3bn, a rise of more than DM80 on its previous estimate. DB Research
referred to the negative statements emanating from the company in recent
weeks. For next year, it expects a loss of only DM8 a share.
Metallgesellschaft said recently that risk provisions of DM1bn set aside to
cover losses on controversial oil contracts would have to be increased. The
company approached collapse early this year before being rescued by its
creditor banks, chiefly Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank.
Investors have been unsettled by speculation that the company may reduce its
share capital and then make a rights issue. Further restructuring,
especially on the non-ferrous smelting side, is expected by some analysts.
Reports of possible legal action and investigations into the company in the
US are a further source of uncertainty.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps lift Huntleigh 74% to
Pounds 5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Huntleigh Technology, the USM-quoted medical equipment manufacturer,
reported a 74 per cent increase in first half profits following a maiden
six-month contribution from Nesbit Evans.
Gains by the hospital bed manufacturer, acquired for Pounds 11.8m in
November last year, helped lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.03m to Pounds
5.27m in the six months to June 30.
Mr Rolf Schild, chairman, said the subsidiary - renamed Huntleigh Nesbit
Evans Healthcare - contributed about Pounds 1m to operating profits of
Pounds 5.21m (Pounds 2.86m).
The improvement was achieved on sharply increased turnover of Pounds 35.4m
(Pounds 16.3m), with the proportion of UK sales rising from 23 per cent to
50 per cent of the total following the Nesbit Evans deal.
Mr Schild, however, hinted that the full-year results might not show the
same growth.
'With the acquisition of Nesbit Evans, the consolidated profits are likely
to be weighted towards the first half owing to the seasonality of the UK
market,' he warned.
He also sounded a note of caution about overseas operations, particularly in
the US where there had been regulatory delays in winning FDA clearance for
some products.
Huntleigh's new French subsidiary made a loss following its launch late last
year, but Mr Schild said it was performing above initial expectations.
Earnings per share rose from 7.45p to 12.18p, and the board is lifting the
interim dividend to 2.75p (2p).
The shares closed up 5p at 433p.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Early promise comes to nought - A look at a
gloomy pattern emerging in computing services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost half the computing software and services companies floated on the
main market in the past 18 months have seen their share prices decline
precipitously after returning results below expectations.
The latest, McDonnell Information Systems - where the shares fell from 216p
to 112p last week on pre-tax profits Pounds 4m short of analysts' forecasts
 -is especially surprising.
MDIS, 25 years old and a former subsidiary of the US aerospace group
McDonnell Douglas before a leveraged management buy-out two years ago, had
been regarded as an unspectacular, solid performer with niche markets in
police, public sector and banking software.
The flotation in March, valuing MDIS at Pounds 260m, was the largest in the
UK computing services sector this year. Other disappointments have proved to
be Coda, a supplier of international accounting software; Data and Research
Services, which specialises in optical mark recognition; Azlan, a
distributor of networking products; and Clinical Computing, the specialist
in medical software.
Inevitably, the problems experienced by these companies is casting a shadow
on computing services; not a sector the City understands particularly well
in any case.
Their difficulties may also affect the prospects of companies such as
Computer Management Group, a large Anglo-Dutch concern which plans to come
to market next year and which has a similar reputation to MDIS for sound
management and planning.
The market will be watching closely the performance of recently floated
companies such as Quality Software Products, which reports today. It is a
supplier of large-scale banking software where one or two sales can make a
large difference to profitability.
Mr Clay Brendish, chairman of Admiral Computing Group, one of the few UK
computing services companies to improve profitability through the recession,
said: 'This hurts the industry because computing services is many industries
in one'.
The lumping together of many different kinds of activities - from software
development to computer maintenance - in the single category is part of the
problem.
Each of the companies had different reasons for its failure to perform to
expectations. MDIS failed to sell more copies of a highly priced banking
software product; Coda saw a decline in popularity of the computers on which
its software runs; DRS and Clinical Computing experienced delays in orders
caused by circumstances outside their control; Azlan, which issued a profits
warning in June, said buying patterns had changed.
None of this cuts any ice with Mr Richard Holway, publisher of a newsletter*
which reports the financial performance of the UK computing services
industry. Pointing out that some of the more rarefied issues such as
Division, a supplier of virtual reality, and Phonelink, an on-line
information service, could rightly be regarded as speculative, he goes on:
'The real shocks have come from companies with previously sound
performances.'
Of all the computing services companies to come to market in the past
decade, only 4 per cent have not suffered a reversal. Five per cent have
gone broke, 57 per cent have made a loss at some time and 34 per cent have
experienced reduced profits before tax.
Mr Holway makes two points:
The quality of earnings for software and services companies is not as sound
as they would have people believe. Mr Martin Read, managing director of
Logica, has emphasised the importance of repeatable revenues in improving
the quality of a company's earnings. MDIS, DRS and Clinical Computing,
however, proved to be heavily dependent on orders that failed to
materialise.
The forecasting skills of software and services companies leave much to be
desired. A competent company should be able to forecast its performance for
the following three months with reasonable accuracy. Yet Mr Jerry Causley,
MDIS chairman has said he believed until the beginning of September that he
would make his target for the year.
Are trading problems, which companies know about or suspect, being ignored
or brushed over in the haste to complete a listing? Some recently floated
companies say the way their brokers handled their flotation was 'a
shambles'. Mr Holway snaps: 'The issues should have been delayed or
investors warned. They were not'.
The beneficiaries, inevitably, are venture capitalists, company directors
who sold shares and the brokers themselves. The losers are small investors
and the industry's credibility.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Brixton Estate up at Pounds 16.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Improvements in rental income helped Brixton Estate turn in a 26 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to end June, up from Pounds
13m to Pounds 16.4m.
'The letting market picked up over the summer but has been especially strong
in the last six to eight weeks,' said Mr Terence Nagle, managing director.
'We are seeing demand from industrial companies who have suddenly found
themselves short of space.'
Brixton has let 400,000 sq ft of office and industrial space since January
and is negotiating on a further 160,000 sq ft.
If these negotiations are completed, the proportion of empty space in
Brixton's portfolio will fall from 7.5 per cent at the end of the last
financial year to 5.5 per cent.
However there was no sign of widespread increase in rents even though
vacancy rates were falling.
Net rental income increased from Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 33.2m in the six
months, reflecting additional lettings and acquisitions. Brixton spent
Pounds 50m acquiring properties during the period, bringing its outlay on
acquisitions to Pounds 123m since its Pounds 100m rights issue in May 1993.
The average yield on acquired properties is 10.7 per cent, well above the
long-term cost of funds.
The company had been buying office and industrial property, concentrating on
London and the western half of the home counties.
In addition to acquisitions, work is about to start on the speculative
redevelopment of 136,000 sq ft in Birmingham and 69,000 sq ft of industrial
space in Woking.
Net interest costs were higher at Pounds 15.8m (Pounds 13.8m), although
interest capitalised on developments amounted to only Pounds 2.14m against
Pounds 4.46m last time. Administration expenses were Pounds 1.44m (Pounds
1.6m).
Earnings per share were 5.47p - or 5.28p excluding a Pounds 442,000 profit
on the sale of properties - against 5.5p. The interim dividend is increased
from 2.825p to 2.95p.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
My Kinda Town, the American theme restaurant owner and operator, achieved
annual results marginally ahead of flotation forecasts.
The company was incorporated on January 20 and commenced trading on May 9,
prior to its flotation on May 10.
Pro forma results for the year to July 3 show pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.93m against a forecast of Pounds 1.9m. In the period from January 20 to
July 3 pre-tax profits stood at Pounds 210,000. Turnover for the year
totalled Pounds 23m while sales in the January to July period reached Pounds
3.5m. Earnings per share came out at 0.53p for the full year.
As stated in the placing document, a dividend is not being proposed although
an interim dividend is expected in respect of the six months to January 1
1995.
MKT operates 31 restaurants and bars in nine countries. It was formed in
1977 with the opening of The Chicago Pizza Pie Factory followed by the
Chicago Rib Shack, Henry J Beans and Chicago Meatpackers.
Mr Stuart McDonald, chairman, said MKT had continued its expansion by
opening Henry J Bean's franchises in Buenos Aires and Bangkok. Construction
had also started on a Chicago Meatpacker in Frankfurt and a Henry J Beans in
Cologne.
The group was founded by American entrepreneur Mr Bob Payton, who was killed
in a car accident in July.
The shares, issued at 10p, closed unchanged yesterday at 13 3/4 p.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Eastern Electricity in Pounds 160m power
plant order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Electricity has ordered a Pounds 160m gas-fired power station for
King's Lynn, Norfolk, in one of three moves announced yesterday which, it
said, underlined its strategy of becoming a leading independent electricity
generator.
The company is spending Pounds 10m to take full ownership of the 360MW
Peterborough power plant, of which it already has 50 per cent. It has also
reached agreement to buy part of the output of the Schooner gas field in the
North Sea.
The investments in the 340MW King's Lynn station, which it will wholly own,
and the Peterborough plant will give Eastern about 2 per cent of the
electricity generation market. The projects could take gearing to about 30
per cent in 1995-96, although this may vary depending on how Eastern
finances them. The company is currently cash neutral.
Eastern said yesterday that following completion of the King's Lynn station
at the end of 1996, the gross assets of its generation division would be
about Pounds 450m.
It expects King's Lynn and Peterborough to contribute about Pounds 40m to
pre-tax profits in 1997. Last year it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 177m.
The King's Lynn project is a further disappointment for the coal industry
following an announcement last week by a group of companies, including
Midlands Electricity, that they are building a 750MW power station on
Humberside.
The King's Lynn power station, to be built by Siemens, is likely to displace
about 1m tonnes of coal a year.
Mr Doug Swinden, group strategy director, said that the project would
provide a good return on the investment even if the price in the electricity
wholesale pool were to remain at current levels.
The peak effect of the station on group gearing would be 12 per cent in
1995-96 and this would then fall because of the station's cash generation.
The acquisition of 50 per cent of Peterborough from Hawker Siddeley
Management, a BTR subsidiary, will bring Pounds 175m of non-recourse debt on
to the group's balance sheet. It will increase gearing by 21 percentage
points in 1994-95.
Peterborough made operating profits of Pounds 3.9m and pre-tax profits of
Pounds 840,000 in the six months to March after starting full operation in
December.
Eastern expects to buy about Pounds 200m of gas from the Schooner field from
Shell and Esso over the nine years from the autumn 1996.

<TEXT>
Alexon, the womenswear group, reduced pre-tax losses in the 26 weeks to July
30 from Pounds 9.98m to Pounds 2.21m as the corrective measures initiated by
Mr John Osborn, brought in as chief executive after the departure of the
previous management in April 1993, began to have an effect.
At the operating level and before exceptionals, losses were cut to Pounds
1.86m (Pounds 4.71m).
Mr Mike Jones, finance director, said the Dash brand had been brought back
to 'a more profitable core' and the badly performing Dash concessions had
been closed.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: ICG meets flotation forecasts with Pounds
9.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intermediate Capital Group, the specialist lender of mezzanine finance,
reported first-half pre-tax profits up 60 per cent at Pounds 9.7m, in line
with expectations at the time it floated in June.
Earnings per share were 13.8p, up 59 per cent on the pro forma figures for
the six months to July 31 1993.
Mr James Odgers, managing director, said the companies in which ICG had
invested were performing strongly. The group had made Pounds 50m of new
loans in the first half in the UK, France, Italy and Sweden.
Some Pounds 36.5m of these loans were on ICG's own balance sheet with the
balance taken up by clients for whom the group is managing funds.
After loan repayments, there was a net increase in lending of 7 per cent.
ICG lends to unquoted companies and takes an equity stake or right to an
equity option. It receives net interest and dividends, which it describes as
its core income, and which in the first half rose by 7 per cent to Pounds
4.5m.
It also realises some of the capital gains it makes on shares in investments
that float. Profits from this were Pounds 5.5m from five flotations and one
trade sale.
ICG said the rate of increase in profits was beneficially affected by the
high level of capital gains and was not representative of the increase
likely for the full year.
ICG's share price has hardly moved from its flotation price of 225p. 'This
is not a stock for the short term or the unsophisticated,' said Mr Odgers.
'We think we had a very good start and are gradually talking to our investor
base - but the passage of time is as important as talk.'
A 3.75p dividend is declared.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Sharelink price drops after warning on
interim losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Sharelink Investment Services, the telephone based stockbroker
floated last July, fell by more than 38 per cent yesterday after the company
warned of losses at the interim stage.
Shares in the Birmingham-based company fell by 51p to close at 187p after
Sharelink announced it expected pre-tax losses of about Pounds 500,000 for
the six months to September 30.
Mr David Jones, chief executive, said low market volumes had caused
Sharelink to trade 'at below break even' in the first four months although
trading had improved in August.
Sharelink warned in January that earnings could suffer if the decline in UK
equity market trading volumes persisted.
Mr Jones also pointed to expenditure of Pounds 700,000 on development
projects, such as the MarketMaster service launched yesterday, which would
benefit Sharelink's product profile by.
Total investment in the first six months reached Pounds 1.25m.
Even with depressed volumes, operating profits were expected to be about
Pounds 200,000 at the interim stage, Mr Jones said. In its first figures
after coming to the market, Sharelink announced interim pre-tax profits of
Pounds 3.68m (Pounds 785,000), inflated by Pounds 1.47m from handling part
of the government sale of BT shares.
Mr Jones said yesterday that the board remained positive about prospects for
the full year, as revenues in the second half were traditionally stronger
than in the first.
The company intended to maintain an interim dividend of 3p and, in the
absence of unforeseen circumstances, to recommend an unchanged final of 6p.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Dorling Kindersley slips to Pounds 9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dorling Kindersley Holdings, the publisher of highly illustrated reference
books, expects a 'reasonable contribution' to group profits this year from
its new generation of multimedia products.
The group is this week launching five CD-ROM products - which combine words,
pictures and text on personal computers - at recommended prices ranging from
Pounds 49-Pounds 99 in the UK and Dollars 60-Dollars 130 (about Pounds
40-Pounds 80) in the US. Titles include The Ultimate Human Body and
Incredible Cross-Sections.
Mr Peter Gill, finance director, said profitability would depend partly on
whether prices were held at this level - particularly in the US, where
earlier multimedia products had been discounted.
DK reported a 6.3 per cent drop in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 9.65m to
Pounds 9.04m, in the year to June 30, in spite of increasing sales by 23 per
cent to Pounds 107m (Pounds 87.4m).
The group blamed the shortfall on investment in new businesses, distribution
problems and a slower than expected take-off by DK Education, which supplies
kits to schools.
Mr Peter Kindersley, chairman and chief executive, said the UK bookshop
market was flat and the situation was not being helped by uncertainty over
the future of the Net Book Agreement, which allows publishing groups to set
minimum prices.
DK said it was disappointed by the proposed withdrawal of the publisher
Hodder Headline from the NBA, as it believed the agreement's abandonment
would result in the closure of smaller, independent bookshops and the
availability of fewer titles. Mr Gill said: 'If there is a snowballing
effect with other publishers joining Hodder, then there may be an impact.'
DK Adult division increased sales by 23 per ent to Pounds 62m, representing
58 per cent of total turnover. Best-selling titles were on sex, gardening
and pasta. DK Children's division increased sales by 19 per cent to Pounds
31.7m, comprising 30 per cent of total turnover.
Earnings per share fell 15 per cent to 8.4p (9.9p). A proposed final
dividend of 2.2p maintains the total at 3.3p.
COMMENT
The quality of DK's products continues to dazzle, but uncertainties cloud
aspects of its markets. Although the UK now accounts for only 25 per cent of
group sales, the break-up of the NBA would not be welcomed by a publisher
which enjoys premium prices. Investment in multimedia is one reason why
administrative expenses jumped from Pounds 19m to Pounds 25m, but it is much
harder to estimate the profits potential of the new CD-ROM products - not
least until the extent of retail discounting is established. Having sorted
out last year's distribution problems should help forecast profits reach
nearly Pounds 12m in the current year. That puts the shares, up 2p to 299p
yesterday, on a prospective multiple of 28 - nearly double the market
average. The rating reflects the premium which investors are prepared to pay
for a stake in the new information revolution, but leaves no room for
disappointment.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Mucklow improves to Pounds 10.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tentative revival in the UK property market helped A&amp;J Mucklow Group, to
a 4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 9.67m to Pounds 10.1m, for
the year to June 30.
Mr Albert Mucklow, chairman of the property development and investment
company, cautioned that the recovery in both rental income and capital
values was 'slow and patchy,' and unlikely to show through to group profits
for some time. 'The ball is still in the tenants' court. But rents have
stopped falling now, and we are beginning to see the start of some
recovery.'
Rental income and turnover edged forward to Pounds 20.53m (Pounds 20.12m).
But some of the positive signals seen at the interim results stage had faded
in the second half. Evidence of this was seen in the group's industrial
vacancy levels, the 245,000 sq ft decline in the first half falling to
27,000 sq ft during the second half. However, the overall industrial vacancy
level dropped nearly 300,000 sq ft to 1.48m over the year.
Mr Mucklow said that starts on two new projects - a 48,000 sq ft factory and
office block and a smaller office development in Birmingham  - had been
made. 'We wouldn't have started unless we were confident that the market is
improving,' he insisted. He added that the West Midlands commercial property
market seemed to be in a healthier state than the southern regions.
Mucklow had also acquired two new properties, at a cost of Pounds 4.33m,
since the year-end. One is a 6,200 sq ft partially let office building in
Birmingham, the other a 135,000 sq ft industrial estate in Mitcham, Surrey.
A review of the company's portfolio had resulted in a valuation marginally
up on the previous year at Pounds 221m. Earnings per share rose from 6.42p
to 7.53p, while the net asset value advanced from 144p to 157p. The final
dividend is 3.2346p for a total of 6.286p (6.103p). The shares fell 12.5p to
146.5p.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Recovery continues at Sears with 38% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sears yesterday announced a 38 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits,
confirming the recovery that began more than a year ago at the retailing
group, which includes such names as Selfridges and Dolcis.
For the six months to July 31 profits rose from Pounds 38.9m to Pounds 53.8m
on sales 4 per cent higher at Pounds 949.6m.
Mr Liam Strong, chief executive, who has led the group away from interim
losses in 1992 of Pounds 97m, said the improvement reflected Sears' ability
to get 'more pounds of profit for every pound of sales'.
The company dismissed suggestions that it would not be able to maintain such
momentum in the longer term. 'Sears is still very much in the process of
upgrading its retail skills,' it said.
Sears compares itself with Marks and Spencer, which operates in many of the
same markets but achieves higher margins. 'Their trading margin last year
was 13 per cent and ours was 6 per cent,' the company said. 'We reckon there
is still some way to go.'
The profits improvement was helped by strong growth in underlying sales.
Like-for-like retail sales were almost 5 per cent up. The trend continued in
the second half with like-for-like sales in the first seven weeks about 7
per cent ahead.
Sears enjoyed strong interim profits growth in all divisions, with the
exception of its children's wear business, the Olympus sports shops on the
high street, and the shoes joint venture in Germany and the Benelux
countries.
Problems in the two UK businesses left profits from high street fashion 69
per cent down at Pounds 1.5m. The decline masked a substantial improvement
in womenswear, the group said. Recession in Germany left the joint venture
with losses of Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 600,000 profits).
Sears reported its strongest growth in Selfridges, the London department
store, which increased sales by 12 per cent to Pounds 107.7m and profits by
52 per cent to Pounds 9.1m.
Footwear, where Sears claims about 20 per cent of the UK shoe market, showed
a 5.9 per cent like-for-like sales improvement. Sales and profits were
helped by the success of new concepts such as the self-service Shoe Express,
and Shoe City, a large format out-of-town store. Trading profits were 24 per
cent ahead to Pounds 11.2m, on overall sales 3 per cent ahead to Pounds
261.5m.
Cost-cutting helped the Freemans home shopping business lift profits 91 per
cent to Pounds 18m. Excluding one-off charges profits rose by 21 per cent.
The dividend is increased by 5 per cent to 1.05p (1p). Earnings rose to
1.85p (1.45p).

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: GA loses life insurance 'tie' with North of
England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Accident, the composite insurer, is to lose its ability to sell life
insurance products through North of England Building Society from the end of
this week.
The ending of the 'tie' - by which North of England sold GA Life products
through its branch network - is a result of the society's merger with
Northern Rock Building Society, which will create the tenth largest society.
Northern Rock is tied to Legal &amp; General for life insurance products, and
financial services regulation means that the merged society is not allowed
to maintain ties with both insurers.
Though Northern Rock is keeping the relationship with L&amp;G at present, the
move comes against a background of shifting patterns of alliances between
life insurers and societies.
Some of the very largest societies, including Halifax and Nationwide, have
announced plans to set up their own life insurance subsidiaries. This should
give them more control over the products sold, and should also be more
profitable than merely taking commission from a life company.
Some insurers also think the relationships must change. Mr Bill Jack,
general manager of GA Life, said earlier this year that greater transparency
should be introduced. Ties between life insurers and banks and societies had
not sufficiently benefited customers in the past, he added.
GA Life said yesterday that it was 'disappointing' to lose the relationship
with North of England, but that it aimed to remain a significant force in
terms of links with societies. It is tied to eight others, though most of
them are smaller than North of England.
Building societies produced about 10 per cent of its business, it said.
GA Life's link with North of England goes back only a year. Before then, the
society had acted as an independent financial adviser, able to sell life and
pensions policies from any product provider.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Lower costs help Britton to Pounds 3.75m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buoyed by lower polymer prices, pre-tax profits at Britton Group, the
packaging company which on June 13 swallowed the larger NMC, jumped from
Pounds 520,000 to Pounds 3.75m in the six months to June 30.
Turnover rose from Pounds 6.39m to Pounds 30m. The shares edged ahead 1p to
153p.
The results this time are essentially those of Britton's UK polythene
subsidiaries - Taco and the now renamed Gelplas.
However, the figures also include 18 days of profits and turnover - Pounds
790,000 and Pounds 6.45m respectively - from NMC, the London-quoted but
US-based folded cartons company.
The acquisition will result in Britton's turnover increasing to about Pounds
200m.
NMC also brought with it some UK polythene packaging subsidiaries - NMC
Security Products, Precision Packaging and NMC Coatings - which are to be
integrated into Britton's polythene division.
While Britton's operating profits jumped to Pounds 3.95m (Pounds 554,000),
on a like-for-like basis they rose 20 per cent.
Operating margins at the continuing businesses rose from 11 to 13.4 per
cent, while the NMC figure was 12.3 per cent. Tonnage volume grew by 9.6 per
cent, helped by a lower average selling price per tonne of Pounds 938
(Pounds 983).
Mr Simon Beart, finance director, said that just as the lower prices had
been passed on to customers, so would the current higher ones. Britton had a
long book of six weeks of polythene supply, he said.
Mr Robin Williams, chief executive, said Taco would concentrate on high
margin areas like feminine hygiene and adult incontinence products, with
less emphasis on nappies. Gelplas makes industrial packaging and
intermediate handling products.
Capital expenditure planned for 1995 is between Pounds 15m and Pounds 18m,
mostly for the US but including Pounds 5m for buildings and the increase of
capacity in the UK operations. Gearing is expected to hold at the current 33
per cent level.
The interim dividend is lifted to 1p (0.6p), payable from earnings of 4.79p
(2.78p).

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Lloyd's agency launches Pounds 30m fund -
Further evidence of shift in character of the market's capital base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellington Underwriting Agencies, the largest managing agency at the Lloyd's
insurance market, yesterday announced plans to launch a Pounds 30m listed
investment company which will supply exclusive support for its seven
syndicates.
The announcement provides further evidence of the shift in the character of
the market's capital base, traditionally supplied by individual Names,
trading with unlimited liability for their losses.
Earlier this week, Hiscox Group, another Lloyd's agency, said it intended to
float Hiscox Dedicated Insurance Fund, and other Lloyd's agencies, including
RJ Kiln, are expected to announce similar plans in the next few weeks.
Unlike the Lloyd's investment trusts floated after Lloyd's raised some
Pounds 800m in corporate capital last year, the new single agency or
'dedicated' vehicles, only support the syndicates of a single agency,
allowing a closer relationship between the investor and the agency's
insurance business.
The new company, Wellington Underwriting, will come to the market by way of
a placing of 30m shares at Pounds 1 each. Wellington intends to raise about
half the money from overseas and is offering US institutions the opportunity
to invest through ADRs.
Other overseas funds could come from Australia, Germany and Switzerland. The
company will supply about Pounds 55m in capacity to Wellington syndicates,
less than 10 per cent of the capacity managed by the agency.
Sponsors to the company are Noble &amp; Company, while the brokers are Greig
Middleton &amp; Company, both of which advised the launch of Premium Trust and
Premium Underwriting at the end of last year.
Alex Brown &amp; Sons are acting as US adviser to the company. Impact Day is
scheduled for the end of October. Investors must make a minimum investment
of Pounds 1,000. The Wellington group itself is buying a Pounds 5m stake.
Mr Anthony Cooper, chief executive of Wellington Underwriting, said that the
pre-emption rights of existing Names would be honoured and that the
development would benefit Names by giving 'additional stability and
secur-ity to the existing capital base'.
Mr Cooper said that Wellington had no plans to create an insurance company,
but the launch of the new fund created a series of long-term options for the
group's development.
Mr Julian Avery, chairman of Wellington Members Agency, added that 'it will
offer (Names) an opportunity to invest directly, and on a limited liability
basis, in Wellington managed syndicates. It could also lead, at some future
date, to a means for traditional unlimited liability Names to transfer their
underwriting to a limited liability basis.'
Hiscox, which announced its flotation plans on Monday, is also planning a
rights issue to raise Pounds 26m in extra capital for the fund, launched
last year after an offer for subscription raised Pounds 11.2m.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: TransTec profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESEWRIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits dipped sharply during the first half at Trans-Tec, the West Midlands
specialist engineering group, and Mr Geoffrey Robinson, chairman, warned
that second-half results would not match last year's.
The announcement yesterday set off a fall of more than 19 per cent in
TransTec's shares. The shares lost 13p to 54p, valuing the company at Pounds
51.7m.
The 46 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.58m to Pounds 3m
checked the fast profits growth that has taken place since the company
emerged from Central &amp; Sherwood, the engineering group controlled in the
late 1980s by Mr Robert Maxwell.
Mr Robinson promised in the second half a 'significant improvement over the
first half' but he added that, 'given the acute downturn in what has
historically been our most profitable segment', it was unlikely to match the
second half of last year.
The most profitable segment has been the control and manufacturing
technology division. Although its turnover rose to Pounds 31.23m from Pounds
21.56m, it turned in a Pounds 41,000 loss against profits of Pounds 3.2m.
TransTec attributed the profits decline to 'an absence of new orders from
the aerospace sector' and heavy development costs on new products to be
introduced in the second half. Mr Robinson said the dearth of orders from
aerospace customers became apparent in March.
The interim figures were salvaged to some extent by the increase in profits
of the automotive division, the problem area of 1993. Pre-tax profits rose
to Pounds 3.13 from Pounds 1.42m.
Group turnover of Pounds 94.18m compared with Pounds 64.96m. Operating
profits declined to Pounds 3.72m from Pounds 6.05m. On earnings per share
down at 2.5p from 4.5p, TransTec maintains its interim dividend at 1.3p.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Yule Catto up 42% but warns on margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp increase in first half profits at Yule Catto, the chemical and
building products group, was yesterday overshadowed by a warning that rising
raw material prices could hamper future growth.
Although the group saw pre-tax profits increase 42 per cent from Pounds
9.26m to Pounds 13.2m in the six months to June 30, it said margins were
likely to come under pressure following price rises of up to 90 per cent for
some petrochemicals.
'Higher raw material costs are starting to impact on our chemicals business
and we will have to push up prices progressively over the coming months,'
said Mr Alex Walker, chief executive.
Prices for chemicals such as Styrene, used in latex, have increased from
about Pounds 320 a tonne to more than Pounds 500.
The group has tightened cost controls to reduce the effect of higher prices,
but Mr Walker hinted that its speciality chemicals business could see a dip
in the second half.
Profits increased by 29 per cent from Pounds 9.51m to Pounds 12.3m in that
division following contributions from Synthomer Chemie, the German latex
company acquired for Pounds 18.2m last year, and buoyant sales in east Asia,
where it has sizeable adhesive operations.
Increased demand from the construction industry, mainly in continental
Europe, helped the building products division report a 43 per cent increase
in profits to Pounds 2.61m (Pounds 1.83m).
The two divisions helped lift operating profits of continuing operations
from Pounds 10.8m to Pounds 13.8m. Turnover rose 14 per cent to Pounds
160.1m (Pounds 140.6m) including Pounds 3.15m (Pounds 6.73m) from
discontinued operations.
Last September's Pounds 29.7m rights issue, which funded the Synthomer
acquisition, helped reduce net borrowings from Pounds 20.7m to Pounds 6.46m,
equivalent to gearing of 10.4 per cent.
Earnings per share, adjusted for the rights, rose from 6.4p to 8p and the
interim dividend is increased to 2.8p (2.5p).
The shares, which fell 9p to 284p earlier this week, regained 8p to close at
292p.
COMMENT
Yule Catto is better equipped than most to cope with costlier raw materials.
It has improved volumes and reduced overheads, mostly through the disposal
earlier this year of its loss-making facades business in the Netherlands.
But it will be difficult to force price increases on unwilling customers.
The only consolation is that all chemical manufacturers are in the same
boat, so market share is unlikely to be affected. If it can contain the cost
rises, full-year profits could reach Pounds 29m. Like most other chemicals
companies, the shares - on a forward multiple of 17 - are at a premium to
the market. Unlike some, however, they look a reasonable if unexciting
prospect.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Ashbourne to raise Pounds 50m via flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ashbourne Holdings, one of Britain's largest nursing home businesses,
yesterday announced plans for a stock market flotation valuing the company
at between Pounds 80m and Pounds 90m.
The company, born out of a management buy-out from Stakis, the hotels and
casino group, aims to wipe out its debts by raising up to Pounds 50m from a
placing and open offer.
Since the buy-out, its ability to expand has been hampered by net borrowings
of Pounds 49m inherited from Stakis, carry-ing interest rates of between 5
per cent and 20 per cent.
If fully taken up, the share issue - sponsored by Charterhouse Bank with
Cazenove acting as brokers - should enable the group to embark on an
ambitious expansion programme.
'Ashbourne has the largest proportion of private patients in the industry
and we want to exploit our market share at new sites,' said Mr Tom Hamilton,
chief executive.
The group, which currently operates 19 nursing homes, is keen to buy
building land around London and develop existing sites acquired before
Stakis sold the business for Pounds 50m.
Further expansion would be funded by up to Pounds 30m of fresh borrowing, of
which between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m has been set aside to build three
new nursing homes next year.
Growing demand for such homes helped lift operating profits from Pounds 4m
to Pounds 5.5m in the 12 months to October 3 last year, and Mr Hamilton said
profits this year should reach Pounds 6m on turnover of about Pounds 23m
(Pounds 21.6m).
'The company has substantial unutilised tax losses which will mean it is
unlikely to pay any mainstream corporation tax before 1997,' he added.
Mr Hamilton declined, however, to say whether the company's institutional
investors - led by Electra Kingsway - had decided to sell their stake as
part of the placing and open offer.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Sycamore's Pounds 1.7m financing deal to
proceed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sycamore, the laboratory, office and garden furniture manufacturer, said the
principal parties had agreed, with some amendments, to go ahead with the
financing package announced in August.
The deal involves the issue of Pounds 1.7m convertible loan stock. Royal
Bank of Scotland and Tufton Capital, a corporate recovery specialist, who
have agreed to subscribe to the new stock, will make the funds available to
Deanes Furniture, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sycamore, which will make
advances to its parent.
Part of the long-term finance will be a secured loan and the balance a
convertible loan which will enable holders to convert into 80 per cent of
the enlarged capital of the company or, in certain circumstances, Deanes.
Shareholders will not be invited to subscribe new capital at this stage.
They will be given the opportunity to subscribe to new shares after the
interim results for the year to March 30 1996 are released.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: AromaScan shares fall sharply to 82p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in AromaScan yesterday fell 14p to 82p, leaving the shares 18 per
cent below their August flotation price. The company, which has developed an
'electronic nose' to detect odours, said it was not aware of any reason for
the fall.
AromaScan is the second NM Rothschild-sponsored flotation to suffer a slide
within the past week. Aerostructures Hamble fell 40 per cent last Wednesday,
after the company issued a negative trading statement.
AromaScan, however, claimed that business was on target and that it had
suffered no operational difficulties.
Brokers said there had been a steady stream of small sellers, plus rumours
that a market maker had built up a large selling position. Turnover on the
day was only 90,950 shares.
The company is developing commercial uses for its odour detection
technology. Investors were warned in the prospectus that 'an investment in
the company involves a higher than normal degree of risk'.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Baltic lifted to Pounds 3.95m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baltic, the specialist finance company, more than doubled pre-tax profits
from Pounds 1.58m to Pounds 3.95m for the six months to June 30.
The results were boosted by Pounds 1.6m from the recovery of debts
previously written off, lower costs associated with the strategy of moving
away from the leasing business, and improvements in margins in non-recourse
financing.
Mr Peter Conroy, finance director, said the company was considering new
sources of profits, including financial services, to replace the declining
leasing portfolio.
Turnover fell 12 per cent to Pounds 8.14m (Pounds 9.29m), although the
decline on continuing operations was just 1 per cent, from Pounds 8.24m.
Basic earnings per share increased from 1.6p to 8.6p; from 1.2p to 7.6p
fully diluted. The dividend rises from 0.5p to 1p.
Improved liquidity enabled Baltic to purchase 3.1m of its shares, resulting
in Pounds 3.4m being returned to shareholders.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: House of Fraser loss deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flotation costs of Pounds 8.5m pushed House of Fraser, the department store
group, deeper into the red at the halfway stage.
The pre-tax loss for the six months to the end of July grew from Pounds
800,000 to Pounds 4.5m, on total sales 7 per cent ahead at Pounds 325.6m
(Pounds 304.7m).
On a like-for-like basis, operating profits were 11 per cent higher at
Pounds 3.4m on a 10 per cent sales increase.
Mr Andrew Jennings, managing director, said the store refurbishment
programme was on schedule, and he was facing the crucial last four months of
the year 'with enthusiasm and confidence'. The shares, 180p at the April
flotation, closed up 4p at 211p.
Operating profits almost doubled to Pounds 7.1m (Pounds 3.6m), boosted by
business rate refunds of Pounds 3.7m. The group expects a further Pounds 2m
of rate refunds this year.
Mr Richard Scott, finance director, said the like-for-like improvement
reflected aggressive marketing and better focusing on more profitable
markets. He described the 10 per cent sales rise as a 'good achievement when
you consider there has been practically no inflation'.
The four stores opened since 1990 had shown a 23 per cent rise in sales,
while the Lakeside Thurrock store was 29 per cent ahead.
A 14 per cent rise in sales of ladies' and men's fashion - a key part of the
group's strategy - was balanced by slow growth in furniture.
The group spent Pounds 3.5m promoting its in-house credit card, lifting the
number of active cardholders from 475,000 to 641,000. Cardholders now
account for 30 per cent of sales, and spent 25 per cent more than the
average customer.
The figures included an Pounds 800,000 gain on a property disposal and
interest payments of Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 3.6m).
A maiden interim dividend of 1.7p has been declared. The loss per share
before exceptional items was 1.2p (0.2p), but excluding exceptionals,
earnings per share were 1.3p (0.1p).
COMMENT
Stripping out exceptionals leaves House of Fraser with a loss of Pounds
500,000 - a flat result, reflected in the level of the dividend which the
City had hoped would be nearer 2.4p. Sales were down in August but started
to improve this month, and the benefit of the refurbishments will show
through in the run-up to Christmas.
However, a 1.2 percentage point improvement in bought-in margins has
disappeared in mark downs, mainly on fashion items, while a discount of 10
per cent on the first purchase with a Frasercard has cost Pounds 3.5m. The
move to maturity of the four stores opened since 1990 is a big factor behind
the improved like-for-like figures. Forecast profits of Pounds 45m for the
full year, rising to Pounds 52m for 1995-96, give forward multiples of 16.5
and just under 14 - a 9 per cent premium to the sector which is high enough.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Fortune Oil back in black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fortune Oil, the oil and gas exploration and production company, could pay
its first dividend soon, after reporting interim results showing a return to
profit.
The group said the recent capital reconstruction had opened the way for
'dividends from future profits' and the board was considering an appropriate
dividend policy. However, a decision on a final pay-out had not been taken.
Fortune announced after-tax profits of Pounds 578,000 for the six months to
June 30 against losses of Pounds 163,000. Turnover jumped from Pounds
226,000 to Pounds 34.1m. Earnings per share were 0.05p (1.63p losses).
Mr Daniel Chiu, chief executive, said he was confident the group would show
a significant improvement this year. Fortune also said the mooring terminal
in Maoming, south China, in which it had a majority stake, would begin
operating some time after November.
Fortune is more than 47 per cent held by Chinese investors.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Acatos Pounds 27m alliance with US
agribusiness group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Acatos &amp; Hutcheson, the edible oil and fat manufacturer, is forming a
strategic relationship with Archer Daniels Midland, the US agribusiness
group which supplies A&amp;H's biggest refinery in London's Docklands.
ADM is injecting Pounds 27m into A&amp;H through buying 9.5m new shares in the
UK group, representing 22.5 per cent of its enlarged equity.
A&amp;H is also forming a 50-50 joint venture with the US group to build and
operate an edible oil refinery and bottling and canning plant beside ADM's
existing oil seed crushing plant at Erith in Kent.
A&amp;H is the biggest supplier of own-label food oils and margarine in the UK,
with about a 30 per market share.
The new investment will enable it to become one of the lowest cost producers
in Europe.
It has long wanted to link with an international company as a step to
expanding beyond the UK, and this is an objective the ADM link would
achieve, said Mr Ian Hutcheson, chairman and chief executive.
ADM is one of the largest agricultural products companies in the world with
165 operating plants.
Some Pounds 14m of the subscription proceeds will be used to pay for A&amp;H's
share of the costs of building the refinery and the bottling and canning
plant and for the redevelopment of A&amp;H's existing facilities to concentrate
hard oil refining at Orchard Place, in London's Docklands. A further Pounds
10m will be used for the construction of the new packing factory at Orchard
Place.
ADM is subscribing for shares at 288p, the level at which they closed before
the deal was first flagged in August.
A&amp;H's shares yesterday closed 1p lower at 289p.
A&amp;H also announced that agreement has been reached for a reconstruction of
the 38 per cent shareholding in the group currently controlled by Acatos
Limited, a private company which owns the shares previously owned by Mr
Hutcheson, his family and other parties.
A&amp;H will acquire the entire share capital of Acatos in exchange for new
shares in the group. After the reconstruction and ADM's subscription, the
Hutcheson family trusts will own 17.7 per cent of the group's enlarged share
equity and Mr Hutcheson will own 8.3 per cent.

FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Halstead advances 14%
</HEADLINE>

James Halstead lifted pre-tax profits and turnover to record levels in the
year to June 30 on the back of improved exports by the core floorcovering
side and solid progress at Driza-Bone, the Australian stockman's coat
company.
The Manchester-based group increased profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 9.9m
(Pounds 8.7m) on turnover up 16 per cent to Pounds 69.1m (Pounds 59.4m).
Mr Stephen Knight, finance director, said that floorcoverings contributed
about two thirds of turnover and 'more than that of profit'. Some Pounds
7.5m, including Pounds 6.5m in the year was spent on vinyl flooring
technology in the Manchester manufacturing base. He said this would lead to
better flexibility to service customer needs, productivity gains, increased
capacity, and new products with different mixes and finishes.
Mr Knight said UK sales had risen 'marginally'. According to its own
research, it had held its 55 per cent market share in homogeneous sheet
vinyl flooring, without entering discount wars. Exports, however, grew by 30
per cent. The group sells to 46 countries, with Europe, and especially
Germany, the strongest markets.
Phoenix, the motorcycle accessories distributor, had turnover of about
Pounds 8m. It added new products to its roster and, said Mr Knight,
benefited from the 'greater number of large bikes bought by middle-aged
riders'. However currency pressures 'torpedoed' profits growth. Conway saw
further decline in its camping products, offset by good demand for security
cabins.
Driza-Bone had a record year with sales of Pounds 7m, of which 30 per cent
were exported.
A final dividend of 4.75p makes a total 15 per cent higher at 7.5p (6.5p).
Earnings grew 11 per cent to 22.5p (20.33p).

FT  28 SEP 94 / ICI and EniChem to float EVC in Amsterdam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
EVC International, a European plastics joint venture between ICI of the UK
and Italy's EniChem, plans to float about 60 per cent of its share capital
on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in a deal likely to value the company at
more than Fl 1bn (Pounds 365m).
The flotation is scheduled to take place in November. EVC is Europe's
biggest maker of polyvinyl chloride with about 19 per cent of the market and
sales last year of Fl 1.9bn.
Half of the flotation proceeds, between Fl 600m and Fl 700m, will represent
the sale of new shares. The other half will be of shares owned by ICI and
EniChem, whose combined stake will fall to about 40 per cent.
ICI will take an exceptional write-down of Pounds 125m as EVC's balance
sheet is restructured. Mr Alan Spall, finance director, said this was
largely a book adjustment as the way in which the accounting for EVC's
assets had changed.
ICI and EniChem will undertake not to sell additional shares until after
EVC's results for 1995 are published in early 1996.
The PVC market, in common with that for other plastics, has been in deep
recession since the end of the 1980s. EVC has made heavy losses since 1991.
The price has recovered to a level last seen in 1991 thanks to higher demand
from the construction and building materials sector, which accounts for 61
per cent of EVC's sales.
EVC is registered in Amsterdam. Its operations are co-ordinated from
Brussels, and it has plants in Germany, Britain, Italy, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland and Austria. Mr Nigel Taylor, finance director, said that
Amsterdam had been chosen for the flotation to underline EVC's pan-European
character.
The flotation will consist of two institutional share offers, for Dutch and
international institutions, as well as a retail share offer in the
Netherlands. SG Warburg Securities and UBS will act as global co-ordinators,
while ING Bank of the Netherlands will handle the Amsterdam listing.
Mr Ettore dell'Isola, chief executive officer, said EVC would use its part
of the proceeds to reduce debt, giving it a debt-to-equity ratio of less
than 30 per cent.

FT  28 SEP 94 / First eurobond for Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lebanon is to launch its first eurobond offering today to help pay for the
rebuilding of a country torn apart by 16 years of civil war. The original
target for the issue of three-year bonds, which bankers say is the first
eurobond to emerge from the Arab world, was Dollars 150m, but it was
increased yesterday to Dollars 300m, the maximum amount authorised by the
Lebanese parliament, because of unexpectedly strong demand from
international investors.
Mr Rafik Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister who was in London yesterday,
said the deal would allow the government to diversify its funding sources.
'We are trying to finance our construction programme through several
sources. This deal opens the door to the international capital markets,' he
said.
The proceeds of the eurobond offering will be used mainly to finance the
building of a ring-road around Beirut. There are also plans to build homes
across the country to encourage people displaced by the 1975-1990 civil war
to leave the capital.
The total cost of Lebanon's reconstruction programme is estimated to be
about Dollars 11bn, to be spent over the next eight to 10 years. The
government intends to finance the programme through the budget, internal
borrowings and bilateral agreements with other countries and international
agencies such as the World Bank.
It has already signed contracts to upgrade Beirut airport and to modernise
telephone, electricity and water systems. Improvements to Lebanon's
infrastructure could revive the tourism industry, which provided about one
quarter of its national income before the civil war.
Merrill Lynch, the US bank which is arranging the offering, reported strong
demand for the bonds from a wide range of investors, including institutions
and rich Lebanese expatriates. The latter are expected to take up one-third
of the issue.
'This is a sign that confidence in the future of Lebanon has returned,' said
Mr Riad Salame, governor of Banque du Liban, the central bank.
Lebanon's foreign debt stands at Dollars 310m which compares with total
foreign assets of Dollars 7bn, of which about half is in gold.
The bonds are expected to be priced to yield about 325 to 350 basis points
over US government bonds. Although there are no immediate plans to launch a
second eurobond, Lebanon is likely to seek a credit rating from
international rating agencies within the next year.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Prudence and pragmatismin German reporting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is just a year since Daimler-Benz decided to break ranks with the German
corporate establishment and seek a Wall Street listing. Now there are
glimmers of a compromise approach to bridging the gulf between Germany and
the rest of the global equity market.
Last year a weakened Daimler-Benz wished to tap the US capital market. It
also aimed to become a truly multinational enterprise, an ambition only
attainable if it broke free of its restrictive legal and accounting base in
Germany.
The group was exploiting a huge wave of US investor interest in foreign
companies. Since 1991 some 370 foreign companies have listed in the US, and
the peak 1993 annual total of 110 is likely to be exceeded this year. These
companies include many emerging markets.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission considers that it has been
flexible in responding to the demand, but it has a formidable rulebook to
impose. Whereas emerging markets with few capital market traditions of their
own have no hang-ups about conforming with US generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP), Germany has its own deep-rooted conventions.
In particular, financial reporting is dominated by the requirements of
creditors, who care little about the profit and loss account but want a
conservative balance sheet while corporate taxes are levied on the basis of
the published accounts, again encourages understatement.
Things have looked up considerably at Daimler since the group reported a
German-style net profit of DM168m (Pounds 69m) for the first half of 1993,
but a US-style net loss of DM949m. Those figures not only emphasised the
group's trading problems but blew the gaffe on the idea that German
accounting techniques are always conservative. In fact, they are used to
smooth out awkward dips; in recessions they are flattering. This year car
production has soared and is likely to be up by 15 per cent, effectively to
full capacity of 585,000 vehicles. First half net profits are unambiguously
positive at DM462m on the German basis and DM369m under US GAAP.
A herd of regulators is attempting to address these problems. The
International Accounting Standards Committee has been promoting its
international standards for more than 20 years, but it is a private sector
body backed by the big auditors and has little direct authority. The
European Union has developed a harmonised framework for Europe, but its
older legislation - in the Fourth company law directive - is now becoming
dated.
More recently the International Organisation of Securities Commissions
(IOSCO) has developed as a network of powerful statutory bodies. It is
working closely with the IASC. But individual national bodies ranging from
the SEC to the German Ministry of Justice are jealously guarding their own
patches.
Thus the Germans continue to promote the 'prudence principle' which
encourages the understatement of asset values and the building of reserves
which can be used to smooth over setbacks. This approach clashes directly
with the provision of accurate information to shareholders about an
enterprise's short-term economic performance. But Daimler-Benz is optimistic
that it can use options within the German Commercial Code to reduce the
differences between the US and German systems.
For the time being a compromise solution to the German problem will apply.
Companies wishing to tap the international markets will prepare global
consolidated statements according to US GAAP (or other international
standards) but non-consolidated statements according to German rules. This
will leave their domestic tax position unaffected, but it will also limit
their potential for paying dividends.
This might lead to confusion, not least for the managers trying to measure
their achievements according to different and conflicting principles. In
practice, though, the domestic statements would probably be largely ignored
even by domestic investors.
Eventually, perhaps, a kind of inverted Gresham's Law of Financial Reporting
would apply: the good financial statements would drive out the bad.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Saudi prince buys 25% of Four Seasons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talaal, the Saudi investor, is expanding his
fast-growing leisure and entertainment interests by paying CDollars 165m
(Pounds 78m) for a 25 per cent stake in Four Seasons Hotels, the
Toronto-based luxury hotel chain.
The prince, who is the largest single shareholder in Citicorp, the biggest
US bank, has also acquired interests over the past two years in the Euro
Disney leisure group, the New York department store Saks Fifth Avenue, and
the San Francisco-based Fairmont hotel chain. Most recently, he joined
Accor, the French hotel group, in an unsuccessful bid to buy the Meridien
luxury hotel chain from Air France.
Accor and the prince were defeated by a rival bid from Forte, the UK hotel
and restaurants group.
Prince Al-Waleed will pay CDollars 22 for each Four Seasons share,
representing a 54 per cent premium on the market price. Although Four
Seasons' operating performance has improved recently, analysts have
expressed concern about its debt exposure.
The prince has also agreed to invest CDollars 100m to acquire or develop
hotels for Four Seasons and its affiliated Regent chain, starting with a
property under development in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.
Mr Charles Henry, a former investment banker recently hired by the prince to
oversee his hotel investments, said yesterday that 'we see long-term value
there which the market wasn't recognising'. Mr Henry said Four Seasons
fitted Prince Al-Waleed's strategy of investing in capital-intensive, global
businesses with strong brand names.
The deal follows a search by Mr Isadore Sharp, Four Seasons' founder and
chairman, for an outside investor with the resources to finance the chain's
future expansion, who would at the same time allow him to plan for
retirement. Mr Roger Garland, Four Seasons' executive vice president, said
the deal would provide liquidity for Mr Sharp's estate, while minimising
disruption in management.
Mr Sharp, who turns 63 next week, will retain 65 per cent of Four Seasons'
voting shares and will continue as chief executive. According to Mr Garland,
Mr Sharp 'has no intention to sell more shares'. Prince Al-Waleed will
appoint two directors to Four Seasons' board, and has a right of first
refusal on Mr Sharp's remaining shares. He also has a 'piggy-back' right to
join Mr Sharp in selling their shares to a third party.
Four Seasons and Regent own or manage 44 hotels and resorts in 19 countries.
Expansion is likely to focus on Europe, the Middle East and Asia. It has 'a
long list of potential opportunities which we'll have to discuss with the
prince,' Mr Garland said.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Tarmac says house sales hit by rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
House sales have halved during the two weeks since UK interest rates rose by
a half percentage point, according to Tarmac, the country's second largest
housebuilder.
Tarmac yesterday announced a nine-fold rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds
2.5m to Pounds 23.1m during the first six months of this year on turnover
down from Pounds 1.3bn to Pounds 1.16bn.
Its share price fell 9 per cent, from 146p to 132 1/2 p, on fears that UK
housing sales, which the company said 'had been patchy over the summer', had
been dented further by the interest rate rise.
Mr Neville Simms, chief executive, said: 'Net reservations after allowing
for cancellations have been running at about 50 to 70 a week since the
interest rate rise, compared with 100 to 150 previously.' It was too early
to tell whether this trend would continue, he said.
The weather had been poor recently and might have deterred some potential
purchasers from visiting show homes, while mortgages and house prices in
relation to earnings remained very cheap.
'The fundamentals are still sound for prospective purchasers. There is
nothing to suggest that this is anything more than a hiatus,' Mr Simms said.
The autumn is the second most important selling period for housebuilders,
after early spring. Tarmac, which had been expected to complete 6,500 to
7,000 house sales this year, said the outcome was likely to be near the
lower figure, 'if not below it'.
Mr Simms said higher margins meant the UK housing division was still likely
to meet its profit forecast for this year.
The company, in spite of plans to increase house construction by 10 per cent
to 15 per cent next year, expected to reduce the proportion of capital
employed in UK housing from 40 per cent in 1988 to 25 per cent by 1996.
Housing profits in the first half rose by 23 per cent from Pounds 15.3m to
Pounds 18.9m in spite of Tarmac's selling 19 per cent fewer homes. The
average price, however, rose from Pounds 78,400 to Pounds 83,900 increasing
operating margins from 6 per cent to 8.7 per cent. UK profits from sand,
gravel, ready mixed concrete and coated stone more than doubled from Pounds
5.7m to Pounds 14.2m helped by higher prices and increased volume sales -
due in part to increased housebuilding by other UK companies.
Profits from UK brick and concrete block sales similarly increased from
Pounds 1m to Pounds 4.5m. Tarmac's US operations moved from a Pounds 1.2m
loss to a Pounds 1.2m profit.
Construction profits, however, declined from Pounds 7.6m to Pounds 6m
reflecting over-capacity in the UK contracting industry.
The company proposed a maintained interim dividend of 3p. Earnings per share
of 1.6p compared with a 0.6p restated loss.
Stockbroker Barclays de Zoete Wedd is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds
105m for this year and Pounds 155m in 1995 after a full-year loss of Pounds
43.1m in 1993.

FT  28 SEP 94 / US bond market dips as Fed holds rates steady
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Reserve indicated yesterday there would be no immediate move
to increase interest rates, despite continuing concern in financial markets
about inflation.
In its traditional elliptical style, the Fed announced that yesterday's
meeting of its policy-setting Federal open market committee had adjourned
after more than four hours of discussions and would make no further
announcement.
Financial market economists said the Fed could still act to tighten monetary
policy before the next FOMC meeting on November 15.
Bond markets, which have shown much more anxiety about the possibility that
inflation might accelerate than either the Fed or the vast majority of
professional economists, fell by about half a point after the Fed declined
to raise its rates. Equity markets remained largely flat.
The Fed has not always announced its interest rate moves. But so far this
year, to make clear it is taking action, the Fed has announced all five of
its increases in short-term interest rates.
When it raised both the discount rate and the Federal funds rate by half a
percentage point last month, it said that was 'expected to be sufficient, at
least for a time, to meet the objective of sustained, non-inflationary
growth'.
Many economists believe the Fed has succeeded in slowing the economy to a
steadier and less inflation-prone pace, but markets have been taken aback in
recent weeks by signs that growth remains strong.
Most alarming to bond investors was the jump in industrial production in
August which took the capacity utilisation rate calculated by the Fed to
84.7 per cent, close to the 85 per cent level at which many economists
believe industry starts to hit production bottlenecks, pushing prices
upwards.
While the Fed's first steps to tighten monetary policy earlier this year
were widely accepted as necessary, its more recent rate rises have provoked
opposition from Democratic members of Congress and business groups. Both
feared that the Fed could kill off the economic recovery by raising interest
rates too much.
New York Comex gold broke Dollars 400 an ounce and surged to a fresh 13 1/2
month high after the committee adjourned. The dollar initially fell against
the yen and the D-Mark, but quickly regained its footing, rising above Y98.0
and DM1.543.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Yeltsin offers upbeat message at US summit: Tension eases
over Bosnian arms embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin opened their fifth summit in 18
months yesterday with mutual proclamations that US-Russian relations had
never been better.
Mr Clinton told a large audience on the sunny south lawns of the White House
that the two countries were now partners not adversaries, adding, 'where we
do disagree, we can discuss our differences in a climate of warm peace, not
cold war'.
Mr Yeltsin was equally upbeat, saying it was 'all the more exciting for the
two countries to join hands'. Perhaps with an eye on his nationalist
opponents at home who have attacked his co-operation with the US, he
described the US as 'a strong partner and not an easy one to deal with -
just like Russia'.
One potential source of disagreement - not only with Russia but also with
Britain and France - was eased when Mr Clinton confirmed that the Bosnian
government had agreed to a delay of four to six months in the lifting of the
United Nations arms embargo against former Yugoslavia.
Bosnian president Alia Izetbegovic told the UN general assembly yesterday
that Bosnia wanted the continued presence over the winter of the UN
peacekeeping force, largely made up of British and French troops. Their
withdrawal would probably have followed the end of the embargo.
Mr Clinton had been under orders from Congress to seek a lifting of the arms
ban, unilaterally if necessary, by October 15 if the Bosnian Serbs refused
to sign the peace plan drawn up by the western contact group, which includes
Russia.
Mr Yeltsin said his reaction would be 'negative, of course' to any move to
rearm the Bosnians, but Mr Clinton was able to say that the question was now
'largely academic'.
The first of the Russian president's two days of talks centred on foreign
and security policy issues. The initial session with Mr Clinton lasted
throughout the morning rather than the planned 30 minutes, with Mr Yeltsin
reporting 'some pluses and some minuses'.
Mr Yeltsin then said at a State Department lunch: 'We do have to take
account of the special interests of our two states.' This was an apparent
reference to US reservations about Russian intervention in Nagorno-Karabakh
which featured prominently in the morning round.
A senior US official acknowledged later that Russia did have legitimate
interests in the enclave, but he added: 'So do the Armenians and the
Azeris.'
Although Mr Yeltsin signed an assortment of trade and investment agreements,
worth over Dollars 1bn (Pounds 630m) in the afternoon, today's talks will be
devoted principally to economic issues. Mr Yeltsin can expect pressure from
the US to quicken the pace of economic reform.
The US has gone to some lengths to create the right mood for this summit.
For the first time, Mr Yeltsin was staying at Blair House, the official
guest house, rather than the Russian Embassy. Yesterday afternoon a White
House ceremony honoured servicemen from both countries killed in the last
war, some recompense, in US eyes, for the exclusion of Russia from the D-Day
celebrations last June.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Italy facing general strike after pensions reform rift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's powerful trades union movement decided last night to call a general
strike after the government ruled out further compromises over pensions
reform and public spending cuts.
At the same time, the government decided to bring forward the presentation
of details of the 1995 budget, originally due tomorrow but likely to be
finalised today. This move demonstrated the determination of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the prime minister, to outflank the unions by presenting the
electorate with an austerity budget which claims to spread sacrifices
fairly.
The budget is seeking to find L48,000bn (Pounds 19.5bn) through spending
cuts and fresh revenues to hold the deficit to L138,000bn - just below 9 per
cent of gross domestic product. Extra revenue through a reform of the
pensions system has been a central issue.
At a final meeting between the government and the heads of the three main
trades confederations last night, the unions claimed the government position
had even hardened. But senior government officials said in advance that the
time for concessions had passed. Union leaders considered a last-minute
compromise unlikely and talked of the inevitability of the long-threatened
action.
The call for a general strike is expected to be put to union members today.
Union officials said yesterday the protest would not be limited to pensions
but to the entire thrust of the 1995 budget.
In three previous meetings over the past two weeks, the rightwing coalition
government has sought to head off a confrontation with the trades union
movement. Mr Berlusconi has already reduced the planned level of cuts in
Italy's generous but deficit-ridden state pensions system. The government
has given ground on plans to reduce the costly rate at which pensions accrue
from 2 per cent a year closer to the European Union norm of 1.5 per cent.
But union leaders are pressing for further changes in the proposals. They
are refusing to accept a suggestion that pensioners should be penalised if
they have made the necessary equivalent of 35 years' contributions but
retire before retirement age.
Measures to freeze inflation adjustments for pensions temporarily are also
opposed, as is a plan to link future increases to the annual projected rate
of inflation. More generally, the unions insist the government has adopted a
short-term approach on budget needs instead of introducing long-term
structural reforms.
The government is gambling on the unions losing public sympathy. It hopes to
avoid a troubled autumn by playing on fears of social instability as well as
concerns for the prospects of what is an increasingly strong industrial
recovery.
But more trades unionists are pensioners than active workers. The government
faces unrest from civil servants who plan a national stoppage on October 13
to protest against stalled pay talks. Also yesterday, local transport
workers began a three-day series of stoppages, starting in the north, to
protest against the failure to renew contracts.

FT  28 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Credit Lyonnais
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Paradoxically the modest scale of Credit Lyonnais' losses reported yesterday
means the state-owned banking group will remain in the mire longer than it
might have done. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, appointed by the government as
chairman of the state-controlled group last year, clearly lost his battle to
post an even bigger figure. This would have allowed him to clear the decks
for the future by forcing the French state to inject even more money.
However, the government appears to have balked at the size of the capital
injection necessary to ensure Credit Lyonnais met European solvency ratio
requirements had even bigger losses been declared. Those believing
governments should not subsidise poorly-run state-owned organisations may
applaud the decision, but it leaves Credit Lyonnais in a desperate plight.
The need for disposals has been made more acute and Mr Peyrelevade, as a
forced seller, will find it even harder to achieve decent prices for his
assets. The year-on-year 3.3 per cent reduction in general and
administrative expenses is a start, but future cuts will have to be more
draconian. A dividend payment remains beyond the horizon and privatisation
somewhere over the rainbow.

FT  28 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Deferred tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK finance directors must feel beleaguered. Last week the Accounting
Standards Board put noses out of joint by tightening up acquisition
accounting. Tomorrow the ASB meets to discuss deferred tax. Though it will
be several months before proposals are published and these will be subject
to consultation, the board is leaning towards scrapping the current 'partial
provisioning' system. If this happened, the reported earnings of some
companies with heavy investment programmes could decline sharply, according
to research published today by brokers Colin Stuart. The snag with partial
provisioning is that it gives finance directors considerable discretion over
what tax charge to report. Deferred tax arises mainly when capital
allowances exceed depreciation, so companies can massage reported earnings
by varying their investment plans. This sits badly with the ASB's drive to
remove opportunities for creative accounting.
But there are also problems with the main alternative 'full provisioning',
under which deferred tax is immediately charged against profits. The actual
payment of tax may be deferred for many years. A tax liability postponed
clearly does not have the same financial impact as one due today.
An attractive option would be to discount a company's deferred tax
liabilities by its cost of capital. Though there would be debate over what
the appropriate cost of capital should be, there would be less discretion
than under partial provisioning. Moreover, if a robust model for discounting
deferred tax liabilities could be developed for deferred tax, it would pave
the way for discounting other liabilities and assets. That would produce
more financially meaningful numbers and be a prize well worth securing.

FT  28 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Sears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The diversity of Sears' interests arguably helps insulate the group from the
full severity of a downturn in individual segments of the retail market.
But, as yesterday's interim results show, the range of the group's
activities also has the unfortunate effect of muffling the impact of
recovery.
The figures showed unequivocal evidence of earnings momentum in at least
three main businesses, namely footwear, mail order and Selfridges. Results
from all three reflected the successful implementation of well thought-out
measures to cut costs, enhance systems and boost sales by revamping store
formats. Elsewhere things went wrong. The two black spots were the Adams
childrenswear chain and the Olympus sports shops. The decline at Olympus can
be blamed on testing conditions in sports footwear, but Adams suffered from
trying to change too much too quickly.
There is much to hope for at Sears. Margins, which were 6 per cent last
year, are still a long way below the 10 per cent which the management
believes is achievable. The rolling out of new formats in footwear and the
Selfridges' revamp will certainly help narrow the gap. But Adams' problems,
the worst of which have now been dealt with, highlight the lack of focus
inherent in so broadly diversified a group. This is especially so within the
loose agglomeration of businesses grouped under the High Street Fashion
heading. Based on consensus forecasts, the group will make pre-tax profits
of Pounds 145m-150m this year, putting the shares on a small premium to the
market. Given that the group's current low tax charge is rising, the rating
looks demanding.

FT  28 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: EVC's plastic problem
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The reasons why ICI and Italy's EniChem eventually want to leave the PVC
industry are easy to fathom. The European sector is mature, hugely cyclical,
and unpleasantly capital intensive. EVC, their joint venture, also has a
record of bleeding red ink. The company has achieved combined pre-tax losses
over the last three years of Fl 827m. That raises the question why anyone
else should pick up shares when the stock is floated.
EVC has its attractions. It moved into the black during the last six months.
Its management believes profits are set to expand rapidly as the group rides
the economic cycle and cuts costs. There is certainly scope for savings. EVC
may be Europe's largest PVC maker, but it is far from the most efficient. If
the new group can grasp the political nettle in Italy where it needs to cut
staff, it can probably achieve its cost reduction targets.
Of more concern is the validity of EVC's growth projections for the PVC
market. Demand for PVC pipes and window-frames - representing about 50 per
cent of the market - looks solid. But health and environmental fears make
the prospects for PVC packaging far more uncertain. These concerns were
heightened this month when the US Environmental Protection Agency published
a new report on the subject. Evian water will no longer be sold in PVC
bottles and other manufacturers look set to follow. Mineral water bottles
may represent just 4 per cent of the west European market, but that is still
substantial given the overall sector may expand at only 1.5 per cent a year.
PVC is a risky product. EVC's price will have to reflect that.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Lobbyists to publish register of clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's top image-makers yesterday moved to polish their tarnished image
by announcing plans to strengthen the regulation of political lobbyists.
In a move that follows mounting controversy over the ways some MPs use
outside interests to supplement their parliamentary salaries, the public
relations industry is to introduce a detailed register of lobbyists and
their clients. Practitioners have made repeated calls for parliament to
regulate lobbying activities.
The industry is following the lead of the Association of Professional
Political Consultants. The association recently published its own code of
conduct for professional lobbyists.
The two organisations behind the latest move - the Public Relations
Consultants' Association and the Institute of Public Relations - yesterday
portrayed it as an attempt to make more information available about the
activities of lobbyists.
Both bodies - which represent practitioners and consultancies, some of whom
work as lobbyists - have added specific guidelines for political consultants
to their general codes of practice.
The initiative comes as a powerful House of Commons committee investigates
MPs' outside interests after newspaper revelations that two MPs were each
ready to put parliamentary questions to ministers in return for a payment of
Pounds 1,000.
The inquiry is expected to dissuade MPs from supplementing their salaries by
being directors or consultants to professional lobbying companies.
The political consultants' body already requires members not to 'place
themselves in a position of potential conflict of interest'.
The new register, which should be operating in eight weeks, will be updated
regularly and be available for not more than Pounds 50.

Some of John Major's ministers seem to have forgotten who helped them get
into office all those years ago. While Labour's shadow minister for national
heritage, Mo Mowlam, recently made time to meet John Perriss, chairman of
the media policy committee of the powerful Institute of Practitioners in
Advertising, Stephen Dorrell, government minister with the same portfolio,
was too busy.
Perriss, a resolute Conservative, is also chairman of Zenith Worldwide
Media, the media-buying arm of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising agency
that originated the slogan 'Labour isn't working'.
Dorrell's civil servants will keep him abreast of the IPA's views. But who
will keep Major informed about the feelings of his supporters?

Is Glaxo about to get a grip on its legendary payouts to top directors?
Over the past two years it has paid or made provisions to pay more than
Pounds 17m to three outgoing directors. The big winner is chairman Sir Paul
Girolami, with Pounds 9.6m in pay, bonuses and pension contributions. Then
come Ernest Mario, former chief executive, with Pounds 5m, and Arthur
Pappas, head of Glaxo's Canadian and Latin American operations until this
year, with more than Pounds 2m.
Today's team members are comparative paupers. Mario's replacement is Sir
Richard Sykes, whose Pounds 930,000 pay package is one third less than
Mario's. The company is yet to name a non-executive chairman - there are
strong indications that the choice will be Sir Colin Corness, chairman of
Redland - at, say, Pounds 100,000 a year.
Even so, if any of the new boys slips off his perch or decides to take early
retirement, Glaxo shareholders deserve to know the potential scale of the
pay-offs before the event, rather than after.

Very interesting that Michael Mates should be the one sent to counteract the
Irish republican propaganda being touted by Gerry Adams in the US.
Mates is a generous man. He it was who gave Asil Nadir, the former Polly
Peck boss currently gracing Scotland Yard's 'Wanted' notice board, a
wristwatch on which was inscribed: 'Don't let the buggers get you down.'
He won't be extending the same gesture to Gerry Adams, that's for sure. For
one thing, what on earth could he have carved on the watch? 'Tempus fugit'
wouldn't have quite the same panache. But 'Permanently yours' might work.

Fun and games at the International Organisation of Consumers Unions' 14th
world congress, currently beavering away at Montpellier, France, under the
title 'Consumers in the global market'.
Edmond Alphandery, French economy minister, graced the meeting with his
presence, giving the opening address at a gathering of 250 consumer
organisations from 80 countries.
The gist of his speech was that successful cross-border trade depends on two
factors: information and the resolution of disputes. 'To reconcile global
free trade with consumer rights, public authorities must push for better
consumer information,' he said.
Right on. Trouble is, Alphandery then announced a press conference - for
French journalists only. The scribes from everywhere else complained -
didn't that rather contradict his speech? Maybe, but tough luck.
Alphandery's staff told them: 'None of you are allowed in.' The French hacks
all meekly trooped off, while their international colleagues fumed.
Ah, the sweet smell of international co-operation.

This time, Lefranc takes umbrage at the centre-right administration's

Nicolas Sarkozy, budget minister - is accused of various sins including
disguising the true condition of the nation's books and glossing over the
escalating debt burden.
Who is Lefranc? All printable suggestions to the usual address.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A puff of white smoke goes up tomorrow as the City of London picks the next
Lord Mayor to follow the much-travelled Sir Paul Newall, the Lehman Brothers
investment banker. The strong favourite is 58-year-old Christopher Walford
of City solicitors Allen &amp; Overy, a partner there since 1972.
Perhaps the more interesting question, however, is who comes next. While a
rough batting order is long established among the Court of 25 aldermen, 12
of whom have not 'passed the chair' at any one time, private circumstances
such as Lloyd's losses - as well as more mysterious factors - can lead to
names dropping by the wayside.
Roger Cork, son of the late Sir Kenneth Cork who was also a Lord Mayor in
his time, seems to have moved up the field, as has John Chalstrey, a surgeon
at Bart's Hospital. Chalstrey is already 63, and hence would have some
priority on age grounds. Richard Nichols, a solicitor, is admitted to the
office of Sheriff today, and also therefore becomes eligible to be Mayor.
If, as it seems, two or three others have been passed over, Sir Peter Levene
moves up the list as a consequence. The nearer he gets, of course, the
trickier life becomes in his current position as chairman and chief
executive of Canary Wharf - the City's arch rival. Then again, he doesn't
have to worry about not picking up his K.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Don't panic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No infectious disease is more evocative of past cataclysms than plague. The
historical resonance of the Black Death, which wiped out one quarter of the
people living in Europe in the mid-14th century, is still strong enough to
give a frisson of alarm in the western world at the news of two outbreaks of
plague in India. Some Indians have more recent memories of plague, as
epidemics continued there until antibiotics became widely available in the
1950s. So the local panic and mass evacuation of the city of Surat is
understandable.
However, in this case, the customary advice issued by the authorities
whenever there is an alarming outbreak of disease - DON'T PANIC - really is
justified. If tetracycline antibiotics are administered as soon as symptoms
appear, they will cure both forms of plague: bubonic (transmitted by fleas
and rodents) and pneumonic (transmitted directly through airborne particles
from the patient's lungs). Fortunately, the Yersinia pestis bacteria that
cause the disease have not developed significant antibiotic resistance.
The most important plague control policy for India is to ensure that
adequate stocks of antibiotics are available to administer to anyone showing
possible symptoms. That means having enough nurses, pharmacists and doctors
 -who must have been vaccinated against plague - on hand to diagnose the
disease and dispense drugs. It is important not to give antibiotics to the
whole population as a preventative measure, because that might encourage
drug-resistant strains of bacteria to evolve.
At the same time, the Indian authorities are right to take robust measures
to stop people spreading infection by fleeing from plague-affected areas.
The traditional policy of isolation can help to contain the disease.
Outside India, there are disconcerting signs of overreaction to the
outbreaks, with several countries introducing heavy-handed airport screening
of travellers arriving from any Indian destination. Although it is sensible
to make sure that all passengers from India are made aware of possible
plague symptoms - and warned to go straight to a doctor if they feel
anything wrong - individual medical checks are not only a waste of time and
resources but also create unnecessary worry.
Conversely people planning to travel to India, whether on business or for
tourism, should not be scared away, unless they were thinking of visiting
the places directly affected by plague.
Many other germs pose a far more serious and immediate threat to health in
India and elsewhere in the world: cholera, dysentery, tuberculosis and
typhoid, for example. The trouble is that their names do not evoke quite the
same dread as the plague. The world must remain on guard against the growing
threat of new and re-emerging infections, without reacting irrationally to
ancient fears.

FT  28 SEP 94 / A consuming interest in China: Big manufacturers of branded
goods are fighting over a potential market of 1.2bn people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We're going to paint Shanghai red,' enthuses a gung-ho Unilever executive,
standing beside a small back-street kiosk covered in red flags advertising
the Anglo-Dutch group's Omo detergent.
As the global soap war reaches China's biggest city, he is battling head to
head with the Ariel and Tide brands of his global rival, Procter &amp; Gamble of
the US. The paler Ariel flags, first raised only a fortnight ago, flutter
above a neighbouring store.
Fighting for flag and shelf space store by store across Shanghai, Unilever
and Procter &amp; Gamble both want to win a dominant position in this important
city.
Their ultimate goal, however, is the country at large, the biggest virgin
territory yet to fall to the makers of internationally branded consumer
goods. Both are pouring in money and people. Unilever alone plans to invest
Dollars 100m (Pounds 64m) a year for the next five years to lift its Chinese
sales from Dollars 200m this year to Dollars 1.5bn by the end of the decade.
'China's top of the list' of Unilever's target emerging economies, says Mr
Morris Tabaksblat, the group's Dutch co-chairman. Its size and
underdevelopment are 'the great attraction to all branders like us', he
says.
Other companies investing heavily in recent years to plant their brands
include Coca-Cola and PepsiCo in soft drinks, Fosters and Miller (part of
Philip Morris) in beer, McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken (part of
PepsiCo) in fast foods, United Biscuits and CPC in foods.
But only the three global giants - Nestle of Switzerland, Procter &amp; Gamble
and Unilever - are likely to have the financial and human resources,
marketing and distribution skills to put a broad portfolio of products into
national distribution. For the companies themselves, success in China is an
important leg in the global race for dominance.
Since China opened its doors to foreign investment in 1979, international
companies have gazed in awe at the potential market of 1.2bn people. It was
not until the late 1980s, however, that they were able to form their first
joint ventures.
For the big three consumer goods producers, the wait has proved worthwhile.
It gave time for China to tackle rural, urban and then financial reform. The
resulting rapid economic growth created a relatively affluent urban
population, eager and able to pay much more for Unilever's Magnum ice cream
bars, Nestle's powdered milk and Procter &amp; Gamble's shampoos than for
inferior local brands.
Money can also be made from less wealthy consumers. Unilever has a joint
venture with the largest toothpaste manufacturer in the world, a
government-owned Shanghai company. The venture, which already produces 550m
tubes of toothpaste a year, has the biggest Chinese brand, Zhongua, with a
16 per cent market share. 'We believe we can reach 300m urban consumers plus
another 300m rural consumers who have access to urban distribution systems,'
says Mr Anton Lenstra, chairman of Unilever China.
The big three have elves challenging financial goals. Nestle, for example,
plans to build sales from SFr200m (Pounds 99m) a year now to SFr1bn within
the next few years.
They are all working through joint ventures with local state-owned companies
and taking larger majority stakes in each successive venture as their
experience grows. Nestle and Unilever, old hands in developing markets,
sought out their Chinese partners on their own. Procter &amp; Gamble, more at
home in developed markets, broke into China with Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong
Kong conglomerate.
Putting together some ventures can be a painstaking process. Nestle
negotiated for 13 years before signing its first deal - a powdered milk
plant in Heilongjiang province (formerly Manchuria). It drew 27 villages
into a milk gathering network, used Swiss experts to teach local agents
animal husbandry and hygiene, and built chilling centres to collect milk
brought in by bicycle, wheelbarrow and on foot. Production of milk powder
and infant formula has risen from 316 tonnes in 1990 to 10,000 this year and
capacity is being tripled.
All three international groups use both their global brands and local ones
to reach a broader market. Unilever's concentrated Omo powder sells for 22
yuan (Pounds 1.63) a kilogramme, and regular Omo for Yn17, while a leading
regional brand acquired last week will sell for about Yn10, in line with
other good domestic brands.
On ice cream, Unilever's prices range from under Yn1 for a Chinese brand ice
lolly to Yn6 for its internationally known Magnum ice cream bar. A machine
operator in one of Unilever's Shanghai plants would have to work for nearly
an hour to earn the money to buy a Magnum.
'We are pricing our products to where the consumer is prepared to pay,' a
foreign businessman says.
One danger is competition from local producers, which will rapidly improve
their own quality to challenge the multinationals. Foreigners argue,
however, that the cost of making higher-standard products will force locals
to charge prices similar to theirs. Furthermore, any competition, whether
from locals or other foreigners, will broaden product ranges and raise
consumer demand for western-quality goods.
Pricing is a relatively simple issue compared with the myriad organisational
problems confronting foreign enterprises. Supplies of raw materials and
packaging can be inadequate, services such as television advertising
production sub-standard, and distribution a nightmare.
It can take three weeks to deliver goods from Shanghai to Beijing - a
distance of 1,000km - using the overburdened transport system. The
government's highly ambitious rail, river and road development plans will
take many years to complete. It will be another three years or so before
foreign freight companies have built up their activities sufficiently to
offer manufacturers effective cross-country distribution.
The nation's wholesaling and retailing system remains heavily dominated by
the state-owned organisations. Entrepreneurs are still small scale and
foreign retailers, new to China, tend to focus on upmarket consumers.
Unilever cannot use, for example, the extensive state-owned toothpaste
distribution system to deliver soap powder into small towns. Until both
distribution tiers function more like a western system, multinationals'
sales efforts will be curtailed.
One critical shortage, however, is of managerial staff. Multinationals have
begun recruiting directly from universities, where educational standards are
high, particularly in languages and sciences. The first business programmes
have begun, but employers still find they must invest heavily in training to
instil western business practices and attitudes.
At least one multinational admits the shortage of white-collar personnel
restricts growth. 'We couldn't grow any faster if we wanted, because of that
one constraint,' says a senior executive.
Workers on the factory floor also need training, especially where using high
technology such as computer controls on state-of-the-art production
equipment. On a more mundane level, Unilever has had to make spitting a
sacking offence in its ice cream factory to curb the Chinese habit. So far
nobody has fallen foul of the measure.
There remain political and economic risks in doing business in China,
including concerns over whether the Beijing government can keep economic
development and provincial governments under control. Brisk inflation and
devaluation could badly distort foreign investors' calculations of local and
imported raw material costs and the selling price needed to cover them.
Multinationals that have a reputation for being cautious and calculating
have set themselves ambitious growth targets. Shareholders will see little
return over the medium term, as the money from profitable ventures is
ploughed back into Chinese investments.
Setbacks are inevitable, given the complexity of the task and the strains on
resources. But the big three have all decided over the last few years to
commit themselves to heavy Chinese investments.
As one foreign businessman says: 'If you wait until the risks in China are
lower, then you will simply be too late.'

FT  28 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Yeltsin's panache
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With characteristic panache, Russia's President Boris Yeltsin has recaptured
the initiative in international affairs with a bold set of proposals for
disarmament and security. In his UN speech on Monday, he called for
strategic disarmament to go beyond the Start-2 treaty, and threw his weight
behind calls for an indefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. He
proposed a new system of guarantees for the security of non-nuclear powers.
Without giving many details, he called for a fresh approach to regional
security, and a new regime of controls for the international arms market. He
wants the five nuclear powers to conclude a treaty that would stop the
production of fissile materials for military use, and ban the reuse of such
materials for making bombs.
Mr Yeltsin is, in effect, hinting to the US that the world might take a few
steps back towards the bipolar system of cold-war times. During the
US-Soviet stand-off, the superpowers - and to a much lesser extent the UK,
France and China - set limits to the behaviour, and above all the arsenals,
of countries within their own sphere of influence. Even at the height of the
cold war, Washington and Moscow co-operated to keep nuclear arms out of
rogue hands. That made for a more predictable world; the idea of returning
to such simplicity is tempting.
Sadly, the certainties of cold-war terror are impossible to recreate.
Nothing will easily change the fact that a dozen rising powers are either on
the brink of acquiring a nuclear capacity or have one already.
But if Russia is ready to play a full part in ensuring that nuclear
proliferation goes no further, that can only be welcome. Up to now, Russia
has taken a softer line than the west with states such as North Korea and
Iran.
It would also be hard to disagree with the argument that even after Start-2,
which leaves the US and Russia with 3,500 nuclear warheads each, there will
be room for further negotiated cuts. But Russia's progress towards
fulfilling its existing arms control obligations will need to be much faster
before its proposals for new reductions can be embraced. So far, Russia has
been much slower than the US in implementing the post-cold war arms accords.
This reflects conservatism on the Russian side, and also some delays in the
disbursement of US funds which were supposed to finance the decommissioning
of Soviet arms  - including the money promised last January to Ukraine.
Russia has been reluctant to let US experts near the heart of its nuclear
programme, although it has accepted offers of US help to remove warheads
from the other ex-Soviet republics. Many Russian arms experts view Start-2
as a bad treaty which locks in US strength. But if Russia's ambition to be
co-sponsor of another world order is to be taken seriously, the least that
other countries can expect is that Moscow should abide by existing promises.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Labour's new economics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'It is time,' Mr Tony Blair said yesterday at the UK Labour party's
conference on new policies for a global economy, 'for a rebirth of the
intellectual basis of left-of-centre economic thinking.' It is by this
standard that his thoughts and those of Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor,
should be judged. What the party needs is not a long list of policies, but
an intellectual framework on which to hang them. That it has. To beat 'the
crude and wasteful individualism' of the Conservatives, the Labour party is
embracing aspects of the social market economy.
Since the Conservatives have hardly found the key to an economic nirvana,
they are vulnerable to a party that offers seemingly relevant ideas. In
elucidating the vision, Mr Brown states that 'new Labour sees modern
economic intervention not as a controlling or directing force, . . . but as
working in partnership with people to make the market economy truly
dynamic'.
The shadow chancellor has embraced theories that 'atomised agents cannot -
acting alone, without active government as a partner - deliver the kinds of
investments that are the true source of dynamism in the modern market
economy'. His aim is to promote 'long-term relations and commitments',
referring specifically to 'the importance of respecting the implicit
contracts between stakeholders if companies and people are to invest
long-term'.
The Labour party's vision means that there is now a clear choice between two
competing approaches to the market economy. It has also jettisoned much
cumbersome baggage. Gone is the commitment to demand expansion as a remedy
for unemployment. Gone is the simplistic commitment to taxing and spending.
In their place come recognition of the constraints imposed by the global
economy and a willingness to build on the improvements in the macro-economic
policy framework of the past two years.
Yet the new model Labour party is not home free. It is far from clear, for
example, whether it is feasible to introduce features of the stakeholder
capitalism of Germany and Japan into the very different circumstances of the
UK. It is also not obvious how helpful success would be, since the
continental European version is showing marked symptoms of the sicknesses
that Labour identifies in the UK: mass unemployment, sluggish economic
growth and excessive public spending on 'rescue', rather than 'renewal'.
To turn the new vision into a credible set of policies for a modern,
market-oriented economy, Labour has still to travel a long way. But the
distance it has gone is remarkable. Listen to the shadow chancellor
announcing that 'the old Labour language - tax, spend-and-borrow,
nationalisation, state-planning, isolationism, full-time jobs for life for
men while women stay at home - are as inappropriate to the demands of the
future as they were to the needs of the past'. This is a new Labour. How
will the party react?

FT  28 SEP 94 / Metal regains its shine: After a long period in the
doldrums, aluminium prices are soaring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Road signs are going missing. So are bridge rails. They could be aluminium,
and sharp price rises in the past six months have made aluminium worth
stealing.
In a sharp turnaround, prompted by production cuts, rising demand and
investment fund interest, aluminium prices have risen 54 per cent since last
November.
Less than a year ago prices were at an all-time low in real terms and the
industry was suffering. Producers worldwide were experiencing heavy
financial losses. More than half the west's aluminium smelters were not even
covering their day-to-day operating costs.
'It seemed that, if the end of the world wasn't going to happen tomorrow, it
would certainly come next week,' said Mr Lloyd O'Carroll, economist at
Reynolds Metals of the US, the world's third largest aluminium group.
The industry's woes were not caused by the recession. Demand for aluminium
has reached record levels every year since 1984, on the back of rapid growth
in the use of cans and foil and steady growth in demand from the
construction industry and transport manufacturing. This continued in Asia
when most of the industrialised world moved into recession.
What took the industry by surprise was a massive rise in aluminium exports
from Russia, following the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991.
Russian aluminium exports to the west tripled in 1991 to 1m tonnes, and rose
to 2m tonnes in both 1992 and 1993. In less than two years the supply of
aluminium in the west had risen by 13 per cent.
Adjusting to the rise in Russian exports has taken three years. Producers
delayed output cuts, initially because they lacked information on the volume
of the new supply, and because they believed the Russian industry could not
survive.
As a result, global stocks increased rapidly - aluminium held in London
Metal Exchange-authorised warehouses across the world climbed to a record
2.5m tonnes, compared with a former average of about 150,000 tonnes. This
glut inevitably pushed prices down. Last November the LME aluminium price
had dropped to Dollars 1,036 a tonne, from Dollars 2,204 in 1989 just before
the Russian export surge.
Since then, aluminium producers have announced plans to cut 1.25m tonnes of
capacity, either permanently or temporarily.
They have been prompted by an unprecedented trade agreement between the
European Union and five of the largest aluminium producing countries,
Australia, Canada, Norway, Russia and the US.
The memorandum of understanding, signed in Brussels in February, identified
a global oversupply of 1.5m-2m tonnes a year, and suggested cuts at that
level for between 18 months and two years to restore the balance of supply
and demand. Russia agreed that if cuts were made in the west, it would cut
output, by 500,000 tonnes a year.
Although Russia and western producers are unlikely to deliver all the cuts
that were hoped for, the deal laid the groundwork for a recovery in the
market.
It attracted the attention of the investment funds, which saw it as the
precursor to a recovery in prices. With bond prices falling and the stock
markets weak, funds began buying aluminium and copper on the LME.
'The funds' intervention was unprecedented and incredible in its size and
volume,' says Mr Roger Scott-Taggart, director of research at Alcan, the
world's second-largest aluminium group. 'It was beautifully timed and their
analysis that the aluminium market was due for a swift recovery spot on.
'People in the industry, peering over the rim of the trenches, didn't
believe there would be a serious recovery this year. But the funds created
that recovery on the back of a much better market balance.'
In the past six months, the rate of growth in industrial demand for
aluminium has risen sharply, led by soaring demand in the US and
earlier-than-expected recoveries in Europe and Japan. During the recession,
the growth in global demand slowed from 3 per cent a year to 1.5 per cent.
Mr O'Carroll of Reynolds suggests that western world aluminium consumption
is set to rise by 7 per cent in 1994 to 16.7m tonnes.
Over the medium term, Mr O'Carroll forecasts that annual growth could reach
3-5 per cent, fuelled by the growing popularity of aluminium beverage cans,
and the shift in the car industry from steel and cast iron to aluminium.
A year ago, producers feared they were not going to survive. Today, they are
a happy crowd. At today's price of more than Dollars 1,600 a tonne, nearly
every smelter in the world can operate profitably.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Small step in the right direction for
pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J A LIVESEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In arguing that the proposed new pensions solvency requirement 'will at
best be useless', Mr H R Wynne-Griffith (Letters, September 24/25) points
out that it is impossible for a company in dire financial straits to pay a
substantial cash injection into a pension fund.
However, a pension fund insolvency is not necessarily a sudden phenomenon,
and the aim of the proposed solvency standard is to ensure that an ongoing
fund remains continually solvent. Members' benefits are then at least
partially protected in the event of the sponsoring employer encountering
dire financial straits.
In the case of Swan Hunter, we are told that the pension fund is nearly 100
per cent fully funded on the new solvency requirement ('Swan Hunter pension
example', September 24/25). Swan Hunter employees reading this alongside
reports that they stand to lose up to 40 per cent of their pensions will
doubtless view the proposed new solvency standard as only a small step in
the right direction.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Weighed down by high-flying image: With production of
executive jets set to end in the UK, Paul Betts examines the industry's
problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exactly 30 years ago, the Hawker Siddeley company delivered its new HS 125
aircraft to its first customer. A small executive jet, designed, the company
said, 'to meet the demands of business houses for the highest standards of
speed and comfort', it became the biggest selling turbine-powered civil
aircraft ever built in the UK.
This month the new American owner of the Hawker family of executive jets,
Raytheon, announced it was moving production of the aircraft from the UK to
Wichita, Kansas.
For Britain, once a leader in the corporate jet field, Raytheon's move marks
the end of a chapter in its aircraft industry, leaving it without a small
jet manufacturing facility. 'The UK's biggest postwar civil aircraft success
story has just become one of the country's biggest-ever aeronautical
embarrassments,' said Flight International, the specialist aviation
magazine, last week.
However, the corporate jet industry is in trouble everywhere, not just in
the UK. Against the backdrop of a recession and heavy industrial
restructuring, it has an image problem: businessmen, and shareholders, see
executive jets as a toy, rather than a tool.
'The business jet has gone from being a symbol of the dynamic, fast-moving,
entrepreneurial corporation to one of corporate privilege and excess,' said
Mr Brian Barents, president of Learjet, the US manufacturer, which is now
part of the Canadian Bombardier industrial group.
This image of self-indulgence has not only deterred company boards from
placing orders for new aircraft, but also prompted governments to target
business jets as a source of additional tax revenues.
In some countries, such as Italy and Venezuela, companies have been
discouraged by high taxation from maintaining their own flight departments.
In the UK, executive jet users have found it increasingly difficult to
persuade tax inspectors that owning, leasing or flying a business aircraft
is a legitimate business expense.
In Japan, tight restrictions on private jet ownership have kept the lid on
the market. There are only about 90 privately owned business jets in the
country, compared with a current fleet of 260 in the UK, 364 in Germany, 492
in France and more than 4,000 in the US.
Another factor that has reduced demand for corporate jets is mergers between
big customers. 'When two big companies get together, they also merge their
separate flying departments into one,' explained a manufacturer.
In addition, companies with large corporate flight departments tend to take
longer to replace their aircraft, or switch to chartering as a more
cost-effective form of business travel.
Mr Gary Hay, head of marketing of Cessna Aircraft, said he found it sobering
to think that 95 per cent of all executive jet sales in the US involved
existing operators. This has created a fiercely competitive market for the
remaining 5 per cent of new business.
In these circumstances, the industry has been forced to step up the pace of
a rationalisation. In the past 18 months, Textron of the US has absorbed
Cessna Aircraft, and Bombardier has taken over Learjet.
This consolidation of the business aircraft industry has mirrored the broad
restructuring in the world aerospace industry. The high cost of developing
new products and the increasingly long lead time for new programmes to break
even in a weak market have driven aircraft manufacturers to forge broad
alliances, and partnerships to spread their risks and expand their
international reach. It has also forced them to choose between the aerospace
activities they could afford to maintain as competitive businesses and those
they had to shed or find joint venture partners to run.
In the UK, the future of the jet manufacturing business has been in doubt
since Raytheon acquired British Aerospace's Chester and Hatfield-based
operations - where the venerable line of 125 business jets was developed and
built. BAe could no longer rely on stretching the already long life of the
125. Rather than invest Dollars 1bn in developing a new business jet with
more range and cabin comfort, BAe decided to sell the business.
At the time of the BAe sale, there appeared to be some signs of improvement
in the market. But these were short lived. 'Beginning in March, all
manufacturers started to see a reduction in sales again,' said Mr Roy
Norris, president of Raytheon Corporate Jets.
'There is simply not enough viable business for seven or eight competing
manufacturers,' said one corporate jet marketing executive. 'There is bound
to be more consolidation, since there is probably room for only three or
four manufacturers.'
This is not a universally held view in the industry. Others believe that
better marketing, rather than consolidation, is the way forward for the
industry. 'It is time to reinvent the whole idea of business aviation,' Mr
Barents said. 'That process starts with ascertaining the needs of current
business aircraft users and delivering quality products that provide
exceptional value to the customer.' In other words, producing better
aircraft at lower operating and acquisition costs.
'Selling cost-effective transportation, as opposed to luxury, is the key to
growth for this industry,' explained another manufacturer, adding that many
companies found it increasingly difficult to justify to their shareholders
the expense of owning an executive jet.
One reason for scepticism over cost-effectiveness may be that executive jets
tend to spend little time flying - unlike large aircraft in commercial
airline use. In Europe, the average is about 15 to 20 minutes a day, or 300
hours a year, according to Mr Michael Riegel, managing director of a new
UK-based venture called JetCo. The company is introducing in Europe a
timeshare concept for corporate aviation, successfully developed in the US
by New York-based Executive Jet Aviation.
Known as fractional ownership, the attraction for companies is it enables
them to invest in a share of an executive jet and enjoy the benefits of
corporate aviation at a fraction of the aircraft's price (anything from
Dollars 1m to Dollars 30m) and at more predictable operating costs.
'A corporate aircraft is an extremely expensive asset with annual operating
costs of Dollars 800,000 to Dollars 1m if you include fixed and variable
costs as well as depreciation,' explained Mr Riegel. 'We think fractional
ownership schemes should help stimulate again demand for business aviation.'
All the main business aircraft manufacturers believe these new timeshare
schemes will help boost future sales. But they do not expect them to provide
the solution to the industry's overall malaise.
The US National Business Aircraft Association is now planning to intensify a
public awareness campaign it launched last year with the slogan 'No plane,
no gain', in an effort to improve the general image of executive jets.
But no recovery is likely before 1996, manufacturers predict, and when it
does occur it will be slow, especially in the US. 'This has traditionally
been a highly cyclical business, but the peaks have steadily become smaller
and the troughs deeper,' said Mr Riegel.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Exclusion of Russia from Nato would
be gross provocation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER OPPENHEIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Boris Fyodorov deserves support for his rebuttal (Letters, September
20) of German defence minister Volker Ruhe's indefensible views on Nato
membership. An extension of Nato up to, but not beyond, the borders of
Russia would be a gross provocation to Russia and inimical to European
security. It is true that, at an earlier stage, European security survived
an analogous provocation in the shape of West Germany's rearmament and entry
into Nato's military structure. But that change did not involve a shift of
Nato's eastern frontier.
The logic of Ruhe's position is that the collapse of communism and the
dismantling of the Warsaw Pact is a pure external retreat by Russia, with no
concomitant internal transformation of its values and ambitions. Some of us,
to the contrary, are impressed by signs of fundamental change in Russia's
political priorities. In particular, the country has shown itself able to
accomplish a significant degree of transition from authoritarianism to
democracy by its own internal volition. That is more than can be said for
Germany, at least in this century.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Vichy casts a shadow: France still refuses to accept shared
responsibility for its past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Revelations that President Francois Mitterrand of France had murky links
with the right wing before, during and after the second world war have sent
the French political class into a buzz of shock and horror. Socialists are
dismayed that this latest blow to the reputation of their one-time leader
will further contaminate their own damaged credibility. But not even his
rightwing critics have crowed too loudly, for no political clan is quite
comfortable when the Vichy era is under discussion.
That is the point of this controversy: it is not what it reveals about the
dubious political debut of Francois Mitterrand, but what it reveals about
the feelings of the French today towards that inglorious chapter of their
history. They still have difficulty facing up to what happened between the
fall of France in 1940 and the liberation of Paris in 1944, when the Vichy
government of Marshal Petain submitted to the Nazi victors.
Every so often old wounds are reopened by a new investigation, and each time
the French react with consternation, as if they had never heard of that
traumatic era. Then the shock dies away, and the unacceptable past is again
buried.
So it is with the new book by Pierre Pean, Une Jeunesse Francaise*. It
provides the fullest account yet of Mitterrand's early career, with many
previously unpublished details. But most of the story has long been known:
that Mitterrand came from a conservative, bourgeois background, and started
his political career far to the right of centre; that before joining the
Resistance he worked for the Petain government, and was awarded the top
Vichy decoration, the 'Francisque'; and that he remained right of centre
after the war.
What is most disturbing about the book is not mainly what it reveals about
Mitterrand then, but what it reveals about Mitterrand now. Pean clears him
of any anti-semitism under Vichy; but it is dismaying that today Mitterrand
should still be pretending that he did not then know about Vichy's
anti-semitic laws, even though they led to the deportation of thousands of
Jews to German extermination camps.
Given his bourgeois, provincial background in the unstable years before the
war, it is not surprising that Mitterrand should have flirted as a young man
with the far right; but the fact that his friends continued to include
people from the far right, not just after the war but into the 1980s, will
reinforce his opponents' conviction that Mitterrand has few political
principles.
Perhaps the bottom line is that the president refuses to accept France's
historical and political responsibility for the debacle of 1940-44. As far
as he is concerned, Vichy was a different regime, and nothing to do with the
republic - in fact, nothing to do with us today. It is as if Vichy were an
accident, without organic origins in French political history, for which no
one was responsible.
It is in such terms that the French have repeatedly refused to accept shared
responsibility for their history. Throughout the political instability of
the 19th century, each succeeding regime was permanently under attack in
terms of its essential legitimacy; and the rightwing tradition which
rejected the legitimacy of republican democracy eventually erupted in the
anti-semitism of the Dreyfus case in 1894, when the Jewish army officer was
falsely accused of spying for Germany.
The Petain regime was no doubt exceptional; it was not an accident. Like the
nationalism of the late 19th century, it was a reaction to humiliating
defeat by the Germans. The French have since tried to exorcise it as
illegitimate; but unless they find some way of accepting collective
responsibility for it, the struggles between rival concepts of political
legitimacy will rage on, threatening instability.
Throughout the 1950s, de Gaulle denounced the illegitimacy of the Fourth
Republic, of which Mitterrand was a leading figure; throughout the 1960s,
Mitterrand denounced the illegitimacy of de Gaulle and the Fifth Republic;
and throughout the past 14 years the Gaullists have denounced the
illegitimacy of President Mitterrand.
This process is gathering momentum once more, in the run-up to next spring's
presidential election. The conservatives ought to win that election easily.
Yet they are split on ancestrally visceral grounds, and could throw it all
away.
If they were to unite behind the candidacy of Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur, he would surely win. But it seems more likely that there will be
up to six rival candidates.
Personal ambition is not the only factor. Jacques Chirac, leader of the
Gaullist party, has been trying and failing to be president since 1981, and
he will not give way now. But the undertow of the Chirac-Balladur struggle
is political legitimacy. Chirac has as few political principles as anyone;
but his claim to legitimacy and the loyalty of his party is that he is an
inheritor of genuine Gaullism, while Balladur is merely a modernising
conservative.
In 1988, Chirac conducted his presidential campaign as farce. He frenziedly
paced up and down, calling on President Mitterrand to come out and fight.
Naturally, Mitterrand waited until Chirac had worn himself out, and then
took him to the cleaners.
Today Chirac is again frenziedly pacing up and down, calling for the
election to begin; once again he is likely to wear himself out - and split
the Gaullist party in two.
This intra-conservative struggle should be interesting and possibly
entertaining. We should remember that its historic roots pass through the
unexorcised trauma of Vichy.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, In the Lex column article on Arjo Wiggins Appleton (September 22)
reference was made to 'the financial weakness of Saint Louis' and the piece
questioned whether that is holding back AWA's industrial progress.
Your question is irrelevant because it is based on a false premise. Far from
being financially weak, Saint Louis has one of the strongest balance sheets
in French industry as you yourself recognised only three weeks ago.
We have gone on record recently to the effect that we have an aggressive
acquisition strategy and a war chest of FFr7bn to fund it.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hanson legacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW ARENDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Cassell's review of the biography of Lord Hanson will clearly
open the debate as to the nature of Hanson's legacy to the British
industrial scene (Book review: 'A deal too far for king of capitalism',
September 22).
Is it not part of that legacy that, to date, Hanson proteges have created
from scratch three highly successful and well-regarded public companies
(Tomkins, Wassall, and TT Group) with a combined market capitalisation of
more than Pounds 3.25bn?
Is that not a testimony to the spirit of entrepreneurial capitalism that
James Hanson and Gordon White have for the past 30 years so brilliantly
represented?

FT  28 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Improved university standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor PETER WATSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The suggestion in your report, 'Universities want watchdog for
standards' (September 26), that there should be a national body to ensure
standards of university teaching and learning are maintained is a very
curious one.
The vice-chancellors who are apparently calling for a new national body are
the very individuals who presumably are responsible for the standards of
their institutions. Second, industry learned long ago that the way to
improve quality or standards is to make individuals responsible for their
own quality and not to impose. Third, the chances of achieving real
consistency of standards across universities would be bureaucratic and
expensive unless, heaven forbid, universities moved towards a system of
national examinations on the model of 'A' levels.
Surely the sensible route is to reinforce universities' sense of their own
responsibility for standards and quality. This would be achieved by ensuring
that universities were funded on the basis of the actual numbers of students
taught. Then, as in the commercial world, they would have the inducement
that if they failed to satisfy their customers they would not only lose
them, but they would also lose revenue.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Spotlight on the World Bank board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr MICHAEL IRWIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Martin Wolf ('Taming the beast of H Street', September 26) was right to
question the effectiveness of the World Bank's executive board 'in
supervising the bank's management'.
When I was the director of the bank's health services department in 1989-90,
the board was generally regarded contemptuously by its senior staff. For
example, I remember being at an internal seminar in May 1989 when Robert
Picciotto, then vice-president for corporate planning and budgeting, stated
that often the 'mushroom approach' was taken with the board - 'keep it in
the dark, and feed it garbage'.
The World Bank's executive board is in an unusual position. With the
exception of its American director, all its members receive generous
salaries and benefits direct from the World Bank; and these are always
adjusted according to rises in the bank staff emoluments. Is there any
incentive to control staff salaries when one's own income would be affected?

FT  28 SEP 94 / Arts: Beautiful Thing - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The wave of gay drama currently breaking over London rolls back for the
third time Beautiful Thing, Jonathan Harvey's soft hearted play about gay
awakening on a south London council estate. After rapturous acclaim at the
Bush, then the Donmar, it comes close to hitting the rocks at the Duke of
York's, a colder, less intimate, arena.
The problem is not the play. Harvey has written a light hearted slice of
cockney life with enough carefully set up one-liners to grace a TV sitcom.
The timing is the trouble.
If only Jamie (Zubin Varla) and Ste (Richard Dormer), the teenagers who find
bunking up together a mind blowing experience, could venture to Hampstead to
see Poor Superman, where the realities of the gay scene for 30-pluses are
laid bare, their joy might be dented. This is feel-good theatre for gays,
who roar with approval at an ending happy enough to bring a tear to the eye
of a Mills &amp; Boon reader.
Harvey has a sharp ear for working class dialogue. 'He ain't seen life; he
hasn't even had a holiday', snaps hard pressed mum Sandra trying to warn
Jamie off. 'I hate old people' says Leah, a desperate drop out. 'It's
alright if they're dead.' As the tower block neighbours gently spar and swap
aphorisms we are given an unusually warm picture of inner city life, made
even more glowing by Johanna Town's lighting. Sandra may be an abandoned
single mum; Ste the beaten up son of a drunken father, but they are as
chipper as Tommy Trinder in a war time movie. As the velvet drapes fall at
the end of the first act and Jamie and Ste exchange their first tentative
kiss we enjoy the cosy escapist romance that delighted audiences in the
1950s when Ste would have been Stephanie.
There is nothing to shock in Beautiful Thing and Harvey shows dramatic
insight in making Sandra's lover Tony (Rhys Ifans), the only genuinely
decent person, the fall guy. As a tentative middle-class hippie, he is
heartily despised by Londoners leading real lives.
Varla and Dormer seem too old for their roles but Diane Parish as Leah is a
marvellously drawn self-victim, and Amelda Brown manages to turn Sandra into
a budding Mother Courage, with a sense of humour. Hettie Macdonald directs
deftly and anyone in favour of positive discrimination should enjoy it.
