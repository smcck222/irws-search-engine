FT  25 AUG 94 / Time to go, m' lords: Roland Rudd suggests the upper chamber
of the UK Parliament is ripe for the bin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Viscount Cranborne's appointment last month as leader of the House of Lords
may represent a sense of continuity in the government's eyes - Robert
Cranborne is a member of the Cecil family, which has held high office, off
and on, since the reign of Elizabeth I. But it also underlined what is wrong
with the second chamber of the UK Parliament: those given influence are
determined largely by birth.
No disrespect to Lord Cranborne, who may turn out to be a good leader of the
upper house, but the right of British prime ministers to bring hereditary
peers into cabinet is blatantly undemocratic and should be abolished.
Imagine the outcry in the western world if the descendants of Lenin
inherited the right to sit in a second chamber and were then appointed to
government by President Boris Yeltsin of Russia.
The only difference in the UK is the so-called pedigree of those who owe
their power to their birth. Defenders of the status quo might argue that, by
bestowing this right on aristocrats, Britain is able to pick ministers from
families who have produced leaders for generations. But irrespective of
whether the upper classes make better leaders - an assumption which is
deeply spurious - there is the awkward fact that all aristocratic families
started off as commoners and some as rogues.
There are dukes who owe their right to sit in the Lords to their descent
from mistresses of Charles II, and lords to the fact that their antecedents
financed the British garrison in Ulster in the 17th century. There is a
leitmotiv in all this: money buys class, and money is no guarantee of good
leadership.
This does not mean that the reverse is always true - that the Lords always
makes the wrong decisions because more than half of its members are
hereditary peers. Indeed, it has recently provided a valuable service in
watering down government plans to weaken defendants' right to silence and
blocking changes to the compensation system for criminal injuries.
But the fact that it occasionally, and by accident, does the right thing,
does not in itself justify the House of Lords' existence.
The question then becomes how best to get rid of it? Tony Benn, the veteran
leftwing MP, had an interesting wheeze in the early 1980s. A Labour
government would appoint 1,000 new peers, with excellent proletarian
credentials, who would vote themselves out of existence at the earliest
opportunity.
There was only one problem. How would the new Labour peers differ from the
old ones who, once installed in the splendour of the upper house, have
sought to defend it? The son of the first Viscount Stansgate was unable to
produce a satisfactory answer.
Mr Bruce Grocott, the Labour MP for the Wrekin who has influenced new Labour
leader Mr Tony Blair's thinking on the upper chamber, believes he may have
found a solution. The right of those who have inherited peerages to sit in
the Lords would be abolished. But the institution would remain intact, at
least during the first term of a Labour government.
The attraction of Mr Grocott's idea is that more than 400 of the 1,203
members of the second chamber, who were appointed by politicians, would
survive. So they would have no reason to try to block change and, together
with some hereditary members, could vote through the reform. Furthermore,
the first holders of a hereditary peerage would also still participate in
the Lords' proceedings.
This is a nice refinement to Labour's policy during the early 1980s of
straightforward abolition. It would allow hereditary peers such as Viscount
Whitelaw (former deputy prime minister) and Viscount Tonypandy (a former
House of Commons speaker) to remain in place.
It is not that the Labour party has a particular affinity with the first
holders of hereditary peerages, but it fears anything more ambitious would
be too controversial and would dominate the first year of a Labour
administration.
Such proposals, however, would leave a rump organisation that many Labour
MPs acknowledge would still be undemocratic. Reform of the Lords has long
been discussed but nobody has yet come up with workable proposals. It is not
for nothing that it recently won the Graham Taylor Lifetime Achievement
Award (named after the less-than-successful England football manager) from
civil rights pressure group Charter 88 for the institution that has defied
seemingly insuperable odds and survived.
Surely the lesson is that there is no middle way. Outright abolition is the
only option.

Spotting the succession at any family company is a tricky job, and
particularly so when the company is as secretive as the Paul Raymond
Organisation, which owns a large chunk of Soho's nightlife. However, Raymond
is getting on - he turns 69 this year - and the tragic death of his daughter
Debbie means that there is no obvious heir apparent.
Hence Joe Daniel's appointment as group managing director might give a few
clues about what happens to one of Britain's most profitable private
companies when Raymond eventually heads for the great night club in the sky.
Given that he was managing Barclays Mayfair business centre until a few
weeks ago, Daniel should know his way around the business world of
night-time London.
Not that Raymond seems in need of any help from his bankers. According to
his last report and accounts, he made pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.3m on
turnover of Pounds 29.8m and employed 83 staff.
He might not be the richest man in Britain, but there cannot be many who can
boast of no gearing and Pounds 25.7m of cash in the balance sheet.

Travellers along the information superhighway must still watch out for the
potholes.
When LDDS, a US long-distance telephone company, announced its Dollars 2.5bn
acquisition of WilTel, an advanced fibre-optic operator, reporters keen to
learn more about the deal were given a toll-free number to join in a
telephone conference-call hosted with WilTel's big cheese.
But the first call to the assigned number went unanswered. On redialling, it
produced an engaged tone. After that, nothing. When the conference call
finally started, there was not enough room for everyone who wanted to join
in. Those left out were given the option of either listening to a replay of
the conference later in the afternoon - too late for most newspaper
deadlines - or waiting for a faxed transcript the next day.
Oh bright dawn of a new age.

To lose one Treasury official may be regarded as a misfortune, to lose two .
. . At the beginning of next month, just when all international eyes will be
on Italy's 1995 budget plans, treasury minister Lamberto Dini will be waving
arrivederci to a couple of his lieutenants.
Francesco Giavazzi, who has played a prominent role in recent
privatisations, is returning whence he came two years ago, namely Milan's
private Bocconi University. Meanwhile, Alberto Giovannini, also only in situ
since 1992, plans to chuck in his job as head of the Treasury's
international borrowing division.
He is likewise returning to his former stable, New York's Columbia
University, this time as professor of international business.
The G2, as they are known for their joint work on international monetary
arrangements, go protesting loudly that they have not fallen out with Dini.
But the latter will miss their intellectual clout.
All he needs now is for his director-general Mario Draghi to be wafted
across to his own old job - number two at the Bank of Italy.

They seem to be acting up in the colonies again. Some free spirit has
decided to organise a Monarchy and Australia Conference at the Australian
High Commission next month and not invite anyone from Buckingham Palace,
though it is but a short carriage-ride away.
The conference will concentrate on such weighty themes as 'Monarchy to
Republic: into the symbolic void', 'How I gave up the Monarchy and came to
love the Commonwealth', and 'Rank desire: the imperial underbelly of the
order of Australia'. Professor David Cannadine, that well-known royal
basher, heads a cast of speakers which includes Tom Nairn on 'The Chances
for a Scottish Republic', and the ubiquitous Marina Warner on 'From
Britannia to Lady Di'.
Admittedly, not all of them have a Republican bent and there will no doubt
be a few nods of approval to Sir Robert Menzies, who loyally served the
monarchy as Australian prime minister for 16 years.
The old boy once told the Queen that in his country 'every man, woman and
child who even sees you as a passing glimpse will remember it with joy. In
the words of the 17th century poet: 'I did but see her passing by. But yet I
love her till I die.' '
He must be turning in his grave at the news that the Sir Robert Menzies
Centre for Australian Studies at the University of London is sponsoring the
event.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Remodelling Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's Social Democrats will probably be returned to power in less than a
month. If so, it will be because they have persuaded the electorate of two
things, the first true, the second false: that they are best-placed to
reform the economic model they built and that doing so can be painless.
As recently as 1987, commentators were revising their obituaries of the
Swedish social democratic model. Though leftists had been forced into
retreat elsewhere in Europe, the Social Democrat government in Sweden seemed
to have bucked the trend. They had adapted the country's tried and tested
economic remedies to global competitive pressures without, it seemed, losing
the kinder face that Sweden's capitalism had always displayed. A steep
devaluation of the krona in 1982, followed by fiscal 'austerity' in the
mid-1980s, had delivered a balanced current account, unemployment below 2
per cent, and a budget surplus of over 4 per cent of GDP.
Yet this was only a brief reprieve from the structural reforms on which
Sweden's economic future now depends. As the country emerges from its
deepest recession since the 1930s, its old remedy, a large devaluation in
November 1992, has brought a recovery in the tradeable sector. But it can no
longer carry the rest of the economy on its shoulders.
Market scepticism
The general government deficit is expected to be 11.5 per cent of GDP in
1994, while the stock of public debt, now 93 per cent of GDP, is on an
explosive path. With government spending currently 67 per cent of GDP,
fiscal retrenchment on a large scale is the only way out of Sweden's
difficulties. Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Social Democrats' leader, claims to
understand this. Investors do not believe him. Last week they put enough
pressure on the krona to trigger a surprise increase in interest rates from
the central bank and, at last, a meagre SKr61bn (Pounds 5.1bn) - 4 per cent
of GDP - deficit reduction package from Mr Carlsson.
There are good reasons to share the markets' scepticism about his likely
resolve if he comes to power after the September 18 election. With
unemployment approaching 15 per cent of the labour force, Mr Carlsson knows
that the electorate is in no mood for further austerity. Until last Friday,
the Social Democrats had conspicuously avoided specific commitments to
public spending cuts for precisely this reason. Even the new proposals are
short on expenditure reductions, with the majority of savings to be gained
by a combination of higher taxes and, less credibly, about Skr10bn in
projected reductions in future debt interest payments.
Spending cuts
Lower interest rates are a fanciful expectation as long as Sweden lacks a
government that can credibly promise to do more than nibble at public
spending. Indeed, without such a promise, the economy will be trapped in a
vicious spiral of rising long-term interest rates, followed by rises in
short-term rates to defend the currency. This will add to the effects of
fiscal tightening on domestic demand. But higher interest rates will also
make tightening more urgent, by pushing the debt burden closer to breaking
point.
If Mr Carlsson proves as protective of his public sector constituents in
office as he has been on the campaign trail, the markets' fears can only be
proved right. Yet the Social Democrats have foiled sceptics in the past: in
1982, it was a Social Democrat government which reversed the deficit
spending of the preceding anti-socialist coalition, and later in the decade
introduced sensible tax reforms and significant economic deregulation. They
were able to do this, in part, because the population felt that the ethos of
the Swedish model was safe in their hands, if not the detail.
A similar feeling lies behind the party's longstanding lead in the opinion
polls. The population's trust would be well-founded if an incoming Social
Democrat government used its mandate to explain why the public sector must
be smaller and push through the measures needed to achieve this. In the
hands of Mr Carlsson, such measures might, just might, come without
abandoning the egalitarian spirit of Sweden's past, or its active approach
to the labour market. But come they most certainly must.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Leading Article: England's local shambles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
England's local government commission is about to complete its preliminary
recommendations for shaking up the existing structure of county and district
councils. But it is not too late for the government to call a halt to the
process and avoid what threatens to be a shambles in local government.
Radical institutional reform can only be justified by urgent necessity. Of
no English institutions is that more true than local councils, which have
been chopped and changed almost to death in recent decades. Yet no adequate
justification exists for the proposal to restructure English local
government wholesale, for the second time in 20 years, abolishing a host of
local councils on the one hand while setting up a host of new ones on the
other.
The decision to establish the local government commission was part of the
move to scrap the poll tax in 1990. It was essentially a political ploy to
reduce the humiliation of retreat. The ostensible argument was that a
single-tier local government system would improve accountability and enhance
the links between voters and their councils.
It is no surprise that district councils which stand to gain from the
abolition of county councils are enthusiastic at the prospect. However,
beyond a handful of large cities anomalously subject to county councils, and
a handful of counties - the product of the last reorganisation - enjoying
little local loyalty, there is no evidence of widespread popular demand for
the proposed revolution.
Derisory responses
The reverse is true. Postal referendums conducted by the commission on
proposed reorganisations have yielded derisory responses of little more than
5 per cent. The commission's chief executive claims that such a response
would 'utterly delight any commercial concern'. But that spectacularly
misses the point that reorganisation can only be justified as a response to
strong local demand.
Then there is the cost, highlighted this week by the government's
announcement that all the costs - estimated at about Pounds 1bn - will fall
on localities. Local electors should not be fooled by talk of prospective
savings, or the government's concession that it will allow councils to
borrow for 'unavoidable' costs.
Unlike the transitional costs, the financial benefits are largely
hypothetical, and would certainly be negated by any decision of a future
non-Tory government to establish strategic authorities above existing
district councils. Such a decision is almost inevitable if most county
councils are abolished, since districts are too small to conduct the
strategic planning functions which many on the left believe should be
carried out at sub-national level. If counties are retained, they would be
the obvious building blocks for that task.
Grave weakness
That, in turn, highlights another grave weakness of the commission. Its
remit is to consider boundaries and tiers, not functions. Yet some of the
weaknesses of the present regime could be tackled by a clearer allocation of
functions between existing tiers, and in some cases by a straight transfer
of functions downwards.
Instead of wholesale restructuring, the government should adopt a more
pragmatic approach. Where change is believed to have strong public support -
in Bristol or Humberside, for example - district authorities should be
allowed to hold referendums on divorcing themselves from their county
council. Only if more than 40 per cent of registered voters support such a
change should it go ahead.
That leaves the problem of local democracy, which is indeed in a sorry
state. The solution, however, is not to be found in expensive musical
chairs. It lies in the introduction of measures which render councillors
truly reflective of, and accountable to, their voters.
Two necessary reforms stand out. Proportional representation for council
elections would end local one-party states. And the use of advisory local
referendums would give electors a direct say on local matters of concern to
them, and force their councillors to say why they disagree if they refuse to
follow. In the long term there is also a case for making councils
responsible for raising more of the money that they spend. But a short while
after the abolition of the poll tax is not the time to revisit the local tax
system.

THE HAWKE MEMOIRS
By Bob Hawke
William Heinemann Australia ADollars 49.95 or Pounds 15.99, 640 pages
Hell may have no fury like a woman scorned, but a rejected politician can
make the cauldrons bubble even more furiously.
Quite simply, the reminiscences of Mr Bob Hawke - the Rhodes scholar and
former union leader who became Australia's prime minister in 1983 and held
the job for eight years - are mistitled. Instead of being called The Hawke
Memoirs, which gives an impression of gravitas, something with a vaudeville
flavour, such as Me and My Enemies, would have been more fitting.
For much of the book's 560-odd pages, the butt of its outpourings is Mr Paul
Keating, Australia's current prime minister. Mr Keating finally snatched the
top job from Mr Hawke in late-1991, after having served as treasurer
(finance minister) for most of the Hawke years and following a bruising
battle within the Australian Labor party.
This leadership struggle was brutal even by the standards of Australian
politics, and has been well-documented both on television and in print. But
Mr Hawke clearly felt the true tale had not been told. 'I knew this book
would cause some unhappiness,' he remarked testily when the book had been
panned by almost all Australian commentators last week. 'But the facts have
to be told.'
Well, yes - but not necessarily with such bitterness and nastiness. As his
account rambles through the domestic and international developments his
government confronted in the mid-1980s, Mr Hawke rarely misses an
opportunity to take a swipe at his successor.
Touching, for example, on whether Australia should have allowed the US to
conduct missile tests in the Tasman Sea in 1985 - an issue which had become
more sensitive because of neighbouring New Zealand's brushes with the US
over defence policy - he suddenly sidetracks.
Mr Hawke recalls that while he was taking calls from other prominent Labor
parliamentarians, including the then foreign minister, Bill Hayden, and
defence minister Kim Beazley, Mr Keating telephoned.
'As distinct from those cooler heads, who shared my view (that agreeing to
the US request would put at risk the broad defence agreement between the two
countries), Paul was gung-ho. He recommended a 'take 'em on, we'll beat 'em,
don't back down' approach. Understandably, I took no notice because he was
not expert in foreign affairs and he had no understanding of the (missile)
issue within the broader framework of maintaining party support for the
Australia-US alliance.'
Other attacks are more personal. Mr Keating is enthusiastic about European
antique clocks - a fact often raised by opposition politicians when they
want to play to Australians' dislike of poseurs. But this does not stop Mr
Hawke from weighing in, too: 'French Empire clocks were his fascination; he
had an absolute passion for them, perhaps not unrelated to visceral
republicanism and his tardiness at keeping appointments.
'On a couple of occasions he had me over to his house to explain in loving
detail the esoterics of his numerous clocks. They were handsome objects to
be sure, but I must say I could think of better ways of filling in my time
than polishing them and taking them to pieces and putting them together
again.'
The shame is that, in pursuit of this vendetta, Mr Hawke misses an
opportunity to shed insights into a fascinating period of transformation for
Australia. Only briefly does he comment on the thesis that his Labor party
was lucky to be in office when social democratic thinking was changing
across the western world, and die-hard socialists began to see the virtue of
market mechanisms.
'The necessary changes . . . we had to make in party thinking were made when
we were an effective government. Had we not been in power there is little
doubt that we would have been doomed to a continued irrelevance,' he
suggests.
But rather than exploring this argument, Mr Hawke reverts to personal
aggrandisement. He reduces Australia's reform process to one decision - his,
of course. 'There is one simple and indisputable fact . . . and it is,
arguably, the single most important fact in the history of Australian
politics in the last two decades of this century. If I had not dumped Option
C (the potential introduction of a consumption tax) in 1985, Labor would
have lost the 1987 election. Labor would not have been continuously in power
for 13 years by 1996, and there would have been no prime ministerial mantle
for Paul Keating to seize in 1991.'
Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the book is its stilted language, and
sugary sentimentality. Summing up one early trade union acquaintance, for
example, Mr Hawke writes: 'The private man was one who had a profound
knowledge and love of classical music and a dedication to gardening.'
Another individual's cynicism is described as being 'leavened, however, by a
witty ebullience and an enjoyment in interacting with those around him'.
Time and again, Mr Hawke claims a personal empathy with the Australian
electorate. 'In 1983, as I travelled the length and breadth of the continent
calling for an end to division and a fresh start, I was aware of an enormous
reservoir of goodwill towards me. One of my many public psychoanalysts has
said that I walk everywhere in a warm tropical breeze, as if this was
somehow a bad thing. In fact, I do.'
Judging by local reaction to the book last week, the winds have changed.
Still, the initial print run is one of the largest planned in Australia, so
Mr Hawke should end up a richer man. By all accounts, his next literary
offering will be a form guide to Australian racing - a penchant of Mr
Hawke's which rivals Mr Keating's enthusiasm for clocks. One can only
tremble for the horses that have let him down.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Facts on The Body Shop difficult to
obtain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Gordon Roddick's defence of his company's commitment to social and
ethical issues (Letters: August 24) fails to mention one important element
of The Body Shop's position. His company has a firm policy of no paid
advertising. However, it has been highly successful in promoting itself
through public relations, spending millions of pounds annually.
The Body Shop distinguishes between advertising and PR in this way -
'advertising is you saying you're good, PR is getting someone else to say
it' (Body Shop annual report 1993, page 20). But, more so than advertising,
public relations is difficult to call to account.
New Consumer can only assess action and hard information. We have been
debating disclosure on corporate social responsibility with The Body Shop
for some time and have found great difficulty in obtaining relevant
information.
In September 1993, in a meeting at which Gordon Roddick was present, The
Body Shop confirmed that, while a source/supplier analysis of basic product
ingredients had been initiated, there had, as yet, been no development of an
ethical sourcing policy for such materials, the bulk of these being bought
as commodities on the world market. At that meeting we suggested:
Clear delineation of Trade Not Aid projects as examples of micro-enterprise
income-generation schemes whose presentation to the public would be
substantially reduced, in line with their contribution to the overall
product range.
Analysis of ingredients and other raw material or finished product supplies
to determine source and what was or could be originated in the developing
world. This to be followed by a prioritised programme for applying
appropriate fair trading criteria and recognising areas where no such
possibilities existed at present, and seeking ways to introduce ethical
sourcing in future.
Taking the work involved in the above point to trade suppliers and
processors for their comment and encouraging their involvement and creative
thinking. Stimulating appropriate trade associations to consider these
issues and engaging with other users of similar basic ingredients, including
competitors, in evolving practical schemes for improvement in standards of
sourcing.
We believe that this was and remains a constructive and far from cynical
approach, and we and many other ethical research groups would be reassured
on this subject if The Body Shop had adopted it.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Share options for the not so rich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM HURLSTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I correct the impression given in your column 'Labour names share
option 'millionaires' ' (August 19) that the discretionary options scheme
used for executives is different from that for other employees.
There is a single scheme under the 1984 Finance Act which covers all
employees, whether executives or not. In practice it has been used mainly
for executives and has become popularly known as a result as the 'executive
share option scheme'.
This however is a misnomer and there is a current trend (Wellcome, the
pharmaceuticals group, is an example) towards using the option scheme for
large numbers of employees.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: No mystery lurking behind employment
statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his letter (August 19), John Wells raised concerns about the failure
of the Department of Employment's statistics to show an increase in jobs to
match the fall of 340,000 in claimant unemployment in the last 18 months.
The employment data, derived from employer surveys, have long been subject
to doubts about their reliability.
The Labour Force Survey of households provides an alternative measure of
both employment and unemployment trends. The five most recent quarters of
data available from this source show unemployment has fallen by 260,000 and
employment has risen by 230,000. There is still a discrepancy - albeit a
smaller one - explained by a continuing, but modest, fall in labour force
participation rates for men.
As Mr Wells notes, labour force participation rates fall in recessions, but
should improve in recoveries. However, this process operates with a lag. It
takes time following the beginnings of a recovery for individual discouraged
jobseekers to react to the signs of improvement and begin to re-enter the
active labour force.
Comparing the last two quarters, male labour force participation rates
steadied and the balance between employment growth and unemployment decline
was more equal. If the recovery were to continue and strengthen, labour
force participation rates for men and especially women would begin to rise,
and further falls in unemployment would indeed have to be matched by
significantly greater increases in employment.
It is not clear then from the LFS that anything particularly unusual or
suspicious is happening. Mr Wells is, however, quite right to draw attention
to the unsatisfactory nature of the official employment figures derived from
employers.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Need publicity for existing courses,
not A-level reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HUW MORRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader 'A-levels fail the test of time' (August 22) rightly
identifies the over-specialisation of students at 18 as a cause for concern,
but your suggestions for reform ignore the wealth of qualifications already
available.
At present students in England and Wales can choose between A-levels, NVQs,
GNVQs, the international Baccalaureate and A/S levels. The last two
admirably fulfil the function of the slimmed down A-levels you recommend.
The main problem is not the nature of the courses, it is the lack of
awareness of their existence. A further problem is created by universities'
admissions procedures and employers' selection criteria which may lead to an
inadvertent bias towards students with A-levels.
The time it takes to become familiar with any of the new qualifications and
the volume of applications means admissions tutors and recruiters often fall
back on what they know best, the A-level. As the introduction of GNVQs and
NVQs continues over the next four years, reforming the A-level system would
only add complications. The important message is less time should be spent
finding new solutions and more time should be spent publicising and adapting
to what is available.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Capitalism grew in my courtyard: Leyla Boulton reflects on
the changes that market reforms have brought to Moscow in four years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the four years since I arrived in Moscow, my courtyard has been
transformed by President Boris Yeltsin's market reforms. The children who
used to play in it have been replaced by armed men in bullet-proof vests who
guard a new commercial bank which rents office-space in our building. The
courtyard administrator, who has visibly prospered from the arrangement,
tells complaining residents he would be 'killed' if he tried to remove the
bank. My husband was threatened with a pump-action shotgun after protesting
when a bank security van almost knocked down my mother, who was on a visit.
Complaining about the aptly named Moscow Business World Bank is as useless
as demanding action from the police against the all-night disco adjoining
the courtyard. Nothing happens. A 10-minute walk down the road, at
Paveletsky Station, the driver of the manager of a big car-dealing company
recently had his head blown off by a car-bomb aimed at his boss.
There is no point in complaining, for this free-for-all is capitalism,
Russian-style. Like many Muscovites, I have learnt to live with impotent
indignation at the power of crooks and corrupt officials, and to consider
myself lucky to be healthy and solvent. Less fortunate are the hundreds of
thousands of Muscovites likely to lose their savings in dubious financial
companies like MMM.
Irina Yasina, a friend with her own financial news agency, argues: 'The
country has gone mad . . .Everybody now wants to make money, but only
Russians could play this sort of Russian roulette.'
On the positive side, the queues and shortages at Gastronom number 45, the
local food shop which now calls itself Zamoskvarechiye Supermarket, have
disappeared since the abolition of price controls in January 1992. Thanks to
the liberalisation of imports decreed at the same time, Muscovites today are
far better-dressed than in the Soviet era, and despite (justified) grumbling
at still very high prices, can find whatever they need in the shops and in
the kiosks which have mushroomed in the capital.
There is little that is not for sale in Moscow today. 'Afghan war veterans
available for all manner of security services,' says the advertisement on
the trolleybuses passing my kitchen window.
Thrown into a market at the deep end by the young reformers, led by the
former deputy prime minister, Yegor Gaidar, Russians are shedding
communist-era expectations that the state will 'feed' them from the cradle
to the grave. My friend Sasha, an underpaid army officer who moonlights as a
security guard, says: 'We can rely only on ourselves.'
Deep-rooted prejudices that business is crime and that trade is
'speculation' are proving more persistent - hardly surprising, given that
much of Russian business still operates in an unregulated and illegal
manner. But gone are the days of total ignorance, symbolised by a
middle-aged Russian journalist who, in December 1990, asked the then finance
minister Boris Fyodorov how speculation could be avoided on the country's
first stock exchange. At a seminar for young financial journalists last
winter, the only questions were about how to report financial fraud and
companies like MMM.
Muscovites like Irina Yasina are setting up businesses, in spite of daunting
official red tape and prohibitive taxation. The Moscow Currency Exchange,
established in a Stalinist skyscraper which houses official institutions
such as the Management of Tall Buildings, is manned by youths with mobile
telephones who trade dollars and D-Marks as if they had been doing so all
their lives - even though a western-style currency market has existed in
Russia for little more than than two years.
When I first arrived in Russia in May 1990, the old communist order appeared
as solid as the bronze statue of Lenin, which still stands outside my
courtyard on October Square. Today the statue is nothing more than a
rallying point for nostalgic pro-communist demonstrations by pensioners.
Arrogant officials continue to race around Moscow in official limousines
without regard for speed limits. But apart from the fact that many now ride
in Mercedes rather than ramshackle Volgas, the officials' own significance
has radically altered with the demise of the old state-run economy.
Many former Communist party officials have gone into business. Nikolai
Ryzhkov, Soviet prime minister from 1985-90, is now chairman of a commercial
bank called Tveruniversalbank. Nicknamed the 'weeping Bolshevik' for his
sometimes emotional behaviour, Mr Ryzhkov accelerated the collapse of the
Soviet economy when he and former President Mikhail Gorbachev failed to
proceed with the '500-day plan' for radical market reforms in September
1990.
Then, officials were all-important, both for the reforms they rejected and,
after Mr Yeltsin came to power as master of a newly independent Russia, for
what they changed. I particularly remember Grigory Yavlinsky, a young
reformer brought into government on the eve of the Soviet Union's collapse
in December 1991, complaining about the refusal of 'idiotic' republics to
endorse his proposed economic union - a refusal most now bitterly regret. Or
Boris Fyodorov, expressing fears of an 'economic coup' by old-style
lobbyists who detested his attempts to impose 'ordinary financial
discipline' before his second resignation as finance minister in January
1994.
With inspired young reformers now firmly out of the way, old-style
bureaucrats are defensively reasserting old secretive methods of conducting
official business. President Yeltsin himself pointed out that many officials
had become as remote as in the old days.
This remoteness was underlined by a remark by his own spokesman, Mr
Vyacheslav Kostikov, at a Moscow reception. Before Mr Alexander Livshits,
the president's economic adviser, could answer a question on why the
government had failed to keep a promise to scrap quotas on oil exports on
July 1, Mr Kostikov blurted out: 'I think it is better if he doesn't answer
that question. We are here to relax.' This long-promised foreign trade
reform would have increased tax revenues and removed a big source of
corruption.
The truth is that, after the young reformers released the genie of market
forces, their successors lost their grip on almost everything except export
quotas and their own secrets. The supreme power today is money, and those
who wield that power are businessmen, mafiosi and the officials who extort
bribes in return for not hindering their activity.
It is that power, as expressed every day in my courtyard, which is the main
guarantee against a return to the past. It is true that Moscow is not
Russia. But that does not make thoughts of the future, which will be largely
decided in the capital, any less unsettling.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Doubts over rail strike figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LESLIE HADI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If we are to believe the RMT's claim that 98 per cent of its members
have remained loyal to the strike, there is a disturbing corollary. The fact
that Railtrack still kept 40 per cent of the network open (presumably with
no compromise on safety) suggests a frightening level of overmanning.
Could Jimmy Knapp please check his figures.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Arts: Shakespeare in many tongues - The Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brush up your Shakespeare, and brush up your languages. Last week the
Edinburgh Festival brought us Antony and Cleopatra in German, this week A
Winter's Tale in French. Meanwhile, the Fringe includes A Midsummer Night's
Dream and Iago (rewrites of the Shakespeare plays) done by the Ukrainian
company Theatre on Podol; the latter takes place in a swimming pool. The
official festival companies perform with a heavy sprinkling of Shakespeare's
lines on surtitles. This adds a peculiar irony to watching the performance:
for, while we read the text on high, we watch what directors have made of it
onstage below.
The Winter's Tale in French stands at the opposite pole to last week's
Berliner Antony and Cleopatra. That was prose, its action downscaled and
updated, its tone intimate, its texture organic. This is poetry, its action
taken out of any realistic context and its content carefully distilled, its
tone cultivated, its structure rejigged by shifting floors and scenery.
The director is Stephane Braunschweig, the production from the Centre
Dramatique National, Orleans-Loiret-Centre, Theatre-Machine; and
Braunschweig shows how intelligently he understands the play. Leontes, the
King of Sicily so suddenly and violently obsessed by false and jealous
convictions about his wife Hermione and best friend Polixenes, is here shown
as a man who absurdly over-dramatises his own innermost thoughts, who
soliloquises in a manner far more melodramatic than he reveals in private:
until this private, ludicrous, histrionic side takes him over in public as
well and makes him monstrous.
But Braunschweig directs like a pathologist. He lays the workings of the
play out on the slab: analysed, organised, labelled, and dead. Leontes's
hammy neurosis is played out by Pierre-Alain Chapuis in the most actorly
French manner, full of special vocal contrivance; and this is set against
the far calmer manners shown by those around him. He clutches at a large red
curtain in his early torment of jealousy, and the curtain becomes a symbol
of melodramatic distortion. Meanwhile, each area of the stage shifts, so
that the scenery itself becomes a symbol of the play's often distorted
emotional perspectives. Several scenes are played out on a rake of about 40
degrees.
At four hours (with interval), this Winter's Tale feels a great deal longer
than the Berliner Antony (three hours 40 minutes without interval): longer
because - oh] - slower. As the play develops, every line - every word -
becomes an etude. And Paulina, whose reckless courage and moral outrage are
the strongest force in the play to counter Leontes's punitive jealousy, is
played by Sophie Daull in artificial style, self-consciously playing to the
house for precious effect even in the most intense scenes.
Braunschweig knows that some parts of the play are comic, others idyllic,
others charming, and shows us how and why. I like the use of a female
'cellist in between scenes; she also plays Emilia. And I like the way that
Hermione appears, beautifully veiled in white, while Antigonus recounts his
fatal dream of her; and how she then remains there, like Patience on a
monument, until - lifting her veil - she becomes the role of Time and tells
us how 16 years have passed. Charming. But neither here nor elsewhere has
the production any naturalness or convincing inner life. Calculation is all
too evident.
Meanwhile, on the fringe, from 10.15pm till 12.30am, the Ukrainian Theatre
on Podol is giving its Iago at the Infirmary Street Swim Centre. Desdemona
does a length of breaststroke to elope with Othello, Iago is forever
chucking people and props into the water, Othello and other characters go
for a swim at regular intervals. This is Othello re-told (though less
radically than the same company's Midsummer Night's Dream) and it sounds
utterly prosaic to this English ear.
But the action is completely fluent. I always wanted to know what would
happened next, and/or how it would happen. Othello (white, without make-up)
is dignified and yet always outshadowed by the towering, inscrutable,
plausible Iago. Desdemona is innocent, spontaneous, unintelligent, a natural
victim. At the end, both Iago and Othello are placed under arrest, on the
jetty that projects out into the pool, for their crimes; Iago reveals all
and handcuffs himself to Othello; and Othello, having learnt how he has been
duped, calmly stabs himself. His body falls back into the pool, pulling in
Iago after it. The lights fall on Iago trying desperately to keep the dead
Othello afloat.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Arts: Humour versus Hammer - Cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOLF (15) Mike Nichols
LE PARFUM D'YVONNE (18) Patrice Leconte
A SHADOW OF DOUBT (15) Aline Isserman
Deep in a Hollywood laboratory, men in white coats seek to create the
perfect rejuvenation potion. The idea is to rejuvenate not people but
pictures. They mix and match movie genres, searching for the ultimate
box-office 'Eureka]' Will it be the action epic cum marital infidelity
comedy (True Lies)? Will it be the Western cum gambling movie cum TV rip-off
(Maverick)? Or how about - touch of desperation now creeping into the
ingenuity - the publishing comedy cum May-December love story cum werewolf
movie?
As genre experiments go, Wolf seems to have escaped its laboratory before
its time and dashed off down the emergency stairs. Screenwriter Jim Harrison
or director Mike Nichols probably left it untended, thinking it was almost
ready. But it wasn't. And being a Jack Nicholson project, it is soon out on
the street, surprising passers-by with idiot grins, flyaway eyebrows and
twanging slow-burn epigrams.
The opening scene - no, the opening half hour - is promising. Jack's car
collides with a wolf on a skiddy, midnight New England road and he is bitten
when he tries to shift the supposed dead body. Back in that other primal
forest called New York, he is being retired as editor-in-chief of a top
publishing firm. His boss Christopher Plummer says: 'I want you to think
about eastern Europe.' (Gothic joke combined with josh at Gotham
job-politics.)
But all that sacked Jack is thinking about is how to appease his vicariously
ambitious wife (Kate Nelligan); how to put a good face on his resentment of
the super-yuppie replacing him (James Spader, in oleaginous overdrive); and
why his senses of smell, sight and hearing are suddenly, strangely sharper.
He is of course lycanthropising. Soon it is but a hop and jump to peeing on
his rival's suede shoes in the office loo ('Just marking my territory'), to
growling impressively at Plummer, and to sharpening figurative claws for his
job reclamation. 'Is the worm turning?' trills his spinsterish secretary
Eileen Atkins. 'The worm is turning and packing an Uzi,' replies Jack.
'About f - ing time,' says Eileen.
And it is. Forty minutes gone and still no authentic werewolfery. Soon after
that, though - but no, we feel a hand suddenly clamped round our mouths by
the Columbia press handout: 'would be grateful . . . refrain from telling .
. . third act . . . thank you . . . understanding and cooperation.'
Happy to oblige. For the third act, sad to tell, is a silly old mess, with
director Mike Nichols evidently bitten by the dead body of Hammer Films and
choosing to finish things off with fur, fangs and flying bullets. (Not
giving too much away, am I?) This would be fine if the images matched the
apocalyptic gear-change. But Wolf, having lingered so long in the land of
back-chat and Martinis, lacks the courage to go feral. If you want
bone-stretching, mind-boggling, proper metamorphoses such as in The Howling
or An American Werewolf In London, rent the aforementioned movies on video.
Instead we have a snuffling Nicholson in orange contacts and miracle-grow
sideburns, inflamed to self-assertion by beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer as the
Plummer's daughter. Their romance - let us call it Act Two - is where the
film begins to go wrong. Pfeiffer is a knock-em-dead actress struggling with
a never-come-to-life role. And director Nichols, who as Silkwood and
Heartburn taught us is ever the vapid stylist when he chooses, films the
couple's formative tete-a-tete from behind their heads, silhouetted against
a sparkling twilight river. Throughout this scene the camera does one of
those simultaneous push-pull motions with the zoom and track to give us a
sense of perspective-sorcery. But it is pretentious beyond measure: like an
icky picture postcard animated by Tarkovsky.
So we are left with the early territorial comedy between Nicholson and
Spader, manoeuvring for acting honours as turning worm and wormy twerp
respectively. Spader is a joy. No one in modern cinema acts better
sincerity-fakers. The face is a blob of radiant choirboy disingenuousness,
with invisible wires hitching the mouth into unctuous grins or pulling the
eyebrows down into 'concerned' frowns. In Wolf he stays right in there and
up there with Nicholson: no mean feat since our Jack is in his
voice-tweezing, elastic-eyed element here, at least so long as the film's
sense of humour keeps at bay its sense of Hammer.
French cinema today wanders in a half-world all its own. The New Wave has
receded, leaving a chain of low-tide rock pools that seem, depending on the
prevailing light, either gloomily inert or delusively reflective.
Can you have life without movement? Can still waters really run deep?
Patrice Leconte's Le Parfum D'Yvonne, from the director of Monsieur Hire and
The Hairdresser's Husband, is rock pool cinema par excellence. Chic resort
setting (luxury hotel). Teasing iridescent light. And a whole lot of exotic,
biologically predestined life forms: including the young man opting out from
the Algerian war during the 1950s (Hippolyte Girardot), the beautiful girl
he falls for (Sandra Majani) and her ageing gay friend (Jean-Pierre
Marielle), who insists on being called Queen Astrid. Don't ask why, just
enjoy Marielle's high-style acidic performance, the movie's one flicker of
vitality.
Indeed Leconte's film could have been, but wasn't, inspired by Cyril
Connolly's novel The Rock Pool. (The actual source was Patrick Modiano's
Villa Triste.) Connolly's story was all about a bunch of vain artistic types
sur le continent, taking elegant swabs from each other's souls. But Connolly
was a satirist. Leconte, via Modiano, seems to be - what? An impressionist?
(All that blurry, light-kissed photography.) A bricoleur? (Narrative tricks
within tricks within flashbacks.) Or just a cinematic dandy doodling
endlessly with his movie palette?
The period set pieces are pretty and sometimes funny: notably the concours
d'elegance for vintage cars and their drivers, a scene resembling Genevieve
out of Last Year In Marienbad. Elsewhere, ever-so-precious dialogue is
exchanged amid ever-such-opalescent settings and the temperature barely
rises even when the chatter stops for the love scenes. Anyone for Dubonnet?
A Shadow Of Doubt is better. The light on this rock pool is dimmer, but the
perspective is wider (Cinemascope) and deeper. When a 12-year-old girl
(Sandrine Blancke) accuses her father (Alain Bashung) of child abuse,
interested parties try to keep the two apart, un-aware that shadows have an
elastic life almost independent of their owners.
No vintage cars. No Dubonnet. Just the distant susurration of mistrust and
the darkened, panicked depths of a relationship into which one fatal stone
has been dropped. Director Aline Isserman boldly uses a wide screen for an
intimate story: which means that faces are wreathed in boas of shadow and
ambiguity becomes a form of brain-teasing poetry.
Movie-making like this is still 'rock pool' rather than high tide. But at
least it makes a virtue of its own marooned and intimist vision.

It seems that those of us who choose our ice cream by taste are in a
minority. Haagen-Dazs is chosen because of its sexy advertising and Ben and
Jerry's because of its 'caring' image: eat a cornet and save a rain forest.
The last in the current series of The Business reports on the ice cream war
(7.30 BBC2). The BBC1 tabloid science series QED reports on another war: the
one between Bruce Silcock and his neighbours. Mr Silcock wants planning
permission to develop the world's biggest maggot farm in Essex (8.30). The
BBC2 series Under The Sun screens the first of three programmes on the lives
of Hamar women in Ethiopia. It seems they have a creation myth which is
rather more attractive than the Adam and Eve version: in the beginning two
people were created, one smiled and became a woman and the other kept his
mouth shut and became a man (9.30). BBC Proms 1994 is a recording of the
second half of last Saturday's Brahms' Night, with Carlo Maria Giulini
conducting (10.00). Can the One Day International produce cricket as
exciting as that in the third Test? (BBC1 11.00).

FT  25 AUG 94 / Arts: Osborne's 'Sarajevo' - Opera Factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first thing to say is that Sarajevo is not an opera, if that matters. In
assembling his material on the suffering in Bosnia, Nigel Osborne found
himself bringing together a variety of sources, which he has fashioned into
a trilogy, composed partly of theatre, partly of music.
The first performance at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Tuesday was entrusted
to Opera Factory, with which Osborne has had a long creative partnership.
The company premiered one of his true operas, Hell's Angels, and also (more
relevant to the piece here) invited him to supply incidental music for two
plays. David Freeman, producer of Sarajevo, more accurately describes the
work as 'performance art'.
Part One of the trilogy begins unpromisingly. Wanting to make a connection
to the suffering of an earlier age, Osborne incorporates an adaptation of
Euripides's The Trojan Women, made by Don Taylor. In spite of an assertion
in an interview that this would have 'integral' music, there is almost no
music at all. The play is acted straight, albeit in a modern setting, but
too much of the text is mumbled or hysterically shrieked for the issues that
Euripides was addressing to come across. A week spent watching fringe
theatre at the Edinburgh Festival leaves one fairly immune to Freeman's kind
of full-frontal soul-bearing.
Part Two is a musical setting of texts written in Sarajevo, 'somewhere
between an opera, a cabaret and a song cycle', says Osborne. Reading the
poems in advance, I thought how moving they were. The unreality of living in
Sarajevo during the siege is marvellously captured by some of these
vignettes, like the boy wanting to keep his Levi 501s with the bullet hole
as a souvenir, or the well-dressed businessman going home with his briefcase
in one hand and a branch of a tree to burn in his home-made stove in the
other.
Unfortunately, most of their force gets lost when the music is added.
Osborne interweaves them and variously undermines their simple honesty,
although his trio of instrumentalists at least allows most of the words to
be heard. There is little feeling of pacing or overall shape to this long
section, and certainly not of drama. Freeman's attempts to provide a
dramatic subtext were inevitably futile.
These songs lead directly into Part Three, which is a setting in 'oratorio'
form of a libretto called 'Sandstorm', by Craig Raine. Here, for the first
time, music gains primacy over the words, which are in any case difficult to
catch without the text to hand. In the more impassioned outbursts, when the
four solo singers come together, one at last senses something of the anger
which Osborne says motivated him to write the work.
Maybe it is unfair to expect that a composer should be able to express his
sense of outrage with more eloquence than the rest of us, but summoning the
power of his creative abilities is surely the challenge. Sarajevo is an
undisciplined and inarticulate cry of pain.
Sponsored by Spero Communications. Further performances at the Queen
Elizabeth Hall until September 3 and then at Oxford Playhouse

FT  25 AUG 94 / Technology: A hidden killer waits to strike - Clive Cookson
continues a series on drug discoveries by looking at ways to fight off
fungal infections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fungi fight on both sides in the war between people and pathogens. They have
provided several of the most valuable antibiotics used to control bacterial
infections but they are themselves an increasingly important target for the
pharmaceutical industry.
Hospital doctors are alarmed by the rising incidence of life-threatening
fungal infections in cancer and transplant patients, whose immune systems
have been depressed by chemotherapy, and in people with Aids. Although there
are no reliable estimates for the number of people worldwide dying from
fungi, doctors are beginning to think of them as a hidden killer.
According to a survey by the US Centres for Disease Control, the rate of
fungal infection almost doubled from 2.0 to 3.8 per 1,000 hospital patients
between 1980 and 1990. A German study of all autopsies carried out in
Frankfurt showed an even faster increase in invasive fungal infections: from
0.4 per cent in 1978-82 to 1.2 per cent in 1983-87 and 2.4 per cent in
1987-92.
Contributing factors include antibiotic treatments, which wipe out bacteria
and leave the field clear for competing fungi, and the increasing use in
hospitals of intravenous catheters - tubes which provide a route for
infections into the body - as well as the growing number of
'immuno-compromised' patients.
To meet the need, anti-fungal drug sales are expanding fast. Datamonitor,
the business research company, puts the annual growth rate at 19 per cent,
with the world market projected to increase from Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds
1.6bn) in 1993 to Dollars 4.9bn in 1997. Another research company, Frost &amp;
Sullivan, estimates that the US anti-fungal market will grow from Dollars
1.1bn in 1993 to Dollars 2.1bn in 1999.
On the supply side, the market growth is being driven above all by Diflucan,
launched by Pfizer of the US in 1990. Analysts expect Diflucan, which was
developed at Pfizer's UK research centre in Sandwich, Kent, to become the
anti-fungal sector's first Dollars 1bn-a-year drug.
Before Diflucan, the leading treatment for systemic anti-fungal disease  -
serious infections in which microscopic fungi have spread right through the
patient's body - was amphotericin B, an old drug associated with severe
toxic side-effects.
Diflucan has the potency of amphotericin B, with fewer side-effects. It can
be given as an emergency injection to treat life-threatening infections, or
taken by mouth as long-term therapy by immuno-compromised patients who need
to keep fungi at bay.
Although Diflucan was a great improvement on previous treatments for serious
fungal infections, it is far from perfect. The most serious drawback is that
Diflucan does not have a sufficiently broad spectrum of activity. It works
well against Candida, the yeast which is the single most prevalent fungal
pathogen in human beings, but it is much less effective against Aspergillus,
the second most common one. And, ominously, there are signs that
Diflucan-resistant strains of Candida are evolving.
Therefore Pfizer is developing follow-up drugs to hit fungi that do not
respond well to Diflucan. So are several other companies that do not have a
significant presence in the anti-fungal market today but are attracted by
its potential, including Zeneca and Glaxo of the UK and Eli Lilly and Merck
of the US.
Most anti-fungal drugs belong to a class of chemicals called azoles.
Diflucan is an azole. So are Sporanox, Nizoral and Daktarin, the three drugs
sold by Janssen, the Belgian subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, which is
number two in the anti-fungal market behind Pfizer.
Janssen's biggest development effort at the moment is focused on extending
the uses of Sporanox, which was launched in 1989. Mike Emanuel, the
company's UK research director, says the drug's great advantage is its broad
spectrum of activity, including effectiveness against Aspergillus.
Azoles work by blocking the synthesis of ergosterol, a fungal hormone that
is essential for the maintenance of cell membranes. They have also been
developed by agrochemical researchers to combat fungal diseases in cereals
and fruit.
There are several more azoles in the development pipeline, including one
from Pfizer and another from Zeneca, in Phase II clinical trials. David
Denning of Manchester University Medical School, scientific adviser to the
Fungal Research Trust, is involved in the clinical trials of both Pfizer's
and Zeneca's new azoles. 'They could be useful drugs but I don't think
either is going to be a giant leap forward,' he says.
'What we need is a drug with a completely new mode of action - and that is a
tall order, because a lot of the fungal cell processes are the same as in
mammalian cells,' Denning says. 'Another difficulty is that fungal cells
have a thick coating of sugar molecules; we have to find a chemical
structure that will get through the wall without causing damage to human
cells.'
One fruitful development is the re-formulation of amphotericin B, in a way
that reduces its side-effects while retaining its potency. Two US companies,
Vestar and Liposome Technology, have encapsulated amphotericin B in
microscopic fatty particles called liposomes; these release the drug more
slowly into the patient's body and reduce its toxicity. The products -
Vestar's AmBisome and Liposome's Amphocil (marketed by Zeneca outside North
American and Japan) - have recently been licensed for use against severe
infections that do not respond to other drugs.
The best-selling non-azole drug is Lamisil, launched by Sandoz of
Switzerland in 1991. Whereas Diflucan aims mainly at systemic internal
infections, Lamisil's primary market is the treatment of skin, nail and hair
infections.
These external infections by dermatophyte fungi affect 10 to 15 per cent of
the population, according to David Pearson of Sandoz. Although not
life-threatening, they can be irritating and disfiguring and are extremely
hard to clear up with conventional drugs.
Lamisil, which can be taken by mouth or applied as a cream, is very
effective at eradicating dermatophyte infections. But it is also turning out
to have a broader spectrum of activity than Sandoz originally expected, with
potential for treating some systemic infections too. 'We're forecasting
sales of more than Dollars 800m a year for Lamisil by 1998-99,' Pearson
says.
Chemically, Lamisil is an allylamine. It interferes with ergosterol
production, like the azoles, but at an earlier step in the biosynthetic
pathway. The effect, according to Sandoz, is that Lamisil is 'fungicidal' -
it actually kills them - whereas azoles are just 'fungistatic', keeping the
fungi under control. Therefore patients treated with Lamisil are less likely
to relapse after treatment stops.
'In principle the distinction between fungicidal and fungistatic drugs is
very important,' says Roderick Hay, professor of cutaneous medicine at Guy's
Hospital, London. 'But in practice there is little clinical data yet to show
that it makes any difference.'
Meanwhile, the search continues for entirely new drugs.
At Imperial College, London, Tony Barrett is running a particularly active
anti-fungal chemistry programme. Promising compounds being investigated by
his group include: papuamine, a powerful fungicide produced naturally by
tropical sponges; papulacandins; hennoxazole A; and FR-900848, a research
compound from Fujisawa of Japan.
An elegant approach is to use fungi themselves as a source of new
anti-fungal drugs. It has yielded several promising research leads for Myco
Pharmaceuticals, a Massachusetts biotechnology company.
'There are an estimated 1.5m fungal species worldwide,' says William
Timberland, Myco's vice-president for research. 'Because fungi are competing
with each other in natural eco-systems, one would expect them to produce
anti-fungals to protect themselves from other species.'
The series continues next month by focusing on drugs that act on the immune
system.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Technology: Pioneers on the barcode trail - Vanessa Houlder
reports on a system that has earned its stripes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barcodes, it seems, have become ubiquitous. The machine-readable panels of
black and white stripes are being used to identify everything from newborn
babies to pension books.
Yet barcodes have drawbacks, notably in the amount of information that can
be squeezed on to a label, which is usually restricted to a simple
identification number. In an attempt to pack in more data, manufacturers
have been working on a new generation of codes which store information in
two dimensions.
These codes, which are capable of storing information 100 times more densely
than their one-dimensional counterparts, have been used in applications
ranging from military security passes to labelling parts on the space
shuttle.
The latest company to announce plans to launch a 2D barcode is Tec (UK), a
subsidiary of Toshiba, the Japanese corporation. Its Data Matrix system,
which can store up to 2,000 bytes of information per code, will come on to
the UK market next month.
Its system has little in common with the conventional barcode, in which data
is represented by a pattern of bars and spaces, which can be scanned by
laser and fed into a computer. The Tec system works by putting raw data into
binary code and representing it in the form of dark and light squares in a
matrix - creating what looks like a blank crossword puzzle. To decypher the
code, a reading machine takes a photograph of the image, which is then
decoded.
The company believes that the system's potential uses include keeping
records for hospital patients, keeping track of components on production
lines, and verifying the identity of document holders.
A similar system has already been introduced by Veritec, a Calfornian
developer. The Veritec system was spotted by Nasa when it was attempting to
improve its method of identifying parts in the space shuttle. By marking the
Veritec codes directly on parts, Nasa was able to bypass steps where a human
would manually transfer serial numbers, thus reducing the risk of human
error.
Another advantage of the system was that it was suitable for marking very
small parts, since the mechanism for reading the code includes a camera with
a lens capable of magnifying the image. The technology also stood out by
producing marks on delicate components that were capable of being read after
being exposed to outer space.
A different technology underpins the two-dimensional system designed by
Symbol Technologies. Its system, which it describes as a portable data file,
consists of a series of codes stacked upon each other. A single code can
contain up to 1,750 characters, compared with around 13 on a traditional
barcode.
The system which was launched commercially two years ago, is being used to
mark the uniform of US fire fighters with their identification and medical
history. Symbol Technologies has also experimented with marking blood bags
with the donor's blood group, the blood's expiry date and centre of origin.
The system is being used in security passes by the US Department of Defence
and will be used by policemen working at the Conservative party conference
in October.
Few developers expect the 2D barcode to replace the traditional barcode. The
traditional one-dimensional systems are relatively cheap and effective and
have already commanded substantial investment.
None the less, the champions of 2D codes firmly believe that their
technology will open up new applications. 'It is the most exciting thing
that has ever happened to barcoding,' believes Brian Marcel, managing
director of Bar Code Systems, a UK distributor of Symbol Technology's
system.
Yet so far, the uptake of 2D barcoding has been relatively slow. The
barriers are not due to cost or technology, says Marcel. Rather, the
acceptance of 2D systems depends on potential users' vision and willingness
to be pioneers, he says. 'No one likes to be first.'

FT  25 AUG 94 / People: Worboyes - levelling up at the PIA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mark Worboyes, 40, an accountant with Fimbra, has been appointed head of
investigations at the Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog
charged with protecting the private investor.
The PIA started operating last month after a long debate about reforming a
widely-criticised system in which regulation of retail financial services
was split between Lautro, which regulates life companies and unit trusts,
and Fimbra, which supervises independent financial advisers.
However, the problem of merging two regulators has caused considerable
jockeying for position behind the scenes and there has been some criticism
that Lautro staff were getting the plum jobs in the PIA. Kit Jebens, head of
the PIA's member relations, and Stuart Willey, head of legal services, both
come from Lautro. David Severn, head of policy development, comes in from
the Securities and Investments Board (SIB).
Worboyes, who comes under Kit Jebens' department, takes over from his old
boss Jim Gaskin, Fimbra's former deputy chief executive, who had been given
the job of the PIA's investigations chief. He quit last week to become
managing director of Countrywide, a chain of independent financial advisers.
Worboyes joined Fimbra in 1988 and has held a succession of posts in the
areas of compliance and enforcement.
The PIA is still looking for a new head of finance and administration to
complete its top management team under Colette Bowe, the new chief executive
who was brought in from the SIB at the start of the year.

The search for a new chairman at Associated Nursing Services has come to an
end with the appointment to the board of former Tory MP and junior sport
minister, Sir Neil Macfarlane (above).
The nursing homes group has also invited John Hodson, chief executive of the
merchant bank Singer &amp; Friedlander, to become a non-executive director.
Singer &amp; Friedlander holds 24 per cent of ANS.
ANS is paying Sir Neil and Hodson Pounds 18,000 and Pounds 10,000 a year
respectively for 'about five' and 'at least two' days' work a month. Nick
Dhandsa, chief executive, says this is the going rate.
Sir Neil, 58, will become non-executive chairman in October, on the
retirement of Robert Upsdell, who joined the group in 1990 and who,
according to Dhandsa, had originally intended to stay with ANS for only two
or three years.
Sir Neil is a non-executive director of several companies, including RMC,
Securicor, and the Bradford &amp; Bingley building society. Hodson's financial
expertise, meanwhile, is expected to help ANS forge joint ventures with City
institutions to fund expansion plans. The group recently called on
shareholders for Pounds 10m to fund expansion through a one for three rights
issue.

FT  25 AUG 94 / People: Davis succumbs to Aegis's carrot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The media buying and planning group Aegis, holding company of the
European-wide network of Carat companies, moved a step further on its steady
rise back from the grave with the appointment of a new chief executive, who
has a track record in managing some of the world's best-known and most
successful brands.
He is Crispin Davis, 45, whose most recent employer was United Distillers -
where he took the controversial decision to reduce the strength of Gordon's
gin. But he spent much of his working life - the years 1970-1990 - with
Procter &amp; Gamble; he was offered the job following a Europe-wide head-hunt.
Davis is taking over from Charles Hochman, 65, who, on retiring from the
chief executive's role, will become non-executive deputy chairman until the
end of 1995.
Aegis has had a rocky two years since Peter Scott was ousted as chairman in
July 1992. It suffered pre-tax losses of Pounds 18m in 1993, including
exceptional items of Pounds 40m, following (restated) losses of Pounds 11m
the previous year; it staged a Pounds 61m refinancing package in October
1993.
In April this year, Davis was reported to have received cash and non-cash
benefits worth a total of Pounds 670,000 from Guinness, following his
October 1993 resignation as regional managing director of the United
Distillers spirits subsidiary and his consequent departure from the main
board of Guinness.
It is believed that Davis's abrupt departure from Guinness followed a clash
over marketing strategy with chief executive Tony Greener. Until that clash,
observers had regarded Davis as being groomed to take on the top executive
job. Running Aegis will give Davis plenty of scope to realise fully his own
views on marketing.
Davis left Procter &amp; Gamble in 1990, where he started life as an assistant
brand manager. By 1978 he was marketing director of P&amp;G's UK operations,
responsible for such matters as establishing the Pampers brand of disposable
nappy as market leader. At P&amp;G Davis rose to become vice president in charge
of the US foods businesses. He takes over at Aegis on October 15.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Unloved and
incompetent - Salespeople's professionalism comes under attack after an
international survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Salesmen and women are commonly portrayed as unloved, foot-in-the-door
creatures, whose superiors provide motivation principally in the form of
alternate bouts of public humiliation and recognition.
In recent weeks, salesforces have received an even worse press than usual,
with revelations from the UK financial services sector of dodgy advice to
clients, lack of training and poor management controls.
Now there appears to be fresh evidence of incompetence - although
salespeople have some of their own grouses, too, about the inefficiencies of
their organisations.
A survey conducted by Kinnaird Communications Group, a Glasgow-based
consultancy, claims that only 5 per cent of field sales staff 'possess the
requisite natural selling skills that make them stand out as professionals',
while 35 per cent 'just manage to pay their way', leaving 'an astounding 60
per cent just there for the beer'.
Kinnaird says it arrived at these figures after an exercise which involved:
questioning about 1,000 salesmen and women operating in the UK, France,
Italy and Germany; looking at sales records; and talking to chief
executives, supervisors and customers. The findings, says Robert Kinnaird,
managing director, were supplemented by observations over many years among
clients' salesforces.
The elite 5 per cent of salespeople achieve about five times the sales
performance level of the poorest employees, while, according to Kinnaird,
much of the rest 'have drifted into the profession, attracted by the
freedom, car and expense account'. In contrast to these findings, around
half of the mediocre and poor salespeople surveyed counted themselves as
outstanding or good performers.
The tiny portion of the day apparently spent face to face with potential
customers is astonishing. Kinnaird calculates that, out the average
salesperson's day, 42 per cent of the time is spent in the car, while 26 per
cent is spent at home planning, having lunch, telephoning, writing reports
and parking the car.
That leaves less than one-third of the time on customers' premises. However,
all but perhaps 5 per cent of that time will be taken up by fruitless 'cold'
calls, waiting in reception, interruptions and, in the case of the poorest
salespeople, inadequate advance planning and an excess of small talk.
Much precious face-to-face time was found to be spent talking to people with
no influence on the purchasing decision. An unproductive monthly call cycle,
made up of 'tea and sympathy' visits, is the only outlet for salespeople 'to
find solace or escape from what they regard as a very lonely existence,'
says Kinnaird.
Salespeople complain of inadequate marketing and advertising support for
products from head office, poor sales literature, and products or services
provided more cheaply by competitors.
A particular irritation seems to be that few marketing managers or, indeed,
chief executives, have any direct field sales experience. This point is
endorsed by Paul Williams, a former sales director for Philip Morris
cigarettes, and now a course director with the Chartered Institute of
Marketing, the professional body which organises sales training. Says
Williams: 'The bane of my life is the fact that most chief executives have a
financial background - probably the worst background you can have to
motivate salespeople. The way you get salespeople to respond is to create
the right attitudes, emotions and feelings in them.'
He also believes that Kinnaird's figure of 5 per cent for the sales elite is
probably about right: what sets this upper tranche apart is charisma in a
sales situation, he says.
Apart from the elusive charisma, the other main qualities that make a
successful salesperson are a sense of humour and good planning and
preparation skills, says Williams. 'They certainly also need initiative,
because nearly all of the time they're on their own, as well as a belief in
their company and their products or services. They've got to believe in
their colleagues - the people in accounts, marketing and distribution - and
finally, they have to believe in themselves.'
John Hunt, a professor at the London Business School who has assembled a
vast databank of occupational profiles, adds to that list of qualities,
physical energy, tenacity and resilience in the face of rejection. The
salesperson's primary motivator is recognition, hence the 'religious events
where everyone gets a prize one way or another', he says. It is not so much
that effective sales staff like people but they enjoy 'the game of using
their own interpersonal skills to hook someone on to their sale'.
Fiona Rogers, the Chartered Institute of Marketing's own marketing director,
says there are 'always going to be naturals, but the training of a salesman
is absolutely critical. It's not just a question of product training in the
features, benefits and uses of the product, but it's also about the
techniques of selling. Good-quality training can override the lack of some
of the personal skills'.
As well as improving training, Rogers believes the value of the salesperson
to the organisation is often not exploited. Her words will be welcomed by
the unloved ranks of salespeople. 'They are your front-line people. They are
a most valuable information source, not just on customer attitudes and
preferences, and what's going on in the marketplace, but also what the
environment is like for the competition.'

FT  25 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Drink to German
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germans drink lots of schnapps, but they are reluctant buyers of shares. So
when Berentzen, a drinks company in north-east Germany, issued new
preference stock this summer, it decided to promote its brands and shares at
the same time.
The issue, which met heavy demand, was Berentzen's first. The 236-year-old
company, which includes such brands as Doornkaat and Schinkenhager and has a
turnover of DM360m (Pounds 148.7m) (excluding spirits tax), raised nearly
DM90m (Pounds 37.5m). To reach as wide a spread of potential investors as
possible, it combined a brand marketing campaign with one highlighting its
share flotation.
Not only did the company advertise the issue on television, radio, in the
press and in stores, it even put details on the back of schnapps bottles.
Gunter Lewald, head of communications at the group, which also makes soft
drinks, says such an all-out investor awareness approach is unique in
Germany.
Buyers of schnapps and fruit liqueur products under the Berentzen name were
invited to take part in a draw for shares. The company put labels on 5.1m
bottles with details of where to write for more information on the products
and the issue.
The response was not huge, with about 3,000 people writing in, but showed
the message was being spread. Television spots on NTV, an all-news cable
channel, produced a further 1,000 inquiries. Out of these responses, 1,500
people went further than wanting to be in the draw and asked about buying
the shares.
After initial scepticism, says Lewald, the banks arranging the issue (led by
DG Bank) were won over. The share draw takes place next month with 111
shares - chosen because a same-digit number is called a schnappszahl
(schnapps number) in Germany - to be divided among 21 winners. The lucky one
will get 11 shares, worth DM3,795 at the subscription price; the rest will
get five each.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Europe's uncommon
markets - Motoko Rich on the diversity of consumption among individual
countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marketing executives aiming their products at the European consumer should
consider their prime audience as single 30-something homeowners who are
health-conscious, employed in the community, social or personal services
sector, and own at least one television.
That appears the conclusion to draw from the latest survey* of European
consumer lifestyles by Euromonitor, the London-based market analyst.
In its survey of 23 countries on a range of factors from employment patterns
to birth rates since its last poll in 1989, Euromonitor reported increasing
homeownership - now accounting for 55 per cent of households in Europe - and
particularly strong growth in single-person households. In western Germany
and Scandinavia, for example, single people occupy a third of all homes.
Birth rate trends mean the youth market in western Europe will fade during
the 1990s and the early years of the next century, while the population aged
between 30 and 45 will represent the largest sector of consumers.
An increasingly health-conscious population, says the report, has resulted
in an overall rise of two years in European life expectancy since the
mid-1980s, and of 10 years since 1970.
The community, social and personal services sector represents by far the
largest employment of Europe's citizens. On average, 26 per cent of the
workforce in western Europe is employed in social and personal services.
This figure represents a move from the traditional large employers in the
manufacturing sector, which now employs about 21 per cent of the workforce.
However, 23.5 per cent of employees in Greece still work in agriculture,
while in the UK 57.5 per cent are employed by wholesalers, retailers,
restaurants or hotels.
While European unemployment rates have been rising by a rate of at least 2
to 3 per cent since 1988, jobless levels have been rising at much higher
rates in some countries. In Sweden, unemployment rose from 1.4 per cent to
5.3 per cent between 1989 and 1992, and jumped in Switzerland from 0.6 per
cent in 1990 to 3 per cent in 1992. In Finland, joblessness rose from 3.5
per cent to 13.1 per cent from 1988 to 1992.
However, some consumer goods appear to be essential, job or no job. In every
country surveyed, televisions are owned by 95 per cent of households.
Consumption trends have been affected by stagnancy in west European spending
power, while levels in eastern Europe have plummeted as state subsidies have
been withdrawn. Although real incomes are beginning to rise, the survey gave
a 'poor prognosis' for large spending on consumer items.
The survey noted, however, that general wealth was increasing in western
Europe, where average per capita production in 1992 was Dollars 21,000,
(Pounds 13,550) with two-thirds of that figure devoted to personal
disposable income. In southern Europe, per capita gross domestic product
ranges from Dollars 7,800 in Greece to Dollars 21,500 in Italy. In eastern
Europe it dropped as low as Dollars 600 in Russia and Dollars 3,400 in
Hungary, the highest in the region.
Spending habits in certain sectors varied widely between markets. Food, for
example, accounts for twice as much of the household budget in Greece or
Portugal - 27 to 32 per cent - as in Germany or the UK. In eastern Europe,
consumers spend 30 to 40 per cent of their budgets on food, although in
Hungary the proportion is 17 per cent.
As a proportion of total consumption, spending on housing is rising - at the
time of the previous survey the rate was falling.
The report warns that the current mood in Europe is towards national
perspectives in consumption as much as anything else.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Accountancy Column: Role of auditing submerged by small
print - Roger Davis argues that the profession needs to take more heed of
clients' demands than standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER DAVIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is time that the auditing profession stopped hiding behind technicalities
and faced up to the need to make its service more relevant to its clients.
British industry has a huge stake in the auditing profession. Company audits
cost some Pounds 2bn annually. Audited accounts affect all major business
decisions. Auditing firms train many of the brightest graduates for an
industrial career. The auditor is a valuable independent source of advice to
management.
It is therefore a great mistake that industry's interests are largely being
ignored in the long-running debate on the role of auditing. My firm's recent
surveys show that what company directors increasingly want from their
auditors are: the courage to constructively to challenge them about their
stewardship, innovative ideas, and, above all, a commercial outlook.
What the profession is doing instead is immersing itself in developing a
plethora of arcane accounting and auditing rules with which industry is,
frankly, getting fed up. The first UK accounting standard had nine pages,
the latest has 137.
Dependence on a litany of technical jargon from somewhere the other side of
the ozone layer will seriously depreciate the asset prized most by company
directors: the auditors' independence of mind to tell the board, from their
wide professional experience, what they really think.
We have a disconnection of major proportions. And if the more strident
academics have their way, the audit would become a highly regulated
activity. The auditor-director relationship would become adversarial. Far
from enhancing the value of audit to directors, shareholders and anyone
else, compliance with the rules would become the end in itself. It would be
demoralising to the outlook of young people joining the profession.
What we need to do is encourage expansion of the auditor's mind, and not of
the rule book. I am ashamed to say that the academics do not need much
encouragement. Auditing firms themselves have been asking for more rules. It
is partly a self-induced weakness to avoid having to make difficult
judgments in a competitive climate.
But others must also take their share of the blame. Time was when the
auditor's words 'my judgment' were invariably respected. Now all too often
the response is 'Show me the rule which says we can't do it,' not only from
company directors but from lawyers and from financial institutions peddling
artificial accounting schemes.
Auditors' fears about litigation are now taking a real grip on this
mentality. It is safer to be able to say in court that you complied with all
the rules. I did not join my profession to become the involuntary equivalent
of a Lloyd's Name, or even worse to underwrite risks the commercial
insurance market will not touch. But by signing an audit report today, that
is increasingly the position I am in: risking being unjustly sued.
The debate is far from academic. A creeping legalistic mentality in the
profession will be debilitating to industry and the economy. Commercial
decisions are increasingly taken with an eye over the shoulder towards how
they will look in the accounts. But a 100-page accounting or auditing
standard will not define a good financial judgment any more than it will an
elephant.
There will be greater encouragement to short-termism because of the loss of
flexibility to account for the longer term substance of decisions. It will
be debilitating to the auditor's mind-set: tidying figures into the right
boxes diverts the auditor's focus from the underlying commercial
performance.
Not least, it will weaken the commercial outlook of graduates the profession
trains for industry, many of whom, unlike other countries, join the
profession with non-accounting degrees.
Colleagues in other countries who have gone further down the same path have
cautioned me against following them. In the United States, there are now 117
accounting standards and hundreds of other official pronouncements. There
are, for example, references to lease accounting in 99 accounting
regulations.
In most of continental Europe, the legal form of accounts, often driven by
the tax regime, is a dominant factor, as it is for Japan. But all still have
business scandals. The detailed standards do not appear to have stopped
them.
No one can argue against greater comparability of accounts - which is one
purpose of the standards. But there is no absolute in comparability. The
only question is how far do we go? International comparability has to be the
goal, but the chances of this diminish as each country goes on expanding its
own accounting lexicon.
The British created accountancy as a real profession in which experienced
professional judgment counted for more than theory. It led much of the
world. It is time for my profession to wake up and realise we now face the
greatest challenge in our history to retain our relevance to the business
community.
The inescapable choice is either to continue on the slide to a legalistic
profession or for the profession to do something about it. I am encouraging
all my partners to carry out a simple test in boardrooms. At every board
meeting or audit committee we attend to present the results of the audit, we
should say to the directors: 'On a points scale of 0 to 10, this is what we
think about the quality of your profits and the quality of the balance
sheet.
'This is how much of your profits have come from making widgets and that is
how much has come from ephemeral activity and from financial schemes. And,
as the final test of quality, we have compared the profits with the cash
flow and that is how much is in the bank.'
Equally, on the subject of internal controls, I suggest that we tell
directors the five most important things they need to put right. The idea is
simple, and because of this it works. Every director joins in the
discussion.
The directors are beginning to throw back similar questions to us. 'On a
points scale of 0-10 how do our accounts overall compare with best
practice?' is a recent quote I heard. The answer we gave of 8 1/2 was not
acceptable. 'I don't deal in halves, and there is a big difference between 8
and 9 in my view,' the director said, thus putting pressure on the auditor
to come off the fence.
It is this kind of simple question and answer test which reflects the mood
of the great majority of boardrooms around the country. It accords with the
business-like way in which directors run their meetings.
A major problem remains: that a lot of unproductive time still needs to be
spent on accounting minutiae. Because the rule book is already so long, the
auditor has painstakingly to explain interpretations of the standards, and
to discuss other potential hostages to fortune which may be referred to the
regulator by those with axes to grind.
Auditors need to convey in everyday language to non-accountants in the
boardroom what they really think as a result of thousands of hours of audit
effort. The benefit of all this effort can easily be lost in the five
minutes they have to make their impact - which is about the length of time
it takes to read the first couple of pages of the latest accounting or
auditing standard.
In summary, the profession needs to reposition itself away from its narrow
compliance mentality towards being a genuinely independent, professional
adviser, challenging boards in the everyday commercial language of business.
We should be in the crow's nest warning of icebergs, not below decks busily
defining what an iceberg looks like.

The Conservatives yesterday dismissed Liberal Democrat plans for a radical
tax and benefits shake-up as a recipe for 'economic suicide for the UK'.
Mr Jeremy Hanley, the Conservative party chairman, said the plan would
damage inward investment and increase the tax burden on middle-income
earners.
The plan, which will be put to the Liberal Democrat annual conference next
month, focuses on the abolition of employees' National Insurance
contributions and big tax rises for the better off.
Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, denied that the proposals
were intended to draw a sharp contrast between the Liberal Democrats and the
low-tax rhetoric of Labour's newly elected leadership.
But he said the plan was intended to reverse Conservative attacks on
progressive taxation and help cut unemployment by reducing the poverty trap.
Mr Hanley accused the Liberal Democrats of hypocrisy. He said: 'I think they
will rue this day, and they will probably try to wriggle out of it before
the next election.'
The impact of the plan is difficult to assess because the Liberal Democrats
will not decide the precise level of tax rates, thresholds and credits until
near the election.
However, low-income households would benefit from the replacement of
employees' NICs by a pensions payment starting at the current income tax
threshold of Pounds 3,445 rather than the NIC threshold of Pounds 2,964.
The low paid would also benefit from the abolition of the 20 per cent tax
band and the replacement of personal allowances with a tax credit. These
measures would remove more than 50,000 people from the tax net.
The higher paid would suffer in several ways:
The ceiling on NICs, currently Pounds 22,360, would be abolished, although
the current 10 per cent rate would probably fall to nearer 8 per cent.
The current 40 per cent tax band would be split in three, with a top level
of no more than 60 per cent on incomes above Pounds 100,000. The middle band
would probably be about 50 per cent, taking effect at a threshold of Pounds
60,000 or higher. The threshold for the lowest of the higher rates would
rise by at least Pounds 5,000 from the current 40 per cent threshold of just
over Pounds 27,000, giving some relief to middle earners.
Inheritance tax would be replaced by an accessions tax on recipients,
treating gifts as income, with safeguards for family business assets.
Mortgage interest tax relief would be replaced by the extension of housing
benefit to mortgage holders on low incomes.
Other proposals include replacing personal equity plans and tax exempt
savings accounts with tax credits on investment income.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Launch of 150-channel TV nears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to introduce 150-channel television will come a step closer next month
with the first demonstrations of a system that can squeeze eight television
channels into the space now occupied by one.
National Transcommunications, the privatised engineering division of the
former Independent Broadcasting Authority, plans to demonstrate the digital
system at the International Broadcasting Convention in Amsterdam on
September 18.
NTL has a development deal with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and
Pace, the consumer electronics group which specialises in satellite
television equipment.
All the signs are that News Corporation is planning to launch a number of
digital television channels in the UK by next autumn and possibly even
earlier on its Star Television system in Asia.
The system will use compression technology to transmit eight television
channels on to half a satellite transponder - the capacity normally used for
a single channel.
NTL is establishing an international reputation in digital compression
technology. Many specialists believe the organisation, which eventually
plans a Stock Exchange flotation, is in the lead in establishing technical
standards for digital television.
The Amsterdam demonstration will use professional television receivers
costing about Pounds 5,000 but it is believed the cost of a unit for
consumers could be lowered to Pounds 500 for the launch of the service. The
costs would then be expected to fall rapidly once volume orders were
received.
The main new use of the vast number of channels would be to introduce 'near
video-on-demand'. This involves devoting a large number of channels,
possibly as many as 50 or 60, to a small number of the latest top movies.
Separate showings of the same films are staggered so that the viewer is only
15 or 20 minutes away from the start of a recent film.
In addition there would be an increasing number of specialist channels.
SES, the Luxembourg-based company which runs the Astra satellite system,
plans to launch two new satellites next year devoted entirely to digital
television signals.
The introduction of 150-channel digital systems involves a big risk for
BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times has a
significant stake, as no one knows whether consumers will be prepared to pay
for receiving boxes for the services.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Lang sets up advice panel on quangos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, yesterday acted to stem criticism of the
growing use of quangos in the National Health Service by creating a
committee of leading public figures to advise him on appointments to health
boards and NHS trusts.
The new committee is chaired by Mr Norman Irons, the Scottish National party
member who is lord provost of Edinburgh. Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the SNP,
described Mr Lang's move as a humiliating climbdown forced by public concern
over 'the stuffing of health-service quangos by Tory placemen'.
The proliferation in Scotland of boards nominated by the Scottish secretary
has aroused criticism because their members are not elected. It is said that
they include disproportionate numbers of Conservatives in a country where
only a quarter of the electorate voted Tory in the 1992 general election.
Mr Lang said that he had sought a broader spread of political views among
people on quangos after the general election, asking leaders of opposition
parties to make nominations, inviting individuals to put themselves forward
and seeking nominations from more outside organisations.
The party leaders ignored the invitation but Mr Lang nominated people such
as Mr Campbell Christie, general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union
Congress, and Mrs Susan Baird, a former Labour lord provost of Glasgow, to
NHS trust boards.
Mr Lang said yesterday that 58 per cent of appointments made since the
general election had been from among people nominated by themselves or
outside bodies. About 40 per cent were women.
The other members of the new committee are: Mrs Jean McFadden, former Labour
leader of Glasgow District Council; the Rt Rev Mario Conti, Roman Catholic
bishop of Aberdeen; Mr Hugh Morison, director general of the Scotch Whisky
Association; and Dr Anthony Toft, president of the Royal College of
Physicians of Edinburgh.
Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, said: 'Appointing yet
another quango to choose more quangos is no real answer in a democracy.' The
answer was to establish a Scottish parliament to which boards would be
accountable.
There is no English equivalent of the committee, although the Department of
Health is setting up a database of potential board members.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Discovery brings thrombosis hope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scientists have taken an important step towards finding a drug to control
blood clotting, which causes heart attacks, strokes and other fatal and
disabling diseases.
The team - from Oxford and Edinburgh universities, and the Medical Research
Council clinical centre at Harrow, north London - has identified the
structure of a protein called tissue factor, which triggers blood clotting,
or thrombosis.
Their findings are published today in Nature, the science journal.
Professor Edward Tuddenham, of the Harrow centre, said: 'More than half the
premature deaths in the western world are thrombosis-related.'
Thrombosis is triggered when tissue factor combines with Factor VII, another
protein in the blood. This starts a biochemical chain reaction that ends in
the formation of a solid clot that may block a blood vessel and cause
damage.
Dr Hamish Humphray, a scientist at Glaxo pharmaceuticals, said: 'Solving the
structure of tissue factor represents a very important step towards the
discovery of new drugs.'
It will allow the development of potential drugs that will block thrombosis
by inhibiting the interaction of Factor VII and tissue factor.
Some compounds are already being tested by drug companies. The details of
the structure of tissue factor will make it much easier to find the most
effective potential drug.
Once a potential drug has been identified, animal trials will be used to
check its effectiveness and test toxicity. Clinical testing could start a
year later. It might, however, be at least 10 years before a drug is
marketed.
A number of drugs that inhibit blood clotting are already used in heart
disease. New drugs in the field include Ciba's Hirudin, which is derived
from leech anticoagulant, and Biogen's Hirulog. They all act by blocking the
later stages of the clotting chain reaction.
A drug that acted on tissue factor could be more effective because it could
start working earlier in the clotting process. At each step in the process,
the number of molecules involved increases a millionfold.
Drug companies are already screening compounds that inhibit tissue factor,
but knowledge of the structure should make the screening process much
faster.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Rail union to ballot its Tube members
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The executive of the RMT transport union yesterday decided to ballot London
Underground workers on a series of one-day strikes over pay.
The move followed a similar decision by Aslef, the train drivers' union, on
Tuesday. The RMT's 8,000 members and Aslef's 2,000 drivers on London
Underground will vote next month on whether to support a series of one-day
stoppages in protest at an imposed 2 per cent pay rise.
If Underground workers vote to strike their action could be co-ordinated
with the stoppages by RMT rail signal staff working for Rail-track.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general-secretary, said: 'Despite promises made by
London Underground of a new dawn following the companycost-cutting programme
introduced three years ago, Underground workers are still waiting.'
The RMT announcement yesterday of a further 24-hour strike by Railtrack
signal workers on September 8 means the action will take place during the
annual Trades Union Congress, which is to be chaired by Mr Knapp.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Exams under pressure to make the grade: John Authers on
fears that new vocational qualifications may do more harm than good
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Results for the first advanced-level General National Vocational
Qualifications (GNVQs) are announced today. But the qualification itself is
under even more rigorous scrutiny than the students.
This follows an attack by Professor Alan Smithers of Manchester University,
a government adviser on vocational education. He said: 'If GNVQs are not
significantly improved, far from revitalising our education system, they
will do harm.'
GNVQs do not involve conventional examinations as the GCE A-level does.
Instead, candidates must complete a series of units, passing each before
they earn the overall qualification.
The National Council for Vocational Qualifications, the agency which
oversees the qualifications, uses the driving test as an analogy.
But Prof Smithers said: 'The way GNVQs operate it is as if your driving
instructor were also your examiner and he or she ticked off whether you
could use the clutch and steering wheel separately but did not assess your
overall performance. Moreover, under the new funding arrangements, they
would only be paid if you passed.'
The attack by Prof Smithers and other conservative academics was damaging,
as the government wants GNVQs to be ranked equally with academic GCE
A-levels both for university entrance and for vocational training. Ministers
want 25 per cent of all 16-year-olds to enter for them by 1996.
Sir Ron Dearing, the government's chief curriculum adviser, intends to
extend the GNVQ structure to cover 14-to-16-year-olds from next year,
allowing them to take pre-vocational courses alongside existing academic
GCSEs.
Mr Tim Boswell, further and higher education minister, took action earlier
this year to address the criticisms of the qualifications. He said: 'We want
GNVQs to have parity of esteem with GCE A-levels. But we recognise that
esteem must be earned - it cannot be conferred by government, the CBI or
anyone else.'
Announcing a plan to tighten the qualification, he said it was necessary to:
Improve external testing.
Provide more training for external verifiers.
Clarify the grading criteria. Clarify what knowledge was needed for a GNVQ.
Provide clearer guidance for teachers on marking coursework, grading and
designing courses.
Tighten criteria for accrediting schools and colleges offering GNVQs.
Mr John Hillier, chief executive of the national council, said yesterday
that all of Mr Boswell's points would be implemented - either this year, for
external tests and grading, or next year.
He added that all elements of this year's pilot of GNVQs had been externally
assessed by awarding bodies, and by the government inspectorate Ofsted, the
further-education funding councils and the Department of Employment's
quality assurance division.
Mr Hillier admitted that this level of supervision could not be sustained
once GNVQs were taken more widely, but said that there were compulsory
external tests for all compulsory units.
He added that the apparent recognition of GNVQs by university admissions
tutors and increased interest from 16-year-olds gave grounds for
encouragement.
While 3,800 students entered for the initial pilot of advanced GNVQs in
1992, the results for which are announced today, about 37,000 registered
last year, and at least 50,000 are expected to register next month.
Ms Tina Townsend, chief executive of the Business and Technology Education
Council, one of the awarding bodies, pointed out that fewer than a third of
students who registered for advanced GNVQs two years ago had gained an
award.
She said: 'It shows the exams are tough and that you need a great deal of
determination and stamina to succeed.'

FT  25 AUG 94 / Reynolds to meet US delegation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, is to meet an influential
Irish-American delegation in Dublin today.
The encounter will precede the group's meeting in Belfast tomorrow with Mr
Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA.
The delegation is headed by Mr Bruce Morrison, a former congressman who is
considered a close friend of Mr Bill Clinton, the US president.
Although not on official US business, Mr Morrison is expected to impress
upon Mr Adams the desire of prominent Irish-Americans to see an IRA
ceasefire in return for the lobbying that has been done on behalf of
nationalists in the US, and which resulted in Mr Adams obtaining a temporary
entry visa to the US earlier this year.
Mr Adams has said he considers his meeting with Mr Morrison's group
important.
However, the Irish government yesterday played down the significance of Mr
Reynolds' planned meeting with the delegation.
The group is also to meet leaders of the mainly nationalist Social
Democratic and Labour party and the Alliance party in Northern Ireland, but
last-minute requests to meet unionist leaders were turned down by both the
Ulster Unionist party and the hardline Democratic Unionist party.
In a sign of growing tensions within the SDLP over the peace process, Mr Joe
Hendron, the party's MP for West Belfast, said he sympathised with the
unionists for not meeting the US delegation because 'they have identified
fairly strongly with the nationalist side'.
With an IRA ceasefire widely expected to be announced within two weeks, new
rifts are also appearing in the unionist camp. Mr David Irvine, a member of
the Progressive Unionist party, which is thought to reflect the views of
loyalist paramilitaries, yesterday accused the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of
the DUP, of attempting to destroy efforts to bring the UUP and DUP closer.
He said there was 'widespread anger' among loyalists at recent attacks by Dr
Paisley on the UUP. 'Unionists should be working together to face the future
from a position of strength, but he is ensuring division,' he said.

FT  25 AUG 94 / North Sea platforms to use wind turbines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wind turbines have been chosen to provide electricity on two natural gas
platforms in the North Sea, in what is believed to be the first such
application of alternative energy sources.
Amoco, the US oil company, is spending Pounds 200,000 to install
wind-powered generators for equipment on its unmanned Davy and Bessemer
platforms off the East Anglian coast. The bigger, manned platforms are
unsuitable candidates because of their large power requirements, which can
be the equivalent of a town of 30,000 people.
The company expects to reap financial and environmental benefits. It
forecasts an 85 per cent reduction in spending on diesel, the fuel normally
used to power generators on unmanned platforms, and a 75 per cent cut in
hydrocarbon exhausts.
It will be able to reduce the frequency of visits to the platforms by
maintenance staff. Helicopter trips will be cut from an average of once a
fortnight to once every 90 days.
Use of wind turbines is in line with industry efforts to cut the operating
costs of offshore installations.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Unit trust sales decline sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of unit trusts fell sharply last month, reversing the strong sales
pattern of the first half of the year.
Net sales fell to Pounds 646.4m in July from June's record Pounds 1.1bn. It
was the weakest sales figure since January. Last month's figure was also
down by almost one-third from net sales of Pounds 954.6m in July last year.
The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Trusts, which released the
figures, said that the falls were dominated by lower net sales through
private-client and pension-fund channels.
It said this might reflect a switch by discretionary managers into direct
holdings of UK equities at the expense of unit trusts - which are pooled
investments - with unit trusts used for overseas holdings.
Mr Philip Warland, the association's director-general, said the fall in
sales looked worse than it actually was because June's figures had been
inflated. He said: 'One member switched all their direct equity Personal
Equity Plans (a tax-free savings vehicle) into unit trust Peps which gave a
boost to the retail side.'
He said that this was not enough to explain the lower volume of net sales
across all distribution channels, but suggested that more people could be
holding cash.
The Building Societies Association has reported a rise in savings inflows
for July, with net receipts of Pounds 286m. It has had net outflows for four
of the past seven months.
Unit trusts attracted a record Pounds 9bn last year, in a climate of low
interest rates. They have pulled in Pounds 5.98bn in net sales so far this
year against Pounds 5.3bn in the same period last year.
The value of unit trust funds in July was Pounds 97.7bn.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Number of GCSE candidates up 2.8 per cent in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of candidates taking GCSE exams in England and Wales rose 2.8 per
cent last year - slightly more than the rise in the 16-year-old population,
John Authers writes.
Entries for mathematics rose 9.8 per cent. This contrasted with last week's
A-level results which showed a sharp fall in the subject's popularity.
Examiners attributed the rise to the national curriculum, which includes
mathematics as a core subject.
There were 30.9 per cent more entrants for general science. This subject is
increasingly replacing individual science subjects at GCSE, all of which
dropped at least 16 per cent and are now restricted mostly to independent
schools.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, said she hoped these figures
would 'encourage more pupils to opt for A-level study of science and
mathematics'.
Business studies proved popular, with the 7.8 per cent rise in applications
reflecting a trend also seen this year at A-level. This was balanced by a
drop of 16.3 per cent in economics entries.
There was a fall of 5.4 per cent in entries for English language, another
core subject of the national curriculum.
The new A* grade, introduced to recognise outstanding individuals, was
achieved by 2.9 per cent of entrants. Pass rates improved slightly. There
was a rise of 0.5 percentage points in the proportion passing with at least
a grade A; a rise of 0.7 percentage points in the proportions managing at
least a grade C; and of 0.3 percentage points in those passing with at least
a grade G.
Following claims that GCSE standards are falling, the examining boards said
they had 'made full use of scripts retained from the GCSE examinations of
1993' to ensure standards required for each grade had remained constant.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Council's police force plan criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans by Conservative-controlled Wandsworth council in London to establish a
municipal police force to patrol housing estates were criticised yesterday
by police organisations.
The council is considering extending its parks police patrols to estates,
using council staff sworn in by magistrates as constables and exercising
powers of arrest.
Mr Edward Lister, council leader, said on BBC Radio yesterday that problems
such as graffiti and vandalism made residents' lives miserable. The
council's plan was not a criticism of the Metropolitan Police.
Residents would finance patrols through higher rents or service charges.
The Association of Chief Police Officers questioned whether council staff
would receive sufficient training. The Police Federation said taxpayers in
Wandsworth were already financing a professional police force and should not
have to pay again.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Public sector warned of reforms' fraud risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's policy of breaking up large public-sector bureaucracies has
increased the risk of waste and opened more opportunities for dishonesty,
the Audit Commission warned yesterday.
The commission is responsible for audits in the local authority and health
sectors in England and Wales. The bodies it audits spend about Pounds 90bn
and employ 3m people.
Some managers and professional staff, it said, were handling large sums of
public money regardless of their expertise or experience.
Sir David Cooksey, the commission's chairman, said in his annual report that
early indications suggested the 'massive changes' taking place in the public
sector, with devolution of responsibility to large numbers of service
providers, were leading to better management and value for money.
But teething troubles were inevitable and change brought risks as well as
potential benefits, Sir David said. Accountability could be blurred as
responsibilities were reallocated.
He said: 'If the full benefits are to be gained, we must ensure that
effective mechanisms for accountability are put in place to underpin the
process of change and to ensure that the risks are minimised.'
Although a study by the commission of probity in local government had shown
that fraud and corruption were apparently low, Sir David said that there
were 'some signs that it could be on the increase'. The commission will
assess the extent of fraud and corruption in the National Health Service by
the end of this year.
He said: 'I remain concerned that some aspects of public expenditure are not
subject to adequate independent scrutiny.' Local authority companies, for
example, were subject to audit under the Companies Act, which provided a
'less rigorous regime of audit than that required by the Audit Commission
for other local-authority funds'. The commission would welcome legislation
to rectify this.
Sir David called for an early resolution to uncertainty caused by the
current review of local government structure. This was 'reducing the time
members and officers can devote to making their services more effective,
efficient and economical'.
The commission expresses concern that the standard spending assessment (SSA)
process, under which the government distributes Pounds 40bn a year to local
authorities and indicates appropriate spending levels, is leading to
'confusion of accountability'.
Neither central nor local government accepted responsibility for decisions
on particular services, while the complexity of the SSA formulas hid
underlying political choices, obscuring decisions and those responsible for
making them.
The report noted problems of efficiency and accountability in the policy of
local management of schools. While most schools had adapted well to managing
their own finances, 'green shoots of impropriety' were emerging in a few.
Some schools spent five times as much as others on administration, while
heads of similar schools spent anything from 5 per cent to 60 per cent of
their time managing budgets.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Lloyd's agent in Bermuda link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Lloyd's agent is teaming up with a Bermudian securities house to raise
fresh capital for the insurance market.
Venton Underwriting Agencies is turning to Butterfield Securities, a
subsidiary of Bermuda's Bank of Butterfield, to raise up to Pounds 25m from
UK, Bermudian and international investors.
The agency aims to increase business written by its three syndicates -
numbers 376, 1038 and 1183 - but does not plan to list the fund on the
London Stock Exchange immediately.
The new initiative is one of a number of so-called 'dedicated' vehicles that
are under consideration by managing agencies. Lloyd's is tipped to raise up
to an additional Pounds 250m in corporate funds, allowing it to increase
corporate capacity - the ability to accept premiums - by up to Pounds 500m
for the 1995 underwriting year.
Institutional investors raised more than Pounds 800m for the market last
year, with most of this capital invested in investment trusts supporting a
range of agents and syndicates.
Venton syndicates have a combined capacity of Pounds 185m. Syndicate 376,
which writes non-marine reinsurance, more than doubled its capacity this
year, increasing from less than Pounds 49m to more than Pounds 100m.
Separately, the Association of Lloyd's Members, the biggest organisation of
individual Names, yesterday forecast that Lloyd's would make profits of
between Pounds 900m and Pounds 1.15bn from business underwritten in its 1993
underwriting year.
The forecast, based on work by Financial Intelligence and Research, the
insurance analyst, is more optimistic than that of its rival Chatset, which
earlier this week predicted profits of Pounds 800m. Both, however, expect
1992 to produce an overall loss of about Pounds 1bn.
Lloyd's will report its results for 1992 and 1993 over the next two years in
line with its three-year accounting system.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Director disqualification cases almost double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of disqualification proceedings against company directors almost
doubled between the second quarter of last year and the same period this
year, official statistics showed yesterday.
However the number of disqualification orders made by the courts against
directors almost halved over the same period.
The Insolvency Service, an agency in the Department of Trade and Industry,
launched proceedings against 170 directors between April and June this year,
compared with 91 in the same period last year. The number of
disqualification orders fell from 126 to 66.
The DTI said it had no control over the decisions taken by the courts. 'We
can take prosecutions to court but we can't make the judge convict them,' it
said last night.
It said the increase in the number of reports and proceedings reflected the
response to a report from the National Audit Office, the Whitehall watchdog,
last year, which criticised the failure to pursue more directors.
Since then the Insolvency Service has hired temporary staff, arranged
special procedures to clear a backlog of reports, and started to put more
pressure on insolvency practitioners to file reports.
In the second quarter of this year 75 proceedings were launched based on
reports from official receivers in companies ordered to be wound up by the
courts, compared with 20 in the same period last year.

Some National Health Service trusts made annual surpluses of almost Pounds
4m in the first two years of operation, while others recorded losses of up
to Pounds 3.8m, Labour said yesterday.
Mr Alan Milburn, MP for Darlington, said an analysis of government figures
showed that the NHS had become 'a national lottery - producing losers as
well as winners.'
The health department said surpluses were used for patient care.

FT  25 AUG 94 / N Sea platforms to use wind power
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Amoco, the US oil company, is spending Pounds 200,000 on installing
wind-powered generators for equipment on its unmanned Davy and Bessemer
natural gas platforms in the North Sea off the East Anglian coast. The
bigger, manned platforms are unsuitable candidates because of their large
power requirements, which can be the equivalent of a town of 30,000 people.
The company expects to reap financial and environmental benefits. It
forecasts an 85 per cent reduction in spending on diesel, the fuel normally
used to power generators on unmanned platforms, and a 75 per cent cut in
hydrocarbon exhausts.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Barclays to launch complaint initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Bank will today launch an initiative directed at improving the way
it deals with complaints from customers, Alison Smith writes.
The new approach is intended to bring greater consistency in individual
branches' handling of complaints.
The announcement comes two weeks after Barclays' record pre-tax profits of
more than Pounds 1bn for the first half of this year provoked anger from
customers and the Consumers' Association.
It also follows an attempt by Midland Bank last month to target the personal
customers of its high-street rivals by promising a payment of Pounds 10 for
every error it made in transferring a current account.
Under Barclays' 'national complaints initiative' any of its 7m personal
customers who complains in person at a branch will be given a written record
of the complaint by the member of staff to whom they talk. This will act as
a 'receipt' for the complaint and the staff member will take responsibility
for seeing that it is resolved.
The bank's central complaints unit will monitor all complaints to build up a
picture of the overall standard of service provided.
Barclays said work had started on the initiative last year and not because
of recent criticism.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Swans takeover deal in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The survival prospects of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in
receivership, dimmed yesterday as the Ministry of Defence disclosed that
there was a problem with a contract transfer deal.
The MoD said the disagreement on the price at which the company's sole
contract should be transferred to its only prospective purchaser was a
'major obstacle'.
The chances of a sale of Swans to French-based Soffia/ Constructions
Mecaniques de Normandie depend on a deal in which CMN would take on Swans'
frigate contract from the MoD and subcontract it to the receiver, Price
Waterhouse.
Price Waterhouse has said that unless CMN starts paying Swans' technical and
design team by next Wednesday they will be made redundant immediately. This
would effectively end the company's chances of bidding for future work and
being sold as a going concern.
Yesterday the MoD said CMN was unwilling to negotiate on the price for the
transfer of the contract for the three Type 23 frigates that Swans was
fitting out when it went into receivership in May last year. The
receivership followed its failure to win an MoD helicopter carrier order.
The MoD said: 'Price is the major obstacle and they are unwilling to
negotiate on price.' It added there was 'little benefit' to the MoD, the
defence budget or the taxpayer in CMN's 'very conditional' agreement, but it
remained ready to negotiate.
CMN also had to satisfy a number of requirements, the MoD said, including
financial and performance guarantees.
Last month the MoD and CMN agreed a price of Pounds 57.7m for the contract
for the three frigates. Since two have been completed and handed over,
between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of this sum, relating to the last
frigate due for completion in late October, would actually change hands.
Mr Fred Henderson, CMN's lead negotiator, said yesterday that the MoD wanted
to drop the price to Pounds 57m.
He said: 'We'd say the key obstacle is the MoD's unwillingness to go through
with the price it agreed on July 19.'
He has called for an urgent meeting with the MoD but said he was not very
hopeful about CMN's chances of buying Swans.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Battle for the heart of once thriving town: Roland Adburgham
finds echoes of past defeats in Bridgwater
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A forlorn handwritten notice at what was once J. Sainsbury's store in
Bridgwater, Somerset, and is now an Oxfam charity shop, reads: 'Please do
not leave donations in doorway (due to arson).'
Sainsbury decamped five years ago to a superstore with 22 checkouts, a
coffee shop and petrol station, on the edge of the town centre. At
mid-morning its car park is stuffed with cars and the store is buzzing.
Meanwhile, back in town, a handful of people wander among the racks of
skirts (90p) and jackets (50p) in what locals refer to as 'the largest Oxfam
shop in Britain'.
In an even bigger shock to the town, Marks and Spencer pulled out of its
small but prime site soon after the move by Sainsbury. The nearest M and S
is now 11 miles down the M5 at Taunton. Its old premises are occupied by a B
Wise discount store with garish orange posters advertising a sale.
Bridgwater, with a population of 30,000, was a thriving industrial town,
renowned for its now-closed docks and its Guy Fawkes carnival.
Its doomed support for the Duke of Monmouth's rebellion is recalled by such
pubs as The Cross Rifles and The Volunteer Arms. Three hundred years ago the
locals lost the Battle of Sedgemoor. Today another battle is being lost.
The town's most famous son was Admiral Robert Blake, who died at sea in
1657. His statue, perhaps symbolically, shows him looking one way but
pointing another. In an era of fast-changing shopping trends, Bridgwater
shows little indication of knowing in which direction to take its centre.
Its modern covered shopping precinct, Angel Place, has a Safeway store, but
the company is building a superstore outside the town centre which it plans
to open next spring. To help it gain consent it has promised Sedgemoor
District Council, the planning authority, that it will continue trading at
Angel Place for two years.
More competition will come from a retail park being built next to the new
Sainsbury. It will include another food store, a Currys superstore,
Carpetright and Wickes building suppliers.
Much of central Bridgwater already looks down-at-heel. Around the old
Sainsbury, 10 other premises are vacant and several other sites are occupied
by charity shops. The landlord of a pub says he has tried to sell for 12
months. 'I don't think I'll get much for it.'
The pedestrianised main shopping street looks healthier. WH Smith is being
refurbished and the other shops include Dorothy Perkins, Boots and Next. The
stalls in the old market house may be tatty but there are plenty of
customers.
Walk a few yards and it becomes rather seedier. A gaggle of young travellers
drink cider. In the adjacent high street, there are eight empty premises and
yet more charity shops. EH Hooper, 'silk mercer &amp; draper, millinery &amp;
mantles', has a half-price clearance sale. The galleried chamber of the
former town hall, a handsome building designed in 1823, is occupied by
trestle tables with plants for sale.
Mr Mike Wain, owner of the Old Vicarage restaurant, said: 'In the town
centre there is a complete pattern of downtrading. Bridgwater can never
compete with Taunton, but it should be kept with its quaintness and funny
little shops. There needs to be complementary shopping to the superstores.
It's ever so sad. There's an awful lot of enthusiasm in the town - we want a
better town but we don't get any support from the council.'
Mr Nick Miles of the local business forum blamed the council for what he
described as its intransigence. 'The future is extremely gloomy. A lot of
people earn well but go elsewhere to shop. Bridgwater is a massively missed
opportunity,' he said.
Conservative-controlled Sedgemoor council commissioned Hillier Parker, the
property consultancy, to suggest how the heart of the town could be
revitalised. Among its recommendations was more pedestrianisation, but last
week councillors deferred a decision and will wait to see what impact the
new Safeway has on the area.
Mr Barry Juniper, the council's principal planning officer, said the council
was concerned but added: 'We all have to recognise that a lot of casualties
are due to the recession, as opposed to changing retail patterns.'
The council, he said, drew a firm distinction between edge-of-town retail
development, which it discouraged, and edge-of-centre. He was doubtful
whether there would have been grounds for refusing the existing
developments, even under the Department of the Environment's recent planning
guidance, which shows more concern for the viability of town centres.
He said: 'The council can't say 'come back M and S'. We would be wasting our
breath. But my own view is that we do need to do something about physically
improving the public spaces.'
A woman shopper was fatalistic. 'Bridgwater has lost a bit of character  -
but it seems to be happening everywhere, doesn't it?'
This is the last report in our series on the state of Britain's urban
centres. The previous two appeared in the Tuesday and Wednesday editions.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Labour attacks NHS 'lottery'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some National Health Service trusts made annual surpluses of almost Pounds
4m in the first two years of operation, while others recorded losses of up
to Pounds 3.8m, Labour said yesterday.
Mr Alan Milburn, MP for Darlington, said an analysis of government figures
showed that the NHS had become 'a national lottery - producing losers as
well as winners.'
The health department said surpluses were used for patient care. It said
trusts were 'treating record numbers of patients to an ever higher quality

FT  25 AUG 94 / RMT to ballot Tube workers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The executive of the RMT transport union yesterday decided to ballot London
Underground workers on a series of one-day strikes over pay.
The move followed a similar decision by Aslef, the train drivers' union, on
Tuesday. The RMT's 8,000 members and Aslef's 2,000 drivers on London
Underground will vote next month on whether to support a series of one-day
stoppages in protest at an imposed 2 per cent pay rise.
Voting will end on September 19. If underground workers voted to strike
action could be co-ordinated with the stoppages by RMT rail signal staff
working for Railtrack, intensifying disruption in the capital.
RMT accused London Underground of refusing to negotiate over this year's pay
award and complained that the imposed rise of 2 per cent was below the rate
of inflation.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Loophole tightens around tax gurus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax advisers were yesterday trying to find new ways through the
ever-diminishing loophole which allows companies to avoid National Insurance
contributions by paying employees in kind.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, announced on Tuesday that
gemstones and fine wines would be treated as earnings and therefore be
liable for National Insurance contributions.
The measure extended moves by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in the last
Budget to prevent gold bars and other tradeable commodities being used to
avoid contributions.
Mr Jim Yuill, director of social security services at accountant Ernst &amp;
Young, said: 'There are other ways of avoiding national insurance
contributions which have not yet been tried and we will be bringing them to
the fore in the next few weeks.'
He declined to be specific, in case of a pre-emptive move by the authorities
to block the proposals.
There are still a few NIC avoidance measures in existence, however. Mr Yuill
cited the controversial use of single-premium insurance policies. The DSS
says that there is legislation which should catch life insurance policies
but some accountants disagree. 'I'm sure it will end up in the courts,' Mr
Yuill said.
He added: 'The employer takes out a policy on the life of the employee for a
small amount, say Pounds 100, which is caught by NICs. The trick then is to
inflate the value of the policy by making a second and large payment which
escapes NIC liability. The employee then cashes the policy in.'
Other tricks to make payments in kind include giving high street store gift
vouchers, paying for employees' holidays and buying cars for them.
Like gold bars, diamonds and wine, these are taxable benefits but they have
not been widely favoured by employees because they are not as easily
encashable.
Mr Martin Kaye, managing-director of Stoy Benefit Consulting, said: 'It will
never be the same again.' He believed that one alternative for employers was
to turn to antiques, which have a mature market in the auction rooms.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Money supply cap raised in Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRASLIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil has been forced to increase its money supply limits, imposed in July
as part of the launch of the country's new currency, the Real. The limits,
designed to stem inflation by curbing the government's ability to print
money, are being lifted to a total of RDollars 9bn (Pounds 6.5bn) by the end
of next month, instead of RDollars 7.5bn.
Mr Rubens Ricupero, finance minister, denied money supply was growing too
quickly or that the increase threatened to stoke inflation. Instead, he and
private sector analysts pointed out it was difficult to estimate money
supply growth following a new currency's launch.
Before the Real, when inflation reached 50 per cent a month, people invested
or spent money rather than hold cash, which lost purchasing power daily.
With the new currency, inflation has fallen to under 5 per cent a month and
consumers seem to be holding more wealth as cash, leading to demand for bank
notes and coins. 'The basic reasons (for the increased limits) are to do
with the demand on the part of people for more money,' said Mr Ricupero.
'This reflects confidence in the new currency.'
The government originally planned to reach the RDollars 9bn figure for the
total money stock in April. Some analysts caution that any further increase
in the money supply limits could lead to doubts about the Real's longer term
stability.

FT  25 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Securities houses get Taiwan's approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to announce final
approval today on applications by eight foreign securities houses to
establish branches on the island as part of a broader deregulation of the
securities industry.
The SEC yesterday said Japan's big four securities firms (Nomura, Daiwa,
Yamaichi and Nikko), Britain's Baring Securities and SG Warburg, WI Carr
(the broking arm of Banque Indo-Suez of France), and Goldman Sachs of the
US, were qualified to upgrade their representative offices to branches.
Until now, Merrill Lynch has been the only foreign brokerage permitted to
have a branch in Taiwan, allowing it to engage in a wider range of business
activities than those houses limited to representative offices.
The Taiwanese government, which has itself had a vested corporate interest
in a closed market, now suggests it would like to develop the island as a
regional financial centre.
Liberalisation of the financial industry, long closed to foreign
institutions, is also part of Taiwan's campaign to gain admission to the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
SG Warburg said last night it was 'delighted' at the decision, which had
followed its application for a branch office licence earlier this summer.
Taiwan last year eased the capitalisation rules for foreign brokerages to
set up a branch on the island, lowering the minimum capitalisation from
TDollars 200m to TDollars 100m (Dollars 7.5m to Dollars 3.78m).
However foreign brokers are still required to have operated a representative
office for a year before they can apply to set up a branch.
The government also said that, in the longer term, banks would be able to
expand their activities by underwriting commercial paper.
Banks are currently banned from underwriting commercial paper.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Shock waves hit defence contractors: Pentagon in bid to
cancel new weapons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Pentagon order to examine delaying or cancelling most of the armed
services' biggest new weapons systems has sent shock waves through the
defence industry and Congress.
Defence contractors, while officially silent on an issue that they say is
the Pentagon's decision, are warning that serious cuts in procurement
programmes could mean the US will enter the second decade of the next
century with ageing equipment and no technological edge over its opponents.
And some members of Congress say the order, which tells the services to
produce plans for cancelling or postponing 10 of their largest equipment
projects in order to fit inside the budget envelope, is new evidence that
the Pentagon needs to rethink last year's Bottom Up Review.
The review spelt out the force structure that would be needed in order to be
able to fight two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts. But some
critics say that goal is too ambitious to fit in today's budget - either the
mission must be scaled back, or the money available for defence must be
increased.
'Now the question is whether they are going to be true to the Bottom Up
Review with the budget they have. It might make the Congress and the
administration think whether they are going to abandon that or find more
money,' said Mr Don Fuqua, president of the Aerospace Industries
Association.
The order to rethink the major weapons programmes, which came in a
memorandum from Mr John Deutch, the deputy defence secretary, has also
anguished members of Congress, who have only just agreed on the final
version of their defence authorisation bill for next fiscal year.
Although the Deutch memo is part of the budget process for fiscal 1996, some
members are irked by the thought of wasting money on programmes which
already face the axe.
The programmes targeted by Mr Deutch include the air force's F-22 fighter,
the army's Comanche helicopter, the navy's Aegis destroyer and the marines'
V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft.
Mr Garry Riley, vice-president of Lockheed and project manager for the F-22,
declined to comment on the Pentagon's plan, but argued that the F-22, which
would replace the current F-15 Eagle and is built jointly by two Lockheed
divisions and Boeing, would be needed in the 21st century.
'The F-15 is a super airplane. It is able to hold its own with today's
threat. But 20 years from today it won't be able to hold its own and that's
why we need the F-22,' Mr Riley said yesterday.
Mr Deutch stressed that his list was of candidates for cancellation or
postponement, and no decisions had yet been made. But he acknowledged that
the budget crunch was forcing the Pentagon to trade some of its long-term
modernisation in order to maintain good operating conditions for the troops
today.
'The fact of the matter is we are delaying modernisation and capitalisation
for near-term readiness and people,' he said, adding that the less
sophisticated enemies faced by the US today left some room to do this.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Cuban exiles await the green light from US: James Harding
hears Bay of Pigs veterans vent their views on the continuing exodus from
the island
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 2506 Brigade is in a belligerent mood. At its Miami headquarters, the
members of the Bay of Pigs invasion force that made an abortive bid to
overthrow President Fidel Castro in April 1961 think it is time to take
another shot at the Cuban leader.
'We sense this is the beginning of the end,' says Mr Jorge Marquet, former
infantryman in the brigade's 5th battalion. 'A revolution is able to succeed
at any moment. 2506 Brigade wants to be with our brothers in Cuba. We are
again willing to sacrifice our lives.'
Washington is unlikely to share some of the brigade veterans' enthusiasm for
another US-sponsored expeditionary force. The Bay of Pigs invasion, in which
some 1,500 anti-Castro Cuban exiles were landed on the island's southwest
shore in a US-financed and directed operation only to be defeated and
captured within four days, is widely seen as an exemplary military bungle.
However, 2506 Brigade veterans include some of the most prominent members of
the Cuban American community, and represent an influential cross-section of
opinion.
Most conspicuous and politically astute of the 2506 alumni is Mr Jorge Mas
Canosa. Mr Mas, a member of 2506 Brigade's naval force and now one of
Miami's leading businessmen, is the founder and chairman of the Cuban
American National Foundation, the community's most powerful lobby.
On Friday Mr Mas flew up to Washington with Florida's Governor Lawton Chiles
for a private meeting with President Bill Clinton after the US broke with 28
years of policy and announced that Cuban refugees would no longer be
welcomed in the US. Instead, they would be taken to a detention camp at the
US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.
Following the meeting the US announced it would tighten its embargo on the
island, a move the foundation endorsed. 'We support the whole package,' one
official said.
However, not all Bay of Pigs veterans support the bar on refugees entering
the US. Mr Arturo Cobo, 3rd battalion veteran and director of the Key West
Transit Centre for Cuban Refugees, advocates an international embargo and
rejects the new detention policy.
His priority is 'assisting my sisters and brothers escaping Cuba for freedom
in the US.' Despite the change in policy that has ended the tide of Cubans
coming through his centre, Mr Cobo keeps the doors open in the hope that
'things will get back to normal immigration policy.'
Adopting an even tougher line is Mr Jose Miro, 2nd battalion infantryman and
current president of the Brigade. Mr Miro is drawing up plans for a new
Cuban-American invasion force. On Monday night Mr Miro, a Cuban-trained
lawyer and now retired life insurance salesman, met his board of directors
at the brigade's headquarters and memorial hall.
On the back wall of the meeting room hang the pictures of the 114 Bay of
Pigs martyrs; left of the speaker's podium a perspex box contains a model of
Havana's future Cuban Memorial Museum which will chart the fight for
independence from the battle against the Spanish to the overthrow of Fidel
Castro.
At the top of Mr Miro's agenda was the need to start recruiting a new force
to overthrow the Cuban president. Mr Miro did not foresee any problems in
gathering the 25,000 people he estimates he needs to defeat Mr Castro.
'All we need from the US government is the equipment and a green light,' he
says. He subscribes to the pressure cooker theory - if the Cuban people are
forced to stay under deteriorating conditions caused by a full blockade,
they will ultimately rise up and overthrow their oppressor.
However, Mr Castro's imminent downfall has been predicted for many years. In
front of Mr Miro's office hangs the 2506 Brigade standard. It was handed to
President John F. Kennedy after the US paid a Dollars 53m ransom for the
release of Bay of Pigs captives held in Cuba for 20 months.
At the presentation in Miami's Orange Bowl, President Kennedy said: 'I can
assure you that this flag will be returned to this brigade in a free
Havana.'
That was December 1962 and the standard is still in Miami.

Mr Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party won
more than 50 per cent of the vote in Sunday's presidential election,
according to the latest figures released by the Federal Electoral Institute,
writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
The PRI vote has edged above the symbolically important 50 per cent mark
thanks to strong support in rural areas, where ballots have been counted
last. With about 90 per cent of results in, the PRI vote stood at 50.1 per
cent, the centre-right National Action Party at 26.8 per cent, and the
leftist Party of Democratic Revolution at 17 per cent. Turnout was 77.6 per
cent, far higher than predicted.

FT  25 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Clinton pulls out all the stops over
fast-track - But he seems set to pay a heavy price to clinch an accord with
Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton will win an important victory if he succeeds in his
ambitious attempt to get Congressional renewal of fast-track authority to
negotiate new trade deals along with legislation to implement the Uruguay
Round.
His trade officials have already had to severely weaken language allowing
inclusion of labour and the environment in future deals. This has infuriated
many Democrats but also left unsatisfied many Republicans, who would like to
totally forgo the option.
Mr Harry Freeman, a veteran of many trade battles in Washington, has
concluded that even if the president gets his fast-track, he will have paid
a heavy price.
'This fast-track has less freedom for the executive branch,' he said. 'I've
never seen a fast-track that had such specificity in the negotiating goals,'
he said.
Besides excluding labour and environment as negotiating objectives, the
current fast-track language agreed with House Republicans specifically
endorses negotiating trade in services, financial services and
telecommunications.
It orders the Administration to 'maintain vigorous and effective disciplines
on subsidies practices with respect to civil aircraft products' under the
multilateral subsidies code.
The fast-track concept was developed in 1974 when Mr Dick Rivers, then a
staffer at the Senate finance committee, wrote a memo suggesting Congress
cede to the executive branch authority to negotiate trade deals and promise
that any trade agreements reached would be considered by Congress on 'a
fast-track.'
This meant that any deal would get a simply up or down vote with no
Congressional amendments.
'Each house of the Congress can even now change the procedures in a New York
minute,' he says now. 'But without a fast-track there won't be significant
trade negotiations.'
This is well understood by the Clinton Administration, which could have
waited until next year to push for a fast-track.
But it badly wanted the authority for the president when he goes to Jakarta
for the annual meeting of the Asian Pacific Economic Council and Miami for
the Summit of the Americas. The Apec agenda has grown increasingly
ambitious; it could propose negotiations for a regional investment treaty at
the very least.
In the Americas, there is a free trade deal long promised to Chile to
pursue, and the hemispheric economic integration under study.
The former executive director of the MTN Coalition, the business group which
lobbied for years for passage of the Uruguay Round, Mr Freeman was leery
about a fast-track fight this year.
'But when the administration decided to go for fast-track it crossed the
Rubicon,' said Mr Freeman. 'There is no backtracking. A defeat means red
faces in Jakarta and Miami.'
Defeat is still possible. Senate Patrick Moynihian, chairmn of the finance
committee, is unenthusiastic at best. Senator John Danforth, the leading
Republican, is opposed. Senator John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, just
does not like a fast-track request included on a fast-track vote.
The AFL-CIO, the umbrella labour group, had been unenthusiastic but quiet
about the Uruguay Round, but it is moving into active opposition on
fast-track.
Mr Freeman is more optimistic about its approval than some trade officials.
But, he said, 'it has become a matter of politics rather than trade policy'.

FT  25 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Japan has eyes for Vietnam's market - Many
companies are studying the possibility of investing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Japan's Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama arrives in Hanoi today, his
Vietnamese hosts will be hoping that their guest, in true Japanese
tradition, does not arrive empty-handed.
For whatever small gift Mr Murayama may bring with him, whether it be a
rumoured expansion of trade insurance coverage or even a murmur of support
for greater trade, is likely to have a favourable effect on economic
relations between the two countries.
While Japan is Vietnam's largest donor of official development aid, and
responsible for 27 per cent of the trade Vietnam does with the rest of the
world, it has contributed only about 5 per cent of the value of foreign
direct investment in Vietnam and ranks seventh after countries such as
Taiwan, Hong Kong and others in the Asia-Pacific region.
'In many respects, the conditions are not yet ripe for Japanese companies to
invest in Vietnam,' says Mr Morihito Kosuda, of Nissho Iwai, a Japanese
trading and publishing company.
It is true that in the past few years, interest in Vietnam both as a market
and manufacturing base has spread considerably among Japanese businesses. A
wide range of companies, from machinery makers to financial institutions,
have opened offices in Vietnam; some manufacturers have started to implement
local production plans.
Mitsubishi Materials and Nihon Cement have tied up with a Vietnamese public
corporation to build the country's largest cement facility with a capacity
of 2.3m tonnes a year.
Mitsubishi Motors and Mitsubishi Corp, the trading house, have set up a
joint venture company with Proton, the Malaysian vehicle maker, and a
Vietnamese public corporation, to make small buses. Production of an initial
1,000 buses a year is scheduled to start early next year and the company
hopes to make passenger cars eventually.
Showa Plastics and Sanyo, the consumer electronics company, through their
joint venture company in Singapore, are building a factory in Ho Chi Minh
City to manufacture TV exteriors and video-tape recorders which they hope
will eventually manufacture air conditioners, washing machines and
refrigerators.
Fuji Bank, which is doing buoyant business guaranteeing letters of credit
issued by Vietnamese banks, hopes to upgrade its office in Vietnam to a
branch next year so that it can meet the growing needs of Japanese
businesses.
Many more companies, including Sony and Toyota, are studying possibilities
in the Vietnamese market.
But on the whole, Japanese companies have been relatively slow to respond to
the emerging opportunities in Vietnam.
'The Vietnamese market will eventually grow into a very big one, there is no
disagreement on that,' says Mr Kosuda. 'Where opinion is divided is on the
short to medium-term prospects.'
Japanese companies frequently cite the poor state of Vietnam's
infrastructure as a deterrent to investment.
'If you go to Ho Chi Minh City, this is immediately noticeable,' says Mr
Hiroshi Matsumoto, of the trading company Mitsui, which has been exporting
oil and sea food from Vietnam to Japan and importing machinery and chemicals
from Japan. 'Power shortages are frequent and the basic infrastructure, such
as ports and roads, is lacking'.
The relative lack of information on Vietnam and the difficulty of procuring
materials, combined with the inherent caution that Japanese businesses have
towards investing overseas, has also held back many companies.
'Vietnam is going through a period of reconstruction after the war and of
transition from a social planning economy to a more market-oriented one at
the same time,' Nissho Iwai's Mr Kosuda says. 'That makes it very difficult
to ascertain the true state of the markets there.'
Honda, for example, despite having more than 90 per cent of the Vietnamese
market for motorbikes, exports neither motorbikes nor vehicles. Many were
sold into Vietnam prior to the Vietnam war, while others have come in from
third countries. 'We don't have the information and the know-how to justify
the considerable investment that would be required to start local
manufacturing,' a company representative says.
It is, anyway, early days for Japanese companies, which tend to take a
long-term view, says Mr Kosuda. 'It is only six months since the US embargo
was lifted, and some Japanese companies only started to think about Vietnam
after that.'
Another powerful disincentive for Japanese companies, says Mr Kosuda, is the
lack of an official government system supporting Japanese trade and
investment in Vietnam. 'The only formal agreement Japan has with Vietnam is
the bilateral aviation accord signed in May.'
Vietnam has much that Japan is seeking. Unlike most other oil sources in
south-east Asia, Vietnam produces oil that is the right price and quality
for the Japanese market, especially the electricity industry, with Japan
buying 70 per cent of Vietnamese oil, according to the Japan External Trade
Organisation. Oil, sea food and garments, all of which face growing demand
in Japan, are Vietnam's biggest export income earners.
If the Japanese government now gives a concrete sign of its support for
greater trade and investment in Vietnam, it will be sending a strong message
to Japanese businesses, Mr Kosuda adds.

<TEXT>
India is about to announce partial liberalisation of its pharmaceutical
industry, in a move which would cut price controls and allow foreign groups
to take majority stakes in their Indian ventures.
The announcement, expected in the next few days, will help revive confidence
in the government's commitment to economic reform and counter criticism that
the liberalisation programme started three years ago is flagging.
The Indian drugs industry has operated for many years under a strict regime
of price controls aimed at ensuring that even the poor have access to
pharmaceuticals. Premier P V Narasimha Rao was initially reluctant to
liberalise the industry, for fear of provoking a backlash from those who
feared decontrol would lead to socially unacceptable price increases. He now
wants to promote investment in the industry, but important curbs will
remain.
Under the new rules, the number of drugs which cannot be sold above
government-specified prices will be cut from 142 to 73. Drugs, which now
come under price controls if their annual sales exceed Rs5m, will now be
free of controls unless their sales exceed Rs40m (Pounds 824,000) a year.
Foreign companies, at present limited to holding minority stakes in Indian
affiliates, will be permitted to buy up to 51 per cent stakes in companies
making bulk drugs, the staples of the industry. The number of drugs that can
be made only by state-owned drugs companies is being cut.
The government hopes the new policy will encourage Indian companies to
invest in research and development. Until now, they have spent little on
research.
Foreign companies are unlikely to rush into India, because they are
concerned about the country's patent laws, which recognise only process
patents and not product patents. This means that Indian drugs companies can
copy western products as long as they find a slightly different way of
making them. Under Gatt's Uruguay Round accord, India is pledged to
strengthening its patent laws, but the legislation has yet to come before
parliament.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Durable goods orders fall 4.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US durable goods orders fell 4.2 per cent in July, the biggest decline in 2
1/2 years, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
The drop in demand surprised analysts, many of whom had been predicting a
moderate rise following strong increases of 1.2 per cent in June and 1.4 per
cent in May.
The drop in new orders by Dollars 6.4bn to a seasonally adjusted Dollars
144.9bn was largely attributed to a decline in orders for transportation
equipment, which fell by 15.8 per cent last month to an adjusted Dollars
31.91bn.
The substantial fall reflected the growing practice in the motor vehicle and
parts industry of shutting down for two weeks in July, the Commerce
Department said. Analysts expected a resurgence of motor industry orders in
August and September as 1995 models went into production.
The 4.2 per cent drop was the largest month-on-month drop since a 5.4 per
cent drop in December 1991. But new orders are up 13.3 per cent over the
same period a year ago.
Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the drop in durable goods orders did
not indicate an economic slowdown. 'We think the economy is ticking along
well,' he said.
The markets reacted positively. Although analysts had predicted a moderate
rise in durable goods orders of between 1 per cent and 3 per cent, the drop
seems to have been welcomed as evidence there will be a slowing in economic
growth in the second half of this year. Mr Ram Bhagvatula, Citibank's chief
economist in New York, welcomed the drop, saying that in combination with
the Federal Reserve's rate rise last week, the economy could expect to see a
moderation in production in the second half of the year.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Zedillo vote passes 50% mark in Mexican poll
</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party won
more than 50 per cent of the vote in Sunday's presidential election,
according to the latest figures released by the Federal Electoral Institute.
The PRI vote has edged above the symbolically important 50 per cent mark
thanks to its strong support in rural areas, where ballots have been counted
last. With about 90 per cent of results in, the PRI vote stood at 50.1 per
cent, the centre-right National Action Party at 26.8 per cent, and the
leftist Party of Democratic Revolution at 17 per cent. The turnout in the
election was 77.6 per cent, far higher than had been predicted.
While the election is widely regarded to have been much cleaner than those
in Mexico's past, Civic Alliance, the most prominent group of election
observers, has reported widespread irregularities that in says call into
question the legality of the result.
In 34 per cent of polling booths surveyed the vote was not secret, in 16.5
per cent voters were put under pressure, in 10.2 per cent at least one
person voted who was not on the polling station's electoral list, and in 8.2
per cent people were allowed to vote who had indelible ink on their thumb
suggesting they had voted before.
The latest polling figures show the PRI having won all 32 states in Senate
elections, having narrowly defeated the centre-right PAN in the state of
Jalisco, and at least 278 of the 300 districts in the election for the
Chamber of Deputies. Under Mexico's complex electoral system, which assigns
a proportion of congressional seats to the opposition, the ruling party will
have 95 of the 128 seats in the Senate, and 300 of the 500 seats in the
Chamber of Deputies.
The big PRI victory led to falls in long-term interest rates yesterday, with
rates on one-year paper declining to 12.43 per cent. However 28-day paper
yields rose and the stockmarket was down nearly 1 per cent by mid-morning.

FT  25 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Securities houses get Taiwan's approval
</HEADLINE>

   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to give final
approval today on applications by eight foreign securities houses to set up
branch offices on the island, writes Laura Tyson in Taipei.
The SEC yesterday said Japan's big four securities firms (Nomura, Daiwa,
Yamaichi and Nikko), Britain's Baring Securities and S G Warburg, W I Carr,
the broking arm of Banque Indo-Suez of France, and the Goldman Sachs of the
US were all qualified to upgrade from representative offices to branch
offices.
For several years Merrill Lynch has been the only foreign brokerage
permitted to maintain a branch in Taiwan.
Foreign brokers will have nine branches and 16 representative offices in
Taiwan, according to the SEC.
Taiwan last year eased the capitalisation rules for foreign brokerages to
set up a branch on the island, lowering the minimum capitalisation from
TDollars 200m to TDollars 100m (Dollars 7.5m to Dollars 3.78m). But foreign
brokers are still required to have operated a representative office for a
year before applying to set up a branch.
In another liberalisation move, the finance ministry said yesterday said it
would allow new companies to underwrite short-term paper, with a minimum
capitalisation of TDollars 2bn. The government also said banks would be
allowed to underwrite and certify commercial paper a year after these rules
took effect.
Banks are currently banned from underwriting commercial paper, and there are
only three companies underwriting short-term paper, all of them government
owned.
In a related development, the finance ministry plans to break the monopoly
held by the Kuomintang-controlled Fuh-Hwa Securities Finance Corp, Taiwan's
only margin finance lender. Four business groups have applied to set up
securities finance firms.
Taiwan's financial deregulation is being motivated in part by its desire to
expedite entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Arafat extends grip over West Bank: Accord will give
Palestinians control of five services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GAZA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation last night initialled an
agreement in Cairo to extend Palestinian powers across the Israeli-occupied
West Bank.
Under the agreement, known as early empowerment, Palestinians will assume
authority over the five West Bank services of tourism, health, social
welfare, direct taxation and education for up to 1m people.
The Israeli military-run Civil Administration will control all other
government functions until after Palestinian elections, due in December.
The handover gives Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, his first formal
foothold in the heart of the still occupied West Bank. The PLO had pressed
Israel for a speedy extension of powers over the West Bank, saying it was
vital to maintain the peace momentum and shore up fragile Palestinian
support for Mr Arafat's concessions to Israel in negotiations since last
August.
With early empowerment under way, Mr Arafat will be better placed to fend
off critics who said he would end up as mayor of a desert strip and Israel
would drive a wedge between Gaza and the West Bank.
Talks can now begin about the much more difficult third stage of the
process: redeployment of Israeli troops out of Palestinian population
centres in the West Bank and the holding of the Palestinian elections.
Education will be the first significant service handed over to Palestinian
administration. Israel has said it will complete the full transfer to
Palestinian control by the start of the school year on September 1.
The Civil Administration yesterday handed authority to Palestinians over 150
government-run schools, educational institutions and offices of the
education department in the Ramallah area.
Mr Naim Abu al-Humos, Palestinian director-general of education, said the
West Bank's six remaining school districts would be transferred by August
29, including buildings, supplies and textbooks at present owned by the
Civil Administration.
The success of the handover will determine the pace of peace talks and
depend largely on the PLO's ability to fund services. Already, the
cash-strapped Palestinian National Authority is struggling to administer for
the 850,000 residents of Gaza-Jericho.
Tax collection is almost non-existent and the PNA treasury largely depends
on the slow drip of international aid and the transfer of Customs duties
collected by Israel on Palestinian imports, so far worth Shk13.5m (Pounds
2.8m).
Israel has voiced concern about the PNA's ability to fund West Bank services
amid predictions that revenue collections, particularly of income tax, which
yielded Shk143m last year, would fall far short of the money collected by
Israel during its occupation. The PNA treasury will be deprived of West Bank
Customs revenues until after the elections.
Israel and the PLO will make a joint approach to international donors to
seek allocation of a contingency fund worth Dollars 9.5m (Pounds 6.3m) a
month for six months. The extra money comes on top of Dollars 13m a month
the PNA can draw from a special fund for the running expenses of its
administration in Gaza-Jericho.
Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, claimed yesterday the World Bank had
made a serious error of judgment by not infusing emergency funds quickly
into the self-rule areas; he warned that economic problems and high
expectations would lead to unrest.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Bhutto denounces N-bomb claim: Opposition backtracks on
Sharif's assertion of nuclear capability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's prime minister, yesterday denounced as
irresponsible the assertion by former premier Nawaz Sharif that Pakistan has
nuclear weapons. Mr Sharif on Tuesday warned that any attack on Pakistan by
India could spark nuclear war between them.
India has seized the occasion to demand international action to halt any
nuclear weapons programme in Pakistan.
'The curtain of ambiguity about Pakistan's nuclear programme has fallen
off,' a Foreign Ministry spokesman in New Delhi said. 'It is a matter of
grave concern that Pakistan is actively pursuing this nuclear weapons
programme and is clandestinely procuring materials in this regard, as is
evident from recent reports,' he said.
The Indian spokesman was referring to investigations by Berlin authorities
into an alleged conspiracy to smuggle plutonium, used in the manufacture of
nuclear weapons, to Pakistan. Islamabad has denied involvement in any
plutonium plot.
Pakistan's opposition Moslem League party yesterday tried to back away from
Mr Sharif's statement that Pakistan had produced nuclear weapons.
Pakistan and India have fought two wars over Kashmir which both nations say
belongs to them. They came near a third war in 1990 and many fear any future
battle could quickly escalate into a nuclear exchange.
Like India, Pakistan is believed to have all the necessary components needed
for a bomb and the ability to assemble one in a matter of days or even
hours.
Pakistan's military and political leaders say the nuclear programme is
needed to deter India, its arch-rival. But successive governments, including
Mr Sharif's, have maintained that the country has stopped short of building
a bomb.
Mr Sharif refused to answer journalists' questions after a three-hour
meeting of his party's leadership in Islamabad yesterday. Instead, Mr
Chaudhary Shujaat Hussain, an opposition senator, accused Ms Bhutto's
government of 'exploiting the issue surrounding Mr Sharif's statement, to
divert attention from a planned opposition campaign next month'.
But some officials suspected Mr Sharif had sparked the controversy in an
effort to seek public support, especially from nationalists, ahead of an
anti-government protest planned to begin in about three weeks.
Others, however, suggested he had probably miscalculated the sensitivity of
the issue. 'Sharif must now be thinking it was wrong to make such a
statement in public. The nuclear issue can be extremely testy in the west,'
one senior western diplomat said last night.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sri Lanka's new government is planning to remove an economic embargo on the
northern Jaffna peninsula controlled by Tamil rebels, Mr Anuruddha Ratwatte,
deputy defence minister, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Colombo.
'We are discussing lifting the embargo with the service chiefs because we
want to relieve the pressure on the local population,' he stated. The people
of Jaffna were suffering from a scarcity of food, and high prices of basic
goods.
The previous government imposed a goods embargo on the north covering 42
items, including batteries, electronic toys, sweets, bullion, medicines,
fuel and matches. It said the goods could be used by the Tamil rebels in
their war against government forces.
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have been fighting in the north and
east for a separate state for their minority Tamil community. Their
stronghold is Jaffna.
Mr Ratwatte said the government's priority was to end the war, which has
cost more than 30,000 lives, through a negotiated political solution. 'The
prime minister has asked them to come for talks. We are waiting for a
response.'
The government would confine to the north and east a state of emergency,
enforced countrywide after last week's parliamentary elections. The People's
Alliance triumphed in last week's election, defeating the United National
party which had ruled for 17 years.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Business urges links with North Korea: John Burton reports
form Seoul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea's main opposition Democratic party is not normally known for
being pro-big business, but this week it publicly voiced what many
executives are saying in private about the government's refusal to allow
economic co-operation with North Korea until the dispute over Pyongyang's
nuclear programme is solved.
'By maintaining the policy of linking the nuclear issue and economic
co-operation, the government is losing out on economic interests in the
North to other countries like the US and Japan,' the party supreme council
said.
It was only two months ago that South Korean companies were reviving
investment plans for North Korea because of the prospect of improved
relations resulting from a proposed inter-Korean summit.
South Korean companies, such as Daewoo and Samsung, are eager to enter the
North to employ its cheap and disciplined workers for the labour-intensive
textile and consumer electronics industries, which are losing their
international competitiveness because of rising wage costs in the South.
But the sudden death of North Korean President Kim Il-sung in early July
post-oned the planned summit and Seoul has adopted a tough stance toward
Pyongyang since then.
'South Korea is losing a golden opportunity to establish an early economic
presence in the North, while giving a helping hand to the reformers in
Pyongyang who want to open North Korea to foreign investment,' said one east
European diplomat. 'A conciliatory economic policy would stabilise North
Korea and prevent its sudden collapse, which Seoul fears.'
South Korean President Kim Young-sam's recent hardline attitude toward the
North is seen as an attempt to win the domestic political support of
conservatives, while avoiding giving a stamp of legitimacy to the North's
new and uncertain leadership under Mr Kim Jong-il.
'The government is facing a dilemma on the economic issue with North Korea.
It wants to use economic co-operation as a leverage to win political
concessions from Pyongyang on the nuclear question and other issues.
But it also fears that if it waits too long, it would allow Japanese and US
companies to establish a foothold in North Korea before South Korea does,'
said Mr Koh Il-dong, a researcher on the North Korean economy at the
state-funded Korea Development Institute.
North Korea is soliciting IBM and other US blue-chip companies to invest in
the country's first free trade and economic zone in the Rajin-Sonbong region
in expectation of improved relations with Washington. Japan already has a
presence in North Korea through a number of small joint ventures managed by
pro-Pyongyang Korean-Japanese.
South Korea has also forged tentative business ties with the North, with
inter-Korean trade amounting to Dollars 113m (Pounds 73m) during the first
seven months of this year.
Lucky-Goldstar and a few other South Korean companies are using North Korean
factories to reprocess garments. Seoul is also a big importer of mineral
products, such as gold and zinc, from the North, which enjoys a heavily
lopsided trade surplus with the South.
It is clear the South Korean government is preparing to support a
significant economic leap into North Korea if the recent framework agreement
between Washington and Pyongyang bears fruit and solves the nuclear dispute.
Seoul has heavily lobbied the US to win its support for the supply of South
Korean light-water reactors to replace the North's dangerous graphite ones
as part of the nuclear deal.
Seoul is also studying plans to provide electricity to North Korea to reduce
energy shortages during the 8-10 years that it would take to build the
light-water reactors.
The South Korean conglomerates want to undertake other infrastructure
projects in the North. Hyundai has expressed interest in rebuilding the
North's poor rail and road networks as well as establishing tourism
facilities and a ship repair yard.
Several producers of cement and construction materials, such as Ssangyong
and Tongyang, have discussed the possibility of establishing facilities in
the North to provide supplies to reconstruction projects.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Gaza security chief criticises leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GAZA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The commander of the Palestinian security forces said yesterday he could
prevent attacks against Israelis by Islamic extremists in Gaza and improve
security if he was given the political go-ahead by Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO
chairman.
In an interview in his Gaza headquarters Maj Gen Nasr Yussuf said the
Palestinian 'political leadership' had failed to take clear decisions about
curbing attacks by Hamas guerrillas and confiscating weapons. He also said
the autonomous operations of Mr Arafat's 500-strong armed plain clothes
Mukhabarat, or Palestinian Preventive Security Apparatus (PPSA), made
security enforcement much more difficult.
The remarks expose the frustration within the professional military and
police establishments with Mr Arafat's murky security policy and his
determination to maintain competing security forces which report directly to
him.
The rare public criticism of Mr Arafat's leadership is likely to spark a
fierce internal Palestinian debate and be seized upon by Israel as evidence
that Mr Arafat is not fully committed to his security obligations under the
peace accords.
Israel has accused the Palestinians of easing up on measures against
extremist guerrillas and said yesterday the PLO had released four Islamic
activists they say are responsible for the May 20 killing of three Israeli
soldiers in Gaza.
Gen Yussuf confirmed that all 40 Hamas activists arrested recently had been
released from his custody and said: 'The political leadership should
identify a clear-cut policy on how to deal with the armed opposition
elements and the use of weapons.' He added that 'for sure' his 7,200-strong
force could deal with Hamas if given the authority to do so.
The general warned that if Hamas was not confronted soon it could grow in
strength. He said the police had been operating under a policy of
confiscating weapons on the street but that this policy had now been
suspended. He said there was an urgent need for a unified and integrated
security command.
A senior official in Mr Arafat's 'Office of the President' denied there was
mounting tension between the military and the PLO chairman but admitted
there were divisions of opinion over what measures should be taken against
Hamas. 'We can't do what the Egyptians or the Algerians are doing and risk a
civil war here,' he said. 'We will not allow people to break the law but
there are limits and we can't risk breaking the whole country apart.'
Gen Yussuf said his police force was desperately in need of funds to pay
salaries and meet running costs. He said he had received only Dollars
880,000 (Pounds 570,000) from 'the political leadership' and had run up
debts worth Dollars 900,000 to local traders for food, clothes and
furniture.
The general said salaries of Dollars 260 a month had led at least four
policemen to sell their weapons to extremists in Gaza and he had dealt with
a few cases of bribery and smuggling.
Britain has pledged Pounds 5m for salaries and equipment, and donors are in
the process of organising a special 'cop' fund worth Dollars 7m a month to
pay for salaries, training and running expenses of the police as they get
set to spread out from Gaza-Jericho to the West Bank. But Gen Yussuf said
the money was slow in coming from donors to the PLO and from the PLO
political leadership to the police force.

<TEXT>
At first glance, business seems to be booming at the Mobil filling station
in Awolowo Road, Lagos. The forecourt is jammed with cars in a queue which
stretches two abreast a quarter of a mile down the road. But the pumps have
been dry for nine days and this month's sales are about 80 per cent below
average.
'Some of these drivers have been waiting here for nine days to buy fuel. I
am getting to know some of them quite well,' says Mr Alex Enwesi, the
manager of the Mobil station.
'I don't know when the next delivery of fuel will come, and these people are
prepared to wait because they know that here when I have fuel they can buy
it at the official price.'
Mr Enwesi has four kinds of insurance for staff, cash, stock and equipment,
as well as the Mobil corporate cover, and life assurance for himself. The
risk of fire with all these vehicles, fights when tempers get short or even
riots are never far away.
The police and the army are not far away either but sometimes they are more
of a hindrance than a help. The sight of a military patrol van and armed
troops at the head of an irate queue raises the temperature every time.
Overnight queues for fuel have become a common sight for among Nigerians
who, for years, have taken very cheap fuel for granted.
The strike against military rule by Nigeria's oil workers is in its seventh
week and in Africa's richest oil producing country petrol, diesel and
kerosene are precious commodities.
Oil marketing companies estimate that fuel supply is less than 20 per cent
of normal demand in the Lagos area, which accounts for about 40 per cent of
Nigeria's demand.
Other than on foot, there is no alternative to road transport and for most
of the estimated 6m people in the sprawling city there are three choices:
queue and hope to buy fuel at the official price of N3.25 (a mere 5p) a
litre; buy it on the black market for anywhere between N30 and N50 a litre;
or do without fuel.
Nigeria's main oil refinery, in Port Harcourt, is out of action until Monday
at the earliest due to a strike by workers in protest at action by
heavy-handed army guards. The next biggest refinery, Warri, has not resumed
operation since an overhaul in April and the small refinery in Kaduna in the
north produces little fuel.
Most of the 16 state-owned depots have very little product, tanker drivers
in the south are still on strike and the private sector's terminals in Apapa
port, Lagos, get occasional imports by ship.
All of this is bad news for the filling stations who play by the rules.
'Being a dealer is not a lucrative job at present' admits Mr Enwesi, who
took over his service station after a successful career in marketing with
Mobil Nigeria, one of the big six fuel marketing companies in Nigeria.
'I make my living as a dealer from commission selling Mobil's products. When
supply is not made regularly, when you want it, it is hard to cover
overheads. Before the strike I sold about 800,000 litres of petrol and
kerosene a month, now I am getting about 150,000.'
Unlike some dealers, Mr Enwesi does not put fuel aside. If a station is
caught hoarding or selling into jerry cans the military Task Force on
Petroleum Products can close him down.
The phone in his office rings. 'Yes, the workshop is open. Fuel? that is a
scarce commodity.' Mr Enwesi apologises to the caller, not a regular
customer just someone desperate.
Mr Enwesi's predicament is typical of millions in Lagos. 'They are striking
for civilian rule and democracy, which I support, but it is hurting the
common person. What pains me most is that there is no sign that the
government and opposition are sitting down to talk. I don't see an end to
it.'

The United Nations Compensation Commission charged with recompensating
victims of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait is to start examining a Dollars
1bn (Pounds 600m) claim from the Kuwait Oil Company for the cost of putting
out hundreds of oil well fires, Frances Williams reports from Geneva.
The fires were deliberately started by Iraqi troops as they retreated from
the US-led allied advance.
The commission, which has so far received a total of nearly Dollars 160bn in
claims, has already begun to pay out small amounts of compensation to
individuals but this is the first big commercial claim it has tackled.
The reimbursement requested by the Kuwait Oil Company, 'in excess of'
Dollars 950m, is part of an overall compensation demand for nearly Dollars
100bn filed by the Kuwaiti government. Other claims relate to damage to oil
reservoirs and loss of crude oil production following the oil well fires.
An expert panel will be set up to assess the Kuwait Oil Company claim which
the commission describes as of 'symbolic character' for Kuwait 'because of
its economic, environmental and health hazard connota-tions'.
However, even if agreed, the compensation commission has no money at present
to reimburse the company. Satisfaction of this and other claims will have to
await funds generated by UN-approved Iraqi oil sales.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Syrian voters face limited choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were no official campaign debates, no opinion polls and no election
manifestos, but voting in Syria's parliamentary elections opened yesterday
with more than 7,000 candidates standing for 250 seats in the People's
Assembly.
Voting ends today and the results are expected at the weekend.
Since all important policy issues, such as the Middle East peace talks and
Syria's foreign policy are strictly off-limits, voter choice was severely
limited. Not only did all the candidates campaign in support of President
Assad's policies, but the distribution of seats means that only one third of
the assembly is directly elected. The others are chosen by the two official
political parties. The ruling Baath party nominates 120 of its party members
and the National Progressive Front (NPF), which is itself under the Baath
party, is allocated 40 seats.
The rest is left to the 'independent' candidates who in this election have
been dominated by Syrian businessmen keen to play a role in pushing through
faster economic reforms. Many are frustrated at the slow pace at which Syria
is gradually liberalising its economy.
With Syria's considerable potential for economic growth constrained by state
monopolies and command-economy structures, the business community is keen to
see a representative voice in the parliament and the independent vote is
expected to swing its way.

fresh international criticism

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan's opposition Moslem League party yesterday tried to backstep from a
statement by Mr Nawaz Sharif, its leader, who had claimed Islamabad had
produced nuclear weapons.
His comments, at a rally in Kashmir on Tuesday, sparked fears of fresh
international criticism against Pakistan, which has been suspected of
producing nuclear weapons for the past decade. Last week, Pakistan was
accused of involvement in an effort to smuggle weapons-grade plutonium out
of Germany. Islamabad denies the charge.
Pakistan and India have fought two wars over Kashmir which both nations say
belongs to them. They came near a third war in 1990, and many fear that any
future battle could quickly escalate into a nuclear exchange.
Like India, Pakistan is believed to have all the necessary components for a
bomb and the ability to assemble one in a matter of days or even hours.
Pakistan's military and political leaders say the nuclear programme is
necessary to deter its arch-rival India. But successive governments,
including Mr Sharif's, have maintained the country has stopped short of
building a bomb.
Mr Sharif refused to answer questions from journalists after a three-hour
meeting of his party's top leaders in Islamabad yesterday.
Instead, Mr Chaudhary Shujaat Hussain, an opposition senator, accused the
government of Ms Benazir Bhutto of 'exploiting the issue surrounding Mr
Sharif's statement, to divert attention from a planned opposition campaign
next month'.
But some officials privately suspected Mr Sharif had sparked the controversy
possibly in an effort to seek public support, especially from nationalists,
ahead of the anti-government protest planned to begin in about three weeks.
Others, however, suggested he had probably miscalculated the sensitivity of
the issue. 'Sharif must now be thinking it was wrong to make such a
statement in public. The nuclear (proliferation) issue can be extremely
testy in the west,' one senior western diplomat said last night.
Meanwhile, the Pakistani government lashed out at the opposition leader and
reiterated its claim that the country's nuclear programme was only for
peaceful purposes.
'He (Mr Sharif) has taken it on himself to topple the government at all
costs, even if it's at the cost of the national interest,' Mr Sardar Asseff
Ahmed Ali, foreign minister, declared in an interview on state television
last night. 'We do not intend to make nuclear weapons.
'His (Sharif's) remarks are based on total fabrication,' he added.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AC Nielsen Company of Japan, the Japanese arm of the US television ratings
group, is at the centre of a growing row within the country's closed
television rating and advertising industries, Emiko Terazono reports from
Tokyo.
The company has been accused by Japanese television networks of creating
'confusion' within the advertising sector with its new rating system, which
it plans to introduce in November. Nielsen wants to launch a system based on
individuals, rather than households as currently offered by Video Research,
a rating agency owned by television networks and leading advertising
companies. The association of private television networks yesterday demanded
that Nielsen retract its plans, saying that the new system was unreliable,
and that a 'consensus had yet to be reached among parties concerned' .
Although the Japanese television advertising market has become one of the
largest in the world, it has been tightly guarded by a few large companies,
and the television networks, which charge corporate sponsors with high fees
based on the ratings. Companies placing advertisements have been
increasingly frustrated with Video Research's outmoded ratings system based
on households, where it didn't matter whether 'a cat or dog was watching as
long as the TV was switched on'.

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Supermarket sales rose in Japan last month for the first time in 23 months,
as tax cuts and a hot summer spurred spending, Gordon Cramb reports from
Tokyo. The Japan Chain Stores Association said yesterday that July data from
member outlets showed an increase of 2.8 per cent on the same month of 1993.
Food sales rose 2.6 per cent, with soft drinks in demand, while turnover in
home electric appliances jumped 15.9 per cent, reflecting purchases of air
conditioners and fans.
Tax rebates accorded in a government stimulus package for the economy fed
through into pay packets from late June, and have yet to show up in other
consumer spending data. Tokyo department store sales for July showed no
revival - nationwide figures are due today - although such store groups have
suffered as a result of customers switching to discount retailers.
Evidence of a consumer-led recovery durable enough to outlast the heatwave
remains thin. Based on less timely figures covering the three months to
June, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said yesterday sales
of Japanese retailers as a whole were down 2.4 per cent from the second
quarter of last year.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Economic Watch: Inflation on rise in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German inflation probably bounced back up to 3 per cent in August from 2.9
per cent last month, according to price data from two key west German
states. In July, German inflation fell below 3 per cent for the first time
in three years, but high coffee and oil prices meant that the trend to
falling inflation was reversed this month. Yesterday, North Rhine-Westphalia
reported that prices in the state were up 0.1 per cent in August for a
year-on-year increase of 2.8 per cent. Prices in Baden-Wurttemberg rose 0.2
per cent for an annual 3.1 per cent increase. These two states, together
with Bavaria and Hesse, form the basis from which the government produces
provisional inflation data for all of west Germany each month. Analysts said
the expected rise was not surprising and partly reflected seasonal factors.
The rate was likely to remain around 3 per cent for the rest of the year
before falling to around 2.5 per cent at the start of 1995.
Dutch industrial production slipped 1 per cent in June on a seasonally
adjusted basis from May, but was 3 per cent higher than 12 months earlier,
the central statistics bureau reported. Adjusted industrial output for the
first half rose 1.8 per cent from a year earlier.
Switzerland's current account surplus fell to SFr4.7bn (Pounds 2.35bn) in
the second quarter, down SFr1.7bn from the same period last year.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Doubt on microchip plant for Saxony
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN, SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Advanced Micro Devices, a leading US semiconductor manufacturer, said
yesterday it had yet to reach a firm decision on whether to build a Dollars
1bn plant in the eastern German state of Saxony. Mr Gunter Rexrodt,
Germany's federal economics minister, had claimed the decision was almost
certain.
'We have held preliminary discussions with Saxony officials,' said an
official at company headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. AMD, which last
year had revenues of Dollars 1.6bn, started negotiations with Saxony six
months ago. It is 'actively investigating potential sites to build a new
plant devoted to microprocessors,' the official said.
A spokeswoman at Saxony's economics ministry said she expected AMD to start
building the plant in Dresden early next year, while Mr Rexrodt had issued a
statement that the plant, which would produce logic chips, would create more
than 1,400 jobs.
AMD will next month open a new memory chip plant in Japan, jointly owned
with Fujitsu. It is also building a Dollars 1bn microprocessor manufacturing
facility in Austin, Texas, where production is expected to begin in
mid-1995.
'Given the current growth in the microprocessor market, there is a real
possibility that we will need another large facility,' AMD said. However, it
is unlikely that construction will begin before late 1995 at the earliest.
There was speculation last night that Mr Rexrodt and the Saxony government
were trying to push AMD into committing itself publicly to the investment
before state elections due on September 11.
Such a commitment would be a welcome fillip to Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the
premier of Saxony. His Christian Democratic Union government - the only CDU
administration in eastern Germany to be elected in the last elections with
an outright majority - faces a challenge from the opposition Social
Democratic party and the Greens.
According to the federal economics ministry, AMD's proposed investment
follows an earlier decision by Siemens to invest DM2.7bn in the same city in
a new research and production complex specialising in memory chips.
'This decision shows Saxony, and particularly Dresden, is set to become the
new centre of high technology in Germany,' an official at the state's
economics ministry said.
Saxony was one of the main centres of German industry before the second
world war, and the former East German communist regime continued this
tradition by locating its electronic industry in and around Dresden.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Slovakia prepares its sale of the century: Stalled
privatisation programme is back on track
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRATISLAVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Slovakia's governing coalition, which came to office in March vowing to
revive the country's stalled privatisation programme, is about to make good
on its promise.
On September 6, three weeks before a general election, the government of
prime minister Mr Jozef Moravcik is due to approve the sale of up to
Kcs250bn (Pounds 5.2bn) worth of state assets to the private sector. It is
one of the biggest mass sell-off programmes of any post-Communist country
outside the Czech Republic.
However, given the government's distinctly end-of-term air, nobody is taking
anything for granted. Officials admit there is still a lot of work to be
done. 'People are working 24 hours a day to get everything finished,' said
one, exaggerating only slightly. 'We are trying to make up for the previous
government (of Mr Vladimir Meciar), which didn't do much, to say the least.'
Privatisation was the issue which brought down Mr Meciar. Mr Moravcik is
hoping it will ensure him a second term when Slovaks vote on September 30
and October 1 in the first general election since independence 20 months
ago.
Getting his fragile coalition to approve such a sweeping sell-off programme
will be difficult. The Democratic Left party (SDL), comprising mainly former
Communists, with seven ministers in the mainly technocratic government, is
divided on the issue. Luckily for Mr Moravcik, the SDL's pro-privatisation
wing, headed by deputy prime minister Ms Brigita Schmognerova, is currently
in the ascendant.
'Privatisation is the most difficult issue facing the government,' admits Mr
Eduard Kukan, foreign minister. He maintains, however, that it is less
whether the policy should be implemented, than how, that divides the left
and right wings of the coalition, and that the government is committed to
the programme: 'We intend to fulfil our promise.'
But the plans have come under fire for allocating only a quarter of the
sales to voucher privatisation. Slovaks are already familiar with the
voucher method, a device used the last government of the former
Czechoslovakia in which citizens buy vouchers and exchange them for shares
in the companies of their choice. About 30 per cent of Slovak industry had
already been privatised in this way before the federation split at the end
of 1992.
The new programme calls for disposing of Kcs80bn of assets via the voucher
method, though this may yet be reduced to Kcs60bn. The remainder will be
sold directly to investors or management, or floated on the stock market.
This has been seized on by the government's free-market critics as evidence
that it is a hostage to its hard-left wing.
With opinion polls suggesting the SDL and Mr Meciar's Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia will emerge as the biggest parties after the election,
it is fear of the return to power of the former prime minister, a hardline
nationalist with no inclination towards privatisation, that is driving the
government to push through its proposals.
This has also led it to strengthen anti-corruption and money laundering laws
alleged to have been ignored or abused during the last days of the Meciar
administration. Three weeks ago parliament enacted a law which requires all
Slovak citizens buying state property to provide documented evidence of the
source of their funds.
However, there is now the prospect of that law being seriously undermined.
An opposition-inspired parliamentary order has forced President Michal Kovac
to call a referendum to enshrine a similar clause in the constitution.
However, the question voters are to be asked to decide is extremely vague,
and there are fears that if the referendum goes ahead - it is scheduled for
October 22 - it could vitiate the newly strengthened legislation, which has
been praised for its comprehensiveness.
The government, as a result, would like to avoid the referendum, but
summoning a parliamentary majority to repeal the order is proving
impossible. Too many politicians are getting campaign mileage out of being
seen to support it.
This is exactly what Mr Moravcik was hoping to avoid. Instead, he has
inadvertently handed a stick to the nationalists, who have taken to beating
the government with it. Whether it becomes an issue when the election
campaign kicks off in earnest in the weeks after the privatisation vote
could overshadow the government's own campaigning platform - that it keeps
its promises.

Russian officials yesterday rebuffed the attempt of Sevastopol, the Crimean
port city, to declare itself a part of Russia earlier this week. A political
gift to Kiev on the day Ukrainians are celebrating their third anniversary
as an independent state, Russia's move is another indication of the thaw in
relations between the two Slav neighbours. 'Russian politicians do not plan
to take advantage of Ukraine's internal problems and warm their hands over
the hardships of others,' Mr Mark Urnov, an adviser to Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, said yesterday. The city council of Sevastopol, home port to
the contested Black Sea Fleet and part of a region which elected an openly
separatist president in January, has proclaimed the city Russian territory.
Kiev said the move had no legal force but chose not to take any punitive
actions.

<TEXT>
In an attempt to convince the financial markets that current high rates of
interest on Danish government bonds are unjustified, the government
yesterday presented a tight draft budget for 1995, bringing its publication
forward by a week. Central government expenditure would fall by DKr6bn
(Pounds 635m) in real terms in 1995 to DKr392.5bn, said Mr Mogens Lykketoft,
the finance minister, who added that the budget would have a restrictive
effect on the economy next year after being strongly expansive in 1994 -
election year. The economic recovery has allowed the government to limit
expenditure and increase revenue. The budget deficit is set to fall to
DKr45.3bn in 1995, or 4.6 per cent of gross domestic product, from
DKr47.3bn, or 5.1 per cent of GDP, in the current year. The total public
sector financial deficit will fall to DKr30.4bn from DKr41.0bn, or from 4.4
to 3.1 per cent of GDP. The budget, which proposes no new taxation or
expenditure, had no immediate effect on the financial markets.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Ruhe warns on Eurofighter

<TEXT>
German defence minister, Mr Volker Ruhe, said that the Bonn government would
not buy the Eurofighter 2000 if it proved to cost the DM150m (Pounds 63m)
per aircraft which the German National Audit Office has calculated. 'I can
only warn the industry that if it is considering prices like that, the
Eurofighter will not be built, said Mr Ruhe. In an interview with Stern
magazine, he added that it was not the place of the audit office to
recommend that Germany should buy Russian MiG-29 aircraft instead. 'When the
German parliament decides on ordering (the aircraft) in 1995, the two most
important criteria will be performance and the concept of European
industry,' he said. The audit office's controversial report also recommends
that Germany delay any purchase of Eurofighter until 2006. However, most
experts believe the DM150m figure to be wrong. Industry sources say that the
current estimate is around DM103m, against a government target of DM90m. The
current year's Eurofighter development funding is due to be debated by
German parliamentary committees on 6 September.

Two unemployed Russian men have been arrested trying to steal low-grade
uranium from a weapons plant in central Russia. They were caught on Saturday
with almost 10kg of uranium-238 at the Arzamas-16 plant near Niznhy
Novgorod. The arrests followed a joint investigation by the
counter-intelligence service, the interior ministry and local security
officials. Nuclear experts said that although the material was dangerous it
was not of sufficient quality or quantity to make a nuclear bomb. The
Russian authorities said that the arrests showed the effectiveness of
current security measures. Following talks in Moscow at the weekend between
Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, Chancellor Kohl's intelligence co-ordinator, and the
Russian authorities, both countries have promised a greater exchange of
intelligence information and co-operation to counter plutonium smuggling. Mr
Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, plans raise the matter with European
Union colleagues next month.
President Boris Yeltsin is expected to visit Britain next month, Downing
Street said last night. British officials said it was hoped he would be in
the country over the weekend of September 24-25. An official announcement
would be made nearer the time.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's coalition partners are at loggerheads over tax policies as the
federal election campaign enters its final phase before voting on October
16. Mr Gunther Rexrodt, economics minister and a Free Democrat, wants the
budget deficit held steady, instead of being reduced further, to leave room
for tax cuts. The finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, has dismissed the idea,
not only on behalf of his own Christian Social Union, but also in the name
of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats.
Mr Rexrodt made his proposal in a campaign debate on Monday night with Mr
Oskar Lafontaine, the opposition Social Democrat tipped to become finance
minister if the SPD wins in October. Seeking to counter the SPD's campaign
promise to implement a programme of swift and huge tax cuts for middle
wage-earners, Mr Rexrodt suggested the government keep the deficit high to
finance its own tax reductions. Attacking the idea, Mr Waigel insisted
yesterday that 'there will be no tax reductions without compensating
revenues.' Mr Rexrodt, however, in defending his proposal, cited progress in
consolidating the federal budget, adding that the government could finance
tax cuts by keeping the deficit at 2 per cent of gross domestic product in
1998 instead of cutting it to 0.5 per cent as planned. 'There would be room
for tax cuts totalling more than DM50bn (Pounds 21bn),' he said.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Sparks fly over attempt to break power barrier: Judy Dempsey
on a German town's move to buy its electricity from across the border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Manfred Palman, financial director of the small German city of Kleve on
the Dutch border, needs no prompting to recall the two most important events
in the city's modern history: the Allied bombing on October 7, 1944, and the
contract made in 1910 between Kleve and RWE Energie, Germany's largest
utility, to supply its inhabitants with electricity.
Fifty years on, though, the bombing seems to have had less impact than the
contract. 'The Allies bombed 91 per cent of our city, but we have since
rebuilt it. RWE has monopolised our electricity supply since the early
1900s. But now we want to end that contract,' said Mr Palman.
Ironically, the British may be his best hope of doing that. Mr Palman hopes
Britain, and some other countries of the European Union, will support a
decision by Kleve to end the contract with RWE and buy its energy from the
neighbouring Netherlands. This decision is supported by Germany's cartel
office which has referred the question to the Brussels competition
authorities.
'The EU wants to use Kleve as a test case. We must win because this will be
the beginning of the end of the large energy monopolies in Germany,' said Mr
Palman. 'It will usher in an era of competition and choice for the
consumer.'
That would be a significant departure for Europe's electricity supply
industry in general and for Germany in particular. The battle for the future
control of the supply and distribution of energy is one of Germany's hottest
political issues - a great deal of power and money is at stake.
In every German city or town Stadtwerke, or city utilities, are responsible
for supplying electricity, gas and water to the local industrial and
domestic consumers. The Stadtwerke, owned by city councils, have a long
tradition, however, of issuing exclusive 'concession rights', or contracts,
to Germany's largest utilities.
To obtain these exclusive concessions, the utility companies pay the
Stadtwerke an annual fee. 'In the case of Kleve, RWE pays us DM3.5m (Pounds
1.5m) each year,' said Mr Palman. Kleve consumes 210m kilowatt hours each
year at a cost of DM45m-DM50m (Pounds 19m-Pounds 21m). 'Our domestic
consumers pay 14.7 pfennigs per kilowatt hour,' said Mr Palman. 'But we
think we can obtain energy from the Netherlands for 2 pfennigs cheaper. The
problem is that, as yet, there is no link between Kleve and a Dutch
supplier,' he added.
Indeed, if Kleve were to go further afield, says Mr Palman, the city might
be able to obtain nuclear generated power from France for about 8 pfennigs
per kilowatt hour. 'But because there is no German law permitting third
party access (TPA), which, in our case, would allow any outside company
access to the RWE grid at Kleve, we are entirely dependent on this monopoly
structure with RWE.'
The dispute between the company and Kleve's city council - controlled by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats in coalition with the Free
Democrats - has national political implications because it coincides with
attempts by Mr Gunther Rexrodt, the FDP economics minister, to deregulate
Germany's energy sector.
Germany currently holds the European Union presidency and Mr Rexrodt is
trying to introduce EU legislation aimed at introducing TPA throughout the
Union. To no-one's surprise, his plans are floundering.
Britain, which supports TPA, has backed him, but France, with one of the
EU's jealously guarded energy structures, has opposed any plans for
liberalisation. More importantly, utility officials say that since France
will assume the EU presidency next January, Mr Kohl is unwilling to support
his minister for fear of upsetting Franco-German relations. The chancellor
is also reluctant to push for TPA until after October's federal elections.
The Stadtwerke, too, are hoping the next government will not upset the
comfortable status quo. Most of them oppose liberalisation for a variety of
reasons. Those councils controlled by the opposition Social Democratic party
fear deregulation would adversely affect the coal industry, traditional SPD
supporters, and eventually lead to the phasing out of coal subsidies. Each
tonne of German-produced coal receives a subsidy of DM200m to offset cheap
imports.
In addition, said an official from the Federal Association for Gas and
Water, 'the introduction of TPA would mean that the Stadtwerke would lose at
least DM5bn each year from concession rights fees. No wonder the finance
ministry is also against TPA. It would have to fork out more money to the
local councils.'
Above all, TPA would mean the loss of political favours for the Stadtwerke.
'Germany's utilities are adept at offering more besides energy when they pay
the annual concession fee,' claimed the same official. 'Its a kind of
political patronage. Don't forget that members of the Stadtwerke are also
members of the city councils, who in turn have close political ties with the
state governments. The councils need money to run their campaigns and prove
their track record. Where do you think the money for a new swimming pool
comes from?'
Mr Palman has little patience with this kind of political clientalism which
has evolved over the decades between the Stadtwerke, the utilities, the city
councils and the states. 'We want choice and competition. If we can obtain
cheaper energy from other sources we should have the right to do that.'
Germany's utilities, for their part, say they have 'in principle' nothing
against TPA. 'We are not opposed to competition provided TPA is based on
reciprocity, which means that we would be able to sell and distribute our
energy in France,' said an RWE official.
But back in Kleve, Mr Palman knows that without a political consensus in
Bonn ready to take on the Stadtwerke and utilities, or unity in the EU, the
city's inhabitants will have to wait some time for their Dutch electricity.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Russian debt plan for promissory notes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian Ministry of Finance proposed yesterday that promissory notes be
used to resolve the country's growing debt crisis.
The inter-enterprise debt, which government officials said now exceeds
Rbs100,000bn (Pounds 30bn), threatens to paralyse the Russian economy and is
developing into the Kremlin's top political concern.
Mr Sergei Dubinin, the acting minister of finance, presented a draft law on
the introduction of promissory notes to yesterday's meeting of the Russian
government's emergency commission on the debt crisis.
According to Russian news agencies, Mr Dubinin's proposal is that promissory
notes, backed by government guarantees, should be used to cover enterprises'
current debts for goods which have already been delivered. Eventually, he
told the commission, all the inter-enterprise debt would be translated into
promissory notes.
A presidential decree last spring made a similar scheme mandatory in an
early effort to head off the debt crisis, but Russian enterprises largely
failed to comply, according to Mr Fyodor Andryev, a board member of Tver
Universal Bank, which is active in the corporate debt market.
But the new plan, whose details remain vague even to senior Russian
government officials, is being sceptically received by reformist members of
the Russian administration and senior western analysts and bankers.
They fear the promissory notes, particularly if backed by the government and
indiscriminately issued to enterprises, could merely become disguised
government loans.
Mr Sergei Aleksashenko, the deputy minister of finance and an advocate of
tough market reforms, rejected his minister's own proposal.
'The minister must be mistaken,' Mr Aleksashenko said. 'My government will
never bail out indebted enterprises either through government backed
promissory notes or more directly.'
Russia's experience with high inflation has made the government wary of
directly handing out soft loans, but many Russian officials also fear the
political implications of allowing large numbers of inefficient, indebted
enterprises to go bankrupt.
Western analysts fear that a promissory note programme could, in the guise
of a solution to the debt problem, merely be a way of postponing the final
day of reckoning.
'They smell to me of another government bail-out,' one senior western
economist said. A western banker working in Moscow said the proposal 'does
not address the basic problem and could even create some new problems'. In
his view, the best solution to the debt mountain - which he said 'is getting
to be a crisis; there is a real debt spiral developing' - would be for the
government to intervene as little as possible.
The banker pointed out that debt was already very expensive for Russian
companies and that to lower their debt burden some enterprises were
beginning to offer investors debt for equity swaps.
Any government programme which indiscriminantly assisted both more and less
indebted enterprises, he said, would harm those more efficient factories
which have sought to reduce their debt load on their own initiative.

FT  25 AUG 94 / German poll finds little love for banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German banks not only have too much influence over industry, but they fail
to use it effectively, according to a poll of the nation's management and
political elite. They have also lost the confidence of many ordinary
customers who now believe they will get a better deal from a car salesman
than from their bank manager.
The tax man, too, appears to require protection from Germany's unloved
financiers. According to the respected Allensbach polling institute, banks
offering overseas investment advice to savers will frequently throw in
advice on tax avoidance as a bonus.
In a process akin to sticking a finger in boiling water to check if it is
hot, the institute carried out a survey recently as the nation steamed over
the third successive bank-related corporate calamity, and while tempers
simmered over bumper bank profits garnered during the recession.
Questioning of a 650-strong sample on the topic of bank power, the institute
came up with a clear majority believing banks should not be allowed to hold
stakes of more than 15 per cent in other companies.
Three-quarters of the sample, which included premiers, board directors and
top managers, said bankers should be granted fewer seats on other companies'
non-executive supervisory boards; two-thirds believed they did not take
their responsibilities seriously enough.
Long a favourite target of the popular press, German banks have now emerged
as not much liked in the higher ranks of society. Although the timing and
tone of the survey - for Capital business magazine - questions might
arguably have distorted the results, the findings underlined the need for
some image-building.
In an unaccustomed display of contrition, Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank
chairman, and target of much abuse, recently admitted to 'arrogance'.
Sensitivities have been outraged in particular by the near-collapse of
Metallgesellschaft in which leading banks had large holdings and
considerable supervisory board clout.
This and the subsequent alleged multi-billion scams perpetrated by property
shark, Mr Jurgen Schneider - now on the run - and managers of an athletics
track supplier, injected new life into a prolonged debate on the power of
the financial institutions.
Fewer than 50 per cent of the managers in the group said banks helped the
economy to function while 40 per cent said they acted as a brake on
entrepreneurial initiative.
The federal banking association greeted the survey with 'great
astonishment,' adding there was nothing new in the results.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michel Rocard was yesterday said by aides to be preparing to resign as
mayor of Conflans St Honorine, a small town outside Paris, which is the
former Socialist party leader's last elected post in French politics. His
impending resignation in favour of Mr Jean-Paul Huchon, his deputy mayor and
righthand man at the Socialist party, would appear to reflect his growing
disenchantment with politics. Mr Rocard was ousted as party leader on June
19 after he led the Socialists into a heavy defeat in the European
parliament elections, though he himself won a seat in the Strasbourg
assembly. But aides said Mr Rocard was not planning to quit politics
altogether. His ouster from the Socialist leadership has left wide open the
question of who will be the party's presidential candidate next year, unless
Mr Jacques Delors, the retiring European Commission president, decides to
run. Until the mantle of the presidential candidacy settles definitively on
someone else, Mr Rocard may be keeping open the option of a come-back.

Two unemployed Russian men have been arrested trying to steal low-grade
uranium from a weapons plant in central Russia. The two men were caught on
Saturday in possession of almost 10kg of uranium-238 at the Arzamas-16 plant
near Niznhy Novgorod. The arrests followed a joint investigation by the
counter-intelligence service, the interior ministry and local security
officials. Nuclear experts said that although the material was dangerous it
was not of sufficient quality or quantity to make a nuclear bomb.
The Russian authorities said that the arrests showed the effectiveness of
current security measures and attacked the western media for tarnishing the
reputation of their nuclear industry. The Russian counter-intelligence
service said the country 'almost certainly' had nothing to do with the trade
in contraband nuclear materials. The illicit international trade in nuclear
materials was highlighted recently when three batches of weapons-grade
plutonium were found in Germany. Following talks in Moscow at the weekend
between Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's intelligence
co-ordinator, and the Russian authorities, both countries have promised a
greater exchange of intelligence information and co-operation to counter
contraband plutonium. But the issue is taking on an increasingly
multinational dimension. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said
yesterday he would raise the matter at a meeting of European Union foreign

should also debate how to stop plutonium smuggling.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Drugs, telecoms seen as spur to EU growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals, telecoms, computer and office equipment, and plastics
processing are among the six leading growth sectors in European industry,
according to a study published yesterday by the European Commission.
The 1,400-page report says a surge in demand for health services, the drive
toward a new 'information society', as well as rapid expansion of car
manufacturing and electronic engineering, were the engines of growth between
1986 and 1992.
But a source of worry is the widespread fall in European companies' average
profit ratio as a result of weaker world growth, stronger competition and
high real interest rates.
European companies are also failing to keep pace with their Japanese and US
competitors in investment in the fast-growing east Asian economies,
according to the 5th edition of the Panorama of EU industry*.
One of the EU's success stories, nevertheless, is in the world
pharmaceutical market, where it is the leading producer. Production rose 44
per cent (in constant prices) since 1987, while the US and Japan increased
their level by 8 per cent and 17 per cent respectively. As a result, in
1992, the value of EU production was about a third higher than that of the
US and double Japan's.
In telecommunications, the report predicts growth of 6 per cent a year,
boosted by new technologies and liberalisation of data services and mobile
communications. The total information services market in the EU could reach
Ecus244bn (Pounds 195bn) by 1997, with telecoms accounting for Ecu136bn.
The computer industry is undergoing a downturn, with large indigenous
suppliers such as Siemens-Nixdorf of Germany, Groupe Bull of France and
Olivetti of Italy losing money amid radical restructuring, the report says.
But it predicts Europeans may be well placed to exploit the trend to smaller
data processing machines.
Eco-industries have strong growth potential. The report says Greece,
Portugal and Spain are projected to have the highest rates because they will
have to invest to meet EU legislative targets. Market growth estimates among
the southern Europeans range from 7.4 per cent to 8.3 per cent; but growth
in the UK, France, Italy and Belgium is likely to be only moderate and may
have already peaked in Germany and the Netherlands.
The report predicts demand in waste management and land reclamation are
likely to increase, while the share of the water treatment and air pollution
control equipment sectors is likely to decline - partly because of the
Commission decision to adapt legislation to match demands for subsidiarity
(devolving decision-making to member states from Brussels).

FT  25 AUG 94 / Archer says share order 'grave error': Labour calls for
second opinion on DTI report into Anglia deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Archer, the bestselling author and former Conservative Party deputy
chairman, last night said it was a 'grave error' to have placed the orders
to buy shares in Anglia Television, which have been the focus of a
Department of Trade and Industry investigation into alleged insider dealing.
In a statement, his solicitor Lord Mishcon, speaking on his behalf, said:
'It was a grave error when his wife was a director of Anglia to have allowed
his name to be associated with the purchase and sale of shares in that
company on behalf of a third party.'
The statement continued: 'His deepest regret is the embarrassment needlessly
caused to Lady Archer in this matter.'
Last week the Financial Times disclosed that Lord Archer's orders to buy
Anglia shares were the subject of the five-month DTI investigation. Since
then, he has refused to make any statements on the record about the affair
until last night.
Lady Archer said last night from her home that she was standing by her
husband: 'I'm still here and I'm staying here,' she said.
In response to a a question about whether she intended to resign from the
Anglia board, Lady Archer said: 'I'm still on the board.'
Anglia, now a subsidiary of MAI, said yesterday that its directors were
'happy to accept that she did not pass on inside information'.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, decided at the end of
July not to launch any prosecutions after the completion of the inquiry and
after receiving independent legal advice.
Robin Cook, Labour's trade spokesman, said last night that Lord Archer's
statement 'makes it all the more important that we get a second opinion on
the DTI report'.
Earlier this week, Mr Cook urged Mr Heseltine to pass the DTI report to the
Crown Prosecution Service, to ascertain whether the CPS concurred with the
DTI's decision to take no further action against Lord Archer.
Lord Archer said last night that the facts about the transactions which have
been disclosed in the press over the past week had been known to the DTI
inspectors.
In January, Lord Archer gave stockbrokers Charles Stanley detailed
instructions for the purchase of two parcels of Anglia Television shares
fewer than four working days before MAI announced a Pounds 292m takeover bid
for the television company.
He also instructed the brokers to sell the shares on the day the takeover
was launched, netting a profit of Pounds 80,000 on the deal. Although the
broker had at first assumed that Lord Archer was buying the shares for
himself when the first order to buy 25,000 shares was placed on January 13,
the novelist gave instructions that they should be registered in the name of
his acquaintance, Mr Broosk Saib.
The following day, Lord Archer bought a second parcel of 25,000 shares for
Mr Saib. However, the address given to the broker for all correspondence
with Mr Saib was that of Lord Archer's London penthouse overlooking the
Thames.
When the shares were sold, the Pounds 80,000 cheque for Mr Saib was sent to
that address.
Lord Archer said last night the DTI must 'be taken to have concluded that
this transaction was not carried out with the benefit of any inside
information'.
The DTI said yesterday it had nothing to add to its statement of July 28,
when it said that it was taking 'no further action against any of the
parties concerned in the investigation'.
New insider trading legislation came into effect as part of the Criminal
Justice Act in April. However, because the Anglia transactions were in
January, the DTI inspectors examined possible offences under the previous
legislation. The legislation was changed after criticism that it was badly
worded.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Wellcome takes SmithKline to court over drug patents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome, the UK drug company, is taking its rival SmithKline Beecham to
court in the US, accusing it of infringing the patents on its best-selling
drug Zovirax, a treatment for herpes and shingles.
The suit claims that the SmithKline drug Famvir, launched last month in the
US, produces inside the body a 'virtually identical' molecule to that
covered by Wellcome patents. Wellcome wants an injunction against the sale
of Famvir in the US and is claiming unspecified damages for loss of sales.
SmithKline said the legal action was a surprise. It denied infringing any
patents and said it would defend the actions.
This is the first patent suit in recent years by Wellcome against a
multinational drug company. It comes after a series of changes in top
management at the company, including the promotion in May of Dr David Barry
from the company's US operations to head of research, development and
medical affairs.
Patent suits are commonplace in the drugs industry, especially in the US.
Winning even a few weeks' extra legal protection for a drug can mean tens of
millions of dollars in increased earnings for the patent holder.
About Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 960,000) worth of Zovirax is sold every day in
the US. With total sales likely to be worth more than Dollars 1.3bn this
year, Zovirax is the fifth-biggest brand of prescription drug in the world,
according to stockbroker Lehman Brothers.
The legal action is a distraction for SmithKline for which Famvir is one of
its most promising new products. The UK company's new chief executive, Mr
Jan Leschly, has already launched it into acquisitions and new markets.
Ms Jo Walton, analyst at Lehman Brothers, said that if SmithKline lost the
legal action it could be forced to pay a royalty to Wellcome. Withdrawal of
the drug was unlikely.
The action relates to the biochemistry of the two drugs. As well as alleging
that Famvir and Zovirax break down inside the body to virtually identical
active ingredients, Wellcome argues that the method by which Famvir is
absorbed was previously patented.
Famvir is available only in the US and the UK, where it was launched in
January this year. A brief price skirmish between the two companies in the
UK resulted in a price cut of 5 per cent for Zovirax. There was no such
skirmish in the US and the two drugs have 'parity on costing', said
SmithKline.
Wellcome shares rose 11p to 720p and SmithKline Beecham's 'A' share lost 2p
to 446p yesterday. Wellcome added legal action outside the US was unlikely.

FT  25 AUG 94 / US to expand Cuban refugee camps: Thousands to be detained
at Guantanamo naval base - Havana offers talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US announced yesterday it would house tens of thousands of Cuban
refugees indefinitely at its Guantanamo Bay naval base, where the refugee
camps are to be expanded to cope with the continuing exodus.
The Clinton administration, under growing pressure from the tide of refugees
in spite of last week's policy switch to bar them from entering the US, was
yesterday offered talks on the issue without preconditions by Cuba.
Mr Roberto Robaina, Cuba's foreign minister, said on a visit to Chile that
his government was willing to talk to Washington, but would not accept a
dialogue 'in which one side presides and the other listens'. The US said it
would welcome resumption of working-level talks on migration, but had no
plans for broader high-level talks until Cuba demonstrated a commitment to
political and economic reforms.
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said camps at Guantanamo Bay in
Cuba, which presently hold 23,000 refugees from both Cuba and Haiti, would
be expanded tohouse up to 40,000 people by the end of next week.
'We are preparing to maintain that (detention) base indefinitely if
necessary until such time as the people can be repatriated to Cuba,' Mr
Perry said.
US officials refused to say explicitly that they would hold refugees until
the Castro regime fell, but said they would be detained until they could be
repatriated to Cuba - which US law currently presently forbids.
The US coastguard rescued 1,159 Cubans by mid-afternoon yesterday after
3,253 were picked up on Tuesday, another record for one day. Mr Perry said
that of the 9,000 refugees picked up in recent weeks, 2,000 were already
held at Guantanamo Bay and the other 7,000 were on their way there.
The administration again warned Cubans not to attempt the dangerous
crossing, with a stern reminder that those picked up at sea and taken to
Guantanamo would never get into the US.
'Do not risk your lives,' said Ms Janet Reno, attorney-general. 'You will
not be processed for admission to the US.'
Ms Reno urged those wanting to leave to pursue legal emigration by taking
advantage of the 28,000 visas reserved for them annually in Cuba.
Mr Perry also said that, contrary to some reports, he had 'no evidence' of
Cubans congregating on the country's border with the US base at Guantanamo.
If Cuba allowed this to happen, the US 'would regard this as being an
unfriendly act (and) take appropriate actions', he said.
Although the administration hopes to see a drop in numbers of refugees over
the next week as its policy change hits home, the State Department is
negotiating to set up third-country safe havens in the region.
Mr Peter Tarnoff, deputy secretary of state, confirmed that the US expects
to conclude arrangements with the Turks and Caicos Islands - a British
dependency - as well as Surinam and Panama.
Mr Tarnoff rejected the idea of discussions with Cuba's leader-ship. Earlier
yesterday, Mr Fernando Remirez de Estenoz Barciela, Cuba's ambassador to the
United Nations, said his country was prepared to discuss the refugee
problem, but only as part of broader negotiations.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Computer price war in US as IBM matches cuts by Compaq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A price war erupted in the US personal computer market yesterday as
International Business Machines slashed prices on many of its PC products by
up to 27 per cent. The move came in response to similar price cuts by Compaq
Computer, the US market leader.
Compaq threw down the gauntlet last week by cutting US prices on PC models
sold primarily to businesses by up to 22 per cent.
IBM has responded by matching Compaq's prices on similar models.
High-performance desktop PCs with large capacity disc drives formerly
selling for around Dollars 2,500 (Pounds 1,610) are now expected to be
widely available for just under Dollars 2,000.
'Today's actions clearly demonstrate IBM's continuing commitment to respond
quickly in resetting prices to meet changing market conditions,' said Bill
McCracken, general manager, marketing and customer fulfilment at IBM PC
Company.
Other PC manufacturers are now almost certain to follow suit as the battle
for market share unfolds. 'In the near future you can expect that we will
undercut Compaq's prices,' said Mr Boris Elisman, product marketing and
programs manager for Hewlett-Packard's PC business.
He said he expected to see continuing price reductions in the fourth quarter
as competition intensified. Digital Equipment is also expected to cut its PC
prices within the next few days. The company is reported to be informing
computer dealers of the impending reductions.
IBM yesterday broadened the pricing battle by reducing prices of its PC
servers to about 5 per cent below Compaq's current levels. PC servers are
computers used to control office computer networks, and represent the most
profitable and fastest growing segment of the corporate PC market.
Compaq is currently the dominant supplier of PC servers, but IBM is making
an aggressive push into Compaq's territory.
The price war comes as the industry is entering its peak selling season and
is expected to boost sales in an already rapidly growing market.
Fuelling the PC battle are sharp cuts by Intel in the prices of its
microprocessors, the 'brains' of PCs. Intel reduced the prices of its 486
and Pentium chips by about 40 per cent in the second quarter.
Also adding to the momentum is the broad availability of products in a
market that has faced shortages during the past two years.

FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Esselte ahead despite slow sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Esselte, the Swedish office products group, yesterday reported a 30 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits in the first half to SKr180m (Dollars 23.7m), up
from SKr138m in the same period last year. This was in spite of only a small
increase in sales.
The group said the profits growth was produced by a reduction in costs of
SKr65m, which more than offset a SKr23m increase in financial expenses, to
SKr96m, caused by lower hedging benefits. Esselte confirmed its forecast
that full-year pre-tax profits in 1994 would exceed last year's SKr301m.
Sales in the first half rose 3 per cent to SKr5.89bn from SKr5.7bn. Although
Nordic and southern European markets showed growth, sales were lower in the
US, the company's biggest country market, and in Germany. However, a
turnround in the US, where the company's operations have been restructured,
was expected in the second half of the year.
Sales at Esselte Dymo, the office products division, increased to SKr2.2bn
from SKr2bn, while operating profits rose to SKr139m from SKr118m.
Sales at Esselte Meto, which makes price marking equipment, rose slightly
but operating profits jumped to SKr101m from SKr68m.

FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: Unidanmark tumbles to DKr207m at
halfway

<TEXT>
Unidanmark Group, Denmark's second biggest bank, yesterday reported a fall
in interim net profits to DKr207m (Dollars 34m) from DKr483m as the value of
its securities portfolio slid.
The value of securities holdings fell by DKr252m during the first half of
the year. Last year in the same period the comparable figure rose by
DKr533m. Under Danish banking law the difference in the value of the
securities portfolio during the accounting period is entered directly into
the profit and loss account.
Reflecting improved economic conditions, the group said that its bad loss
provisions fell to DKr950m in the first half compared with DKr2.34bn in the
same period last year.
The bank reported a 10.7 per cent growth in net interest and fee income to
DKr4.8bn from DKr4.3bn, while expenses were reduced by DKr68m to DKr2.97bn.
The bank said that the first-half performance showed that efforts to
re-establish the bank's market position, coupled with credit management and
cost-cutting, are bearing fruit.
The bank was rocked by losses which peaked at DKr4.6bn in 1992, when bad
debt provisions soared to DKr8.2bn. Bad debt provisions have now been
reduced to 1.4 per cent of loans and guarantees, compared with 3.3 per cent
in the first half of last year.
The capital adequacy ratio at the end of the second half was 13.4 per cent
compared with 11.8 per cent at the end of last year. No forecast was made
for profits for the full year, but the bank said that it expected lower net
interest income in the second half.
DFDS, the North Sea ferry and freight shipping group and European haulage
business, reported a first half profit of DKr31.8m compared with a loss of
DKr37.3m last year. Sales were up to DKr3.16bn from DKr2.65bn last year.

FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: OMV recovers to post first-half
Sch240m profit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
OMV, the Austrian integrated petroleum and chemicals group, has reported
consolidated pre-tax profit of Sch240m (Dollars 22m) for the first half,
compared with a loss of Sch552m in the corresponding period last year.
The partially privatised group said turnover was flat at Sch40.1bn as
conditions in many of its markets remained weak. However, it was still
aiming to make a profit in the full year through continued cost cutting.
As expected, the pre-tax profit in the second quarter, at Sch50m, was
considerably smaller than that in the first quarter. This was mainly due to
squeezed refinery margins.
The exploration and production division fell into a Sch380m loss in the
first half compared with a profit of Sch260m, due to lower crude oil prices,
lower domestic gas sales and accounting changes.
The Schwechat refinery also went into the red in the second quarter because
of a slump in gasoline margins, but higher profits at the Burghausen
refinery prevented any erosion from the Sch130m profit made by the refining
division in the first quarter. It suffered a Sch380m loss in the first half
last year.
The gas division's profit rose 26 per cent to Sch860m in spite of lower
prices and reduced transport business. The gas storage arm performed well,
taking advantage of increased capacity.
Profit in the marketing division jumped from a nominal Sch30m in the first
half of 1993 to Sch150m in the same period of this year, mainly due to cost
cutting within the domestic network.
The group said it saw 'the first signs of a recovery' in its long troubled
chemicals business in the second quarter, but the reduction in first-half
losses to Sch60m from Sch430m was attributed mainly to cost-cutting.
Similarly, plastics sales rose 4 per cent to Sch3.76bn on higher volumes,
and the division reduced its loss from Sch710m to Sch460m.

FT  24 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Arab-Israeli agreements prise open way for
greater trade ties - Israel predicts a regional common market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After decades of Arab economic isolation, Israel's gradual normalisation of
relations is being cemented by trade agreements which are paving the way to
a commercially interdependent Middle East.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, has predicted the development of
a regional common market, while Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan has advocated
'a Middle East marked by the free movement of people, capital and goods
across national frontiers'.
Such a vision is unlikely to materialise for many years, with Israel opposed
to the free movement of labour and bound by possibly incompatible trade
accords with the US and European Union. Arab states also fear Israeli
economic domination.
However, the newly emerging trade patterns between Israel, the Palestinians
and Jordan provide what Mr Ehud Kaufman, a senior Israeli economic
negotiator, describes as 'the first building blocks' for wider Arab-Israeli
co-operation.
Israel's custom union with Palestinians and last week's unilateral trade
concession allowing Jordan to export Dollars 30m of goods a year into the
Israeli-occupied West Bank will provide immediate economic benefits to
Israel's Arab neighbours.
Mr Ezra Sadan, an Israeli economist, predicts that Palestinian exports to
Israel - now worth Dollars 150-200m annually - will return to the annual
growth rates seen in the 1970s of about 16 per cent.
For Israel, the deals offer political gains, in the form of the greater
security brought by increased Arab-Israeli trade links and as possible
encouragement for other Arab states, such as Syria and Lebanon, into peace
treaties.
Israel also hopes trade concessions will encourage the EU and the Far East
to open up to Israeli exports in the interest of consolidating Middle East
peace.
Under the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, Israel and the self-rule areas of
Gaza and Jericho are forming a free-trade customs union, protected by a
common tariff barrier. The customs union will be extended to the rest of the
West Bank after Palestinian elections due mid-December, but Palestinian
agricultural produce has already begun flowing freely into Israel.
Israel says rising Palestinian agricultural exports to Israel - now worth
Dollars 150-Dollars 200m annually - has provoked a backlash from Israeli
farmers and forced the government to allocate Shk250m (Dollars 83m) in
compensation and export incentives.
Israel has also granted the Palestinians exemptions under the customs union
to import limited quantities of basic food items and high priority inputs
for construction and development at their own customs rates. In addition,
the Palestinians will have VAT of 15 per cent compared with Israel's 17 per
cent, import some consumer goods, such as cars at their own rates and sell
petrol at a pump price 15 per cent lower than Israel's.
The short-term concessional agreement with Jordan allows Jordanian exports
without a reciprocal opening of Jordan to Israeli exports. The move reflects
Jordan's concern about the affect on its protected import substitution
industries of a two-way opening of trade.
The measure will have little impact on Israel's economy and is an important
victory for Israel in its continuing battle to erode the Arab economic
boycott. However the move will only last until Israel hands over the West
Bank to Palestinian self-government. Jordan would then have to negotiate a
permanent trade accord with both partners of the customs union.
Traditional Jordanian-PLO political rivalry remains formidable and
Palestinians may also object to Jordanian competition on economic grounds,
with the few goods that Israel would wish to buy from Jordan likely to
compete directly against Palestinian goods. Arab states are also reluctant
to integrate their economies with Israel - fifteen years after the
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty non-oil trade with Egypt is only worth about
Dollars 10m.

FT  24 AUG 94 / India's airport Customs men are no longer ogres: Getting
through the green channel is easier, but problems remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three years after the start of economic liberalisation, the customs men at
Delhi's international airport have done their best to adapt to deregulation.
Before, the protection of the globe's most regimented economy outside the
communist world required that officials treated travellers with the greatest
suspicion. Dressed in white military-style uniform, the customs men were
lords of all they surveyed.
Anyone carrying a videocamera or computer had to have serial numbers
indelibly written into their passport, to ensure the item was not sold in
some black-market bazaar. Home-bound visitors who came to the airport
without a declared item had to write a long letter of explanation and
apology, and hope customs officials would read it before the flight was
called.
Today, officials are prepared to take on trust visitors bearing a modest
amount of luggage, though almost every bag is still X-rayed. The customs men
remain suspicious of anyone carrying two or more of any high-priced piece of
electronics. 'This is my camera and that's my wife's,' is not an explanation
they like to hear. Armed with the latest price lists from Sony and Toshiba,
they know the exact cost of your new portable compact disc-player, even if
you seem to have forgotten.
As far as the casual visitor to India is concerned, there is no comparison
with what went before. As one customs man says: 'The green channel is now a
mile wide'.
Over at the cargo terminal change is rather less discernible. On first
arriving in Delhi two years ago, innocent of the complexities of Indian
bureaucracy, I went into the cargo terminal to collect a shipment of
clothes. Having obtained from the airline office a vital document called a
delivery order and then strolling over to the customs hall to pick up my
cases, I asked a customs man where to collect the shipment. He laughed and
said: 'Sir, you have completed stage one of a 13-stage process'.
This week, I discovered the process still consists of 13 stages, when going
to collect another shipment, mainly food for my three children who pine for
tuna fish and baked beans. Those who find it bizarre that anyone could go to
the trouble of flying tuna fish and baked beans around the world have never
lived in a closed economy.
The passage through customs takes place inside an enormous warehouse, in
which travellers' possessions are stored behind metal fences. At one end
there is a gate, near which are the offices of the many officials to whom
the visitor must report before he can claim his baggage. In summer the
building is stiflingly hot, except for the officials' glass-walled cabins
which are cooled by air-conditioning to a few degrees below zero.
The International Airports Authority of India (IAAI) offers travellers a
guide through the maze of desk and counters. First, obtain the delivery
order, says the IAAI. Then file the baggage declaration form; obtain the
location slips; obtain the shipmentfrom IAAI staff; complete the customs
inspection; return the shipment to IAAI staff; pay the duty; obtain an
'out-of-charge' form from customs against a duty payment receipt; obtain a
bank challan from the IAAI; pay the IAAI charges; obtain an IAAI gate pass;
present customs-cleared documents to IAAI staff; take delivery of the
shipment from IAAI; pay octroi (local transport tax).
I am still not sure what a challan is, as it gets buried in all the other
documents one must carry around from one counter to another. The greatest
importance is attached to paperwork. A wrong number on any of the documents
needed to gain access to one's goods can mean long delays. The officials are
not in the least irritated by the mind-numbing tedium of their work; they
know perfectly well that lots of rules means lots of jobs for airport staff.
After two and a quarter hours, my shipment is delivered to me on a trolley.
It is quarter to one in the afternoon and I am the first person to leave the
warehouse that day. I sign one record book to acknowledge receipt, and the
trolley moves forward five yards. I sign another record book and the
warehouse guards lift the chain which bars the warehouse entrance. At last I
have access to the tuna and baked beans.

FT  24 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: NFC shock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A profits warning from NFC together with the shock resignation of the
company's chief executive sent shares in the freight group tumbling in heavy
volume. By the close, the shares were down 14 1/2 at 185 1/2 p, making it
the day's biggest retreat among FT-SE 100 constituents while turnover of 15m
shares made it the most heavily traded stock of the day.
Analysts downgraded full year forecasts for the group by around Pounds 10m
to Pounds 110m after third quarter profits of Pounds 76.6m fell short of
expectations of around Pounds 80m. NFC also disappointed the market in June
with lower than expected interim figures.
The resignation of the chief executive after only 18 months in the job took
the market by surprise but market watchers welcomed the decision of Mr
Robbie Burn, the head of the group's UK transport and logistics arm, to
withdraw his resignation. One analyst said: 'This is all a bit of a shock
but I believe the management changes at NFC will counter the negative impact
of the lower than expected figures.'
Shares in leisure group Thorn EMI recovered from early lows to close 9 down
at 1054p, on volume of 2.2m, after the company reported an 18 per cent
decline in first quarter figures.
Profits fell Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 40.4m and dealers moved quickly to sell
the stock sending the shares to a low of 1046p. However, later in the day,
the spotlight moved away from the headline profit figure and analysts
focused on the 25 per cent increase in operating profits, helping the shares
claw back some of the earlier losses.
Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court commented: 'The underlying figures and
statement are encouraging but the shares have had a good run.' An analysts
tour of some of the group's operations begins next week.
Tobacco group Rothmans International shed 9 to 393p as Smith New Court
issued a bearish note in the light of a price war in Australia. The
securities house estimated that the potential lost profits from the
Australian situation amounted to five per cent of the group's total.
Worries about property prices following the Hong Kong government's decision
to pull one of its land auctions sent Hong Kong related stocks lower
yesterday. HSBC fell 8 to 710p and Cable &amp; Wireless slipped to 455p but
rallied to close 2 off at 460p.
Barclays was actively traded as Hoare Govett pushed a bullish line on the
bank's prospects. The house believes that the bank has some Pounds 20bn in
low profit lending which it wants to cut out or restructure. The argument is
that much of the cash will be liberated in the form of higher dividends and
possibly a share buy back. Hoare predicts a 25 per cent rise in the dividend
every year for the next few years. The shares rose 2 to 568p with volume
heavy at 9.3m.
Composite insurer Commercial Union lifted 7 to 547p as Smith New Court
reiterated its long-term buy recommendation on the stock. The house believes
that although the purchase of Groupe Victoire will knock CU's asset value
down to 580p a share initially the NAV will rise 2 per cent a year more than
it would have done previously as a result of the acquisition.
A weak oil price was countered by optimism over refining margins and, in the
case of Shell Transport, over the dividend. Shell is to announce its first
half dividend on September 15. Because of the weakness of sterling against
the Dutch guilder it could, according to some analysts, boost its UK payout
by 16 per cent. It is unlikely to be that high but some houses were
apparently mooting the idea of rises as high as 12 per cent - the current
prejudice remains in favour of 8 per cent. Shell improved 4 to 718p while BP
was firm at 406p.
Chemicals group Courtaulds slipped 6 to 527p as institutional investors
reacted to a cautious note from BZW. The investment bank argues that the
hope value invested in Tencel, the company's new fibre, was already
discounted by the shares' 27 per cent premium to the FT-A All Share Index.
A clutch of broker's recommendations powered industrial group Charter, which
on Monday declared its bid for welding equipment supplier Esab
unconditional. The group is expected to win the 90 per cent acceptances it
needs to achieve a complete takeover.
The shares jumped 26 to 796p, with Kleinwort Benson and NatWest Securities
among brokers recommending the shares.
British Steel put 4 3/4 to 155p, after stainless steel group Avesta
Sheffield, its Swedish joint venture, returned to profit in the first half
of the year.
Holiday group Airtours had a volatile day. The shares were down 15 early in
the session on rumours that the group was about to issue a profits warning.
Calls to the company from anxious dealers and analysts met with a 'no
comment' reply which initially increased the market worries.
However, mid-session bargain hunters started a recovery and, together with
the dismissal of the early rumours by many analysts, the shares closed 4
ahead at 449p. The early negative sentiment weakened rival Owners Abroad
which gave up 1 1/2 to 104 1/2 p.
Printing group Wace jumped 16 to 270p after announcing interim profits up 57
per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market has the scent of a big takeover in the pharmaceuticals sector and
refuses to let go. Yesterday there was a whiff of very big game being hunted
by Glaxo, the UK leader, with Wellcome pinpointed as prime target.
A story in the US press said Glaxo had secured a Dollars 16bn line of
credit. This gave rise to suggestions that it might be looking at either Eli
Lilly, the new owner of prized pharmacy benefit manager PCS, Warner Lambert
or Wellcome. Although analysts and dealers were sceptical they were running
through the numbers and suggesting that Lilly would have a take-out price of
Dollars 70 to Dollars 75 a share and Lambert of over Dollars 100. Wertheim
Schroder had already suggested that Wellcome might be bought at 900p a share
and was stoking interest in the sector yesterday with a piece of research
arguing for a strong overweight stance. Analyst Dr Jonathan Gelles argued
that investors should be up to three times overweight but should perhaps
switch from SmithKline which was suffering from a 'thwarted strategy' and
erosion of profits by generic rivals to Tagamet, its anti-ulcer treatment.
Glaxo shares rose 6 to 645p and Wellcome 9 to 709p while SmithKline was flat
at 448p.

FT  24 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong opening on Wall Street lifts
UK equities - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong rally in the dollar after prolonged weakness provided a much-needed
boost to international bond markets and helped resuscitate a UK equity
market suffering from an acute dose of inactivity.
The FT-SE 100 index ended a difficult session a net 3.8 higher at 3,171.3
and there was a feeling around the City's trading desks that a good closing
performance by Wall Street could see the UK equity market launch another
attempt on the 3,200 level. There was encouragement for that view after
London closed with the Dow-Jones Average up more than 26 points more than
two hours after trading finished in the UK.
The FT-SE Mid 250 index moved in tandem with the senior FT-SE index, ending
the day 3.6 up at 3,753.4 and was given a substantial push by another strong
performance from the utilities areas of the market where there were
persistent rumours that a predatory move against one of the regional
electricity stocks might materialise sooner rather than later.
The main driving force for share prices in London came from the gilts market
where long-dated stocks, which were down almost half a point early in the
session, rallied to end the day fractionally higher on balance.
The dollar's improvement, which drew an instant response across
international financial centres, came as markets were said to have adopted
an early bullish view of the current series of bond auctions. Yesterday saw
the auction of over Dollars 17bn worth of two-year bonds while today brings
the sale of Dollars 11bn of five-year debt. Traders also said that the
dollar had been oversold and was due a rally.
Many dealers remained unconvinced that the market was about to move ahead,
pointing to the recent low turnover levels in what is traditionally once of
the quietest trading periods of the year. Turnover in equities yesterday was
556.5m shares, with non FT-SE 100 stocks accounting for just short of 60 per
cent of the total.
Sentiment at the close was in marked contrast with the early part of the
trading session. An early attempt to mark stock prices higher succeeded only
briefly as both the FT-SE future and the long gilt future were hit by
flurries of substantial selling pressure.
The FT-SE 100 which posted a gain of around two points minutes after the
opening subsequently ran back to show a double-figure decline in
mid-morning.
Thereafter, prices began to stabilise, recognising the gradual improvement
in the dollar, and subsequently improved to close at the day's best levels.
Late trading was featured by a series of big individual trades, including
the purchase of a block of 2.2m Vodafone, the UK's leading cellular phones
group. The FT-SE 100's best individual performance came from Prudential
where one institution was said to have paid 318p a share for a block of 1.6m
shares. Insurance shares are among the market's worst performers this year,
dealers said.
Financials also provided two good performers in Barclays, which shrugged off
recent switching into NatWest and responded instead to a bullish circular,
and Bank of Scotland, which continued to respond to a recent upgrade.
Guinness, the brewing and distilling group, was also heavily traded as the
session drew to a close.
Worries about developments in milk marketing continued to affect the
market's two big dairy produce groups, Northern Foods and Unigate.
NFC, the transport group, was the FT-SE 100's worst performer, slipping back
in the wake of the resignation of the chief executive and a profits warning.
NFC is now regarded as the prime candidate to drop out of the prestigious
FT-SE 100 list when the constituents list is next reviewed.

FT  24 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures rallied after an uncertain start, responding to a sharp
upturn in international bonds and a firmer showing by the dollar. Dealers
took the view that both areas were oversold, writes Steve Thompson.
The September futures contract opened at 3,185 but ran into selling
pressure, unsettled by the recent slide in the dollar and worries about the
big US bond auctions taking place yesterday, retreating to what turned out
to be the day's low, 3,171, in mid- morning.
Thereafter, the contract began to rally with support triggered by a gradual
improvement in international bond markets and a strong opening on Wall
Street, which was over 20 points higher when London closed. By the close of
trading the futures contract had moved up to 3,191, a premium of around
eight points to fair value. Dealers said it was set for another move above
3,200.
It was another disappointing day in traded options where volume came out at
21,800 lots. The FT-SE option was especially disappointing, dealers said,
with turnover reaching only 5,000 contracts. HSBC was the busiest stock
option, attracting turnover of 2,206 contracts, reacting to a sharp decline
in the underlying shares which were undermined by news that the Hong Kong
authorities had withdrawn its latest land auction.

FT  24 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs on bonds and
progress at Deere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks rallied yesterday on news of a strong quarterly performance by
Deere, the farm equipment manufacturer, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 24.61 higher at 3,775.83, while
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.20 ahead at 464.51.
Activity on the Big Board was brisk, with 307m shares traded by the close.
Advancing issues led declines by nearly a two-to-one margin.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was up 0.51 at 446.28,
and the Nasdaq composite gained 5.69 to 747.97.
After several days of weakness, stocks opened higher and advanced steadily
until the late afternoon. The improvement came as investors suspended
nagging concerns over the impact of higher interest rates on corporate
profitability.
The change in tone was partly explained by a firming trend in bonds, which
had dragged down share prices since the day after last week's move to
tighter credit conditions. Treasuries posted modest gains as the dollar
ended the day slightly stronger against other leading currencies.
The session's most influential development was the release of a surprisingly
robust earnings report by Deere. In addition to revealing impressive gains
in third-quarter revenue and net income, the company said that it was
boosting its North American production schedule in view of an expanding
economy and the improved outlook for US farm incomes.
The announcement triggered fresh enthusiasm for many stocks whose
performances are closely linked to broad economic trends. The rebound by
such cyclical issues suggested investors were hedging their bets on the
direction of the economy in the coming months. At the very least, the
company's results encouraged some bargain-hunting.
Deere was the greatest beneficiary of the mood swing, its share price
jumping 5 per cent or Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 69 1/2 . Agco, a Deere
competitor, gained Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 45 1/4 . Among the Dow
industrials, Caterpillar set the pace with a gain of Dollars 4 3/8 to
Dollars 111 5/8 , while Allied Signal climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 35
3/4 .
Elsewhere, Cummins Engine improved Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 40 7/8 and Clark
Equipment was up Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 68 1/2 .
In the consumer non-durable sector, Philip Morris was Dollars 1 1/4 better
at Dollars 56 1/2 . Investors were anticipating the company would raise its
dividend or announce a share repurchase program at next week's annual
meeting.
Canada
Toronto stocks closed higher with a solid gain. The TSE-300 composite index
was up 25.26 points, or 0.60 per cent, to 4,211.68.
Losing issues, however, held a slight lead over winners by 378 to 373.
Volume rose to 73.69m shares worth CDollars 979.5m from Monday's 46.26m
valued at CDollars 532.6m.
Mexico
Equities surrendered early gains to show a slight loss on profit-taking and
unconfirmed market rumours of post-electoral trouble in the southern state
of Chiapas.
The IPC index of 37 leading shares closed 3.44 points, or 0.12 per cent,
lower at 2,755.33 after earlier soaring to 2,800.86 in heavy volume trading.
After peeping above the psychological 2,800-point level, the market began
falling back on profit-taking and the rumours accelerated the decline.
Of the 127 issues traded, 80 were still higher and 30 were down with 17
unchanged.
Telmex L shares were down 0.18 percent although its A shares were up 0.18
percent. Telmex ADRs were down  5/8 to 65 7/8 in New York.
Brazil
Mild profit-taking cut stock prices in Sao Paulo market by 1.5 per cent at
the close as the market staged a small correction to a 28 per cent rise in
the first three weeks of August.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares ended down 818 at 53,040
points. On the Rio bourse, the ISENN fell 1.1 per cent to 20,548 points.
Turnover was 442.3m reais (Dollars 499.2m).

FT  24 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): VW punished for second-half
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recovery in New York offered late-closing bourses a more comfortable
afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT found reasons to move and had a busier, volatile day. The Dax
index was nearly 2 per cent lower at one point before it recovered to close
15.92 lower at 2,107.87. and before a post-bourse recovery to an
Ibis-indicated 2,121.25, up 7.88 in 24 hours.
On Monday, the Dax had breached its 200 day moving average, said Ms Barbara
Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt, and a fall to around 2,080 was indicated.
However, after the key index hit its intraday low of 2,086.93, there was
short covering in both equities and in bund futures; especially evident in
the afternoon, this produced the later recovery.
Turnover rose from DM4.7bn to DM7bn. Disappointment hit Volkswagen after its
chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, forecast lower German car orders in the second
half of 1994. The shares dropped DM21.50 on the session to DM483, and
recovered only DM2 after hours.
Profit taking left Mannesmann DM13 lower at DM438.50 but stocks which had
been punished recently, like Deutsche Bank and Schering, made the most of
the short-covering process, the bank ending the post-bourse up DM16.50 at
DM697.50 and the pharmaceuticals group up DM18.10 at DM890.10 after a drop
of DM85.50 in the previous week.
AMSTERDAM staged a partial recovery, although sentiment remained weak. The
AEX index added 1.50 to 410.83.
Philips was among the gainers, adding 30 cents to Fl 57.10 following news
that Standard &amp; Poor's, the ratings agency, had lifted its recommendation on
the electronics group from stable to positive.
Gist-Brocades went against the trend, shedding 50 cents to Fl 46.80, as
investors continued to react to Monday's disappointing half year results.
PARIS recovered all of Monday's losses on a technical bounce which came
towards the end of the session following the opening of trading on Wall
Street. The CAC-40 index added 28.00 or 1.4 per cent to 2,000.63.
Turnover was FFr3bn.
Euro Disney and Eurotunnel continued to dominate activity, with the former
adding 25 centimes at FFr10.55 in volume of almost 2m shares and the latter
unchanged at FFr24.15 with 1.3m shares changing hands.
MILAN ended an uninspired session very slightly lower as trading volume
eased from already depressed levels. The Comit index slipped 0.59 to 675.55.
One sector to show strength was insurance, with gains here coming towards
the end of the day's trading on unconfirmed reports that the government
might highlight the industry in the budget package. Generali rose L900 to
L41,500 while RAS put on L1,000 to L25,800.
Olivetti was active for the second day, the shares rising L30 to L2,360 with
a large block of shares crossing the market.
Elsewhere Telecom Italia, advanced L150 to L4,590 while Stet fell L10 to
L5,240.
MADRID broke a seven-day downtrend, although the general index only
recovered 1.03 to 304.24 in a timid acknowledgement of the uptrend on Wall
Street. Turnover was low at Pta20.6bn.
ZURICH ended little changed, the SMI index easing 1.5 to 2,530.9 with Brown
Boveri and Roche recovering SFr9 to SFr1,185, and SFr55 to SFr5,680
respectively.
STOCKHOLM retreated as a rise in domestic bond yields weighed on the equity
market. The Affarsvarlden general index lost 10.00 to 1,411.30.
Turnover was a light SKr1.9bn, down from Monday's SKr3.1bn.
The forest sector was a significant underperformer following worse than
expected first half results from Stora, off SKr9 at SKr445. MoDo lost SKr8
to SKr354.
Banking stocks were also depressed as profits were taken on strong results:
Handelsbanken A lost SKr3 to SKr98.
COPENHAGEN, closing early in the day, fell 1.4 per cent, the KFX index
ending 1.39 lower at a year's low of 97.53. However, the banking group,
Unidanmark, climbed DKr11 to DKr231 on Tuesday's smaller than expected drop
in pre tax profits.
TEL AVIV rose for a second session following a sharp correction on Sunday
which reflected the introduction of a capital gains tax. The Mishtanim index
gained 168.90 or 2.7 per cent to 173.53.
ISTANBUL slid nearly 6 per cent in a bout of profit-taking triggered by
volatility on the currency markets. The composite index fell 1,577.85 to
25,204.81, having seen a session low of 25,026.
The Turkish lira fell against the dollar after the central bank raised
currency rates. However, analysts felt that the downturn could be attributed
mainly to investors taking profits following the market's gain of some 21
per cent since August 5.

FT  24 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Monetary policies key to Brussels
revival - The bourse has outperformed this year, especially in dollar terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
August may be a sleepy month in Belgium but the Brussels stock exchange, at
least, had laurels to rest on after a late July and early August rally which
surprised observers, coming immediately after a 1994 market low on July 13.
Buoyed up by much better than expected half-year results from some of
Belgium's biggest blue-chip companies, the Bel-20 weighted index of the 20
largest stocks rose 6.6 per cent to 1,485.54 in a little under four weeks to
August 8, against the high of 1,542.65 it reached early in February.
'In those few weeks we saw a clear rally in industrial company stock after a
very bad June,' said Mr Michel Ernst, investment research manager at Dewaay,
the Brussels-based brokers.
Belgium has outperformed other continental European stock markets since the
beginning of the year, especially if the strength of its currency is taken
into account.
Measured by the FT-Actuaries World Indices, Brussels had risen by 8.1 per
cent in terms of the weakening dollar by last Friday, against a 2.6 per cent
gain for Europe as a whole.
The country's relatively better showing can be explained partly by a
succession of small but steady cuts in short term interest rates since
January. Having taken longer to act last year than some of its neighbours,
the central bank changed its pace at the start of the year, contributing to
a climate of good sentiment through some 25 small rate cuts.
Also helping to keep the market steady has been the absence of new issues,
unlike the situation in France, for example, where the privatisation
programme produced a good deal of new paper.
'In Belgium there has been virtually nothing,' said one London-based broker.
'There has been no new paper around for people to buy.'
Further, macroeconomic news has been more promising than last year, when the
economy remained locked in recession.
In its recent budget statement the government was confident that it would
not have to raise taxes or cut spending in order to meet next year's budget
deficit target of 4.3 per cent of gross domestic product, thanks to higher
than expected growth.
Although the government's comments helped stem some of the worst fears about
Belgium's huge deficit problems, certain analysts are sceptical about the
official growth forecasts.
'The government has based its forecast on a pick-up in consumption in 1994,
as people reduce their savings. We don't think that will happen. So far
there have been no signs of any real improvement in domestic consumption,'
said Mr Ernst.
The pleasant surprises that prompted the recent rally came from the interim
results of Belgium's big petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals companies,
Solvay, UCB, and Petrofina.
Petrofina, the biggest of Belgium's energy groups, announced that recovery
in petrochemical activities and gains from asset sales helped lift interim
profits to BFr5.2bn in the first half of the year compared with BFr3.8bn a
year ago. This came after similarly encouraging results from Solvay and UCB.
Thanks to the results from the blue chips, the outlook is good. Brokers have
been urging clients to buy industrial stocks, with expectations high for
more good results from the banks and distribution companies next month.
'We must wait until September in order to confirm the good results we have
already seen,' said Mr Ernst. 'This could be the signal for the stock
exchange to go into an upward trend.'
One potentially unsettling event on the horizon is October's communal
elections. Analysts are unsure whether, like the European elections, these
will be used as an opportunity to pass judgement on the federal government.
'I don't think they will be seen as a national test. The issues involved are
different,' said Mr Vanbol. 'There will be some nervousness but no great
upheaval.'

FT  24 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei down again amid
uncertainties and gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices fluctuated on index-linked activity, and the Nikkei index
closed lower for the third consecutive day in thin trading, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei index lost 13.80 to 20,380.78 after fluctuating on selling by
arbitrageurs and buying by public funds. The index fell to a low of
20,316.56 in the first few minutes of trading, and hit a high of 20,503.10
in the afternoon.
Technical trading dominated activity as most domestic investors remained on
the sidelines due to increasing uncertainty over the movement in the yen
against the dollar. The dollar fell to a one-month low below the Y97 level,
but later recovered to the Y98 line due to buying by the Bank of Japan.
Volume totalled 192m shares against 181m. Foreign investors took profits,
their holdings having appreciated thanks to the rise in the yen.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 5.66 to 1,631.79 and the
Nikkei 300 lost 0.78 to 297.00. Declines led advances by 664 to 290 with 217
unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.56 to 1,325.50.
Large capital steels and shipbuilders were actively traded. Nippon Steel,
the most active issue of the day, remained unchanged at Y362, while Sumitomo
Metal Industries lost Y3 to Y333.
High-technology stocks were mostly lower. Toshiba fell Y3 to Y740 and Sharp
declined Y10 to Y1,770. Sony, however, gained Y20 to Y5,890 on reports that
it is shifting new investments of its audio visual division overseas.
Some drug makers, theoretically unaffected by the yen's fluctuation,
advanced. Sankyo rose Y20 to Y2,350 and Dainippon Pharmaceutical added Y10
to Y1,130. However, Takeda Chemical Industries fell Y10 to Y1,250 on profit
taking.
DDI, the telecommunications operator listed on the second section, rose
Y6,000 to Y934,000 on bargain hunting. Some traders said the issue, which
fell from over Y1m last week, had been previously sold by investors raising
money for Thursday's auction of Japan Telecom, another long distance
operator.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 69.17 to 22,779.68 in volume of 74.6m shares.
The OSE index fell for the fourth straight trading day.
Roundup
Sentiment was gloomy in most of the region. Bombay remained closed for a
holiday.
HONG KONG dropped sharply as disappointment over the government land auction
results brought late selling. Bearish sentiment towards the dollar also took
its toll of the market.
The Hang Seng index lost 223.27, or 2.4 per cent to 9,234.06. Turnover was
HKDollars 3bn. Mainland Chinese stocks also came under pressure, with the
H-share index falling 42.01 to 1,193.10.
Properties suffered the most, after the government withdrew a third site
scheduled for auction and the first two were sold at the opening bid for
prices well below expectations.
Sun Hung Kai fell HKDollars 2.25, or 4.3 per cent, to HKDollars 50.50,
Henderson Land slid HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 39.70 and Cheung Kong
weakened HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 35.30.
SINGAPORE was characterised by a lack of buying interest on all fronts. The
Straits Times Industrial index finished 18.06 lower at 2,302.88, weighed
down by a 40 cent fall in both Cycle &amp; Carriage and Fraser &amp; Neave.
Investors preferred to focus on Malaysian shares traded over the counter.
SEOUL fell victim to aggressive profit-taking as investors took the view
that the market's recent rise had been exaggerated. The composite index
retreated 11.45 to 951.51, well off its intraday high of 971.12.
Samsung Electronics and Kepco, which led the recent rally, fell 1,000 won
and 600 won to 112,400 won and 29,800 won respectively.
TAIPEI weakened, although late bargain-hunting in electronics issues helped
lift prices off session lows. The weighted index lost 40.41 to 6,798.19 but
had recovered from a low of 6,740.14.
SYDNEY ended lower amid investor concerns about US inflationary pressures.
The All Ordinaries index fell 12 to 2,051.6.
BHP ended lower in line with the market but News Corp posted a modest rally.
News shares remained well bid after its decision to raise the price of its
UK 'Sun' newspaper by 10 per cent.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Soros helps the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Soros, the influential US investor, yesterday helped the dollar
and sterling retrace some of their recent losses, writes Philip Gawith.
Comments from Mr Soros in a TV programme, warning about the dangers of a
weak dollar, helped boost the US currency, and sterling followed in its
wake.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.5377, up from DM1.5309. Against the yen
it was also firmer, finishing at Y98.45 from Y97.96.
The pound rose by over 1 1/2 pfennigs to close at DM2.3893 from DM2.3729.
The sterling index finished at 78.6 from 78.2.
Little significance was attached to the moves which took place against the
background of no fresh data or policy developments.
With the dollar firmer, the D-Mark also lost ground in Europe. The most
significant gain came from the Spanish peseta which finished at Pta 83.34
from Pta 83.73. Analysts said it was the beneficiary of better economic data
and predictions of good figures in August.
Mr Soros's comments, which were re-run from an earlier TV showing, cautioned
against dollar depreciation. 'If you allow the currency to depreciate too
much, that ..can be very destabilising because of its inflationary
implications and its implications for the bond market,' he said.
Mr Steve Barrow, international economist at Chemical Bank, commented: 'The
market seems to be so devoid of any ideas at the moment that it latched onto
Soros.' There was little follow-through buying, however, and the dollar was
trading weaker in the New York afternoon.
The only fundamental development of interest was the recommencement, in
Seattle, of US-Japan framework talks on access to each other's insurance
markets. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the Japanese finance minister, said in Tokyo
that the two countries had made more progress in the insurance sector than
in the other priority areas of government procurement and car and vehicle
parts.
Mr Takemura also said he regretted the recent rise of the yen. He said
'timely and appropriate' measures were necessary in order to achieve
currency stability.
Although progress in the trade talks would help the dollar, numerous
obstacles appear to stand in the way of dollar recovery. Mr Mark Austin,
treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets, offered a neat summary: 'The
fundamental problem for the dollar is unchanged. Relatively robust economic
growth means that trade and current account deficits are continuing to
widen.'
'At the same time, investor appetite for Dollar assets is limited by the
perception that the direction for short term rates is firmly upward and that
this still poses risks for the bond and equity markets.'
'International diversification by US investors also appears to be
continuing, and the net effect is to put downward pressure on the dollar,
which is only periodically relieved by speculative buying.'
An insight into how investors have shifted positions on the dollar comes
from Merrill Lynch's August 1994 quarterly global investor survey results.
These show how investors have continued to trim their dollar exposures in
favour of the D-Mark.
Historically there has been a clear positive correlation between shifts in
investors' holdings, and the dollar's trade-weighted value.
On a scale where 50 constitutes a neutral position, the net weighted average
exposure to dollars fell from 53.25 on May 26, and 60.5 on March 3, to
51.25. The net weighted average exposure to the D-Mark rose from 54.25 in
May and 42.25 in March, to 57.25. These figures represent the highest
reading for D-Mark exposure since October 1990, and the lowest US dollar
reading since November 1991.
Investors remain significantly underweight in yen, where exposure fell from
38.5 to a low of 33.25.
The outlook for German interest rates remains unclear following comments
from senior Bundesbank officials. One unnamed official told the newspaper
Handelsblatt that the central bank's decision last week, to leave all three
of its rates unchanged, showed 'a conscious policy of the steady hand at a
time of persistent interest rate uncertainty.'
He said an official rate cut or a return to a variable-rate repo 'would have
risked ending hopes of a rate cut prematurely.' Mr Otmar Issing, the
Bundesbank council member, was quoted in the Italian press saying that
German inflation would continue to fall.
These comments were insufficient to give the futures market much direction,
with the December Euromark contract finishing at 94.85 from 94.84. German
call money was unchanged at 4.85/4.95 per cent ahead of today's repo
allocation. The repo rate is currently fixed at 4.85 per cent.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 370m late
assistance. Earlier it had provided Pounds 28m in the afternoon round after
forecasting a Pounds 550m shortage. Overnight money traded between 4 1/2 and
6 1/2 per cent.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HAMBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Higher world market prices for green coffee since the introduction last
October of the producer's export retention scheme resulted in expanded
plantings in Brazil's Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo states, the German coffee
industry association DKV said yesterday, reports Reuters from Hamburg.
The use of fertiliser had also increased, according to an article in DKV's
bulletin assessing Brazil's crop damage following the frosts in June and
July.
Some farmers might still be able to reap good harvests and to reinvest their
higher earnings in the wake of frost damage to the 1995-96 crop, DKV said.
About 1bn Brazilian coffee trees, a quarter of the total, had been felled
between 1991 and 1993 as depressed world prices made production largely
unprofitable.
Brazil's 1994-95 crop would be in a range of 22m to 25m bags (60kg each),
while the 1995-96 crop should be reduced by 9m or 10m from 25m to 30m bags
expected before the frosts, the article said, citing US and trade estimates.
The Brazilian authorities had put the frost-hit crop at 15m to 17m bags.
Depending on the extent of the damage, which will not be fully apparent
until October, Brazil could return to good harvests as early as 1996-97, DKV
said.
In any case sizeable crops were likely to re-emerge in 1997-98.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices jump as buyers
find supplies tight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buying interest from coffee manufacturers and a shortage of supplies drove
coffee futures prices sharply higher in London yesterday.
The second position robusta contract rose Dollars 156 to close just below
the day's high at Dollars 3,570 a tonne, giving a two-day rally of 7.7 per
cent.
Prices on the London Commodity Exchange were helped by a strong performance
in New York on Monday, which continued yesterday. The December arabica
contract was 7.5 cents stronger in afternoon trading at 197 cents a pound.
The rally took London prices back to the levels of two and a half weeks ago.
But November futures were still about Dollars 500 off the peak reached in
the wake of the second frost in Brazil in early July.
'At the lower levels of the past two weeks there has been significant
interest from roasters to accumulate and extend their cover,' said Mr Robert
MacArthur, head of tropical trading at Merrill Lynch in London.
'Selling by growers is restricted because they don't want to be too
aggressive in selling at these lower levels.'
Continued dry weather in Brazil has encouraged the bulls, since it is likely
to hamper the flowering season, which begins next month. The US Department
of Agriculture warned last week that rainfall was now needed for a
'favourable' flowering season.
Some traders were expecting trade demand to increase in the run-up to the
important winter roasting period, but they hesitated to predict how much
prices might recover while the true extent of the frost damage in Brazil was
still unclear.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper leads LME metals to
firmer ground - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Significant underlying demand for COPPER uncovered by a dip yesterday
morning gave encouragement to other London Metal Exchange contracts, which
closed mostly higher on the day.
'Everyone wants to buy copper on dips . . . there's a widespread feeling
that the copper price could move up strongly in September,' a trader
commented.
Early dealer selling and liquidation and an LME warehouse stocks rise put
copper on the defensive in early trading and the three months delivery
position fell to Dollars 2,370 a tonne. But at the close it was at Dollars
2,390, up Dollars 7 a tonne.
Traders said the early sell-off in copper reflected volatility created by
the market adjusting to a new, lower, short-term trading range.
ALUMINIUM was also undermined by a stocks rise, three months metal dipping
to Dollars 1,477 a tonne in early trade. A steady recovery for the rest of
the day triggered shortcovering in after hours trading, however, which
prompted a burst up to Dollars 1,504, up Dollars 19 from Monday.
Traders warned that selling was likely to be attracted above Dollars 1,500,
though a break above Dollars 1,510 could signal fresh gains.
ZINC remained underpinned by trade buying and rallied to the top end of its
narrow trading range late in the day. From a morning low of Dollars 963 a
tonne the three months price rallied to Dollars 969, up Dollars 5 on the
day.
European precious metals markets remained quiet as New York, where most of
the recent moves have started, failed to offer direction.
In London, GOLD closed at Dollars 382 a troy ounce, down 70 cents, while
SILVER eased 2 cents to Dollars 5.22 1/2 an ounce.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian farm returns boosted
by livestock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australian farmers saw an overall 4 per cent increase in prices received in
1993-94. But the improvement, which compared with a 2.1 per cent fall in
1992-93, was largely due to higher returns from livestock and wool. Crop
prices were generally lower than in the previous year.
The figures, produced by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource
Economics and published yesterday, showed that cattle prices increased by 14
per cent, thanks to a reduction in slaughterings and higher export prices.
Prices of lambs and sheep rose by 12 and 23 per cent respectively, while
wool prices were 3.9 per cent higher.
Grain prices, by contrast, fell for the second year in succession, with a
6.7 per cent decrease in 1993-94 following the 4.6 per cent dip in 1992-93.
The price fall for barley was 13 per cent and for wheat, 9.6 per cent. Only
a few crops bucked the trend: sugar prices, for example, rose 12 per cent
and tomato returns were up 30 per cent. Wine grape growers enjoyed a 17 per
cent rise, while cotton prices were up 5.5 per cent.
The index of prices paid by farmers rose by only 2.6 per cent, with the most
noticeable increases coming for store and breeding stock and for plant and
equipment.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil market takes stock after
sharp fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices steadied yesterday as traders pondered whether the latest sharp
falls signalled a breakdown in prices or merely a deep correction.
The price of the benchmark Brent Blend was about Dollars 15.90 a barrel in
late London trading yesterday, 20 cents up from the close of Dollars 15.70
on Monday, when a 60 cent fall pushed the Brent price below Dollars 16 for
the first time since June.
Some analysts yesterday said heavy selling by commodity and derivative funds
were a big factor in pushing prices down. But one London trader noted that
it was the 'oil community' that started the selling spree.
The latest falls in large part reflected a growing conviction in the markets
that the political crisis and strike by oil workers in Nigeria would not
lead to further big supply disruptions. 'The markets have discarded Nigeria
as a factor,' according to Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at the
London office of US brokers Smith Barney.
Other analysts noted that concern over a cut-off in Nigerian supplies
coincided with prices approaching the top end of the Dollars 15-Dollars 19
range which many have predicted for the year.
'The Nigerian crisis hit at a time of upside fatigue,' said Mr Vahan
Zanoyan, an analyst with the Washington DC-based Petroleum Finance Company.
He believed prices went up too fast in response to the threat of major
supply disruptions, which never materialised. Prices at the higher end of
the range needed continuous support from events and were 'more sensitive to
bearish news,' he added.
Another factor contributing to the oil price fall was the imminent shut down
for maintenance of a large number of US refineries. In addition there are
plentiful supplies, especially from the North Sea, of the light crude oil
which Nigeria mainly produces.
Most analysts, however, are predicting that supply pressures are likely to
emerge towards the end of the year. This is because of rising world demand
and the fact that other members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries are so far showing no signs of cheating on their production
quotas.

pact

   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The world's main rubber producing nations will meet in Thailand next month
to discuss their negotiating strategy for a new global price stabilisation
pact, an official from a rubber producers council said here yesterday,
reports Reuters from Kuala Lumpur.
Mr Sucharit Promdej, secretary-general of the Association of Natural Rubber
Producing Countries said the meeting would be held in Hatyai on September 23
and 24.
'We will have a round of informal talks there before we go to Geneva for the
second round of negotiations for a new agreement,' he said after the ANRPC
met.
Major rubber producing and consuming nations are to meet in Geneva from
October 3-14 to negotiate the third International Natural Rubber Agreement.
Producers and consumers remain at odds over the benchmark prices for rubber,
with producers saying they are too low and consumers saying they are just
right.
The ANRPC groups India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Singapore,
Sri Lanka and Thailand, which between them control about 80 per cent of the
world's supply. It met in Kuala Lumpur to discuss decisions taken by a
special executive session of the International Natural Rubber Organisation
on Monday.
The Inro council decided to continue selling rubber from its stockpile in a
so far vain attempt to pull down prices from six-year highs.
Mr Sucharit said the informal round in Hatyai would focus on demands by
producers for higher reference prices for rubber, which have remained
basically unchanged since the first rubber pact was agreed in 1979.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold market absorbs fund
'dishoarding'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At least 880 tonnes of gold (28m troy ounces) was bought by hedge and
commodity funds in 1993, according to estimates by the American Precious
Metals Advisors consultancy organisation.
It suggests that the funds then sold at least 520 tonnes (17m ounces) in the
first half of 1994.
Mr Jeffrey Nichols, APMA's president, says gold sales by the funds have
undoubtedly continued in the second half of this year.
'What is quite remarkable is that the market has absorbed this incremental
supply without much agony and the price of gold has remained mostly in the
Dollars 375 to Dollars 395 (an ounce) range,' he says in the latest issue of
APMA's MetalsFAX.
'This is testimony to the strength of investment and jewellery demand from
Asia and the Middle East,' he states. 'The implication is that, when
institutional dishoarding (of gold) has run its course, barring a resumption
of large central bank sales, there will be insufficient supplies to satisfy
market requirements.'
Mr Nichols points out that most of the gold buying and selling by the funds
was principally through derivative instruments such as exchange-traded
futures; over-the-counter, or dealer, forwards; options; and warrants. Some
other large-scale players in the gold market, particularly many European and
Middle Eastern investors who years ago participated exclusively in the
physical bullion market, are also now trading principally in derivative
instruments.
He argues that this change has obscured their activities to some analysts,
'resulting in a false picture of what's really going on in the gold
investment arena'.
Mr Nichols suggests that the markets for gold derivatives and bullion are
not really separate and distinct markets, but are 'a seamless, interrelated,
single market,' because every purchase or sale of gold derivatives
translates into buying or selling of gold bullion in the physical market.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries show slight gain as dollar
stalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds were finishing with slight gains yesterday after tracking
the dollar's movements in the foreign exchange markets.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/32 at
99 15/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.538 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was up  1/16 at 99 27/32 , to yield 6.192 per cent.
For the second day, there was no fresh economic guidance to push prices out
of their tight range. Traders again focused their attention on the dollar,
which recovered some lost ground against other leading currencies in the
early going, only to slip back in the afternoon.
The reaction to the greenback's early improvement was favourable, though
restrained. By midday, securities across the maturity range showed modest
gains in light trading.
Activity picked up in the early afternoon, when strong demand surfaced for a
Treasury auction of Dollars 17.25bn in new two-year notes. Bonds extended
their gains when the issue was awarded with a yield of 6.27 per cent, a
little lower than expected.
But the rally was quickly aborted, partly due to the dollar's inability to
hold its early gains. The market's timidity after the successful two-year
sale did not bode well for today's auction of Dollars 11bn in five-year
securities.
European government bond markets got off to a weak start yesterday as
traders remained wary in the absence of any economic data. But they
recovered in the afternoon due to a technical 'squeeze' which forced dealers
wanting to cover their short positions to chase bond prices higher.
The release today of US durable goods orders data for July and news from
Germany on inflation in August could provide the markets with a fresh
direction, analysts said. However, they said volume was likely to remain
thin until the end of the holiday season. 'There is no fundamental reason
for investors to get involv-ed,' said Mr Sanjay Joshi, chief economist at
Daiwa Europe.
The main casualty of the day was the Italian government bond market, which
fell heavily at the opening on a newspaper report which appeared to suggest
that the government was considering a rise in the withholding tax on
government short-term bills and certificates to 15 per cent from 12.5 per
cent.
On Liffe, September Italian government bond futures lost 1 1/2 points to the
day's low of 97.54 in reaction to the interview with Mr Filippo Berselli,
under-secretary at the finance ministry. But they recovered to trade around
98.33 in late afternoon, down 0.47 point on the day, after the official said
that the government had no plans to raise the tax.
Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets, said
that in spite of yesterday's confusion, a rise in the tax was not out of the
question. Indeed, such a move could well be accepted by the market if it was
presented as part of a decent package of measures aimed at tackling the
budget deficit. In any case most overseas investors did not pay the tax, he
said.
News that the Bundespost was issuing DM2.5bn worth of 10-year paper did not
thrill the bund market but prices ended higher on the day due to technical
short-covering. On Liffe, the September bund future stood 0.23 point higher
at 91.46 in late trading, off the day's low of 90.96.
Some dealers were hopeful that better-than-expected inflation data would
provide some relief. A rise in the yearly rate to 3 per cent from 2.9 per
cent had already been discounted by the market so a flat result could well
produce a recovery, they said.
The firmer tone in bunds and a minor rebound in sterling helped UK gilts
stage a late rally although the long end did better than the short end of
the yield curve. On Liffe, the September long gilt future rose by 1/8 point
to 100 7/8 in later trading, off the day's low of 100 5/32.

FT  24 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Morgan Stanley falls 46% in
second term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Stanley yesterday reported a 46 per cent decline in second-quarter
profits to Dollars 121m, becoming the latest Wall Street securities firm to
post sharply lower earnings because of deteriorating conditions in US and
international financial markets.
The firm reported earnings per share on a primary basis of Dollars 1.31,
less than half the Dollars 1.77 a share in the same period a year earlier.
Revenues were Dollars 2.2bn, down from Dollars 2.49bn in the same quarter of
1993, with the biggest declines in revenues from trading (down 42 per cent
to Dollars 300m) and investment banking (down 34 per cent to Dollars 211m).
The weak second quarter, coming on the heels of a difficult first period,
meant that Morgan Stanley's profits for the first half of 1994 totalled
Dollars 238m, well down on the Dollars 423m earned in the first half a year
ago.
Several factors were behind the drop in revenues and profits, said Mr John
Mack, president. 'Rising interest rates in the US and Europe resulted in an
overall decline in client activity which negatively impact revenues from
debt and equity underwriting and fixed income and foreign exchange trading.'
There were some bright spots, however, said Mr Mack. 'Partially offsetting
these declines were strong results from trading in equities and commodities
and continued growth in the asset management and global custody businesses.'
The firm also yesterday announced plans to buy back Dollars 200m worth of
its own shares.

FT  24 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Hungary considers eurolira issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Bank of Hungary, which borrows on behalf of the Hungarian
government, is considering launching a eurolira bond offering.
Mr Frigyes Harshegyi, the bank's deputy president, said in London yesterday
that he had been given the 'green light' by the Bank of Italy's market
committee at the end of June
A bond offering in eurolira would round off Hungary's recent drive to
diversify its international funding sources. This year it has launched bond
offerings denominated in yen, D-Marks, Swiss francs, dollars, sterling,
Austrian schillings, French francs, pesetas, Luxembourg francs and guilders.
Mr Harshegyi said that the bank had raised around Dollars 1.9bn so far this
year in the international bond market, which almost completes its Dollars
2bn foreign borrowing programme. 'We are now viewing next year's
requirements,' he said.
The size of Hungary's borrowing programme next year is likely to be the same
as this year's.
However, Mr Harshegyi said that foreign borrowing could be less than Dollars
2bn in 1995 if more loans from the World Bank and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development are forthcoming. 'The more the economy
borrows on the private side the less we will have to do on the public side,'
he said.
He was also optimistic that Hungary's stable political situation and the
economic transformation would allow it to achieve an investment grade rating
in the near future. Its current ratings are Ba1 from Moody's and BB+ from
Standard &amp; Poor's, one notch below investment grade.
Meanwhile, new-issue activity in the eurobond market was thin, with only one
significant offering in the lira sector.
Rabobank Nederland issued L225bn of 11.5 per cent three-year bonds. The
initial L150bn offering was increased to L225bn soon after launch due to
strong investor demand, said lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation.
The combination of the bonds' high coupon and short maturity attracted
demand not only from the usual retail investors, but also from large
institutional accounts, SBC said.

<TEXT>
Canon, the Japanese office equipment and camera maker, lifted pre-tax
profits by 83.6 per cent to Y28.54bn (Dollars 291m) in the first half to
June as restructuring efforts paid off.
Parent company sales were up just 3.8 per cent to Y512.68bn. The company
said it had achieved savings worth Y65bn, more than offsetting a Y38bn
negative impact from appreciation in the yen over the period. Canon has been
hedging foreign currency and shifting production overseas.
Sales of copiers fell by 3 per cent, cameras by 12 per cent and
telecommunications equipment 4 per cent. However, a 12 per cent rise in
revenues from computer peripherals, its largest product line, was enough to
redress the balance. Other optical equipment, the smallest division, showed
the sharpest growth at 42 per cent.
Domestic sales grew 6 per cent overall, while exports were up only 3 per
cent, reflecting the increase in overseas production. By the end of the
current year an estimated 30 per cent of all sales is intended to come from
products made outside Japan, up from 25 per cent a year earlier.
Moody's, the US credit rating agency, this week put Canon's long-term debt
under review for possible upgrade because of improved competitiveness.
First-half net earnings per share rose from Y14.93 to Y20.44, from which a
maintained interim dividend of Y6.25 is being paid.
TDK, the magnetic tape and computer peripherals producer, suffered a 26.5
per cent fall in worldwide net profits to Y2.49bn for its first quarter to
June. Sales dipped 2.3 per cent to Y117.81bn and pre-tax profits were down
23 per cent to Y4.95bn. The company blamed price-cutting in some of its
consumer markets and disappointing demand for magnetic heads used in hard
disk drives.

<TEXT>
Dah Sing Financial Holdings, the Hong Kong-listed banking and financial
services company, has agreed in principle to set up an investment management
group in the colony with M&amp;G Group, the London-listed fund manager.
The proposed joint venture will carve a niche in both institutional fund
management and unit trust business in Hong Kong, broadening out to China and
other countries in the region.
Dah Sing will have a controlling 51 per cent interest, with M&amp;G supplying
the balance and seconding senior staff to the venture. It is envisaged that
the British company, which is the UK's largest unit trust group, will also
supply the venture's chief executive.
Dah Sing last year expanded its presence in the colony with the purchase of
the Wing On Bank, previously controlled by Hang Seng Bank, the Hong Kong
banking arm of HSBC Holdings. This acquisition increased its branch network
to 54 branches. The group has also entered a joint venture agreement to
operate supermarkets in Shanghai.

FT  24 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Indian groups turn to loans
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three of India's best-known companies have turned to the international
syndicated loans market in recent weeks, attracted by the continued erosion
of margins and the willingness among international banks to invest in this
fashionable emerging market.
Indian companies have been allowed to tap the international loans market
since last October under a so-called 'net exporter loan' scheme, whereby the
loans are repaid from their net export earnings.
A Dollars 30m term loan facility with a maturity of 30 months for Indian
Rayon and Industries, part of the AV Birla multinational group, has been
closed following a significant oversubscription.
An official at ANZ, which arranged the loan with ABN-Amro, said Indian
companies can now expect to pay an annual rate of around 1 1/4 per cent over
Libor, down from 1 5/8 per cent at the start of this year. He added that a
Dollars 12.5m two-year amortising loan which ANZ arranged for Tube
Investments of India was also oversubscribed.
Meanwhile, Tata Iron and Steel, which exports around 20 per cent of its
total sales, has asked ANZ to arrange a Dollars 25m two-year loan to finance
the purchase of equipment, raw materials or services for use in specified
projects to assist in export enhancement. This loan is in the process of
being syndicated.

Bangkok Bank rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bangkok Bank, south-east Asia's biggest bank in asset terms, has reported a
19 per cent rise in net profits for the first half of the year to Bt8.386bn
(Dollars 336m), after a 48 per cent rise in second-quarter net profits to
Bt4.837bn.
The result was generally well received, but analysts warned that the bank's
profits in the increasingly competitive banking sector may slow slightly in
the second half. They also cautioned that a narrowing differential between
lending and borrowing rates - now down to about 1 percentage point - will
hit income in the second half.
Profits were boosted by accrued interest gains of nearly Bt800m from the
Bangkok Expressway, the elevated motorway project for Bangkok financed by
Thai and foreign banks. There were also foreign exchange gains of about
Bt1.656bn, some Bt1.2bn coming in the second quarter.
Jardine Fleming is maintaining its forecast net profits of Bt16.6bn for the
year.

Random House will make a 'significant investment' in Knowledge Adventure.
Terms were not disclosed, but the investment is expected to enable Knowledge
Adventure to expand development of new titles. Random House will distribute
Knowledge Adventure's titles through book stores.
The agreement is the latest example of broadening collaboration among
publishers and software developers to create multimedia versions of books
and other published works. Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times,
acquired Software Toolworks, a US software company, earlier this year.
Random House and Knowledge Adventure said they planned to jointly create,
produce and market multimedia titles, beginning with the Random House Kid's
Encyclopaedia which will be introduced in November.
The encyclopaedia will feature interactive simulations and activities,
narrated text and movie clips.

FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: QVC declines to Dollars 11.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
QVC, the US cable television home-shopping group which earlier this month
accepted a Dollars 1.4bn takeover offer from its two largest shareholders,
yesterday reported second-quarter profits of Dollars 11.7m, down from
Dollars 13.3m for the same period last year.
For the first six months of the year, QVC earned Dollars 23.8m, compared
with Dollars 34.9m in the same period of 1993.
QVC is due to be bought out by the two shareholders - cable groups Comcast
Communications and Liberty Media - later this year. The takeover foiled a
previous attempt by QVC to merge with CBS, the broadcast television network.
The decline in profits during the quarter and half-year was blamed on the
cost of setting up electronic retailing joint ventures in the UK and Mexico.
Although the ventures reach 17m households in the two countries, QVC does
not yet make a profit from its overseas operations, which incurred losses of
Dollars 9.6m in the quarter.
Net revenues were up 16 per cent during the quarter at Dollars 303.3m, and
operating income by 31.5 per cent at Dollars 31.4m. There was little
reaction to the earnings from investors, and QVC's shares closed down
Dollars  1/16 at Dollars 44 13/16 in trading on the Nasdaq stock market.
CBS, which failed to win control of QVC earlier this year, yesterday said
its offer to buy 3.5m of its own shares at Dollars 325 a share had expired
with the tender oversubscribed. CBS plans to declare a five-for-one stock
split, the date of which will be announced on September 14. The company's
share price closed up Dollars 2 at Dollars 314 in trade on the New York
Stock Exchange yesterday.

FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: Video conference picture begins
to clear - An industry standards war seems to have been averted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Monday's agreement between AT&amp;T and Intel, for them to develop and market
desktop video conferencing (DVC), is likely to lead to the widespread
adoption of personal electronic meeting systems.
The deal, between the world's largest chip maker and the leading US
telecommunications company, seems to have defused a situation which could
have led to a standards war within the videoconferencing industry which
would have damaged suppliers and customers.
Mr James Cosgrove, AT&amp;T's general manager for business multimedia services,
said customers and equipment manufacturers would be able to invest in
personal videoconferencing without fear of being trapped in a technological
blind alley.
However, some industry experts reacted with less than wholehearted approval,
arguing that the AT&amp;T/Intel accord fudges the issue rather than promoting
the idea of a single, industry-wide standard.
Intel sees desktop video conferencing as an important new capability that
will drive demand for high performance PCs built around its microprocessor
chips.
Mr Andrew Grove, Intel chairman, said: 'All of this requires microprocessor
power. This is very important for us because every time you do one of these
conferences, you can almost hear your microprocessor take a deep breath . .
. This is a pretty powerful application. It is a good application for high
performance microprocessors. When we optimise our system for Pentium
(Intel's top of the range processor) you will see higher quality video.'
Videoconferences - electronic meetings where images of the participants and
documents are transmitted over telecommunications lines in addition to
conversation - are well established in many international companies. ICL,
the UK-based computer manufacturer, for example, holds weekly management
meetings with Fujitsu, its Tokyo-based parent, using a large
videoconferencing system.
The costs of corporate videoconferencing systems, while declining, remain
high. A typical system from a supplier such as the UK company GPT, costs
about Pounds 34,500 (Dollars 53,475). A videoconferencing studio could cost
a further Pounds 80,000.
A breakthrough has been the development of semiconductor chips that can be
incorporated into electronic circuitry which converts a conventional desk
top personal computer into a videoconferencing station, at an additional
cost of about Pounds 1,000.
The importance of DVC is two-fold. First, given the growing cost of
executive travel, it is seen by many as the future of business
communications. 'The business call of the future will be a conference call
from your PC,' said Mr Frank Gill, general manger of Intel's products group.
Second, it is seen as the application which will drive the growth of
multimedia in business. According to Ovum, a London-based technology
consultancy: 'From 1996 onwards, sales of video PCs will take off rapidly
eclipsing those of dedicated videoconferencing systems.' Ovum estimates that
sales of video PCs could approach Dollars 5bn by 2000.
In January this year, Intel introduced a set of PC add-on products and
software it calls Proshare, which converts a PC into a video telephone. The
heart of the system is a compression technology called Indeo, a joint effort
between Intel and Microsoft, the world's largest software company.
The system is low cost, but the result is not up to dedicated
videoconferencing standards. The picture is small and jerky in movement but
adequate for many purposes. Intel says that video quality will improve as
microprocessor power increases.
However, Proshare is not compatible with video-conferencing standards
developed for dedicated systems, most of which conform to a standard known
as H320. AT&amp;T is a leading member of the industry group that developed the
H320 standard.
The essence of this week's announcement is that Intel and AT&amp;T will work to
build a technology bridge between Proshare and its network services.
Mr Cosgrove said the aim was to provide a system open to any customer no
matter what kind of device was used to make the call. He gave the example of
a customer making a conference call from his or her car - the connection
might be to other participants using video PCs. At the office, the customer
could change from portable phone to video PC. The network would be
responsible for translating between one technology and another.
Mr Cosgrove said AT&amp;T would be testing the new system in December and
selling products based on it next year.
The question remains how businesses want to use DVC. Studies show that
executives only want to see each others' faces at the beginning and end of a
conversation. For the rest of the time, they are more concerned to be able
to share information and work together on documents. Intel Proshare software
can provide this capability without the need for add-on equipment.

FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: Deere announces record profit of
Dollars 157m for term

Deere &amp; Co, the US agri-cultural and industrial equipment manufacturer,
yesterday reported record profits in the third quarter and said its
worldwide production tonnage was up 17 per cent over last year.
The company earned Dollars 157.7m, or Dollars 1.82 a share, in the quarter,
up from Dollars 90.8m, or Dollars 1.19, in last year's third quarter.
Excluding special accounting charges, Deere earned Dollars 100.1m in the
third quarter of 1993. Sales in the quarter rose 14 per cent, to Dollars
2.327bn, from Dollars 2.049 last year.
Wall Street analysts had expected Deere to report another record quarter,
but the magnitude of the earnings increase caught many by surprise. The
company's share price closed up Dollars 3 1/4 at Dollars 69 1/2 in New York
yesterday.
Mr Hans Becherer, chairman, said: 'The company's results for the quarter
reflect continued improvement compared with a year ago, primarily due to
higher North American production and sales volumes, as well as improved
operating efficiencies and better than previously anticipated results from
our overseas operations.'
For the first nine months Deere recorded income of Dollars 434m, or Dollars
5.04, on sales of Dollars 6.5bn, up from Dollars 154.9m, or Dollars 2.01,
before special charges, on sales of Dollars 5.57bn.
Overseas sales increased 23 per cent in the third quarter, to Dollars 535m.
Although the company still forecasts a long-term downward trend for
agricultural equipment sales in Europe, Mr Becherer said: 'The current
outlook for 1994 anticipates industry sales being slightly higher than 1993
levels.'
The company revised its 1994 full-year worldwide production schedule to be
up 17 per cent over last year, from a previous forecast of 16 per cent.
The increase reflects the third-quarter production totals, which the company
said would have been higher had it not been re-tooling production lines for
a new large row-crop tractor line to be introduced in the fourth quarter.
The company cautioned that fourth-quarter output of some vehicles could be
hampered by the availability of tyres, which have been in short supply.

A CDollars 46m special charge to cover a US subsidiary's investment losses
reduced the Bank of Montreal's third-quarter net profit by about 5 per cent.
Net income for the three months ended July 31 was CDollars 172m (USDollars
125), or 61 cents a share, down from CDollars 180m, or 66 cents, a year
earlier and 69 cents in the second quarter.
Return on equity was 12 per cent against 14.1 per cent.
The special charge stemmed from investment activities at Harris Bank in
Chicago. Harris invested institutional accounts in mortgage-backed
securities, which dropped in value when interest rates rose. Harris absorbed
customer losses and itself took a special charge in its June quarter.
Bank of Montreal's nine months' profit was CDollars 557m, or CDollars 2.02 a
share, up 9.6 per cent from CDollars 508m, or CDollars 1.85. Return on
equity was 13.6 per cent, which was little changed.
The bank's commercial property portfolio improved, leading to significant
reductions in non-performing loans which stood at CDollars 1.9bn at July 31,
compared with CDollars 2.3bn a year earlier. The provision for credit losses
for fiscal 1994 is CDollars 510m, against CDollars 625m.
Strong revenue growth was fuelled by higher volumes in most sectors while
average assets reached CDollars 124bn at July 31, up 14.8 per cent year to
year.
Non-interest expense, excluding the special charge, was up 6.6 per cent.
Noranda, Canada's biggest resource group, is to build a CDollars 25m pilot
plant to test its process to extract magnesium from the hundreds of millions
of tonnes of tailings in Quebec's asbestos mining area.

<TEXT>
Instrumentarium, the Finnish health care group, has agreed to buy the
intensive care and anaesthesia business of Gambro, the Swedish medical
equipment specialist.
The deal, on undisclosed terms, will give Instrumentarium a business with
360 employees in 15 countries and annual sales of SKr450m (Dollars 58.4m).
Its main units are in Germany, the UK, Italy and Sweden.
The purchase will strengthen the Finnish group's Datex division, a world
leader in patient monitoring equipment.
Intensive care and anaesthesia was the only Gambro division to report
reduced sales when the Swedish group announced its first-half figures last
week. Health-sector investment restraints were blamed.
Seco Tools, the Swedish industrial tool maker, yesterday reported a 76 per
cent jump in pre-tax profit for the first six months of 1994, AP-DJ reports.
The company predicted a better full-year result for 1994 compared with 1993.
Seco's pre-tax profits advanced to SKr216m from SKr123m on sales which rose
to SKr1.07bn, compared with SKr955m last time.

FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: Trygg-Hansa chief executive
steps down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bjorn Sprangare yesterday resigned as chief executive of Trygg-Hansa,
citing strong criticism of his performance and uncertainty over the group's
strategy.
Mr Sprangare, who has led the company for eight years, said it was clear he
did not enjoy the 'full public confidence' necessary for effective
leadership.
He is expected to leave the company during the autumn, after a successor has
been chosen from three short-listed candidates.
In deciding to step down, Mr Sprangare said he took full responsibility for
a series of deals which ended in failure and produced heavy losses.
These include the group's ill-fated alliance with SPP, the financial
services group; its investment in the US insurance group, Home; and its
involvement with the collapsed financial concerns, Gota AB and Svenska
Kredit. Gota alone brought more than SKr5bn (Dollars 662m) in losses in
1992.
Mr Sprangare said the alliance with SPP had been 'a complete failure', and
his biggest mistake, leading directly to the costly investment in Gota AB.
He said changes following the crisis in the Swedish financial sector were
partly to blame for the breakdown of the alliance.
Trygg's failure to win a banking licence, when competitors had been granted
them, was perhaps the clearest sign it had lost the confidence of the
authorities.
Trygg yesterday announced a sharply-reduced operating profit of SKr190m for
the first six months, partly because of losses linked to its 35.3 per cent
stake in Home Holdings. A year ago, the group's operating profit was
SKr884m.
After including the full impact of the group's investment performance, it
swung to a SKr380m loss from a SKr1.38bn profit. Unrealised losses caused by
falling bond markets were the main reason for the decline.
Group premiums fell 9 per cent to SKr3.6bn from SKr3.95bn, following the
group's decision to run off its reinsurance activities. Underwriting losses
deepened to SKr441m from SKr322m.

FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: Avesta Sheffield swings back to
black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Avesta Sheffield, the Swedish-British stainless steel maker, yesterday
announced a swing to profits of SKr431m (Dollars 57.1m) after financial
items in the first six months, from a loss of SKr21m in the same period last
year. It said it expected a further increase in earnings in the second half.
The result put the group firmly on a profits path for the first time since
it was formed in late 1992 through a merger between Avesta and the stainless
steel interests of British Steel. British Steel owns 40 per cent of the
group.
Avesta Sheffield attributed the turnround to rising demand in Europe,
particularly for cold rolled steel plate, its main product, and the effects
of internal savings and favourable currency movements.
Sales rose 16 per cent to SKr8.3bn during the first half, compared with
SKr7.14bn last year, and operating profits after depreciation jumped to
SKr546m from SKr93m.
'The group result is influenced strongly by currency and price changes for
stainless steel. With a continuation of current conditions, the result for
the second half is expected to exceed the result for the first six months,'
said Mr Per Molin, chief executive.
Avesta said higher consumption and stock-building of cold rolled plate had
shifted the balance between supply and demand in Europe. This had pushed up
prices by 30 per cent compared with the end of last year, although only to
the levels of mid-1993.
Overall, the market had improved since the end of year, with European
producers diverting sales to Europe from other markets to satisfy the demand
surge.
The company, which earlier this year raised more than SKr590m through a
rights issue, plans to invest more than SKr1bn over the next three years.
The board yesterday gave the go-ahead for a SKr250m investment, part of a
SKr600m allocation approved in March.

Stora
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Higher volumes, cost-cutting and capital gains brought a dramatically
improved performance at Stora in the first half, enabling Europe's biggest
pulp and paper group to lift profits to SKr1.51bn (Dollars 200m) from
SKr30m.
Helped by a long-awaited revival in the pulp and paper sector, group volumes
climbed 5 per cent, and capacity utilisation reached 92 per cent. However,
the company has still to feel the impact of the higher prices which are
gradually feeding through into most product areas.
Mr Lars Ake Helgesson, chief executive, said local currency prices had
generally been lower in the first half than a year ago. Although the group
has achieved higher prices for sawn timber and fine paper, a firm upturn in
prices for newsprint and magazine paper grades is still awaited.
The SKr865m underlying improvement in the group's performance was enhanced
by SKr617m in one-off gains.
On the plus side, the divestment of the Tarkett flooring material unit,
Akerlund &amp; Rausing, and forest assets in Chile brought in SKr914m in capital
gains. However, these were offset by a SKr200m provision against a possible
write-down of a Canadian pulp mill and a SKr105m provision for a fine
imposed by the European Union for breaching competition rules. Stora says it
may appeal against the EU decision.
Sales were SKr23.1bn, up 6.5 per cent after adjusting for divestments. The
pre-tax figure benefited both from a stronger operating performance  - where
income rose to SKr2.14bn from SKr840m - and from reduced financial expenses
of SKr625m, against SKr810m. The group has benefited from lower interest
rates and a SKr4.7bn reduction in net debt.
Nearly all the group's divisions improved their operating performance, with
power, pulp, sawn timber and technical office paper units all returning to
the black. However, the group's financial services unit was unable to repeat
last year's exceptionally strong performance, and profits slipped from
SKr385m to SKr173m.

pace

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp fall in the loan losses which threatened to cripple Sweden's banking
system 18 months ago has helped two leading commercial banks, Skandinaviska
Enskilda Banken and Svenska Handelsbanken, yesterday report a strong
improvement in first-half earnings.
Handelsbanken, the only bank to survive the crisis without appealing for
state aid, announced a threefold rise in operating profits, to SKr2.3bn
(Dollars 304.6m) from a surplus of SKr768m last time, as loan losses tumbled
60 per cent from SKr3.63bn to SKr1.46bn.
At SE-Banken, which a year ago dropped an application for state assistance
as its performance recovered, the swing was even larger. It posted a profit
of SKr2.22bn after a loss in the first half last year of SKr298m. Its loan
losses, at SKr2.95bn, remain much greater than those of its traditional
rival, but were 43 per cent lower than the SKr5.15bn in the same period last
year.
The figures were further evidence that economic recovery and lower interest
rates, compared with 1992 and early 1993 when the crisis hit, have enabled
the banks to overcome much of the damage done to their loan books by
over-exposure to overheated property markets.
Handelsbanken said its total of problem loans after provisions had fallen to
SKr7.95bn from SKr13.25bn a year ago, and now accounted for 2.9 per cent of
lending volume, compared with 4.4 per cent. S-E-Banken's problem loans after
provisions totalled SKr10.69bn, down from SKr22.53bn a year ago. They
accounted for 4 per cent of all loans, compared with 6.9 per cent.
Although the worst of the loan-loss flood has been stemmed, Handelsbanken
stressed that the level of credit losses - in its case around 1 per cent of
annual lending - was still above 'normal' levels of around 0.5 per cent. The
level at SE-Banken was 1.97 per cent.
Meanwhile, both banks reported a weaker underlying performance for the
period, as net interest income was hit by low lending volumes, narrow
margins and lower returns from bond trading. Net interest income at
Handelsbanken was down 15 per cent at SKr4.29bn, compared with SKr5.03bn. In
spite of a 13 per cent rise in commission income to SKr1.5bn, profit before
loan losses fell 14 per cent from SKr4.39bn to SKr3.76bn.
Profits before credit losses were up 7 per cent at SE-Banken, to SKr5.18bn
from SKr4.85bn. However, the result was distorted by gains from disposals,
which raised non-interest and non-commission income to SKr1.87bn from
SKr726m. Net interest income fell 7 per cent to SKr4.26bn from SKr4.58bn,
and commission income slipped to SKr3bn from SKr3.28bn.
Handelsbanken said rapid growth in its Swedish krone surplus liquidity,
stemming from the low loan volumes, had led to a big rise in its holdings of
government securities and bonds. These had grown to SKr105bn from SKr59.7bn
at the same stage last year.
It said SKr36bn of the holdings were held in a trading portfolio, the value
of which had a direct impact on the profit and loss account.

joint venture

Delta Air Lines, the third-biggest US airline, is contracting out Dollars
2.8bn worth of information technology work over the next 10 years to a joint
venture it has formed with AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions, part of US
telecommunications group AT&amp;T.
The so-far unnamed venture will handle most of Delta's internal computing
requirements, apart from its reservation systems. These will be transferred
to Worldspan, a computer reservation system jointly owned by three US
airlines.
Delta and AT&amp;T said the company would also market its computing and
communications services to other companies in the travel and transport
industries.
Delta said it was transferring the work as a cost-cutting measure. lt
estimated the joint venture would save it Dollars 400m over the next 10
years by developing innovations that would improve the performance of its
business units and reduce annual operating costs.
Mr Ron Allen, Delta chairman, said the joint venture was a 'strategic
initiative designed to improve our competitiveness, and it will play a key
role in Delta's drive to return to sustained profitability'.
Earlier this year, Delta announced a drastic restructuring plan to cut
Dollars 2bn a year from operating costs, in an attempt to overcome
competition from low-cost US carriers such as Southwest Airlines. Since
then, it has unveiled measures which take it some way towards a targeted cut
of between 12,000 and 15,000 jobs from a workforce of 73,000 in the next
three years.
In the latest move, up to 1,200 Delta employees will transfer to the joint
venture with AT&amp;T. The new company, to be based in Atlanta, Georgia, will be
owned equally by Delta and AT&amp;T. A chief executive is expected to be named
later this year.
AT&amp;T said the venture represented a 'major win' in the growing market for
outsourcing and professional services.

<TEXT>
OMV, the Austrian integrated petroleum and chemicals group, has reported
consolidated pre-tax profit of Sch240m (Dollars 22m) for the first half,
compared with a loss of Sch552m in the corresponding period last year.
The partially privatised group said turnover was flat at Sch40.1bn as
conditions in many of its markets remained weak. However, it was still
aiming to make a profit in the full year through continued cost cutting.
As expected, the pre-tax profit in the second quarter, at Sch50m, was
considerably smaller than that in the first quarter. This was mainly due to
squeezed refinery margins.
Also, the exploration and production division fell into a Sch380m loss in
the first half compared with a profit of Sch260m, due to lower crude oil
prices, lower domestic gas sales and accounting changes.
The Schwechat refinery also went into the red in the second quarter because
of a slump in gasoline margins, but higher profits at the Burghausen
refinery prevented any erosion from the Sch130m profit made by the refining
division in the first quarter. It suffered a Sch380m loss in the first half
last year.
The gas division's profit rose 26 per cent to Sch860m in spite of lower
prices and reduced transport business.

<TEXT>
Unidanmark Group, Denmark's second biggest bank, yesterday reported a fall
in interim net profits to DKr207m (Dollars 34m) from DKr483m as the value of
its securities portfolio slid.
The value of securities holdings fell by DKr252m during the first half of
the year. Last year in the same period the comparable figure rose by
DKr533m. Under Danish banking law the difference in the value of the
securities portfolio during the accounting period is entered directly into
the profit and loss account.
Reflecting improved economic conditions, the group said that its bad loss
provisions fell to DKr950m in the first half compared with DKr2.34bn in the
same period last year.
The bank reported a 10.7 per cent growth in net interest and fee income to
DKr4.8bn from DKr4.3bn, while expenses were reduced by DKr68m to DKr2.97bn.
The capital adequacy ratio at the end of the second half was 13.4 per cent
compared with 11.8 per cent at the end of last year.

FT  24 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Graseby blames end of cold war for
unchanged Pounds 4.96m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Graseby, the electronics group, yesterday blamed flat first half profits on
falling demand for its defence equipment following the break up of the
Soviet Union and end of the cold war.
A weak performance by the technology division, which makes detection systems
for explosives and chemical weapons, held pre-tax profits at Pounds 4.96m
(Pounds 4.87m) as group sales slid from Pounds 55.1m to Pounds 47.4m.
Worsening defence sales relegated the division from being the
best-performing business to the worst with operating profits down from
Pounds 2.66m to Pounds 1.05m.
However, that was offset by improved figures from the medical, environmental
and product monitoring businesses.
'We have great growth prospects in these three divisions and they will be
the key to our future,' said Mr Paul Lester, chief executive.
Medical showed the sharpest improvement with operating profits increasing 83
per cent to Pounds 1.85m (Pounds 1.01m), helped by buoyant hospital demand
for its drug delivery systems.
The division claimed that its latest product, a pocket size infusion pump,
could generate sales of Pounds 20m over the next five years.
The product monitoring division saw operating profits increase 69 per cent
to Pounds 1.97m (Pounds 1.16m) following UK cost-cutting and a five-month
contribution from Graseby Best.
Sales of emission monitoring equipment, meanwhile, lifted profits in the
environmental division from Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 1.43m.
The group benefited from sharply reduced net interest payments of Pounds
396,000 (Pounds 799,000) as borrowing fell from Pounds 26.7m at the 1993
year end to Pounds 13.9m, for gearing of 53 per cent.
Earnings per share were flat at 5.8p (5.7p) and, as previously announced,
the interim dividend is reduced to 2.7p (3.3p). The total dividend is
expected to be unchanged at 6.6p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First National Building Society, the second largest in the Irish Republic,
announced a 16 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to IPounds 7.6m (Pounds
7.5m) for the six months to June 30.
The society blamed the fall on a reduction in investment income because of
bearish sentiment in the bond market.
It refused to comment on its bid for Mortgage Trust, SE Banken's UK mortgage
operation, which is at the due diligence stage and is expected to be
completed within the next four weeks. First National is thought to have
offered Pounds 150m for the specialised lender which has mortgage assets of
Pounds 760m and about 10,000 borrowers. However, First National could spend
more than this, having raised Pounds 225m through a syndicated loan and
revolving credit facility last June.
The society reported an increase in home mortgage lending from IPounds 90m
to IPounds 107m and a reduction in arrears as a percentage of loans from
0.67 per cent at the end of last year to 0.61 per cent at June 30. Overall
lending in the first six months was IPounds 121m.
Operating profits, excluding gilts trading, were up 25 per cent to IPounds
7.28m but after-tax income rose by just 1 per cent to IPounds 5.1m.

Caparo Group, the privately-owned UK steel and engineering concern, is said
to have offered Dollars 59m (Pounds 38m) for the assets of Sharon Speciality
Steel, the US steelmaker.
The acquisition offer, Caparo's largest to date, was reported to have been
disclosed in a reorganisation plan filed to a US bankruptcy court, which is
administering Sharon under Chapter 11.
It follows the announcement earlier this month that Mr Swraj Paul, the
Anglo-Indian businessman who founded and chairs Caparo, had signed a letter
of intent to buy the US group.
If the deal goes through, it would transform Caparo into a Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m) company.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Increased house and land sales helped Ben Bailey Construction, the South
Yorkshire-based housebuilder, lift turnover from Pounds 7.1m to Pounds 9.25m
in the six months to June 30.
However, pre-tax profit dropped 9 per cent from Pounds 77,000 to Pounds
70,000, which Mr Richard Bailey, chairman, said reflected initial site
set-up costs and increased staffing.
The number of new homes sold rose by 14 per cent to 136, with reservations
up 20 per cent, but Mr Bailey warned there had been 'some falling away of
purchaser confidence over the last two months'.
Earnings per share fell from 0.51p to 0.45p, but the interim dividend is
maintained at 0.3p.

Net asset value at Murray International Trust fell from 381.9p to 324.2p
over the six months to June 30. However, it was ahead of the 310.6p reported
12 months earlier.
Net revenue for this investment trust in the half year to the end of June
was lower at Pounds 8.06m (Pounds 8.35m).
The company has adopted FRS 4 covering the treatment of finance costs and
has decided to allocate 60 per cent of the costs to capital and the balance
to income. The comparatives have been adjusted.
Earnings per share came out at 6.8p (7.05p) or 6.71p (6.96p) fully
converted. As already forecast the company is paying three interim dividends
of 2.7p, but is now forecasting a 1994 final of 3.9p. It also expects to pay
an interim of 8.7p in three instalments for 1995.

Equifax is offering 600p a share, increased from 500p after Trans Union's

Friendly Hotels yesterday announced a 42 per cent increase in interim
profits as trading improved after a slow start to the period.
On turnover ahead 19 per cent to Pounds 16.1m, the pre-tax line for the six
months to June 12 rose to Pounds 963,000 (Pounds 679,000), helped by
associates' contribution of Pounds 525,000 (Pounds 396,000).
Mr Henry Edwards, chairman, attributed the better showing to the 27-strong
hotel chain. Improved trading was being maintained in the usually stronger
second half, he said, and the group was still seeking 'suitable'
acquisitions.
The group's 18 serviced offices were encountering competitive trading
conditions but maintained occupancy rates.
The interim dividend is held at 2.2p on capital increased by last
September's Pounds 10m rights issue. Fully diluted earnings were 3.5p (3.3p)
per share.

FT  24 AUG 94 / UK Company News: SE looks at Rossmont offer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange is making inquiries into the publication of a tender
offer for shares in Rossmont, the quoted toilet maker, through the pages of
two UK national newspapers.
Berjaya Group (Cayman), owned by an aggressive Malaysian conglomerate of the
same name, announced in the Financial Times and the Daily Telegraph that it
was offering 13 1/2 p per share for up to 29.9 per cent of the company.
Rossmont, floated last year, has recommended the offer. It has also agreed
to issue shares to Berjaya at 13 1/2 p to make up any shortfall on the 29.9
per cent.
Berjaya does not have to tell the Stock Exchange of its tender offer.
Rossmont, however, is required to announce the subscription proposals. In
the event, an announcement was not made until 10am. The Stock Exchange is
discussing the situation with brokers Keith Bayley Rogers.
Mr Howard Drummon, of Keith Bayley said Rossmont believed the Berjaya offer
was in shareholders' interests, even at a discount to last night's close of
14 1/2 p. 'If the company does not come in, there may be a difficulty in
maintaining this price,' Mr Drummon said.

FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: Kerry rises 10% to Pounds 15m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Kerry, the Irish food group, reported a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
to IPounds 15m (Pounds 14.8m) for the first six months of 1994, following
strong performances by the food ingredients and convenience food divisions.
Overall sales increased 6.5 per cent to IPounds 420m, mainly due to
increases in the domestic Irish market and in North America, where Kerry has
expanded its food ingredients operations. There was a small decline in sales
in European and other markets reflecting the scaling down of the red meat
business, signalled earlier this year.
Higher margins in the food ingredients and processed foods divisions pushed
up operating profits to IPounds 23m, representing margins of 5.52 per cent
(5.43 per cent). Sales from food ingredients were up to IPounds 173m
(IPounds 153m) due to organic growth and increased contributions from North
America.
Kerry is starting to feel the benefits of 1993's acquisition of two food
ingredient companies in Canada for Dollars 20m, said Mr Frank Hayes,
director of corporate affairs.
Earlier this year Kerry acquired another food ingredients business in Mexico
for Dollars 20m and continued expansion of the foods ingredients division
remains the strategic goal, said Kerry's chairman, Mr Michael Hanrahan,
yesterday.
Kerry Foods, the convenience foods side, also reported increased sales, up
from IPounds 127m to IPounds 139m.
The scaling back of Meadow Meats, the red meat operation, resulted in a fall
in sales in that division to IPounds 80m (IPounds 89m).
Kerry Agribusiness, reported a small increase in sales from IPounds 26m to
IPounds 28m.
Earnings per share emerged at 7.9p (7p). An increased interim dividend of 1p
(0.91p) is declared.
COMMENT
A solid set of results slightly ahead of most forecasts leaves Kerry well
positioned to fulfil ambitious full year earnings forecasts of between 20p
and 21p per share and full year pre-tax forecasts of about IPounds 39m. The
second half will be aided by the beef slaughter in the autumn, further
benefits from the Mexican and US acquisitions and a maiden input from
Mattesons-Wall's, bought from Unilever in July. Kerry will have it all to do
if it is to live up to these expectations, but the company's aggressive
management have rarely disappointed in the past. The prospective p/e of
between 16.5 and 17 is expensive relative to the rest of the Irish food
sector, but reflects Kerry's transition towards being an international food
ingredients and processed food company. Comparisons of other international
food ingredients companies are perhaps now more relevant as the scaling down
of the red meat division will shift the balance further towards these parts
of Kerry's operations.

FT  24 AUG 94 / UK Company News: NFC struggles to overcome City doubts -
Recent events have not helped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NFC had always prided itself on the strength of its paternalistic staff
culture, but while Mr Peter Sherlock was chief executive there was a growing
sense that the tide was turning. His departure yesterday suggests that the
employees have, for the moment, won.
However, the company will struggle to win back respect from the City, where
investors were already beginning to tire of the lack of results from Mr
Sherlock's strategic review.
It is unclear whether this was the fault of Mr Sherlock, or the result of a
lack of support from his fellow management, many of whom were far from
enthusiastic about his overhaul.
He certainly failed to turn round NFC's profit performance. June's interim
results were disappointing, with no evidence of the economic recovery
feeding through to profits, and no concrete results from the new strategy.
On the day of Mr Sherlock's departure, NFC disappointed again, with profits
from Europe and North America below budget in the third quarter.
'The stock market was looking for reassurance that the strategic plan was
working', said an analyst at a British brokerage. 'The last thing we needed
was this.'
UBS Securities, brokers to NFC, have lowered their 1994 forecast from Pounds
120m to Pounds 110m, as a result of the disappointing figures.
Pre-tax profits before exceptional items rose only 6 per cent in the third
quarter, despite the economic recovery and the Pounds 263m new funds from
December's rights issue.
Mr Sherlock's strategic review involved a refocusing of management attention
and capital on the higher value added businesses in NFC's repertoire, namely
transport and logistics.
The most controversial proposal was a merger of NFC's two largest
businesses, BRS and Exel Logistics - a move which is understood to have been
strongly opposed by some of the 'old guard'.
The logic was that a merger of transport and contract distribution would
link the two ends of of the distribution chain, so removing costs and
enhancing revenues. Other businesses, such as contract rental and parcels,
would remain non-core oper-ations.
The plan was welcomed by analysts, and there are inevitable concerns that
the removal of Mr Sherlock may reduce the pace of change, in spite of the
board's stated commitment to the strategy.
The appointment of Mr Sherlock, an outsider, implied a realisation that the
paternalistic management needed a little shaking up. Mr James Watson,
chairman, will find it hard to demonstrate that commitment if he opts for an
internal replacement, such as Mr Robbie Burns.
However, the problems encountered by Mr Sherlock may not encourage other
leading executives to fill his shoes.
One fund manager said: 'This company needs someone powerful who will take
NFC by the scruff of its neck, tell the City what it is going to do, and
then achieve it.'
Insiders expect something more in keeping with NFC's paternalistic roots.

FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: AIB may enter the bidding for
HMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interest from other mortgage lenders in acquiring Household Mortgage
Corporation appears to be widening with Allied Irish Banks, the Irish
Republic's largest banking group, now expected to be among the bidders.
Through a subsidiary, AIB has a stake of about 7 per cent in HMC, which has
a residential mortgage book of Pounds 1.5bn. Yesterday AIB would only say
that it was watching the sale closely as a shareholder.
Other potential bidders are thought to include a number of building
societies, notably Yorkshire and Birmingham Midshires.
HMC, the UK's largest centralised lender, said last month that it was
seeking a buyer, and appointed Baring Brothers to manage the sale.
Bidders have been asked to submit indicative bids in early September. HMC
will then draw up a shortlist of those who will be able to make a revised
bid after closer inspection of the loan book.
The process is expected to take three or four months.
One difficulty for HMC may be that potential buyers are more interested in
acquiring the mortgage book alone than in buying the company as an ongoing
organisation.
Another factor is that the market in mortgage books is changing,
particularly since Halifax Building Society's announcement that it was
negotiating to buy the Pounds 1.5bn UK mortgage business of Banque Nationale
de Paris.
Some potential bidders suspect that the prices at which mortgage books are
available may be too high.

FT  24 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Restructured Wace jumps 57% - Advance to
Pounds 11m achieved despite decline in US print activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further cost reductions and improved productivity helped Wace, the
restructured pre-press and specialist printing group, report a 57 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits for the half year to June 30.
On turnover which slipped slightly to Pounds 164m (Pounds 165.5m), pre-tax
profits increased from Pounds 7.04m to Pounds 11.1m.
Earnings per share jumped from 4.1p to 10p as the tax charge fell to Pounds
1.66m (Pounds 2.47m). That reflected the utilisation of trading losses
associated with the reorganisation of the property portfolio, resulting in a
projected 15 per cent tax rate for the year.
The interim dividend is increased by 50 per cent to 1.5p.
The shares closed 16p higher yesterday at 270p.
Mr Trevor Grice, chief executive, said the profits increase reflected the
continued drive for productivity improvements together with the group's
clear focus on cash generation. That had helped reduce net borrowing by
Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 51.8m at the end of June compared with peak borrowings
of Pounds 100m less than two years ago.
Trading profits increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 14.1m (Pounds 11.4m) led
by improved results from pre-press operations in the UK, the US and
continental Europe.
The pre-press operations in Europe as a whole produced considerably improved
trading profits of Pounds 4.52m (Pounds 3.63m) on turnover down from Pounds
44.3m to Pounds 42.9m.
In the UK, despite intense pressure in the publications market, the
corporate advertising market had started to show signs of improvement and
the packaging market remained buoyant.
The printing operations in the UK lifted profits to Pounds 5.69m (Pounds
4.49m) on turnover of Pounds 55.3m (Pounds 54.4m).
The strongest performing businesses were the specialist print operations
although both corporate print and screen printing were also ahead of last
year.
The group's US operations lifted trading profits by 20 per cent to Pounds
3.86m (Pounds 3.22m) on broadly similar turnover of Pounds 65.8m (Pounds
66.8m).
US print turnover and profits, however, were slightly lower because of
operational problems with two new presses in Michigan.
COMMENT
Wace's current management team continue to impress and the strategy pursued
over the past 18 months of driving costs down, generating a strong cash flow
and paying down debt appears to be working. Meanwhile, although gearing
remains high, the balance sheet looks much healthier. The press problems in
Michigan and Pounds 350,000 of Scottish commercial print restructuring costs
will hold profits to about Pounds 23m this year, equivalent to 20.9p of
earnings given the abnormally low tax rate. The shares are on a prospective
multiple of 12.9 and could move higher as advertising volume improves.

Standard Life Fund Management, the unit trust company, starts business today
following the decision by Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual life
insurer, to buy out Halifax Building Society, its former partner in the
business.
Halifax Standard Trust Management looked after two trusts, Income Advantage
and Global Advantage, with 68,000 customers and funds of more than Pounds
300m. The new company will also offer a UK equity growth trust, which was
marketed through Standard's other unit trust company.
Developing the new wholly owned company could lead to a more fundamental
re-structuring of Standard's unit trust subsidiaries.

FT  24 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Lower school sales hit Nottingham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nottingham Group, one of the UK's leading suppliers of educational products,
yesterday announced its first decline in profits for 12 years.
The setback came just five months after its flotation.
The shares fell 36p to 119p, having been as low as 110p, as the company
revealed a further decline in sales to primary and secondary schools - its
core business.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 fell 8.5 per cent to Pounds
3.61m (Pounds 3.94m), reflecting a 6 per cent decline in sales to schools.
This was exacerbated by a shift towards lower margin products and the impact
of increased marketing costs.
Nottingham's shares were issued in March at 155p, when the company stated in
its prospectus: 'The directors expect that turnover and profit during the
current financial year will benefit from a combination of the release of
cash reserves by schools, the recently introduced marketing initiatives and
new product lines.'
The peak period for sales to schools is from late May to the end of July,
and Nottingham has found that schools have increased their budget reserves.
With the National Curriculum to be announced in January and implemented by
September, Mr David Mansfield, chief executive, expects sales to improve by
mid-1995, as reserves fall. He said, however, that profits in the second
half were still unlikely to match 1993.
Turnover from continuing operations rose from Pounds 23.4m to Pounds 23.8m,
with sales for the rehabilitation market rising from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds
5.7m. Pre-school sales also increased.
Operating expenses rose from Pounds 7.55m to Pounds 7.8m, reflecting the
cost of new marketing initiatives, which have yet to feed through into
increased sales. Nottingham is looking for acquisitions in related
businesses, as gearing has fallen from 55 to 40 per cent since the
flotation.
An interim dividend of 1.84p is payable from earnings per share of 4.6p
(5.12p).

The Pounds 4.5m rights issue launched by Prestwick Holdings, the Scottish
electronics company, was 25.3 per cent subscribed, the company said
yesterday.
Despite the low take-up for the 4-for-5 offering, Mr Archie Coulson,
executive chairman, said he was pleased with the outcome.
'The issue was fully underwritten and means we now have nine new
institutional shareholders and a better balance between institutions and
private investors,' he said. 'It is now about 50-50 instead of around 30 per
cent institutions and 70 per cent private.'

FT  24 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Societies caution on housing growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Benefits from sharp falls in provisions against bad and doubtful debts were
reflected in increased pre-tax profits for the first half of this year
reported yesterday by two of the UK's larger building societies.
However, both societies expressed caution about future growth in the housing
market, saying that they expected only slow and gradual recovery.
Bradford &amp; Bingley, the seventh largest society, recorded pre-tax profits of
Pounds 79.2m in the six months to the end of June - a 35 per cent rise on
last time's Pounds 58.8m. Provisions fell steeply to Pounds 8.4m (Pounds
28.3m), and assets rose to Pounds 14.1bn (Pounds 13.3bn).
Pre-tax profits at Bristol &amp; West, the 10th largest society, rose to Pounds
26m (Pounds 20.4m), after Pounds 7m restructuring costs had been taken into
account. Provisions fell to Pounds 21.1m (Pounds 33.1m), while assets rose
slightly to Pounds 8.2bn (Pounds 8bn).
Mr John Burke, B&amp;W chief executive, said that the society planned to
securitise some Pounds 150m of its commercial lending, as a way of
demonstrating the high quality of the loan book and releasing resources
which could then be used in other lending.
Securitisation allows lenders to take loans off their balance sheet. They
place the assets in a special-purpose vehicle which then raises money by
selling the debt securities to investors. Interest on the so-called
'mortgage-backed' securities is funded by the loan repayments.
Mr Burke said that the society had cut the proportion of funding it was
raising on the wholesale money markets to 22.8 per cent at the end of June,
compared with 25.1 per cent at the end of 1993.
As a further element in strengthening B&amp;W's operations as it recovers from a
period in which it had high provisions and costs, the society is
restructuring its estate agency business under the Hamptons brand name.
B&amp;W's cost/income ratio was 52 per cent (53 per cent) for the group, while
that for the society alone was 42 per cent (43 per cent).
Mr John Smith, Bradford &amp; Bingley's finance director, said that B&amp;B's
cost/income ratio had risen slightly from 46 per cent to 47 per cent.
This was partly because intensifying competition was putting pressure on
income through narrower margins, he said.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Amstrad's electronics director lured by Sega offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Miller, Amstrad's director of worldwide consumer electronics, has
resigned to become chief executive of Sega Europe, part of the Japanese
electronic games group.
Mr Miller, 39, joined Amstrad in 1979 as product manager while Amstrad was
still a small private company run by its founder and chairman, Mr Alan
Sugar.
During the 1980s Mr Miller, who previously worked for Birds Eye Foods, part
of the Unilever group, became one of Mr Sugar's closest and most loyal
aides.
He is credited with helping steer Amstrad through its rapid expansion in the
1980s, buoyed by 'blockbuster' consumer electronics products such as
cut-price compact audio systems and the Amstrad PC.
Yesterday Mr Miller expressed mixed feelings about leaving Amstrad, saying
it had been a very difficult decision.
Mr Miller, who will depart next month, decribed his 15 years at Amstrad as
'very exciting', and said it had been 'a wonderful experience working with
Alan Sugar'. However he added that Sega, whose European operations are
larger than Amstrad's, had made him 'a very good offer which I could not
turn down'.
Amstrad is not known as a particularly generous employer, even for its most
senior executives. Mr Sugar's remuneration was only Pounds 195,000 in the
year to June 30, 1993, and is thought to have topped Pounds 200,000 in the
latest financial year. In contrast Sega is believed to have offered to pay
its new European chief executive about Pounds 250,000.
Although Mr Miller's departure is amicable, he is the latest in a series of
senior Amstrad executives to depart.
In May Mr Bernard Steiner, Amstrad's sales and marketing director, resigned
'to pursue other interests'. His sudden departure was thought to have been
prompted by the appointment of Mr David Rogers, a senior Philips executive,
to the post of chief executive at Amstrad.
Earlier departures have included Mr Peter Thoms, the former finance
director, who resigned in July 1992, and Mr Robert Watkins, technical
director, who resigned in January 1993. Mr Watkins, who left to join
Binatone, the rival electronics group, has returned to take charge of
Dancall Radio which Amstrad acquired last September.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Scramble for a slice of the nitty-gritty market: A look at
the hotting up of competition between US long-distance telecoms operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The obsession with 'superhighways' and high-tech 'convergence' has obscured
the dominant trend in the US telecommunications industry: the massive
intensification of competition between operators vying to provide core
telecoms services.
This week's Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) purchase of WilTel, a US
long-distance operator, by LDDS, the acquisitive US telecoms group,
underlines that reality. LDDS's ambition is simple: to establish itself as
the fourth force in US long-distance and international telecoms, challenging
AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint.
LDDS is elbowing its way into a crowded market. Long-distance telecoms in
the US has been fiercely competitive for a decade, since AT&amp;T was forced to
spin off its local networks and the remainder of its business was exposed to
newcomers.
AT&amp;T steadily lost market share until stabilising at about 60 per cent of
long-distance traffic. The main beneficiary was MCI, which rose to about 20
per cent on the back of aggressive discounting and innovative marketing.
Sprint took a 10 per cent stake, while hundreds of smaller resale operators
 -WilTel being one of the largest - established themselves by discounting.
LDDS has forged a profitable business in the past 10 years reselling leased
telecoms lines at a discount to small and medium-sized business customers.
Last year the Mississippi-based group merged with Metromedia Communications,
the long-distance telephone and entertainment concern owned by Mr John
Kluge, a billionaire businessman with ambitions to take on the 'big three'
long-distance operators.
Earlier this year, LDDS's first offer for WilTel was rejected by Williams
Companies, the Oklahoma-based owner. LDDS paid Dollars 895m for IDB
Communications, an international satellite phone carrier before returning
for WilTel with a Dollars 2.5bn offer.
With WilTel's 11,000-mile advanced fibre-optic communications network, LDDS
becomes a fully fledged phone carrier. As an owner instead of a lessee of
telecoms lines, it hopes to reduce its costs and offer lower prices and a
broader range of services. It will target larger corporate customers of the
kind traditionally served by the Big Three.
What are its prospects?
LDDS believes it has snatched a head-start on other operators angling to
compete in long-distance services, notably the seven 'Baby Bell' regional
companies which hope to enter the market on the back of regulatory changes
expected to be enacted by Congress this year.
It is debatable, however, how much of a market opportunity exists. AT&amp;T and
its rivals will not yield business without a fight. Price differentials are
already low: according to analysts, a 3 to 8 per cent margin separates the
operators.
Moreover, new services increasingly depend upon sophisticated network
software, and the larger operators are to the fore in its development. AT&amp;T
estimates that within five years half its revenue from business customers
could come from services other than telephone calls.
Nonetheless, LDDS starts with about 4 per cent of a Dollars 65bn market
which is expanding rapidly. All customers are becoming used to switching
operators, and many businesses are employing multiple long-distance
providers.
Much depends on whether Congress passes the current telecommunications bill,
which would further open up the industry. Mr Stuart Conrad, analyst at CJ
Lawrence Deutsche Bank Securities, says charges imposed by local operators
are declining at an annual rate of 3-4 per cent and could fall by as much as
20 per cent within three years, if Congress permits greater local
competition.
If LDDS establishes a profitable niche, it might itself become a takeover
target, particularly for the Baby Bells as they look for a short-cut into
the long-distance business. Alternatively, a data information company might
take a look: last week the company's shares were buoyed by rumours that
Electronic Data Systems, the computer services company owned by General
Motors, was considering merging with LDDS, although Mr Bernard Ebbers,
LDDS's chief executive, denies that talks took place.
LDDS is also developing an international strategy. Mr Ebbers says 'there may
be an opportunity' in tying up with an overseas operator. Cable &amp; Wireless,
the UK telecoms group, is keen to strengthen its position in the US market,
where it has a small long-distance business.
Mr Ebbers says his priority is to weld together the existing business.
However, in today's telecoms industry, there is no such thing as a breathing
space.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Thorn stalls on demerger: Music and rentals group sees 18%
fall in first-quarter profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Colin Southgate, Thorn EMI's chairman, yesterday firmly ruled out an
early demerger of the music and rentals group and said the proposal was now
'on the back-burner'.
Sir Colin, speaking as Thorn unveiled an 18 per cent fall in first-quarter
pre-tax profits reflecting exceptional charges, said: 'I don't think we will
look at demerger again for three years.' There was 'no indication of any
terrific upside value' in a demerger of the group's core music and retail
divisions and he noted that the costs would be huge.
Thorn's shares, which have rallied recently on revived speculation of a
demerger, closed down 9p at 1054p.
The group's results for the three months to June 30 - the first time Thorn
has reported the first quarter - showed a strong performance by its main
businesses, EMI Music, Thorn Group and HMV, together with an improvement in
its other businesses.
However, pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 33.1m from Pounds 40.4m after a net
exceptional charge of Pounds 13.1m, mainly on the disposal of Thorn
Security, which was partly offset by a decline in finance charges
to Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 12.5m).
Turnover from continuing operations increased to Pounds 928.8m (Pounds
870.8m) with discontinued operations contributing a further Pounds 2.3m
(Pounds 147.9m). The group sold Thorn Lighting and its stake in Thames
Television.
Profits from continuing operations rose 24.7 per cent to Pounds 52.5m
(Pounds 42.1m).
Sales at EMI Music rose 16.6 per cent to Pounds 404.9m and profits grew by
14.6 per cent to Pounds 33m helped by the success of Canto Gregoriano and
Pink Floyd's latest album.
Thorn Group, the renamed rental business, posted a 9.8 per cent increase in
operating profit to Pounds 25.8m on revenues which rose 6.2 per cent to
Pounds 374.1m, underpinned by improvement in both UK and continental
European businesses.
Sales at HMV increased 12.4 per cent to Pounds 87.8m with its seasonal loss
falling 24.4 per cent to Pounds 3.4m. Store sales continued to grow on a
like-for-like basis and the group opened a further six shops to bring its
total to 188 stores worldwide.
Net borrowings at the end of June stood at Pounds 471.5m representing
gearing of 38.3 per cent.
Earnings per share fell to 3.1p (6.4p) on a fully diluted basis.

FT  24 AUG 94 / French bank plans criminal charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the troubled state-owned French bank, yesterday confirmed
that it was preparing criminal charges of financial impropriety against
former executives of its loss-making associate company, International
Bankers SA (IBSA).
The bank's action is expected to take the form of a 'complaint against X',
or persons unknown, a standard procedure in France to trigger an inquiry by
an investigating magistrate who then decides what charges to bring.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, Credit Lyonnais' new president, said that if, in
addition to the misjudgments at the bank, he uncovered serious impropriety,
he would take legal action.
On June 16 Mr Peyrelevade, told the French parliamentary inquiry into Credit
Lyonnais that he had sacked 'two or three people' who had worked for IBSA,
and warned that there may be grounds for criminal proceedings.
Credit Lyonnais yesterday excluded any action against Mr Jean-Maxime
Leveque, who after heading the Credit Lyonnais group in 1986-88 took over
IBSA, originally a Luxembourg-based financial institution.
When he switched IBSA's base to France in 1990, where most of its property
lending was, Mr Leveque was required by Bank of France rules to have a
French 'shareholder of reference'. He went to his successor at Credit
Lyonnais, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, who complied by taking 25 per cent in IBSA.
But Credit Lyonnais' involvement in IBSA landed it with potential losses of
around FFr3bn (Pounds 366m), according to Mr Peyrelevade, who called the
investment 'an error of strategic character'.
IBSA has largely been dismembered, with some of its assets transferred to
another Credit Lyonnais subsidiary, Banque Colbert, and some FFr5bn of its
doubtful property loans hived off with other bad Credit Lyonnais real estate
loans into a special state-backed company.
Credit Lyonnais is maintaining its pressure for repayment of loans. In
addition to its theatrical legal tactics against Mr Bernard Tapie, the
beleaguered entrepreneur, it has warned Mr Roger Hersant, the French
publishing magnate, that it cannot renew loans falling due this autumn,
including a FFr600m credit maturing in October.

FT  24 AUG 94 / VW's gloom hits car shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen chairman, was yesterday accused of playing
'malicious tricks' on his competitors after his gloomy views on market
prospects hit German car shares yesterday.
VW stock suffered most, slumping 4.3 per cent, after Mr Piech said on Monday
evening that the industry's west European sales would be unchanged from last
year's low of 11.3m.
His remarks to journalists, combined with official data published yesterday
showing German car registrations down 16 per cent in July, and 4.9 per cent
lower than a year earlier, rattled the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
VW shares tumbled DM21.50 to DM483 at the official close: BMW shares dropped
1.7 per cent, or DM14, while Daimler-Benz fell 1.4 per cent, or DM11.50. The
decline in car stocks was the main cause of a 0.75 per cent dip in the Dax
index of 30 leading shares.
One industry official claimed the VW chairman was basing his assessment of
industry prospects on those at VW.
'He thinks VW is the automotive industry and he is presenting his own poor
orders as representative of the whole sector. It is malicious trick,' he
said.
Analysts said Mr Piech might be attempting to damp profit expectations after
VW's interim report last week announced the long-awaited turnround had been
achieved. The group earned DM133m (Pounds 55m) net in the second quarter,
reducing the first-half loss to DM209m against DM1.6bn in 1993.
While Mr Piech's forecast of unchanged German sales this year matched the
industry consensus, his suggestion of a flat result throughout western
Europe was 'completely out of line', according to one analyst.
General Motors Europe stood by earlier forecasts that German demand for all
makes of cars would be unchanged at 3.2m cars, while west European sales
would rise around 700,000 to 12m cars this year.
BMW said July deliveries, orders and production were all higher than a year
earlier, while Mercedes-Benz said its plans to deliver 585,000 vehicles to
all markets remained unchanged.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Russians defend the rouble with a flood of US dollars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's central bank made its most forceful intervention in the history of
Moscow's infant currency exchange yesterday when it flooded the market with
US dollars to counteract a sharp fall in the rouble.
The central bank's action appeared at odds with recent government moves to
lower interest rates and extend credits in response to lobbying from
cash-strapped companies. Russian officials suggested a rift in monetary
policy might be developing between different government departments.
A cut in the three-month refinancing rate from 150 to 130 per cent on Monday
unsettled the rouble, raising concern about further monetary loosening at a
time when the government's fiscal position is coming under strain. Increased
government spending and a softening of its position on credits to industrial
enterprises and farms have also raised inflation worries.
The central bank, which has been trying to cultivate a reputation as
guardian of the rouble, succeeded in stabilising the currency yesterday. In
turnover of Dollars 313m (Pounds 202m) - twice the previous record trading
level in Moscow's currency market - the rouble rose slightly on the day to
end 10 roubles higher at 2,161 roubles to the US dollar. Over the past
month, however, the rouble has fallen 6 per cent.
Economists were divided about the merits of the interest rate cuts. Some
suggested that the cut in the refinancing rate - the seventh this year -
simply brought it into line with other interest rates. 'We are moving from
an extremely high real interest rate to just a very high one,' one western
economist said. 'Real interest rates remain at about 4 per cent a month.'
But others argued the trend was risky. 'Given the future outlook and the
fiscal slippage, more prudence would have been useful,' another economist
said.
The difficulty faced by Russia's foreign debtors - chiefly former Socialist
countries - in servicing their Dollars 147bn debts may further complicate
the government's fiscal difficulties. Mr Oleg Davydov, foreign trade
minister, said Russia's debtors were paying only Dollars 2bn a year compared
to their obligations of Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7bn.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Local councils to meet costs of reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All the costs created by local government reorganisation in England must be
borne locally, the Department of the Environment said yesterday.
County councils claimed this would mean higher council taxes in the areas
affected.
The costs of reorganisation, which would involve replacing the current
two-tier system of counties and districts with new all-purpose unitary
authorities, are fiercely disputed. Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local
Government Commission, which is preparing recommendations for the government
on new structures, has estimated total costs at about Pounds 1bn.
Under the plans announced yesterday, councils will be allowed to borrow to
cover the transitional costs of the reorganisation, due to take place in
1996 and 1997, but central government will pay no grants to local
authorities to cover the costs.
Ministers are putting pressure on local authorities to minimise costs by
restricting councils' borrowing to cover for only 'unavoidable costs and for
a reasonable amount of discretionary expenditure'.
Their intention is that this will thwart any rises in council tax. Councils
which spend more than the government deems 'reasonable' on reorganisation
will have to find money from reserves.
The Labour-controlled Association of County Councils, most of whose members
support retaining the two-tier system, said the decision meant 'people in
some parts of the country will be paying for the reorganisation into the
next century, long after the review process has been completed'.
Ms Josie Farrington, the association's chairman, said: 'The irony is that
the proposed system of financing changes is drawn up in such a way to ensure
that the government - which has foisted the review upon local communities
with no convincing explanation - dictates that the local taxpayer foots the
bill.'
She said the distinction between unavoidable costs and discretionary costs
was 'no more than a cynical attempt to make local authorities look
responsible for the inevitable rise in council tax bills'.
However, the cross-party Association of District Councils, which supports
the creation of unitary authorities, gave the proposals a 'guarded welcome'.
It predicted that long-term savings generated by removing a tier of
bureaucracy would enable the new unitary authorities to pass on savings to
council tax payers. It said it had never expected the government to provide
new money from central funds to pay for the reorganisation.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Lilley takes shine off City bonuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City firms accustomed to paying high-flying dealers with diamonds or cases
of Chateau Lafite to avoid National Insurance contributions will now have to
search for even more imaginative loopholes in the law.
From midnight last night, gemstones and a range of alcoholic drinks will be
treated as payments of earnings, liable for National Insurance
contributions, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, announced
yesterday.
This could include favourites such as Chateau Lafite 1990 retailing at about
Pounds 700 a case or, perhaps, Chateau Pichon la Lande, which sells for
Pounds 400 a case, according to one wine broker who has supplied wine for
city bonuses.
The move, expected to save the exchequer about Pounds 50m a year, is the
latest attempt to close loopholes which have enabled mostly large City firms
to avoid paying the 10.2 per cent employers' contributions on bonus
payments.
It follows action by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in the last Budget
to prevent gold bars and other tradeable commodities being used to avoid
contributions, saving an estimated Pounds 70m a year. The government has
previously acted to prevent gilts and shares in other companies being paid
to avoid tax.
Mr Lilley said yesterday: 'Companies and their accountant advisers who
devise ways of paying earnings which avoid their liability for National
Insurance contributions will find it increasingly unattractive to produce
and operate such schemes.
'These regulations are clear evidence of the government's intention to act
speedily to close National Insurance loopholes.'
Officials are thought to have uncovered about 50 schemes involving diamonds
or fine wines. These escaped the budget measures because they were not
traded on a recognised exchange.
The Royal Bank of Canada has assisted customers making diamond-backed
payments by enabling gems to be bought and sold without leaving Switzerland,
thus avoiding the payment of value added tax.
It said yesterday: 'The operation, which was only a very small part of our
business will no longer apply.'
Accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which advises clients on how to limit tax
bills, said: 'These schemes were attractive mainly to City firms paying
large bonuses to individual staff, rather than the run-of-mill bonus
schemes.'

FT  24 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: US telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LDDS certainly cannot be accused of lacking direction. Through a series of
mega-deals, it has turned itself from a little-known Mississippi telecoms
reseller into the US's fourth largest long-distance operator. This week's
Dollars 2.5bn acquisition of WilTel means it will be able to route calls
from its growing customer base over its own infrastructure instead of buying
capacity from rivals. Its earlier Dollars 900m acquisition of IDB
Communications gave it direct relationships with about 100 foreign telecoms
carriers.
But does this drive to join the big league makes sense? It is not just that
Dollars 2.5bn looks expensive given WilTel's operating profits of Dollars
90m. Margins in the long-distance business are under pressure. Making
profits in this market is largely about tapping its immense economies of
scale and establishing a strong brand name. On both scores, LDDS starts a
long way behind AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint.
The best justification for the strategy is that LDDS is now in a position to
play an important part in restructuring the US telecoms industry. It is the
only unaffiliated player in the long-distance market. That will make it an
attractive partner, or even acquisition, for the Baby Bells if as expected
they are allowed to break out of their local fiefdoms. It could also appeal
to any foreign carriers seeking to form a fourth force in the global market
to compete with the three alliances built around LDDS's main rivals.

FT  24 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After years of ruinous losses it is some comfort that business now being
written at Lloyd's of London is expected to be profitable. But the Pounds
800m profit for the 1993 year of account forecast by Chatset, the
independent forecasters, would hardly be a cause for celebration. A return
of less than 10 per cent of market capacity - the long-term target set in
Lloyd's business plan - would be a disappointing outcome for a year which
saw few natural catastrophes and premium rates at their peak. While the
weather has also been kind this year, rates are already softening.
Neither does this headline forecast include reserves which will have to be
set aside against asbestosis and pollution claims on policies written years
ago. While the eventual level of liabilities depends on events in the US
Congress and courts, it is likely that reserving will fall from the Pounds
1.4bn set aside last year. If Chatset's estimate of Pounds 500m proves
correct, though, there would be precious little left over to make up for the
losses of the previous five years.
The individual Names which back the market must therefore hope that Chatset
has underestimated the eventual level of underwriting profits and
overestimated the need for additional reserves. Although corporate capital
was not admitted in time for the 1993 year of account, investors in quoted
Lloyd's funds would also prefer to see a higher profits peak. Investment
returns this year look like being especially poor, so the onus is more than
ever on the underwriters to show a decent profit.

FT  24 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Thorn EMI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Colin Southgate's comments yesterday ruling out a demerger of Thorn EMI
for the next three years were a disappointment. Splitting the group he
chairs into its music and TV rental parts looked an attractive way of
enhancing shareholder value. The advantages of keeping the two divisions
yoked together are slim. The steady but not terribly exciting rental
business arguably drags down the rating that free-standing EMI shares would
enjoy.
The best that can be said about Sir Colin's remarks is that they should
clear up speculation over group strategy. The management's main challenge
for the medium term is to hit its targets of boosting music margins from 14
per cent to 16 per cent and rental margins from 8 1/2 per cent to 10 per
cent. The group's first quarter figures, reported for the first time
yesterday, show a slight slip in margins in the music business.
But it would be wrong to conclude much from this as EMI's results are highly
cyclical and its Japanese arm did particularly well in the first quarter of
last year. Equally the small improvement in rental margins means little,
though it is encouraging that Thorn is close to stemming what has been a
steady erosion of its UK rental business.
If Thorn can hit its margins targets, investors will look kindly on its
plans to diversify into book publishing. Sir Colin has highlighted this as
an area where EMI could apply its existing skills in managing intellectual
property. With a demerger off the agenda, management will certainly have
time to look at other strategic moves.

FT  24 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: NFC loses driver
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NFC's statement on the resignation of chief executive Mr Peter Sherlock left
everything to the imagination. The company provided no explanation at all,
not even that traditional fig leaf, 'after a clash of management styles'. To
be fair to NFC, Bass was no more illuminating when Mr Sherlock left its
employ in October 1992. Whatever the reasons, shareholders of both companies
may begrudge paying Mr Sherlock over Pounds 1m in compensation for loss of
office in under two years.
The bigger worry for NFC shareholders is that there is more to Mr Sherlock's
departure than personalities. While his business school jargon may not have
been to every investment institution's taste, his arrival was welcomed by
those keen to see NFC's inbred culture opened up. They will not be reassured
that the board appears to have sided with Mr Robbie Burns, a life-long NFC
man who was beaten to the top job by Mr Sherlock and has now withdrawn his
own resignation. Although the company stresses that there has been no change
in strategic direction, the suspicion remains that Mr Sherlock wanted to
pursue it more quickly than Mr Burns.
The management question would matter less if Mr Sherlock's bullish comments
about trading prospects had proved accurate. Third quarter figures suggest
operating profit growth remains very sluggish. NFC may be right to blame
both European recession and American overheating for its problems. But the
new chief executive will need to do more to convince investors it can
capitalise on the undoubted opportunities.

<TEXT>
Here's a salutary lesson for all academics who think their research might
earn them an extra bob or two on the side.
Carl Hamilton, of the Stockholm Institute of International Business, has
just been booted out after agreeing to publish his PhD thesis on the
marketing of the Absolut brand of vodka. It was commissioned by Absolut's
maker, the state-run Vin and Sprit AB. The company is cross because the
thesis reportedly contains confidential information. More sensitively,
Hamilton also reportedly credits Absolut's huge popularity to clever US
advertising, rather than to Vin and Sprit's own efforts.
Lesson one of life: never bite the hand that feeds you. Unless of course you
know a fatter hand is just around the corner.

A couple more names to add to the roll-call of young media tycoons in basic
training. Observer commented earlier this week on how Australia's local
newspaper business was being used by the Packer, Murdoch and O'Reilly
families to see if the next generation had the right stuff to make it to the
top. The same thing seems to be happening in the UK.
Young Matthew Doull, a nephew of Conrad Black, has done his stint as a hack
on the Daily Telegraph's city pages, and has now got the job of thinking up
bright ideas for the Telegraph's new business unit.
Another young thing to watch is Jonathan Rothermere, 26, who is currently
writing for the Sunday Mail in Glasgow. With his father, Lord Rothermere,
turning 69 this week it probably won't be long before young Jonathan gets a
call to return to Associated Newspapers' headquarters so that he can learn
how to do a proper job.

Rear-admiral Allison Madueke - just sacked as chief of staff of the Nigerian
navy - will no doubt look back with nostalgia on his nine months in the job.
An Ibo who once fought on the rebel side in the Biafran war, he probably
relished his staff mansion in Lagos's exclusive Ikoyi suburb.
Not that running Nigeria's navy is particularly demanding, aside from
receiving visiting warships from Brazil. It might be the largest navy in
west Africa but has never had to fire a shot in anger. Of the two frigates
moored in Lagos, the Obuma is not in operation - except for an annual spin
round the harbour - while the Iradu has been undergoing repairs for two
years.
Perhaps Madueke will get a consolation prize. Local press reports suggest
the number two in the regime, General Oladipo Diya, may be the next victim
of General Abacha's reshuffle - with Madueke tipped for the job. Lucky him.

There seems to be precious little Sprung, let alone Vorsprung, in the German

Ferdinand Piech was in Paris this week to tell journalists that the second
half of the year would see a further drop in orders. Right across western
Europe indeed, 1994 sales would be no higher than last year. Less than ideal
starting pads for the new Polo range he was unveiling, presumably. But cheer

on an exciting new Skoda. And that's no laughing matter.

Argentina has a new constitution today, which, as well as giving president

removes the old requirement that the president must be a Roman Catholic. It
also bans discrimination of practically every shade and nuance.
Someone should tell Antonio Quarracino, the Catholic archbishop of Buenos
Aires. The bishop has little time for homosexuals, and uses his weekly
television programme to air his less than politically correct opinions.
Quarracino has just called for the creation of 'a zone where all the gays
and lesbians can live with their laws, their television and even their own
constitution, where they can live in a sort of separate country with great
freedom. In this way we will clean an ignoble stain from the face of

FT  24 AUG 94 / Spot the Real Thing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It all started in May 1886 when John Pemberton, a pharmacist in Atlanta,
Georgia, cooked up an unusually exhilarating brain tonic. Its stimulative
effects came mainly from two ingredients: the coca leaf of South America, a
source of cocaine, and the seeds of the cola tree of West Africa, a source
of caffeine. He called it Coca-Cola, and a legend was born.
Part of that legend rests on the mystique that surrounds the Coca-Cola
formula. According to company folklore, only two people within the Coca-Cola
empire know how to make Coke, and the only copy of the recipe is locked away
in a vault, unavailable to anyone in any circumstances except by a formal
vote of the board of directors.
This has not stopped people trying to work out the secret for themselves.
The cynic would say the formula is simple: one part sugared water to 99
parts hype. But piecing together the available information, it is possible
to pick up some clues as to the recipe.
In most countries, the basic ingredients are written on the side of the can
or bottle. The biggest two are water and sugar. Caramel gives the drink its
characteristic dark colour, and phosphoric acid gives it a tang. The
caffeine is still there, though in much smaller quantities than a century
ago. So are the coca leaves, but they have been decocainised.
The big secret lies in the so-called 7X portion of the formula - the part
listed as 'natural flavours' on the container. This comprises seven natural
oils. Six are thought to be orange, lemon, nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander and
neroli (from a variety of orange blossom). The seventh is lavender or lime,
according to which version you believe.
Knowing the list of ingredients, of course, is not the whole of the mystery:
you still have to know how to mix them. Undaunted by the secrecy, however,
people have been trying to imitate Coca-Cola since the day it went on to the
market. Pepsi-Cola's origins go back almost as far as Coca-Cola's: to 1894,
when Caleb Bradham, a North Carolina pharmacist, started selling a
cola-based drink containing pepsin as a tonic for the relief of dyspepsia.
Of the many smaller imitators worldwide, by far the most prominent today is
Royal Crown Cola, a Texas-based company formerly owned by the US financier,
Victor Posner, but last year taken over by a newly formed New York-based
conglomerate called Triarc.
RC Cola has been making and selling cola under its own name for decades, but
since 1991 it has had another sideline: supplying cola syrups to Cott, a
Canadian soft drinks company, which in turn uses them to make own-label
colas for supermarket chains.
These Cott-supplied colas are better packaged than earlier private-label
colas were. They also taste better: in conjunction with Cott, RC Cola has
developed new formulas to meet individual retailers' specifications. But do
they really taste anything like Coke or, for that matter, Pepsi?
First, it can be surprisingly hard to tell the difference. In the absence of
any independent consumer research on the subject, the FT's New York bureau
held a highly unscientific blind tasting of Coke, Pepsi and PC Cola (a
Cott-supplied private label). Of the six people who took part, only one
succeeded in singling out the interloper.
Second, who cares? History has shown that people do not buy Coke for its
flavour. In 1985, Coca-Cola took the extraordinary decision to abolish Coke
in the US and replace it with the smoother, sweeter New Coke, which had
consistently scored higher in blind tastings. The move was a disaster: the
US public said changing the taste of Coke was like burning the American
flag. Back came the old Coke, and it has been out-selling every other soft
drink since.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Milk shakes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It hardly seems fair. The UK government spent six years deciding the best
way to reform the country's dairy market, only to be taken to court for
botching the job. The Dairy Trade Federation announced this week that it is
seeking judicial review of the government's efforts to shake up the milk
market, which it claims threaten unnecessary price rises and job losses.
The Milk Marketing Board was at the heart of a cartelised system of UK milk
provision which kept prices high and stifled innovation. Abolishing the
MMB's monopoly over milk supplies and allowing processors to compete for
supplies with the Board's successor, Milk Marque, was intended to reverse
both effects. It has done neither.
What went wrong? The DTF's decision to seek a judicial review sounds like
sour grapes. For the first time in 60 years, the dairy processors were this
year allowed to bid direct for milk, but only managed to secure a third of
what they required. Milk Marque signed up the rest and the resulting
scramble for supplies allowed it to push up prices. If the DTF's complaint
stemmed simply from its members having lost the first round of playing under
the new rules, it should be rapidly dismissed. The trouble is that the rules
themselves are fundamentally flawed.
Any reform labours under two obstacles. First is that the UK's milk quota
under the Common Agricultural Policy, currently 85 per cent of the country's
needs, will always allow someone in the industry to make excess profits. The
second is that, by failing to break up the old MMB into competing regional
entities, the government has preserved a single body with a good chance of
exploiting its position to share those profits with farmers at the expense
of the processors.
The best way of reforming the milk market would, of course, be to abolish
the CAP, although this is beyond the government's power. In the long run,
processors may turn to imports to make up their shortfall. But a quicker way
of injecting flexibility into the current system would be to make milk
quotas tradable across national borders. Meanwhile, the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission might cast a fresh eye on the question of unfair
competition closer to home.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Tonic for fickle tastebuds: New Age soft drinks and
own-label colas are posing a challenge to market leaders Coke and Pepsi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For as long as anyone can remember, more people have quenched their thirsts
with a Coca-Cola or its closest imitator, Pepsi-Cola, than any other soft
drink money can buy. Together, they account for more than 50 per cent of all
the carbonated drinks consumed worldwide. And yet . . . is it just possible
that some of the fizz is going out of the market for two of the world's
best-selling products?
In the US, which alone accounts for a third of the world market for soft
drinks, consumers are showing signs of getting bored with Coke and Pepsi.
These days, they want wider variety. Cola-flavoured drinks are slowly losing
market share to new types of beverages such as iced teas, fruit drinks,
bottled water and energy-giving sports drinks. In the late 1980s, according
to US securities firm Salomon Brothers, colas took 63 per cent of the US
soft drinks market. Last year, the figure was down to 58 per cent.
But alternative beverages are not the only worry for Coke and Pepsi. Until
recently, the biggest threat Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, the company that makes
Pepsi, faced was each other. Now a bigger one seems to have emerged: the
possibility that private-label manufacturers are taking an increasing share
of a market that is in any case shrinking because consumers' tastes are
changing.
At first sight, this proposition seems to be supported by PepsiCo's latest
financial results. Its second-quarter profits this year were Dollars 447m -
excluding exceptional items, unchanged from the same period the previous
year.
Coca-Cola, however, increased net profits by 13 per cent to Dollars 758m in
the same period. More significantly, Coca-Cola's share price, currently
hovering around its all-time high, suggests that investors think the
company's glory days are far from over.
One reason why the companies' figures tell different stories is that, unlike
Coca-Cola, PepsiCo derives only 35 per cent of its operating profits from
soft drinks. A higher proportion, 37 per cent, comes from its fast food
chains (Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC - formerly Kentucky Fried Chicken),
which suffered badly from price competition in the second quarter, and
another 28 per cent comes from its Frito-Lay snacks business.
Another reason for the profits difference is their geographical spread. In
the US, Pepsi's market share is almost as big as Coke's, but worldwide,
Pepsi trails behind. About 80 per cent of Coca-Cola's total operating
profits come from outside the US, while PepsiCo's beverage division earns
less than 16 per cent of its operating profits from other countries. The
result is that Coca-Cola is cushioned from the effects of competition in the
US, while PepsiCo is relatively exposed.
Even so, neither Coca-Cola nor PepsiCo can afford to ignore US consumers'
changing tastes. In the past few years, an increasingly health-conscious US
public has shown signs of turning away from high-sugar soft drinks such as
Coke and Pepsi. At first, the trend was towards diet (low-calorie) versions
of the same drinks. But now the fastest area of growth is an ever-expanding
variety of 'natural' drinks and so-called New Age beverages, such as fruit
juice drinks and iced teas. A driving force behind the trend has been
Snapple Beverage, an upstart US drinks manufacturer that has rocketed to
public prominence through rapidly rising demand for its New Age drinks,
which include Raspberry Iced Tea, Amazin' Grape Juice and Mango Madness
Cocktail.
This phenomenon has prompted a revolution at Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.
Realising they cannot resist the market trend, the two companies have
decided to join it. Both are diversifying away from their core brands and
are launching new products that do not even carry the Coke or Pepsi names.
Coca-Cola, for example, sells a range of iced teas under the Nestea brand in
a joint venture with Nestle, the Swiss food group, while PepsiCo sells iced
teas under the Lipton name in a joint venture with the Thomas J. Lipton tea
company, the US subsidiary of Unilever. In March this year, Coca-Cola
launched a range of New Age fruit drinks in the US under the Fruitopia
brand, with names such as Raspberry Psychic Lemonade and Grape Beyond; and
earlier this month PepsiCo said it was forming a joint venture with
Starbucks Coffee, a fast-growing US specialty coffee company, to launch a
range of ready-to-drink iced coffees in bottle or cans under the Starbucks
name.
These days, both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo make no attempt to disguise their
willingness to spread into other kinds of soft drinks. PepsiCo acknowledges
that some of the fastest-growing product categories are outside its
traditional soft drinks business, and talks of its all-out effort to become
a 'total beverage company'. Mr Sergio Zyman, chief marketing officer of
Coca-Cola, said at the time of the Fruitopia launch in March that the
company planned to increase both the speed and frequency of its product
launches to meet changing consumer demands, 'aggressively addressing growth
opportunities wherever they exist'.
But while this approach may give Coca-Cola and PepsiCo a stake in the growth
sectors of the soft drinks market, are their cola businesses in danger of
withering under an assault from own-label brands?
Private-label colas have been around for decades, but in the last few years,
manufacturers have improved the flavour and packaging of their products.
Consumers are nowadays switching away from branded goods if they can get
acceptable quality at a lower price from own-label products.
Earlier this summer PepsiCo suffered a fall of 2 per cent in operating
profits from its soft drinks business. It turned out that Cott, the
fast-growing Canadian maker of low-cost, store-branded foods and drinks, had
quietly been signing up US store groups as customers.
This came only a few weeks after Coca-Cola, the US maker of Coke, had taken
a drubbing from Cott in the UK. When Cott started supplying J. Sainsbury,
Britain's biggest food retailer, with cans of own-label cola that looked
like Coke but sold at about half the price, Coke's share of Sainsbury's cola
sales initially slumped from 63 per cent to 33 per cent.
Yet even Royal Crown Cola, the US company that supplies cola syrup to Cott,
says the threat to Coke and Pepsi has been exaggerated. Mr John Carson, RC
Cola's chief executive, says recent inroads by own-brand colas have been
limited to grocery store chains and discount stores, and even there they
have come largely at the expense of earlier private-label products.
'Private-label is definitely a thorn in Coke and Pepsi's side. It's real and
they can feel it. But it's not a threat,' Mr Carson says.
Cott also tends to play down the implications of its recent triumphs - with
good reason. Cott is a minnow compared with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, and it is
painfully aware that it would be unlikely to survive retaliatory action if
it came to an outright cola price war.
Industry analysts say own-label products will continue to be an irritant to
Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, but not much more. Most of them think any adverse
effects on the companies' sales from private-label competition - or, indeed,
from an increasing proliferation of alternative beverages - will be more
than outweighed by the opportunities for growth in developing countries and
recently opened markets such as eastern Europe and China.
While some of these markets may be less profitable than those in developed
countries, particularly during the costly start-up phase, their sales
potential is immense. At present, consumption of soft drinks outside the US
averages four gallons per person per year. Inside the US, the figure is 49
gallons.
PepsiCo, more heavily exposed to the US market and less focused on soft
drinks than Coca-Cola, is regarded by Wall Street as less well placed to
benefit. But own-label products and New Age beverages notwithstanding,
industry observers say it is much too soon to suggest that the growth is
about to end for either company. Jesse Meyers, publisher of US trade
magazine Beverage Digest, says their brands are strongly embedded in the
global psyche. 'I fully anticipate that when Virgin Atlantic Airways flies
to the moon, we will be able to get off the plane and drink a Coke or a
Pepsi,' he says.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Russian debt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Just as night follows day, so does the growth of Russian inter-enterprise
debt follow a credit squeeze. Such soaring indebtedness has happened before,
notably in 1992; it is the predictable result of attempts at stabilisation;
if the government gives in to the blackmail from enterprise managers, the
problem will recur.
At its recently estimated level of Rbs90,000bn (Pounds 27bn), the debt
enterprises have accumulated with one another is spectacular. It is not
surprising that the government's resolve is crumbling, notwithstanding its
agreement with the IMF last March. President Boris Yeltsin has, for example,
already agreed to grant Rbs3,500bn in low-interest credits to the defence
sector and heavy industry. More may follow.
Regardless of privatisation, managers have not yet made the mental switch
from supplying state-directed production, to satisfying paying customers.
This, moreover, is the more benign aspect of the story. Enterprises without
owners, operating in a society without effective laws, allow managers to
privatise the gains and socialise the losses. Why not offer goods on credit,
in return for bribes, leaving the company with the debt and themselves with
the money? Or why not sell goods abroad, put the proceeds in a Swiss bank
account, leaving suppliers unpaid?
Managers confidently expect that the government will have to drop the needed
cash from helicopters. Yet their enterprises, as large holders of cash, are
themselves victims of inflation. Worse, the government will only have to
repeat the battle, in still more disadvantageous circumstances.
Targeted allocation of credits to high-priority industry is not the answer,
since nobody knows which the high-priority industries actually are. Even
closing insolvent enterprises may be a big mistake, since in so distorted an
economy, it is difficult to know which enterprises should be closed. Nor can
a mechanism for netting out inter-enterprise debt play a useful role at
least until its growth has been halted.
It can be halted, however, by forcing enterprise managers to manage their
cash flows, as has been done in other economies in transition. The debt
overhang should be left to one side, at least for the moment. Meanwhile, by
refusing a bail-out, the government will create huge pressure for payment
within the enterprise sector. There is money. Enterprises must simply be
forced to use it.
Mass unemployment is the spectre that stops this from being tried. The
government needs to lay this ghost, by telling people that producing goods
that are not wanted or, if wanted, are not paid for is unemployment. In
addition, any money must go directly to workers, either as unemployment
benefit or as payment for short-time working. It must not just be dumped on
the enterprises.
This crisis has arisen partly because the stabilisation lacks credibility
where it counts and partly because enterprises are in limbo, subject neither
to the control of the state nor to that of owners. State control cannot be
restored, while ownership will take time to establish. In the meantime,
enterprises must be compelled to look after their cash flows. The printing
press is not the answer.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Mr Zedillo's long agenda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The candidate of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, Mr
Ernesto Zedillo, won a convincing victory on Sunday in the most competitive
elections in Mexican history. He would be making a grievous mistake,
however, if he interpreted that victory as a signal that he should leave
Mexico's political system unchanged.
Many voices in the ruling party will be telling Mr Zedillo that the wide
margin of his victory means he should leave well alone. He should ignore
them. Another six years of denying the political opposition a proper voice
would serve only to intensify the strains which nearly took Mexico's body
politic to breaking point this year.
His first gesture of conciliation to opposition parties is welcome. But
given the tenacity with which the PRI has held on to power in its 65 years
in office, Mexicans are sceptical of gestures. Mr Zedillo needs rapidly to
take action.
A democratic system will only emerge if the ruling party is itself made
democratic. Mr Zedillo can begin work before he takes office by embarking on
reform of the PRI. This enormous task of disentangling the PRI from the
structures of the state has frustrated his predecessors since 1965.
An integral element of the needed reform is to give to party members the
right to choose candidates. This will deprive the president of an important
lever for the management of the state, but is essential if the PRI is to be
converted into a modern political party. Such reform has its dangers: the
powerful and often undemocratic traditionalists may well take over parts of
the party. However, if their candidates are forced to submit to free and
fair elections for political office, the danger may be reduced.
Ensuring free and fair elections is therefore the next important reform.
Although Sunday's elections were probably the fairest in Mexican history, it
is clear that a substantial minority - with some justification - still
considers the election process iniquitous. Elections must no longer be a
source of such political conflict. The way to ensure this is to hand the
entire electoral process - lock, stock and barrel - over to the independent
magistrates who oversaw Sunday's elections. These magistrates, chosen by
consensus among the political parties, performed admirably, but were
appointed late and were limited in their powers.
This is only the beginning of the huge task Mr Zedillo will face if he is to
follow up on his campaign promises to turn Mexico into a modern, law-based
society. Decentralising the political system, reforming the legal system and
the country's corrupt and inefficient police forces, and reforming the
social security and health systems are all necessary. Efforts in these
directions will bring him into conflict with some of the country's most
powerful vested interests.
The new president also inherits an unfinished agenda on the economy. He must
rid the private sector of many of the obstacles blocking growth. These
include monopolies both public - oil, railways and electricity - and private
 -in particular, telephones. Eliminating the monopolies would greatly
enhance economic efficiency. If growth were, partly as a result, to be 5 or
6 per cent a year, rather than the 2 to 3 per cent achieved under the
present administration, the country's tensions would be greatly eased.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Personal View: UK needed at the heart of Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr LUDOLF VON WARTENBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent events in Europe - from the argument over the successor to Jacques
Delors as president of the European Commission to the fate of war-torn
Bosnia - have highlighted the difficult evolution of relations between the
continent's nation states. There is a growing tendency to form alliances
between European Union members on the basis of national interests.
Germany and the UK are promoting deregulation. UK foreign minister Mr
Douglas Hurd and his French counterpart Mr Alain Juppe have taken the lead
in trying to find solutions for Bosnia. Mr John Major and Mr Silvio
Berlusconi have compared notes on European policy. And there is always
Franco-German co-operation, said to be the motor of European integration.
As in any community, this tendency for shifting alliances within the EU can
be healthy - as long as there is a basic consensus within the EU on
objectives. In these times of political and economic reorientation it is of
paramount importance for the EU to maintain this consensus and develop it
further.
It is reassuring to see the UK playing an active part in this process -
after a period of concern that its position could become increasingly
defensive.
For industry it is encouraging to note that the UK government has identified
the search for measures to establish a competitive framework for European
companies as one of its priorities. Deregulation, dismantling the
bureaucracy and privatisation in key sectors, such as energy and
telecommunications, are in our mutual interest, be it on a national level or
in Brussels. Here we have classic British-German co-operation, as in the
attempt by the two countries to find strict criteria for subsidiarity within
the EU.
The principle of subsidiarity is basic to the functioning of markets and -
in a broader sense - for democracy, as we in Germany know from experience.
But we must also realise that there are limits to subsidiarity in any
community, particularly in areas that are crucial to industry, such as
environmental policy or export controls on weapons and the technology of
mass destruction.
The UK has decided to opt out of the social chapter of the Maastricht
treaty. It seems doubtful that this decision is really in the interests of
the country, and of its industry in particular. We cannot avoid a discussion
with other EU countries on social policies, as is illustrated by the recent
debate on the misconceived works council directive. It is always better to
try to influence decisions that may have consequences for British industry
than just to stand aside.
Recently, the Confederation of British Industry presented its business
agenda for Europe. German industry is in line with most of the CBI's
priorities. We underline the importance of the completion of the single
market as a big achievement and the linchpin of the EU. We also agree with
the CBI's proposition that Europe's future cannot simply rest on free trade
or the single market.
Because our industries are increasingly global, we know that our home base,
the EU, is central to our competitiveness. Economic convergence cannot be
achieved simply through macroeconomic policies and should not be hastily
arranged for political reasons. Stability, predictability and favourable
conditions throughout the Union - in monetary policy, interest rates and
exchange rates - are of great importance for our companies. The Maastricht
process is far from perfect, but it is a credible attempt to take the Union
forward. Economic and monetary instruments should not be misused to promote
policy objectives that would not otherwise be implemented. But would it not
be in the interest of our companies if the single market were complemented
by a European monetary union - provided, of course, that monetary stability
is guaranteed?
German-based companies are increasingly adopting European strategies and
even identities. They are already pursuing their own vision of a united
Europe. Various national interests could get in their way, as politics in
Europe is trailing far behind. It is in the interest of European industry to
strengthen - and to deepen - co-operation, be it economic and monetary
policy, foreign and international security policy, or the co-ordination of
internal policies such as crime control. It is also in the interest of
European companies to develop a trans-European infrastructure. This is true
for information technologies which are at the heart of our future
competitiveness. We must think beyond national borders and establish new
European structures vigorously. Equally important is an improved transport
network. Though the UK has no land link with the rest of the continent, this
geographical insularity should not detract from its interest in a modern
infrastructure that would benefit both continental and UK distributors.
We should be realistic about what can be achieved in the process of
integration and how serious the temptations for misguided quick fixes are.
This is particularly true for the European monetary union which has so far
not been properly thought out and suffers from an ambitious, possibly
unrealistic schedule.
But there is no reason to disbelieve that one day the UK, along with Germany
and others, will be part of a monetary union.
We must be careful not to follow obsolete concepts of national interests and
shifting alliances between nation states. This is a challenge for all, but a
particular one for those who consider themselves the great architects of
Europe. The UK should be among them.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Hard test at end of a crash course: After a decade of fast
growth, the UK university system is examining its future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is even worse than doing the exams,' said Alison, a nervous school
leaver from Sussex, yesterday. She was waiting for the listing today of UK
university places that were not filled when last week's A-level results were
unveiled.
Her concern was understandable. After a decade in which the number of
university places on offer has increased each year, this autumn the numbers
admitted will be the same as in 1993. Having seen student numbers double
since the early 1980s, UK universities are at last slamming on the brakes.
Admissions tutors are limiting the number of entrants mainly because the
government has given them no choice. Universities will be given less state
funds per student if they allow the number they recruit to rise by more than
1 per cent this year - the first time in recent years that they have been
penalised for growing too fast.
Many universities object to the government's methods, which they consider
unnecessarily heavy-handed. The Committee of Vice-chancellors and
Principals, which represents university heads, said the cap on admissions
could mean a 'massive denial of opportunity' for students. They blame
ministers for not anticipating how fast higher education would expand - and
then overreacting when they realised they had miscalculated.
When Mr Kenneth Baker, the then education secretary, announced in 1989 a
push towards a system of 'mass higher education' he set a target of 30 per
cent of 18 year-olds entering university by 2000. That target was passed
last year.
But there is a growing acceptance among universities that, even without
government intervention, they would be best advised to consolidate for
several years.
To do otherwise, the committee has been warned by higher education experts,
would risk exacerbating already serious funding problems and compromise
quality. It would also run the risk of flooding the labour market with
graduates.
The number of universities has almost doubled since 1992 thanks mainly to
the upgrading of polytechnics, which were previously funded by local
education authorities. There are now 89 UK universities, 41 of which have
gained that status since 1992.
New universities have expanded fastest. De Montfort University, formerly
Leicester Polytechnic, is the fastest-growing university in western Europe.
In the 1986-87 academic year it had 8,000 students. By 1993-94 that figure
was nearer 18,000 and by the end of this year should reach 25,000.
Almost inevitably, growth on this scale has brought funding problems. The
amount the government pays to universities per student (excluding
maintenance grants) has dropped by more than 30 per cent since 1980 in real
terms, and the government is looking for a further fall of 10 per cent over
the next three years.
Even in the longer term, a report by Professor Gareth Williams and Dr
Heather Fry of London University's Institute of Education warns
vice-chancellors not to expect any increase in government funding. They
point to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development figures
which show that UK state funding for education as a proportion of national
income is higher per student than in any other western nation.
The effects of reduced funding are already being felt in more crowded
lecture halls. Five years ago there were 10.6 students to every lecturer;
now there are 14, according to the Association of University Teachers.
Meanwhile, claims the vice-chancellors' committee, higher education
institutions have not been able to keep their buildings up to standard and
need Pounds 1.35bn just to clear the maintenance backlog.
The experience of Germany suggests that rapid expansion of higher education
can jeopardise quality, as well as adding to financial pressures. German
universities were once as exclusive as the UK system, catering for only 5
per cent of young Germans in the 1960s. Now the figure is 30 per cent.
Of these, 40 per cent drop out within the first two or three years without
qualifications. But about a third stay for more than seven years. That
suggests the system has not been able to cope effectively and efficiently
with the increase in numbers and is wasting resources.
Some UK academics fear the reduction in state funding per student has
already affected the country's academic standards. Earl Russell, a Liberal
Democrat peer and history professor at London University, has argued that
undergraduates, unless they have rich parents, are forced to work during
term time and so spend less time on studies. He sparked controversy by
adding that as a result: 'Academics, often unconsciously, have lowered their
requirements for work to what their students are able to do, so that an
Upper Second in 1992 may involve less work than a Lower Second in 1984.'
Vice-chancellors deny that this has happened, but the proportion of students
at 'old' universities (that is, excluding former polytechnics) being awarded
first-class honours degrees has risen by 50 per cent over the past decade,
even though a much larger proportion of the population is sitting degree
examinations. That implies quality might have been diluted.
The Institute of Education's report also warns that the increase in
institutions awarding university degrees could affect quality: 'So far the
system has been able to sustain the credibility of the doctrine that all
degrees are formally equivalent if not exactly equal. At issue for the
future is the extent to which this belief will remain convincing, and if not
what will replace it.'
The rapid expansion of higher education is not necessarily good news for
students either, when they start looking for jobs. With twice as many
graduates entering the job market each year, a degree cannot guarantee the
same opportunities as a decade ago.
According to the Institute's report, 'graduates will need to accept career
patterns' which are 'markedly different from those of the past . . . It is
not clear that most students have yet come to terms with this change in
prospects.'
Experience from the US, where the number of students graduating each year
has trebled since 1961, suggests that employers will adjust recruitment
practices accordingly.
The Institute of Manpower Studies, based at Sussex University, found that
after increasing steadily throughout the 1960s, US real starting salaries
peaked in 1969 (at Dollars 25,288 in 1990 prices), and then dropped by 16
per cent over the next two decades, to Dollars 21,319 in 1990.
Meanwhile the proportion of US graduates accepting jobs for which a degree
was not a requirement rose from 11 per cent in 1969 to 20 per cent in 1990.
This is projected to reach 30 per cent by 2005.
Similar trends are already emerging in the UK. Graduate unemployment is at
record levels, while starting salaries failed this year to keep pace with
inflation for the first time since records began in 1980, according to the
Higher Education Careers Services Unit.
Traditional graduate recruiters, such as accountancy firms, continued to
offer attractive salaries, according to Mr Colin Lawton, the unit's
statistical assistant, but the average was being dragged down by smaller
companies which had not recruited graduates before.
By holding numbers constant this year, universities should be able to create
a breathing space in which to address such problems. That will require
examining the service they can offer in an increasingly 'mass-market' higher
education system, and the trade off between quality and quantity when
resources are limited.
As Mr Baker observed in 1989: 'The structures appropriate to higher
education with 3 per cent participation, or even a 13 per cent
participation, simply cannot be sustained when participation rises to 30 per
cent.'

UK UNIVERSITIES: THE KEY FACTS
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
How many full-time students were in UK higher education in 1982 and
1992?
208,000 and 436,000 respectively.
What proportion of school-leavers go to university?
In 1986 only 14% went to university.
Last year it was 31% and it will rise again this year.
Are there more universities?
Yes. The old polytechnics have been granted university status.
Full-time students at polytechnics and college doubled in the decade
to 1992, while 'old' universities registered a rise of 40% over the
same period
Has there been an improvement in standards?
9% were awarded firsts last year. Only 6% were in 1983.
How many graduates find work within six months of graduating?
Graduate unemployment is presently 10.5% down from last year's
all-time high of 11.6%.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Highest ethical principles always
upheld
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr T GORDON RODDICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We would like to respond to a number of points made in Andrew Jack's
article on The Body Shop ('US ethical fund turns against Body Shop', August
19).
There were no 'emissions' from our former New Jersey 'factory'. Rather,
there were two accidental spills of 30 gallons of shampoo at our former
bottling plant two years ago. In line with our policy, we immediately
notified the authorities. There was no breach of environmental law, no
citation, no 'emissions'. I'm sorry that we spilled some shampoo, but
whenever there are human beings around, there will be minor accidents. The
reference to 'oil-based ingredients' is perplexing: perhaps the Financial
Times was referring to mineral oil. If so, then you should be aware that
this is the same ingredient which has been slapped on babies' bums for
generations in England without adverse effect]
The accusation that I find personally most offensive is the suggestion that
we lack 'commitment' to our trade-not-aid programme. No one should doubt our
commitment. Some of our critics' arguments about trade-not-aid centre around
a percentage game that misses the point. They say that, because our
trade-not-aid purchases form only a small percentage of our total, we should
not talk about it nor have prominent displays or window posters relating to
it.
We say that trade-not-aid is a very important part of our business, on which
we spend a disproportionate amount of time and money. Let me give one
example of how it works with one ingredient: Brazil nut oil is pressed in
the Amazon jungle by Kayapo Indians. We use the oil in our Brazil nut
conditioner. It comprises 1.5 per cent of total product volume, making it an
insignificant percentage of the total ingredient list. We use 1.5 per cent
because it is what works: use less and it would be ineffective; use more and
your head would look like an oily mop. Financial and managerial efforts on
these many projects far outweigh their naked value to us.
As for the supposed lack of public information, we publish our product
information manual in every store worldwide giving facts about ingredients
and their properties. We are at the forefront of companies in Europe in
listing ingredients on our product labels, though not yet required by law.
For the third year running, we have voluntarily published an independently
verified environmental statement in our Green Books. We make explicit our
stance on animal testing. I sometimes think we overdose on providing
information.
We will continue to develop our business with the highest of ethical
principles. This is why we recently institutionalised our values in amending
our memorandum of association, passed by our shareholders at the recent
annual general meeting. This is why we have set up the Values and Vision
Centre uniting our Against Animal Testing, Environmental, Fair Trade and
Human Rights departments in a group working directly with Anita. This is why
we published our company mission statement, and soon will publish our
trading charter. If this, and what we have done over the past 18 years, is
not good enough for the cynics, that's their problem - not ours.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICK MCVEIGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, On August 19 you carried a somewhat inaccurate headline to an article
regarding our company's sale of The Body Shop's stock earlier this summer
('US ethical fund turns against Body Shop').
As you point out, one factor (of several) leading to our sale was a belief
that negative allegations scheduled to be published in the US press
regarding the Body Shop's ethical performance could hurt the company's stock
price in the short term. We would like to clarify that at this time we are
researching these allegations and do not necessarily share them. We are
independently researching a report on the Body Shop's ethical performance,
which we have not finished, nor have we reached any conclusions.
It is therefore inaccurate for the headline to say that Franklin Research &amp;
Development has 'turned against' the Body Shop. While we have turned against
the stock for a variety of reasons, we have not taken this same position
towards the company.
If the results of our ethical analysis are positive and the company's stock
were at an attractive valuation, The Body Shop would certainly be a company
whose shares we would consider buying again.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Widespread support for blank tape
levy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WAYNE BICKERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Emma Tucker ('Blank tape prices may rise if EU supports levy plan',
August 18) makes several misguided predictions about the effects of the
European Commission's proposal to protect music copyright through a
Europe-wide levy.
Though the government has opposed this initiative in the past, the Music
Copyright Reform Group, which represents those who create, own, publish or
administer copyright music or lyrics, has found widespread support for the
proposal among backbenchers of all political parties. Indeed, harmonisation
of private copying legislation in the EU has even been welcomed by blank
tape manufacturers.
The suggestion that a levy would 'punish ordinary consumers' is not borne
out by the experience in other European countries. In France, Germany and
Austria, prices have fallen after the introduction of the levy due to
intense competition between blank tape manufacturers. We believe that a
reasonable levy for audio tapes could and would be fully absorbed by the
blank tape manufacturers, who have benefited enormously from the public's
ability to copy copyright music (research shows more than 90 per cent of
blank tapes are used for this purpose).
The proposals would not be bureaucratic, as suggested, since the
organisation necessary to administer the distribution system for the levy
exist in the UK. Nor would the blind and other disadvantaged users of blank
tapes be hit as the proposal allows member states to exempt or compensate
them.
The UK government should realise that the proposed levy aims fully to
compensate composers and music publishers for widespread, illegal private
copying of pre-recorded music. The MCRG hopes that ministers will give their
full support to protecting the interests of the UK music industry which
plays such a vital role in the heritage of the UK and Europe.

paranoid enemy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KARL A ZIEGLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a London-based US citizen observing the Cuban situation, I agree
with your leader's timely suggestions ('A new deal for Cuba', August 22).
It is absurd for US taxpayers to subsidise further a costly and militant
posture against most Cuban residents, whose principal ambition is greater
exposure to the 'free world's' markets; its goods, services, ideas,
tourists, institutions and its relative freedoms.
The anti-Castro lobby in Florida should take the lead in encouraging
political and economic liberalisation within Cuba. History has shown that a
paranoid enemy is usually more problematical than a co-operating trading
partner.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Arts: Humane observations - 'More Cuddles Now' on the
Edinburgh Fringe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The perceptibly larger share of drama claimed by gay themes at this year's
Edinburgh fringe still leaves room for old friends such as Jack Klaff, whose
acute and humane observations on the way of a man with a maid (and vice
versa) can be seen at the Assembly Rooms. More Cuddles Now has all the Klaff
virtues: a wicked ear for the banalities of dinner-party profundities, the
quickfire kaleidoscope of cliches behind which we almost but do not quite
hide, and the self-sustaining jargon with which we salve hurt pride -
'You're really forcing the pace,' says the disgruntled man when the woman is
offered a high-powered job in his field. 'We should have a discussion about
how fast we're to walk.'
Klaff portrays all the characters, not as an impersonator but as a sketcher
with a lightened tone and economic body language. The central thread is the
relationship between Mike, of Aldwych Films, and Kim, who comes to him with
an idea for a film on children and art. Growing attraction is charted, with
Klaff's customary amusement at external cool and internal turmoil, hopes,
fears, agonising self-consciousness. ('This woman hasn't blinked for 12
minutes,' is one desperate inner comment.)
He fancies himself, she gushes. Their affair is fondly chronicled ('unique .
. . never been able to talk to anyone before'), the living together and
clashes over life-style ('I don't think you know what pastel means]' 'For me
pastel is girlie'). Rifts and rows prompt a ventriloquial episode with a
squeaky-voiced quark that takes the place of conscience for both partners.
Towards the end, kids, serenity and the death of Kim are telescoped into a
bumpily-attained happy ending: 'We showed them. We made it]'
Klaff's satire on how the sexes communicate is as affectionate as ever
without losing its bite. His repertoire now includes a monstrous id,
ape-like and bellowing, inside Mike, providing a counterpoint to the careful
political correctitudes he comes out with, not always for the most correct
of motives.
Funny thing, relationships . . . Also at the Assembly Rooms, 7:84 Scotland
gives the premiere production of Twilight Shift by Jackie Kay. Kay is a
considerable poet, and her heightened sense of language (even including
rhymed couplets at times) permeates the play. It all adds to the unreality
of this study of a gay relationship in a small mining community.
It is any sense of that community which is lacking, however. There is no
feeling that Joe, the homosexual barber, has ever faced hostility or the
need to conceal what he is, though the audience is evidently meant to take
this for granted. Steven Wren plays him as uncomplicatedly cheerful as
opposed to the tortured emotional writhings of his secret lover, Alexander,
a married man with a child.
The cast of four is completed by the two men's womenfolk, grandmother and
wife respectively. Deirdre Davis's Ella is intelligent and touching as she
perceives her husband growing away from her. Her tendency to compare herself
with the heroine of Middlemarch (the book, Penguin edition, mark you, not
the television serial) I attribute to the traditional superiority of
Scottish education in even small mining communities. The climax is wildly
contrived - the revelation of a love between the fathers of Joe and Ella -
and only just avoids melodrama.
Iain Reekie's direction is intense, spare and stylised, except for some
rather glassy-eyed fondling for the men. The recorded poem of a child
mine-worker is beautiful. But then the play is the work of a poet, whose
characters are explored in a vacuum rather than the fully depicted world of
a natural dramatist.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Arts: Julian Joseph - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It says something about Julian Joseph's energetic piano playing that, at 28
and with only two records behind him, he can already draw a sizeable crowd
to the Barbican Hall on two consecutive nights. He came up in the late 1980s
crop of young British jazz musicians which included Courtney Pine and Steve
Williamson and like them his style is coruscating hard bop tempered by a
more contemporary sound. Reggae shines through Coltrane for Pine, for
Williamson it is funk and Joseph likes soul.
But Joseph's irrepressible urge to swing his quartet is what really sets him
apart. Once seated at the keyboard he simply cannot wait to push a tune
along. On Sunday he started out with a trio, a vigorous three cornered
work-out with Wayne Batchelor (bass) and Mark Mondesir (drums). Mondesir is
the most combative drummer and engaged Joseph in some serious hand-to-hand,
the pair grinning at one another wickedly throughout. Using his own material
from the albums, Joseph took the substance of a good tune and worried it
with percussive repetition until it was in the most satisfying shreds.
When the barnstorming trio returned after the interval with a seven piece
brass section clipped on one side and six reeds on the other, you felt
seatbelts might be in order. Packed with top flight soloists - Guy Barker
(trumpet), Peter King (alto) and Keith Waithe (flutes) - this orchestra
soars. Joseph is new to big band orchestration but clearly it suits him. His
arrangements on standards unfolded carefully and in a cool way but allowed
for soloist's aerobatics between. 'Everything Happens To Me' featured Peter
King at his most nimble and allowed Joseph a slot to serenade before revving
up the ensemble again. Marcus Miller's 'The King is Dead' used a poignantly
still duet between Barbara Wyllie's clarinet and Jamie Talbot's soprano
before taking off into the blue yonder; 'High Priestess' had Guy Barker,
Peter King and Patrick Clahah (tenor) out front, issuing slippery harmonies.
In October Joseph hosts the first Wigmore Jazz Series in London and in
November tours his extended group, The Forum Project. The third album is due
next year. On the strength of this weekend's display, we have much to look
forward to.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Arts: The power of pastiche - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A man slumps at his desk, squeezing his temples and grimacing. Clearly he
has a headache. A woman in a white coat approaches from behind. 'Tense,
nervous headache?' she asks, taking a brochure from the desk drawer, 'You
could choose a leading brand of painkiller or' - giving the man an almighty
whack round the ear with the book - 'you could choose from thousands of
First Choice Holidays]' Well it made me laugh. So did the commercial where
the dialogue goes 'Is it a bird?' 'No, it's a plane]' 'No, it's a fat chef]'
because clearly the object flying through the air is a fat chef. This is one
of a series so successful that they have actually lodged their punchline in
my memory. Since I can never remember which product a commercial is for,
even when I enjoy the joke (for instance the one where the 'bouncing bomb'
union flag towel gets to the sun lounger ahead of the German tourists;
gloriously politically incorrect, but which beer?) this seemed quite an
achievement . . . until I realised they had taught me 'Pay attention,
Medomsley Road, Consett' but failed to lodge in my mind the name of the
crisps which are made there.
My current favourite among the ads is the series where various middle aged
men - one overhearing himself discussed in the men's washroom, another
undergoing an operation - mime to the Nat King Cole recording of 'Let's Face
The Music And Dance'. I re-wound the tape to check on the advertiser which
is Allied Dunbar pensions and life assurance, hence the importance of the
line 'There may be trouble ahead'. And do these enjoyable ads have anything
in common? They do: all are pastiches of well known television items.
'Tense, nervous headache?' was for years used by a branded analgesic (heaven
knows which). 'Is it a bird? Is it a plane?' is meant to produce the
response 'No, it's Superman]' And the miming, in style, music period, and
particularly the hospital setting, is clearly a tribute to the late Dennis
Potter.
Enjoyable as they are, however, those commercials are the exceptions. Since
the summer schedules are stuffed with so many repeats and duff programmes it
seemed a good moment to check on those bits of television where the critic
usually hits the 'Fast Forward' button: the commercial breaks. Flashing
through the tapes, zapping out the programmes and watching only the
advertisements certainly makes a change, and brings home certain truths. We
know, of course, that production values are often high in the breaks, after
all people can spend as much producing 30 seconds here as on 30 minutes of
programming. But it is startling to find how much is old or even very old,
and how much is infuriating and counter productive.
Given the whiz-kid image of the ad biz, and the impression advertising
people like to convey that all new trends spring directly from them, it
seems astonishing that the talking chimps are still promoting PG Tips. They
began in 1956. In concept and gentleness of humour virtually nothing has
changed in 38 years. If the series does ever end (and no doubt somebody is
already campaigning for the rights and dignity of chimpanzees) it will leave
an unfillable hole.
In 1959 Domestos was undertaking to 'kill all known germs in an hour'. In
1994 it is offering to 'kill all known germs anywhere'. After 40 years
detergent manufacturers are still comparing the grey laundry of their
competitors with their own dazzling whites. The first cat named Arthur stuck
his paw in a tin of cat meat in 1967; last week another white cat named
Arthur was still doing it. It is 30 years since Esso urged us to 'Put a
tiger in your tank' and today the tiger is racing across crumbling ice floes
(why?) to get to an Esso station (why, if as we are told the big petrol
companies routinely use supplies from one another's tankers?) And the
umpteenth pretty woman is giving head to Cadbury's Flake.
Concentrating on the commercials you also notice how often they try to
baffle you with science. Remember 'WM7'? That was Omo's secret ingredient in
1963. In the past few days products have boasted of 'pro vitamin B5' of a
'hydromat complex', and of a 'unique hydroxy formula'. Others offer 'time
release freshness' or 'anti-static agents' and, in the case of a razor,
'micro fins'. All of a sudden every toothpaste manufacturer is promising
that the product is stuffed with bicarbonate of soda. So what? And why,
anyway, is quite so much television time currently occupied by advertising
for toothpaste, toothbrushes, denture fixative and so on? Do we pay more
attention to our teeth in the summer?
The claims in those ads are, mostly, merely ludicrous. There are others, for
companies with which many of us are familiar, that may actually turn many
viewers against them. How dare the AA, for example, claim 'To our members
we're the fourth emergency service', thus attempting to appropriate public
esteem for ambulance crews and firemen? Remembering how long you have sat in
the rain waiting for the AA to arrive, this campaign is enough to drive you
into the arms of the RAC. Similarly, if there was any alternative to the
Post Office most of us would surely take it after our experiences in waiting
to buy a few stamps, or being refused a tax disc on a Saturday morning. So
to be told repeatedly that the Post Office is 'part of everyday life' is
enough to make you spit with fury. And what makes anyone imagine that Bob
Hoskins being coy and gnomic, even if he does have the estuary accent which
is now mandatory for commercials, is going to make us use the phone more? We
know what it is already costing us.
Nor is it just a question of service organisations. In view of recent
revelations about The Body Shop, the commercial for American Express which
consists of Anita Roddick being all green and feminist and third world seems
a teeny bit unfortunate. Commercials surely cut both ways. There is little
informational advertising on television: overwhelmingly it is concerned with
brand awareness and market share, and it depends heavily upon the
predisposition of the viewer. If you begin with deep reservations about the
treatment dished out to the public by high street banks or major airlines,
then their television advertising, far from changing your mind, is likely to
reinforce your feelings. Now that Nicole (she with the oh-so-stupid 'Papa')
has allowed us to see her taste in underwear, why should any of us trust her
taste in motor cars?

FT  24 AUG 94 / Arts: Miami City Ballet - Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ballets die each time the curtain falls. Every performance after the first
night is an act of erosion, albeit also one of exploration, as dancers and
public come to understand what the choreography is saying. A revival is an
act of betrayal, as the egos of producers, coaches, dancers, have their way
with the text, declaring that the creator wanted this, that he intended that
 -with no two authorities ever in accord.
How then to preserve ballets, to save masterpieces for the future in
something like their original form? It is a question to which Miami City
Ballet has provided some fascinating answers in its programmes of Balanchine
ballets at the Edinburgh Festival this year. The troupe is only in its ninth
year but it is directed by Edward Villella, a star of Balanchine's company
for two decades. He has transmitted to his artists his reverence for
Balanchine as a creator, together with something of his own power and
vitality as a dancer.
So the company shows Balanchine ballets with a verve and a freshness which
make every step seem vital, restoring that freshness of impetus, that sense
of committed energy, which is the life-blood of the Balanchine manner. They
are not so polished as New York City Ballet casts, but nor do they look as
glossy in manner. For them, dancing Balanchine is a journey of discovery -
of themselves as artists quite as much as of the ballets. They are not
coherently schooled, yet variety of training brings a savour of
individuality to illuminate the choreography. Most important, Villella and
his coaches have inspired casts to dance these masterpieces as if they were
new. And new-minted, freshly exciting is how the ballets looked in
performance last week as the Miami season ended at the Edinburgh Playhouse.
A quadruple bill brought Serenade, Four Temperaments, the Tchaikovsky pas de
deux, and Western Symphony, danced to the hilt. I did not suppose that,
after all these years, Serenade could look so youthful. But Maribel Modrono,
Myrna Kamara, Sally Ann Isaacks and their colleagues darted and sailed on
the music's pulse as if hearing it, and being inspired by it, for the first
time. It was, in the best sense, urgent, and their joy was our joy. Four
Temperaments was strong in flavour, bright in outline. A remarkable young
Chinese dancer, Lin Zhen, sunk deep into the troughs of the Melancholic
variation. Christopher Roman made much of the broken outlines of the
Phlegmatic writing. These performances, and Myrna Kamara's raging force as
the Choleric humour, were authentic, splendid.
What MCB showed us, as it did in its newest acquisition, Western Symphony,
was Balanchine danced with the love, dedication and understanding which can,
despite all the odds, still guarantee the continuing life of choreography in
the theatre. Miami's energies may sometimes seem a little raw, but
Balanchine reproached polite dancers in class by asking: 'What are you
saving yourself for?' Miami's dancers do not save themselves for a second.
They dance for Balanchine, and they are splendid.
The musical standards of this visit have been high, the Royal Scottish
National Orchestra playing each score lovingly under Akira Endo's baton.
MCB's visit was sponsored by Hertz.

Another of those nights when you may be better off with the radio. The final
of the 1994 Brain Of Britain contest is on Radio 4 at 6.30. The finalists
are a biologist, a nurse, a shop assistant and a teacher. When that ends at
7.00, Radio 3 begins the first of today's BBC Proms 1994, relayed live, as
usual, from the Royal Albert Hall. This is a tribute to Basil Cameron, one
of the main conductors of the Proms in the 1940s and 50s. The BBC Symphony
Orchestra under Alexander Lazarev plays the Sibelius 5 and Shostakovich 9 on
either side of John Lill's performance of the Britten Piano Concerto. The
late Prom, at 10.00, features the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra, described as
one of Europe's leading period instrument ensembles. They play works by
Handel, Zelenka, Haydn, and CPE Bach (10.00). Witness reports on Japanese
children who were left with Chinese families at the end of the second world
war when the Russians moved in to liberate Manchuria (9.00 C4). As ever in
The Human Animal Desmond Morris is either showing us how very similar people
are all over the world or how very different they are (9.30 BBC1).

FT  24 AUG 94 / People: Brian Yates: the new consumers' champion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new chairman of the Consumers' Association, publishers of Which? and
related magazines, is Brian Yates, a chartered engineer who runs a division
of a Loughborough company making cranes and lifting systems.
With a brief interruption, Yates, 49, has sat on the Consumers' Association
council since 1986, and has been chairman of the operating company for the
past two years. The opportunity to chair the holding company arose when his
predecessor, Phillip Whitehead, decided to run for the European elections in
June. Both chairmanships are unpaid.
For those who would contend that the 37-year-old association has had its
day, Yates, of course, has a ready answer. 'We may not be testing pop-up
toasters, but our relevance is undiminished,' he contends, pointing out that
there are plenty of battles to be fought on behalf of the consumer
throughout the service industries. While testing will remain an important
part of the association's work, the new chairman is also interested in using
technology to 'improve the delivery of information', for instance, via
interactive terminals at shopping centres.
Yates reckons his manufacturing background is a considerable asset. 'People
often say the association is against the supply side of business. That is
not true.' He has worked at Morris Mechanical Handling for the past 10
years, and is now on the board of the company that was sold to its
management by Trafalgar House in May. He advises companies on ways of
improving productivity through computer automation.
The CA is also poised to choose a new chief executive to succeed John
Beishon, whose controversial term comes to an end when he turns 64 in
November. An announcement is expected next month.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Business and the Environment: Oil-rich refuge of the caribou
 -A look at US/Canadian national park links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The similarity between US oilmen and polar bears is that they both want to
set up camp in Alaska. Beneath the Alaskan coastal plain, where polar bears
make their dens and porcupine caribou calve, lies possibly as much as 9bn
barrels of crude oil.
Proposals under consideration at the US Interior Department indicate that
the Clinton administration is on the side of the polar bears. An internal
memo proposes that the US and Canada 'co-ordinate management' of the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), the 19m-acre Alaskan sanctuary, whose
coastal plain is thought to contain the oil, and the adjacent Vunntut and
Ivvavik Canadian national parks.
Under current legislation, oil companies are prevented from drilling until
ANWR is opened up by Congress. An agreement between the US and Canada to
'twin' their parklands would force companies to consult both countries to
gain access to the area, effectively ending industry's ambitions for the
so-called 1002 fields for a generation.
The plan to link the US refuge in north-east Alaska and Canadian parkland in
Yukon territory is part of an Interior Department options paper drawn up at
the beginning of August. A White House official says the Clinton
administration could support a system of 'co-operative management of
resources in the area' because 'ecosystems spill over boundaries'. It was
stressed that federal land would have to remain under American jurisdiction.
Oil companies still hope to gain access to the fields in the longer term and
oppose any move that would obstruct the future development of arctic
reserves. Tom Koch, a spokesman for British Petroleum, says the company
'would prefer the US to maintain the opportunity to take future decisions on
energy security'.
BP and Chevron Corporation of the US, which together have drilled the only
well in the ANWR, have not disclosed how much oil they believe to be in the
1002 fields. Industry estimates vary, with the most modest forecast for 500m
barrels.
The more common figure of 9bn barrels is plausible: the 1002 reserves are
understood to be part of the same geological formation as the Alaskan
Prudhoe Bay field, the biggest US reserve, which has exceeded the original
9.6bn barrel forecast and produced nearly 11bn barrels.
It is not only the petroleum industry which is resisting the proposal for
twin management of Canadian and US federal land. Alaskan state governor
Walter J. Hickel says: 'It is unthinkable that the Department of Interior
would proceed with a proposal such as this one without consulting the State
of Alaska.'
Responding to the suggestion that the federal government could include ANWR
in a World Heritage Park, Hickel says: 'This is exactly the kind of
unilateral federal decision-making that we fought for statehood over.'
Principles of the constitution are not all that is at stake - the oil
industry promises jobs. Oil production from Prudhoe Bay is declining, from
738m barrels in 1988 to 627m barrels in 1992. The American Petroleum
Institute claims that exploration and production on the Alaskan coastal
plain fields may generate as many as 735,000 jobs.
Environmental campaigners argue that estimated economic benefits do not
justify putting America's last undisturbed natural habitat at risk.
Industrial development would threaten the 180,000-strong porcupine caribou
herd that migrates across the coastal plain and into Canada twice a year,
they say.
It would have the knock-on effect of destroying the Guich'in community, the
indigenous people whose subsistence and culture is based on the porcupine
caribou. 'It is one of the unfortunate accidents of fate,' says Scott Kearin
of the Alaska Wilderness League, 'that an area the oil industry thinks is
very promising can't be developed without destroying the caribou herd.
Caribou will never calve in an area that looks like New Jersey.'
Twinning the refuge and the Canadian national parks is a proposal most
environmentalists would like to see adopted, even though it does not meet
their ultimate target of getting wilderness designation (which prohibits any
future industrial development) for the ANWR coastal plain.
What they fear, however, is that the proposal will be linked with a lift on
the export ban of Prudhoe Bay oil which is currently before Congress. The
Clinton administration is understood to support lifting the ban, which would
create an expanding market at a time of depleting reserves.

FT  24 AUG 94 / People: BBC beams in two finance men
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC has brought in two new finance directors to help it fulfil its
ambition to become a major international broadcaster in the satellite age.
Tony Kay, formerly deputy finance director of Granada/LWT International, has
been appointed finance director of the newly-created BBC Worldwide TV, and
Andrew Hind, director of finance at Barnardos, is joining the BBC World
Service as finance and commercial director.
They both come under the umbrella of BBC Worldwide which was established in
May and is headed by Bob Phillis, the BBC's deputy director-general, who is
known for his interest in tight financial controls.
The aim of the new structure is to provide a fully co-ordinated approach for
the first time to the BBC's international and commercial activities. BBC
Worldwide has three separate divisions: Worldwide TV which is responsible
for programme sales, co-productions and the BBC's news and non-news
channels; Worldwide Publishing; and the World Service, the international
radio service funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
Jeff Hazell, who was at World Service TV, has been appointed director of
channel sales and marketing of BBC Worldwide TV. However, it is not clear
whether a role will be found in the new organisation for Christopher Irwin,
the former chief executive of World Service TV, the forerunner of BBC
Worldwide TV. The BBC said yesterday that Irwin was still on leave and
refused to comment on speculation that he would receive substantial
compensation for loss of job.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Business and the Environment: The chips are down - A look at
the growing controversy surrounding Chile's booming forestry industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the rain is not lashing down, the noise can be heard quite clearly  - a
faint rumbling punctuated by thuds. It is the sound of the Forestal del Sur
woodchip plant in the rough-and-tumble town of Puerto Montt, southern Chile,
grinding up thousands of logs into chips for export to Japan.
It is also the sound of controversy. For of all the sectors of Chile's
booming forestry industry - which includes pulp and paper, logs, planks and
furniture - it is the woodchip manufacturers that have provoked most ire
among environmentalists. Chippers are accused of creating an unsustainable
demand for native forests which, say critics, are shrinking daily.
Last year, of the Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 800m) earned by forestry exports,
woodchips represented Dollars 137m. Most chips, later turned into products
such as writing paper, come from native forests.
Chile's forestry sector has grown rapidly since the mid-1970s when the
government began to subsidise man-made forests. An almost insignificant
industry 15 years ago, forestry now counts for 13 per cent of exports,
second only to copper.
But it was not until the late 1980s that chip exports took off. Jose
Augustin Ramirez, law faculty professor at Valdivia University, says the
impact has only been felt in the last few years and believes the government
must act now to save Chile's woodlands. He says Chileans over-estimate the
abundance of forests, which have not yet been properly catalogued. A World
Bank-funded study of reserves is not expected to be ready for three years.
Ramirez says that 11 per cent of Chilean territory is forested, compared
with 21 per cent in the US and 63 per cent in Japan. He favours restricting
the industry to man-made forests and banning the exploitation of native
trees.
Claudio Donoso, professor of forestry at the same university, says a
moratorium is 'extremist', calling instead for the strict management of
resources using pruning and rotation techniques.
Donoso claims that Conaf, the Chilean forestry corporation, lacks the
regulatory teeth to control the industry properly. Furthermore, Conaf is
responsible not only for the protection of woodlands, but also for their
industrial development, a dual function which many critics find perverse.
In theory, landowners cannot cut down trees without Conaf permission in the
form of a 'plan of operation'. But Donoso is scathing about such plans,
describing them as 'absolutely useless - just a licence to cut down trees'.
At Conaf in Puerto Montt, Carlos Alberto Ritter, technical department chief,
admits that 'plans of operation' are a blunt tool. Conaf technicians agree
the plans with landowners using criteria designed to prevent soil erosion,
but not on the basis of the rarity or beauty of the woodlands. 'We have no
legal authority to say: 'Don't cut it.' In this respect the law is
inadequate,' he says.
Neither can the small Conaf office in Puerto Montt adequately monitor the
vast 10th Region. Given the poor quality of roads, often impassable in
winter, Ritter admits that Conaf's 16 staff and fleet of road-weary vehicles
are little match for the task. Last year alone, Ritter's office handed out
Dollars 1m in fines to 300 landowners caught felling trees illegally. Only 5
per cent has been collected, he says.
However, Ritter says that chippers are only a small part of what is an old
problem, consuming around 10 per cent of cut wood each year. Sixty per cent
is destined for firewood.
Mauricio Fierro, an environmental activist, counters that the Chilean chip
industry is relatively young. If left unchecked, its damaging effects are
likely to spread uncontrollably, he says.
Javier Ovalle, manager of the Puerto Montt division of Forestal del Sur,
defends his industry's environmental record, saying it is 'entirely feasible
to exploit native forest in a sustainable manner'. He argues that
responsible exploitation actually improves tree quality by pruning away bad
wood, a view shared by some Conaf officials.
Forestal del Sur, in common with most chip manufacturers, does not own
native forest but supplies its needs by buying wood from local landowners.
Critics say this is a convenient way of avoiding blame for any destruction.
The company, which takes delivery of wood 24 hours a day, exports 650,000
tonnes of chips a year, earning around Dollars 35m.
Ovalle believes most private landowners are managing their forests
responsibly, mainly thanks to Conaf's educational drive. 'All of our
suppliers have a plan of operation approved by Conaf.'
He says that controversy surrounding the use of woodlands, among Chilean and
Japanese consumers, means the industry will have to shift towards using wood
from plantations. 'This is a shame because you have lost the chance to
manage the native forest,' he says.
The forestry industry argues that if laws or consumer pressure render
forested land uneconomic, owners will simply cut down all their trees and
convert land to a profitable activity such as cattle rearing.
The controversy over woodchip producers is just part of a broader battle
being waged between environmentalists and the forestry industry. Even the
owners of Chile's 1.6m hectares of man-made forests - who argue that they
have improved the environment by planting pine and eucalyptus - have not
been immune from attack. Critics say native forests are often cleared to
make way for plantations and that monocultures bring the danger of disease.
Much of the debate has been transferred to parliament where legislation to
protect native forests has spent years crawling through committees. The
eventual bill will probably opt for the controlled use of woodland, allowing
a certain percentage of trees to be cut each year.
Industrial lobbyists argue that the imposition of onerous restrictions could
render their businesses unprofitable, costing thousands of jobs and millions
of dollars in exports. Juan Moya, Conaf director, says Chile cannot act as
if it were a rich country. It must make use of its resources, he says.
On the other side of the debate, Ramirez believes that defenders of
woodlands should have spoken earlier and louder. 'The problem with native
forests is that if you wait too long, there's nothing left to protect,' he
says.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Management: Dreaming at the top - Belmiro de Azevedo rose
from a poor village background to be chairman of the Sonae group /
Euromanager to Watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'My head is in the clouds but my feet are firmly on the ground,' says
Belmiro de Azevedo. The management philosophy of one of Portugal's most
successful businessmen is rooted in the down-to-earth values of the poor
village where he was born and the capacity to dream that helped him climb to
the top.
By drawing on the spontaneity, aggressiveness and frugality that
characterised his background, Azevedo has built the Sonae group into
Portugal's biggest private-sector conglomerate, with 1993 sales of Es228bn
(Dollars 1.4bn). The company was an almost bankrupt chipboard producer with
an annual turnover of only Es5m when he was taken on as a researcher in
1965.
Azevedo, 56, tempers Latin passion with a dedication to education and a
determination to rise above local horizons and take a global view. Partly
thanks to his efforts, Portuguese management style is no longer a pejorative
term used to describe sleepy, family-run businesses unaware of international
competitors until it is too late.
The son of a carpenter from a village near Oporto, Azevedo was given a job
at Sonae soon after graduating as a chemical engineer. The owner was
president of the sports club where Azevedo made a name for himself as a
handball player. The young graduate turned the business around and was
rewarded with equity.
As he expanded the group, Azevedo succeeded to the chairmanship, becoming
principal shareholder along the way. He is now thought to be the third
richest man in Portugal, owning assets worth an estimated Es105bn. Sonae's
industrial arm is still focused on wood-based products, a sector where the
group dominates the Iberian market and has ambitions to become a European
leader.
But a perceptive move into distribution in 1982 took it into an altogether
bigger league. 'Portugal was in the stone age in terms of retailing and an
explosion was imminent,' says Azevedo. Sonae's supermarket and hypermarket
chains now lead the Portuguese market and account for 82 per cent of group
turnover. Sonae's other core activity is commercial real estate.
Normally on the offensive, Azevedo is currently playing a defensive role in
Portugal's biggest takeover battle. Led by Sonae, the core shareholders of
Banco Portugues do Atlantico, the country's second largest bank, are
fighting a bid by Banco Comercial Portugues, the fifth largest, to acquire a
controlling stake of 40 per cent of BPA.
Family was the first nest of Portuguese management tradition that Azevedo
flew. His own appointment and promotion was based on merit and he enforces
the same policy. 'A sense that people will rise just because they are family
members is the worst possible climate for a corporation,' he says.
'Following the northern Portuguese custom would make it very difficult for
Sonae to motivate the best managers.'
However, Azevedo does follow his executives' progress with fatherly concern.
Sonae has no human resources division for its 8,790 employees. But Azevedo
devotes considerable time to personally guiding the careers of the group's
top 100 managers. He is keen to ensure that each manager is in the position
where his or her abilities are best put to use. As a result, Sonae has a
reputation as a management school equal to any of the specialised academic
institutions that have recently emerged in Portugal.
Small as Sonae was when Azevedo joined, the company exported to more than 60
countries and he spent three months a year travelling abroad. The
international outlook he gained is another quality that distinguishes Sonae
from many Portuguese companies. 'We approach strategic and organisational
issues in global, regional and local terms and strive to be at the cutting
edge of technology at an international level,' Azevedo says.
Such is his drive to dominate trends affecting the group that there are
often more Sonae managers at international business conferences on relevant
issues than all the other delegates put together. One result was that
supermarkets in Portugal were unexpectedly the first in Europe to have every
checkout equipped with a scanner.
Education helped Azevedo rise above his background and today it is one of
the assets most valued by Sonae. Azevedo himself spends two to three hours a
day studying the latest management thinking and attends courses around the
world. Dedication to self-improvement is a feature of the Sonae culture and
managers are encouraged to spend time teaching at universities, as Azevedo
did during his early career.
Azevedo supports academic learning with the common sense values of his
upbringing. These tell him, for example, that much current management
writing is 'bunk, old-hat or repetitive'.
Outside the office, he most enjoys conversing with the small farmers who
live near his modest farmhouse. Frugality is a hallmark of Sonae and the
successful leveraging of resources has played an important role in the
group's expansion.
Emotion is also a vital element of Azevedo's management style. 'You can't
take a purely scientific approach to innovation. You must have dreams and
visions as well,' he says. 'I think Latin managers have more flair for this.
The margin of error is higher but they are more aggressive in pursuing new
ideas.'
Azevedo's own combativeness partly stems from a lifelong passion for sport.
He says he is addicted to the 90-minute workout that begins his day. 'We can
be aggressive with each other in Sonae. If you are too polite the message
sometimes doesn't come across as it should.' The right degree of stress is
important, too. 'I don't know of anyone who has broken a world record while
they were training,' he says.
Azevedo is reluctant to acknowledge criticism that his own pugnacity has, in
the past, led to a despotic approach to running Sonae. Today, he says, he is
involved in less than 10 per cent of decision-making. Associates commend him
for recognising his assertive traits and building mechanisms of control and
delegation into Sonae that protect the group from any dictatorial
inclinations.
Four months' absence following an operation last year showed Azevedo that
Sonae could prosper without him. It has also taught him that he can afford
to spend less time on close control of day-to-day affairs and devote more to
strategic thinking. 'I used to spend about three hours a day taking calls or
writing to people,' he says, 'now I've cut it down to 20 minutes.' More time
for dreaming . . . with his feet on the ground.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Management: Dissection of the professional firm - Book
Review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles Handy, Tom Peters and other management gurus have a habit of
pointing to the professional service firm as one of the most instructive
models for the business of the future. But definitive literature on the
species, and its management problems, remains sparse.
Accountants, lawyers, architects, consultants and other professions arranged
as partnerships are significant employers, revenue generators and
influence-formers around the world. Yet - partly because of their own
secrecy - they are rarely analysed.
An exception is the work of David Maister, a US-based consultant and former
academic who over the past decade has become one of the world's few
commentators on the subject. His Managing the Professional Service Firm*,
just published in Europe, provides useful and readable insights - in spite
of some drawbacks.
The book's style reflects Maister's frequent oral presentations in his work
as a consultant to professional firms. Much is honed into simplistic but
memorable alliterative 'rules of three'.
Hence firms are about service, satisfaction and success; client benefits
relate to expertise, experience and efficiency. In a phrase borrowed from
medicine, the most important priorities are availability, affability and
ability - in that order.
Borrowing an image from social science research, Maister says most firms are
either 'farmers' specialising in particular areas, or 'hunter-gatherers' in
a constant search for new sources of meat (types of work), whatever these
may be.
Many firms still believe they are offering high-value, top-level 'brain
surgery' to clients while their clients, by contrast, increasingly view the
services they offer as more those of the 'chemist shop'.
Moreover, he argues that many firms have maintained profitability by
focusing on short-term 'hygiene' performance measures (such as staff
utilisation, boosted by sacking staff) rather than on long-term 'health'
measures (such as fees per hour).
Maister manages to bring off his analysis without the worst excesses of
guru-speak. He includes some pertinent personal and self-deprecatory
stories, valuable expertise from his consulting work, and a few references
to other specialist writers.
He talks about the systematic failure by firms to delegate more to junior
staff; the fact that professionals tend to be more geared to their own
values than what the client might want; and that the difficulty
professionals have with marketing themselves is less of a 'marketing
problem' than the result of inadequate management to create the
opportunities for the effective sale of services.
One value of the book is that Maister is able to appeal to the widest
audience of different types of firms and is able to draw on their varying
experiences.
But this is also a weakness. While there are clearly many parallels, there
are also a good number of differences between the types of firm: in size,
structure, culture, market, willingness to change and so on. Maister makes
little attempt to highlight these.
Irritatingly, he rarely gives named examples, blaming the need to retain
confidentiality to clients. Some of his material on particular organisations
is also outdated.
In spite of that, he does provide useful analysis of several firms that are
commonly held to be well managed: Arthur Andersen, Goldman Sachs, Hewitt
Associates, Latham &amp; Watkins and McKinsey. He describes them all as
'one-firm firms' with a single structure, identity and method of operation.
The staff and partners are characterised by their loyalty, teamwork and hard
work, for downplaying stardom and generating a sense of mission.
The book's principal weakness, other than its rather banal tables and
graphics, is that it is essentially a compilation of articles - some written
as long ago as 1981 - rather than something specially written and coherently
structured.
He admits that a few years ago, friends told him his clients were saying:
'Oh yeah, we've had Maister in and heard his stuff. What else has he got?'
His next book should prove the real test of whether he has an answer to
that.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Recruitment: Tired corporate bodies reject new blood - Many
organisations are not tapping the drive and enthusiasm of graduates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The seasonal emergence of thousands of university graduates on to the jobs
market has initiated the annual debate among recruiters about their
respective merits.
Typically, this appears as a series of gripes and moans about the graduates'
quality and commitment. Graduates are either too complacent, too confident
or too timid. It seems that they cannot win, no matter how they approach
their job applications and interviews.
Once through the door, full of vigour, eager to prove themselves, how often
do they find themselves reined in and told they must walk before they can
run? How many have their confidence undermined by older hands ready to focus
on mistakes but sparing with praise when a job is well done?
These are some of the comments collected by a Glasgow-based employment
consultancy. A graduate working in consulting said: 'I joined the company
and I had a brilliant training course and then I just wasn't given anything
to do. There were a load of us who were all assigned together and, all
right, we had a good laugh, sat there playing cards all day, but it's not
really how you anticipate spending your first months with a company.'
Another said: 'Something I found quite strange was that the whole idea of
recruiting externally was to bring bright new blood in, new ideas. But
anybody who goes against conventional ideas and traditions finds it just
works against them. It's very much a case of don't rock the boat and you'll
do fine.'
Such negative experiences are far too common, according to Yellowbrick, the
consultancy which collected them. Instead of focusing on the merits of
graduates, it has chosen to study the different approaches towards their
employment. The resulting report - Delivering the Promise - concludes that
many organisations have become complacent about the recruitment of graduates
and do too little to maximise their potential.
The company conducted interviews with graduate recruits and personnel
departments in 15 private and public sector organisations, reflecting a
broad sectoral spread and which between them were responsible for recruiting
some 2,000 graduates a year.
It found that selecting graduates is an expensive business. A recruitment
cost of Pounds 25,000 per graduate is a realistic figure, says the report,
although estimates among different employers ranged from Pounds 5,000 at the
lower end to as much as Pounds 40,000.
When salary, training and overhead costs are included, a new graduate will
cost an employer in excess of Pounds 100,000 over the first three years,
says Yellowbrick.
You might expect, with that kind of outlay, companies would give the same
thought to developing their graduates as to a new product range. Instead,
many employers appear to take the view that graduates are wet behind the
ears and know nothing. Whether it has anything to do with the generation gap
or fading memories of youth, some managers continue to harbour resentment,
even hostility, towards the product of universities.
The result in such workplaces is that enthusiasm and drive are less likely
to be tapped than drained away. But why recruit them at all if your approach
is the corporate equivalent of putting bromide in the tea?
The report says graduates are recruited for three basic reasons: their
future potential and prospects in senior management; their intelligence and
knowledge to do an immediate job; and for their injection of new ideas and
energy.
In spite of this, companies often fail to live up to the expectations of
graduates, sometimes leading to disillusionment, an early move and a loss to
the employer of the front-end investment in their careers. If companies
portray themselves at the recruitment stage as fast moving and dynamic and
fail to deliver this image in reality, they can expect a negative response
from their graduates, says Yellowbrick.
The report finds that those companies which expect a lot of their graduate
recruits receive the highest returns in terms of performance.
'Graduates arrive at an organisation with up to date knowledge, fresh
creative potential, yet often this is ignored because the ideas may be put
across in the wrong way,' says Colin Graham, a Yellowbrick partner. 'The
challenge is to help these recruits communicate their ideas in a way that
can benefit the employer.'
He adds: 'We asked every company when they expected the graduate make a
significant contribution. Between six and 18 months was the standard reply
but one company we went to replied: 'Day two''.
This meant that on their second day in their new job a group of young
recruits would be given a project brief and budget of up to Pounds 100,000.
Graham commends the approach: 'Graduates come to their new jobs with high
expectations and these play an important part in their performance,
attitudes and habits.'
Since, according to a Department of Employment study, graduates spend, on
average, only three years in their first job, it perhaps makes sense to make
the most of them without delay.
While Graham concedes graduates would require further training specific to
the particular job - sometimes because they need professional qualifications
 -the research had found the longer graduates were treated as trainees, the
more likely they were to act as trainees.
Prof Charles Handy, whose books on the organisation of work have inspired
new approaches to employment and management, says in support of the
findings: 'It has always seemed amazing to me that companies go to a lot of
trouble to recruit the brightest of the bright and do nothing to use their
brightness.'
One of the main reasons for under performance of graduates, says the report,
was poor management. 'They should be assigned to competent professional
managers who can give them responsibility while at the same time extending
them the support they need,' says Graham, who advises companies to carry out
regular appraisals. 'Graduates are used to continuous appraisal and they
find it a useful source of encouragement.'
Apart from its criticisms, the report found good practices worth
highlighting. It identified SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceutical group,
and GKN, the engineering company, as having particularly effective graduate
development policies. The cream of the SmithKline Beecham graduates from its
worldwide recruitment is channelled into a fast track programme.
This allows them to tour its international offices and plants, developing
new ideas and reporting directly to the main board.
The top two or three trainees from this group will then be promoted to a
comparatively senior post, something like the post of marketing director of
a Latin American subsidiary, in their mid 20s.
The report points out that companies such as GKN which take a long-term
strategic view towards graduate employment have had far better results from
their training programmes than those which turn their recruitment on and off
with short-term economic fluctuations.
Unless companies approach their graduate recruitment in an organised,
structured way they can only blame themselves if they see their promising
youngsters walking out of the door to a competitor at the first opportunity.
It is not simply lost investment, it can also be a loss to a company's
reputation. Word about employment conditions soon gets around among young
people with fresh university networks. Those new graduates may prove to be
your best job advertisements for next year's crop. Respect their
achievements, put them to good use and do it quickly.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Blood centres under threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of blood transfusion centres in England will be cut from 15 to 10
under reorganisation proposals announced yesterday.
Officials of the National Blood Authority said the cuts would lead to a
small number of job losses - but unions said more than 1,000 of the
service's 5,200 staff were at risk.
A strategic review of blood services has produced 35 proposals aimed at
increasing efficiency and improving the supply of blood products to the
National Health Service. These include managing the service around three
administrative zones based in London, Bristol and Leeds, and organising
stockholding so that hospitals receive emergency deliveries within two
hours.
Under the proposals testing and processing of blood would be consolidated at
10 centres. Lancaster, Plymouth, Liverpool, Oxford and Brentwood, in Essex,
would eventually be amalgamated with other centres.
Mr John Adey, chief executive of the authority, said consolidation at fewer
centres would allow more efficient use of new technology and specialist
staff, and enhance safety and quality procedures.
Formal consultation on the proposals will start next month but Mr Kevin
Greene, national officer of Unison, the public service union, said it was
'clear that the key decisions about closure have already been taken'.
He said unions were worried that the proposals were driven by a need to cut
costs and might put public safety at risk. Centres operated on narrow
margins of supply and the closure of facilities was a 'highly risky game'.
Mr Adey said the proposed amalgamations of centres would not affect the
deployment of mobile teams around the country.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Ghost Towns: Merry Hill puts high street in shade - The
second in a series on urban centres examines the shopping complex's impact
on middle England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The heart of Stourbridge beats slower in the 1990s than it did in the 1980s.
The arrival of the Merry Hill shopping centre two miles away threatened
commercial seizure, but the worst fears for the town's health have not been
realised.
'We've learned to live with it,' said Mr Terry Pigott, a Stourbridge butcher
and president of the local chamber of trade. 'In some ways you've had to
change and get your act right to survive.'
The presence of one of the largest shopping centres in Europe - now drawing
to it an office population and a small entertainment quarter including
cinemas, restaurants, wine bars and a hotel - has nevertheless led to
significant change in the economic scenery of the Black Country.
Stourbridge used to act as a market town for north-west Worcestershire and
south Staffordshire. Its south side was upmarket residential, its north more
industrial. Gradually it was embraced by the sprawling Black Country to
become the affluent south-western edge of the Birmingham-Black Country
conurbation.
The town sends a Conservative, Mr Warren Hawksley, to Westminster with a
comfortable 9,582 majority, and has one Tory councillor and one Labour on
the local borough council. It has an unemployment rate below the average for
the conurbation, the region and the nation. Stourbridge is prosperous middle
England.
But two miles from the town centre, in an area of defeated industry and
redevelopment concessions, shopping started to appear. On the site of what
was once the Round Oak steelworks Merry Hill shopping centre and its
adjacent developments cover an area the size of Coventry city centre.
Roger Tym, consultants, calculate in a report for the government that
between 1989 and 1993 Stourbridge lost 43 per cent of its West Midlands
market share for comparison shopping - items such as clothing and footwear.
The overweening presence of Merry Hill intensified the problems retailers
faced from recession.
Investment has dried up. The Owen Owen department store closed in 1990 and
no other operator has been interested enough to take the space. Between 1989
and 1992 shop rents fell an average 26 per cent, according to Tym.
Mr Pigott - whose shop is in the Crown Centre in the middle of town - said:
'Merry Hill has probably stopped people investing and moving into a town
like Stourbridge - you'd move where you haven't got competition on your
doorstep.'
Mr John Mainwaring, assistant chief planning officer at Dudley Borough
Council, whose area embraces both Merry Hill and Stourbridge, said the town
had been affected 'because it is an area of high mobility and wealth.
Instead of driving to Stourbridge, people have been driving to Merry Hill.'
Stourbridge retailers were incensed last year when the borough council
introduced car parking charges - a modest 30p an hour in a multi-storey.
Parking is free at Merry Hill.
The next squabble with the council will be over pedestrianisation in the
town centre, a frequent response by planners to the diminished popularity of
a shopping area. Noting surveys of shoppers' attitudes, Mr Mainwaring said:
'The majority wanted extended pedestrianisation but the retailers fought
against it. They want people to be able to park outside the shops.'
But the interests of the retailers are not necessarily paramount. Mr
Hawksley said: 'There must be a balance between those who benefit from Merry
Hill and the traders who lose out.'
The expansion of Merry Hill has provided new recreational facilities. The
cinemas in Stourbridge closed long ago.
Still, amateur dramatics can be seen at the town hall, and Mr Graham Hart,
deputy editor of the Stourbridge News, said: 'Stourbridge has a live music
scene. There are a lot of pubs. If you walk through at night they're
normally very well supported. But there is nothing for the young to do
except the pubs - and Merry Hill.'
Yet this shift in the pattern of consumer spending from a traditional centre
to a new complex, not unlike the malls in the US, does not spell the end of
Stourbridge. It will remain what Mr Mainwaring said it had been for the last
two decades, 'a well-heeled commuter town'.
The Tym report says that 'at the local level much can be achieved to
alleviate the worst of the adverse effects of major developments such as
Merry Hill by means of local town-centre management and environmental
improvements'.
For Stourbridge that means easing the throttling tightness of the ring road
with its three lanes of speeding traffic. Resuscitation presupposes the
ability to breathe.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Halifax acts on confusion over mortgage indemnity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest mortgage lender, has moved to
clarify its mortgage indemnity policies by underlining that they do not
directly benefit the borrower.
The change follows an attack on mortgage indemnity policies by Union
Finance, a Southend-based financial adviser, which said that the policies
could be interpreted to read that the borrower was indemnified.
Most borrowers who take loans of 75 per cent or more of the value of a
property have to pay for mortgage indemnity. The policy covers the lender
against losing money should the house be sold for less than the outstanding
loan.
From the beginning of next month Halifax mortgage indemnity policies will be
called 'additional mortgage security' and the premiums payable by borrowers
are to be called additional mortgage security fees.
The society said that the renaming had been planned before Union Finance's
challenge to the lenders' interpretation of the policies.
Lenders and insurers say that borrowers have no right to protection under
mortgage indemnity policies if they cannot pay their mortgage, even though
they pay for the cover.
Halifax said yesterday: 'Our new definitions should make home buyers more
aware of what the policy actually means. It insures the lender, not the
borrower.'
In a fact sheet sent out to mortgage advisers the society says that
customers may misunderstand what mortgage indemnity means.
It says: 'This type of additional security is solely for the protection of
the society with the costs being met by the customer, who benefits by having
access to higher levels of borrowing than would otherwise be available.'
Union Finance is charging Pounds 300 to advise home-owners on how to take
advantage of the 'loophole' it says it has identified.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Investment rises in manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturing investment rose in the past quarter for the first time in two
years, official figures showed yesterday, fuelling hopes that the
improvement in the industrial sector might be feeding through to a growth in
investment.
The rise occurred although official data released on Monday showed that
overall investment in the economy fell in the second quarter of the year,
compared with the first quarter.
The seasonally adjusted provisional estimate of manufacturers' capital
spending in the three months to June was 4 per cent higher than in the three
months to March, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
Some analysts suggested that the growth might indicate a turning point in
the manufacturing sector. In the past five years manufacturing investment
has fallen about 30 per cent, after falling steadily from the peak it
reached in 1989.
But with the past quarter's improvement in manufacturing investment still
lagging a long way behind the overall growth in manufacturing output,
yesterday's figures suggested that the investment picture remained patchy.
Manufacturing investment in the second quarter of this year was 2 per cent
higher compared with the same period last year, the CSO said. Measured on an
annual basis, however, the level of capital spending in the year to June was
3 per cent lower than in the year to June last year.
The data showed distinct differences in the type of investment on a sectoral
basis. Spending on plant and machinery, which accounts for the bulk of
manufacturing investment, rose 3.4 per cent in the second quarter compared
with the first quarter.
However, spending on plant and machinery was 1 per cent lower in the second
quarter compared with the same period a year ago, and on an annual basis
spending fell 5 per cent in the year to June, compared with the previous
year.
Spending on vehicles rose 8 per cent in the year to June compared with the
previous year, while spending on buildings rose 4 per cent.
On a sectoral basis, the figures showed that the solid and nuclear fuels and
oil refinery sector fell sharply over the year, with spending in the second
quarter of this year 31 per cent lower than in the same period a year ago.
Spending in the chemicals, metals and non-metallic minerals sector also fell
over the year, in spite of a small rise in the past quarter. Spending in
this sector was 5.6 per cent lower in the second quarter of the year,
compared with the same period a year ago.
Spending in the machinery, electrical and transport sector was 1.7 per cent
higher in the second quarter of the year compared with the same period a
year ago.
Separate data released by the CSO yesterday showed that manufacturers
reduced their stocks by Pounds 57m in the past quarter, after a sharp rise
in stocks in the first quarter of the year.
The level of work in progress among manufacturers rose Pounds 115m in the
second quarter, after rising Pounds 182m in the first quarter of this year.
Retailers' stocks rose in the second quarter of the year, after falling back
in the first three months. Wholesalers' stocks rose for the second
successive quarter.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Poorest 'lose out' in benefit reforms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The unemployed and students were among the biggest losers of benefits after
social security reforms, according to a report yesterday by the London
School of Economics for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.
It says most families with children gained from the changes brought in after
the 1986 Social Security Act, while nearly half of all single-parent
families and claimants without children saw their income fall.
The report says the reforms will lead to an increase in the social security
budget as more people are now aware that they can claim benefit.
But it says the reforms fail in their aim to target benefits more
effectively on the poor. The disposable income of income-support and
housing-benefit recipients has fallen by 10 per cent in real terms.
Of the poorest fifth of the population, 46 per cent are worse off because:
Income support is less generous than previous systems.
Students and young people aged 16 to 18 are no longer entitled to benefit.
The replacement of the social fund with a system of loans and grants is
equivalent to a 2 per cent cut in benefits.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Bottomley in row on private healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday forecast an increase
in private care in the National Health Service, but played down the prospect
of greater independence for trusts.
Her remarks prompted an angry response from Labour, which said that the
government was accelerating its drive to privatise the NHS.
Mrs Bottomley's comments followed a suggestion by Mr Peter Griffiths, the
former deputy chief executive of the NHS, that health trusts should be given
greater independence.
Mr Griffiths, who is now director of the King's Fund College, an independent
medical training organisation, told BBC Radio that trusts could become
'non-profit-making organisations with the right kind of social ethos'.
Mrs Bottomley said greater independence for trusts was 'certainly not on my
agenda'. Trusts should be 'accountable to the secretary of state, and to
local health authorities'.
She said there was no reason why devolution of control to local level should
ultimately lead to independence for health trusts.
'I think the model works extremely well. It is showing results. We don't
foresee wholesale upheaval having once established the trusts across the
country,' she said.
However, Mrs Bottomley said the private or voluntary sector could sometimes
provide a better deal for patients than the state sector.
'If the private sector can give a better deal for patients, then I welcome
it,' she said. 'Where the private or public sector mean we can go further
faster, provide an additional service, that is something we should certainly
embrace.'
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's health spokesman, said that Mrs Bottomley's
comments confirmed that the government was trying to fragment the health
service.
He told her in a letter: 'The NHS is being sold off in parts, with the most
lucrative segments on sale to the highest bidder.'

FT  24 AUG 94 / Post office closure claims rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Federation of Sub-Postmasters yesterday denied that government
plans to sell 51 per cent of the Royal Mail and Parcelforce to the private
sector would lead inevitably to the closure of many post offices.
Mr Colin Baker, the federation's general secretary, said that there was 'no
evidence whatsoever' that the sale would result in widespread closures.
His statement came as the Labour party released the results of a survey of
500 of the country's 19,000 local postmasters and postmistresses. Mr Robin
Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the people who ran post
office branches believed by a majority of five to one that the government
would be wrong to break up the organisation.
By a majority of three to one they thought privatisation would force more
small post offices to close, he said.
Mr Baker said the federation was concerned about 'blatant scaremongering
stories of massive sub-office closures' and felt it vital that such rumours
should be scotched.
But he acknowledged that the organisation, which represents Britain's
sub-postmasters and postmistresses, had concerns about separating the parts
of the system.
He said there were still 'many questions' to be answered arising from this
year's government green paper, relating particularly to automation and the
future size of the post office network.
Mr Cook said that post office users did not want to see the organisation
sold off as a private business.
Referring to a tour he had made recently of British post offices, he said he
had not met such universal hostility to a government plan since the poll
tax.
In an attempt to engender misgivings about the government's proposals among
Conservative MPs nursing shaky majorities, he said opposition was 'as strong
in Tory Kent as in Labour Tyneside'.
Mr John Roberts, chairman of Post Office Counters, said that the post
offices network was not at risk, adding that the Post Office warmly welcomed
the government's pledge that the link between a privatised Royal Mail and
post offices would be guaranteed in law.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Potato growers' rebellion defeated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rebel potato growers who wanted to expose the industry to market forces
overnight have been overwhelmingly defeated in a poll of the country's
15,000 producers.
Growers voted by 81 per cent to 19 per cent to keep the Potato Marketing
Board for the next three years while the industry discusses its successor.
Mr John Heading, the board's chairman, said: 'This is a victory for common
sense, but also a strong mandate for change through the PMB. As a potato
grower myself I am well aware of the need for a national organisation to
look after our collective interest in highly competitive, unregulated
markets.'
The board's future had been in question since 420 growers called the poll
last month, saying that the 60-year-old board had outlived its usefulness
and should be abolished.
Mr Graham Solari, chairman of the rebel Potato Producer Poll Campaign, said
he would press his supporters to back the board in its three-year transition
to the open market.
He said: 'The PMB have moved their position considerably . . . in that their
expectations of the costs of operating the scheme have been considerably
reduced.'
The dispute over the board was triggered by last November's government
decision to scrap its principal function - supporting prices in a glut  -
and to wind it up in 1997.
Rebel growers, unhappy about the levies they pay to the board, demanded that
it be scrapped so the industry could set up a 'lean and efficient'
organisation for potato promotion and research.
Mr Heading said the board would be planning the successor body, reducing the
levy progressively from Pounds 48 a hectare to no more than Pounds 35, and
trimming services and staff.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Oftel backs cable groups in phone war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cable industry has won a significant victory which should help it to
gain telephone subscribers from British Telecommunications.
The Office of Telecommunications has decided that BT subscribers who decide
to move to cable operators for their telecommunications services should be
able to take their old telephone number with them. An announcement is
expected from Oftel today.
The cable companies, many of them large North American telephone groups,
have been installing nearly 25,000 new telephone lines a month in the UK
this year. But the fact that subscribers had to change their number when
they moved to a cable service has been seen as a considerable barrier,
particularly for business users.
Oftel is responding to a formal application from Videotron, one of the
largest cable operators with franchises in London, Southampton and
Winchester. Similar applications have been submitted by other groups.
As an interim measure BT will be asked to provide call-forwarding until
number portability starts, but it is not clear who will pay for this.
BT said yesterday: 'We are surprised at the piecemeal approach that Oftel is
taking.'
The Cable Television Association yesterday welcomed the change, which it
believed would be important in the business market.
The CTA said: 'The business market is the most lucrative and the least
likely to change numbers.'
Cable companies say that they can offer discounts of more than 10 per cent
on telecommunications services, and by the start of July had installed more
than 460,000 lines.
Oftel yesterday also published a study suggesting that a significant number
of telephone company staff were unaware of fair trading rules.
Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said: 'There are many more
telephone companies competing for customers than there used to be. This
study was about whether any of the behaviour of these telephone companies
was anti-competitive.'
No evidence was found of anti-competitive pricing in breach of licence
conditions. Although some examples of inaccurate or misleading information
were discovered, there was nothing systematic.
Mr Cruickshank made it clear, however, that he wanted companies to review
and strengthen their compliance programmes on fair trading. Among telephone
company frontline staff the study had 'identified the absence of such
knowledge as a real problem.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Nuclear tries to clean up its contaminated image: A look at
the environmental case for building more nuclear power stations as British
Coal this week raises questions about the economics of an industry under
government review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The environment is a central plank in the nuclear industry's case for
building more power stations, even though many people associate nuclear
stations with radioactive contamination.
Nuclear Electric, the state-owned utility which supplies a quarter of the
electricity in England and Wales, says in its submission to the government's
nuclear review: 'Nuclear power is an essential part of policy to achieve the
government's current environmental commitments and its long-term sustainable
development objectives.'
The utility's first argument is that nuclear stations emit virtually no
pollutants. Unlike fossil fuel generators they produce no sulphur dioxide
and nitrous oxides, the main causes of acid rain, nor do they emit carbon
dioxide, the 'greenhouse gas' which is thought to cause global warming.
By Nuclear Electric's calculations existing nuclear power stations save
emissions of 840,000 tonnes of sulphur and 17m tonnes of carbon a year.
The UK is committed to bringing carbon dioxide emissions back to 1990 levels
by the year 2000, and lower targets are likely after that. The company says
that more nuclear power is essential if these targets are to be met.
Its second point is that nuclear power is much cheaper than it looks because
of its relatively small environmental impact. The submission cites findings
by the Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment
which measures the cost of environmental damage from fossil-fuel power
generation. These suggest that the nuclear industry saves more than Pounds
300m a year compared with coal-fired plants.
State-owned Scottish Nuclear estimates that its operations will save
Scotland Pounds 450m in environmental costs between 1995 and 2010.
The third point is that nuclear power is the only significant fuel source
which pays its full environmental cost. Coal and other fossil fuels damage
the environment but do not foot the bill. The main environmental cost is
disposing of nuclear waste and decommissioning old plant. Nuclear Electric
says that this is included in the price of nuclear-generated electricity.
Scottish Nuclear says its stations 'make full provision for these expected
future costs. The costs are therefore internalised in the cost of nuclear
generation'.
Much of the debate surrounds the claim that the government will be unable to
meet its targets for pollution levels - particularly for carbon dioxide -
without nuclear power. The only forecasts the government has made appeared
in the Department of Trade and Industry's Energy Paper 59, published two
years ago.
Of the six possible scenarios in the paper, only one - which assumed low
economic growth and high energy prices - showed lower carbon dioxide levels
in 2000 than in 1990. All forecast sharp rises up to 2020. One reason was
that the paper assumed nuclear power would decline as ageing stations were
shut down and not replaced.
But the fossil-fuel power generators, such as National Power and PowerGen,
are more optimistic that the targets can be met. They point to the cleaning
equipment being fitted to two of the largest coal-fired stations and the
tough new targets being introduced by the pollution inspectorate. One
fossil-fuel official said: 'We think we can get there with room to spare.'
Greenpeace, the environmental group, has submitted a detailed rebuttal of
the nuclear industry's claims. It accepts that nuclear emissions are low,
but says this advantage is greatly outweighed by other problems,
particularly radioactive waste.
Greenpeace says it would be more sensible to reduce emissions through
greater energy efficiency, renewable energy, and better use of fossil fuels.
Nuclear Electric has anticipated these objections. Its submission says that
even if all these alternatives were exploited to the maximum, they would
still not yield as big a result as building more nuclear power stations.
One of the problems for the nuclear industry is that its estimates of the
cost of environmental damage by fossil fuels are only that - estimates. For
the industry to deliver its benefits in cash terms the government would have
to introduce measures to make fossil fuels pay their full environmental
costs.
Scottish Nuclear suggests a tax on fossil fuels, legislation which places a
premium on nuclear electricity, and a system of pollution permits which
could be traded among power generators.
A group of leading energy academics headed by Professor Ian Fells of the
University of Newcastle upon Tyne suggested to the government that an
'energy policy framework' be created to overcome the short-termism of the
markets and bring out nuclear's long-term environmental advantages.
The academics said: 'Nuclear power has an important role to play in
environmental protection, security of supply and ultimately to compensate
for exhaustion of fossil fuels. It would not be prudent to leave its fate to
market forces.'

FT  24 AUG 94 / BT plans 'smart' cards for callboxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications yesterday announced that it was going ahead with
a system of phonecards and payphones based on 'smart card' integrated
microchip technology.
BT said the cards would improve the reliability of payphones and could lead
to the introduction of multi-purpose cards designed for a range of
functions, such as paying for goods in shops.
BT plans to introduce the payphones from next year.
Three companies, including GPT, the UK-based joint venture between GEC and
Siemens, will provide payphones able to accept smart phonecards. Two
companies, Gemplus and GPT, will produce the phonecards.
The smart phonecard will be a prepaid card similar to existing phonecards
and will be used in a similar way.
BT said the new payphones would be conventional in appearance and offer a
cash-and-card or card-only payment option.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Railtrack claims support for strike is on the wane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A record number of signal workers reported for work during the latest
24-hour rail strike, prompting claims from Railtrack that support for the
RMT transport union's 10-week action was waning.
But hopes for a quick return to peace received a setback when another rail
union, Aslef, announced plans to ballot 2,000 London Underground workers to
assess support for strike action over an imposed 2 per cent pay rise.
Strikes on the Underground would increase problems for commuters if they
were timed to coincide with rail stoppages.
Railtrack said that 599 signal workers, including 342 RMT members, had
reported for duty during the stoppage which ended at midday yesterday.
During last week's shutdown 530 signal workers had reported for duty,
including 309 members of RMT.
Mr John Ellis, Railtrack's production director, said: 'It is clear from
these figures that an increasing number of signalmen and women are now
willing to return to work despite the pressure that has been put upon them
to keep the strike solid.
'The RMT executive should listen to their members and stop forcing them to
gamble on their future and that of this business. The RMT mandate for strike
action is clearly falling away as every day goes by.'
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, denied that support was crumbling and
accused Railtrack of increasing the number of train services by a better
'exploitation of supervisors' rather than because of any return to work by
signalling staff.
He said: 'The significant figure is that there are still 4,000 people - 98
per cent of RMT members - on strike. That resolve is as strong as ever.
Railtrack should get down to serious negotiation about their problems.'
He rejected Railtrack's claim to have run more than 40 per cent of normal
services. In many parts of the country the service was less at than a
quarter of its normal level and most of the trains were poorly patronised,
he added.
The RMT has called another 48-hour strike from noon next Tuesday.
Its executive is expected to meet later this week to call another stoppage
in the week starting September 5. This would coincide with the Trades Union
Congress conference in Blackpool.
InterCity West Coast has announced plans to operate a limited service from
London Euston to Manchester and Glasgow via Wolverhampton and Crewe next
week.
This would be the first through service to run on the west coast main line
since the dispute started.

FT  24 AUG 94 / British Coal aims to cut more jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal yesterday started negotiations for a final reduction of staff
before privatisation. The move is expected to lead to more than 2,000 job
losses by the end of the year.
In talks with three unions the corporation was unable to state exactly how
many jobs would go but said the cuts would be broadly limited to management
and clerical staff at national, regional and group headquarters.
Of British Coal's 14,000 industrial employees and staff, about 10,000 are
miners with the rest either managers or white-collar workers. Most of those
not working in pits are unlikely to be needed by the corporation's
successors.
The government has asked bidders for the five core mining regions to present
their tenders by September 14 and is expected to select a preferred
candidate for each soon after. It wants to complete the sale of all five,
plus any closed mines that the private sector wants to re-open, on December
24.
Mr Kevan Hunt, British Coal employee-relations director, told the unions
that the government's sale of the core mining activities was progressing on
schedule. In addition, the corporation's sale of non-core businesses was
attracting considerable interest. Many of British Coal's 4,000 non-miner
employees are employed in these businesses.
Mr Hunt called on miners who had not yet accepted flexible working packages
to 'focus their attention' during the next few days. They have been given a
deadline of August 31 to decide.
The packages provide miners with one-off payments of Pounds 6,000 and allow
for redundancy packages of up to Pounds 27,000 if they lose their jobs
before March 1998. They must also, however, agree to work rosters which can
include shifts of up to 12 hours and weekend work.

More than half of all appeals against council tax bandings in Greater London
had still not been resolved 16 months after the tax was introduced, a survey
by the Labour-controlled Association of London Authorities has found.
At the end of July 57.2 per cent of appeals across London were outstanding.
Hounslow and Barking and Dagenham were the only boroughs to have resolved
more than half of their appeals.
The boroughs with the highest proportions of appeals outstanding were Bexley

FT  24 AUG 94 / Employee fights 'racism' charge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A member of the far-right British National party lost his job as a council
caretaker after being shown on TV 'inciting racial hatred', an industrial
tribunal heard yesterday.
Greenwich Borough Council in south-east London said that the trust and
confidence it needed to have in an employee, who by the terms of his
contract of employment had to deal with members of a vulnerable minority,
could not exist where someone was an 'avowed and active racist'.
The Croydon tribunal hearing, which is expected to end today, heard that Mr
Ian Dell was suspended last year after he was seen on television holding a
copy of the BNP newspaper and chanting 'rights for whites'. Mr Philip
Engelman, for the council, said Mr Dell's action had been tantamount to an
'incitement to racial hatred' and a fundamental breach of trust and
confidence in his ability to do his job.
Mr Dell said that what he did in his own time was his business. He had never
discriminated against anybody while carrying out his job. Of the slogan
chanted at the demonstration, he said: 'I was a member of a perfectly lawful
organisation, carrying out lawful campaigning, putting a lawful message
across, and that was not aimed at Greenwich council.'

FT  24 AUG 94 / Gatwick near-miss blamed on computer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A jumbo jet with more than 200 passengers and crew on board narrowly missed
buildings at Gatwick airport because a navigation computer was faulty and
the aircraft's crew made mistakes, a safety report said yesterday.
The crew of the Continental Airways Boeing 747 was working on incorrect
information when two attempts were made to land on February 7 last year.
Both were aborted a short way from the runway. The aircraft was landed at
the third attempt under manual control, a report by the Air Accidents
Investigation Branch said.
The report said the problems arose because the aircraft's automatic flight
control system failed to lock on correctly to Gatwick's landing guidance
instruments. The captain, not knowing this had happened, accepted incorrect
guidance instructions from a radar controller at Gatwick - without realising
that instruments in his cockpit were accurately telling him he was off
course.
The report also blamed the captain for not realising how far off course he
was when making his second approach - which saw the jumbo pass within 500
feet of the airport's south terminal building.
It recommended that the US Federal Aviation Administration should
investigate the computer failure.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Growth forecast for north Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The north of Scotland is poised to pull out strongly from a belated
recession, with economic growth expected to average 2.6 per cent a year over
the next five years, a survey published yesterday says.
The Fraser of Allander Institute, in a quarterly business survey for
Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the development agency, says the growth
should produce thousands of new jobs when a recent rise in business
confidence is matched by private-sector investment in company start-ups and
expansions.
Mr Iain Robertson, chief executive of HIE Network, which groups the area's
10 local enterprise companies, said the network had triggered a number of
projects. More than 1,000 business projects had been assisted and more than
2,900 jobs created or retained.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Stream of cuts erodes help for disabled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year Remploy drew Pounds 13m from Ministry of Defence contracts as a
result of the priority suppliers scheme. The orders were to provide military
clothing and chemical protection suits
But earlier this month the government decided to scrap the scheme to comply
with a strict interpretation of a European directive. Mr Tony Withey, chief
executive of Remploy, said: 'We knew that the withdrawal of the scheme would
make life difficult for us.'
It is the company's textile division, which gets 65 per cent of its business
from the MoD, that could be hardest hit.
Remploy was set up in 1946 to provide work for the war-wounded and has
maintained a commitment to employing a large percentage of disabled workers.
The company employs 8,736 disabled workers - about 99 per cent of its
shopfloor employees - in 95 factories across Britain, providing
manufacturing services in furniture, packaging, textiles, healthcare,
bookbinding and printing.
In the past Remploy has been able to rely on a steady stream of work from
government departments. But the loss of the priority supplier scheme is only
one of a number of government cuts that have affected its business.
Last year the government lowered a subsidy intended to cover the costs of
employing disabled workers, although Mr Michael Portillo, the employment
secretary, has said this subsidy should help Remploy maintain a competitive
edge after the disappearance of the priority scheme.
The company is also suffering from the government's competitive tendering
policy. Last year it lost about Pounds 5m in government contracts with the
Employment Service and the National Health Service.
Mr Withey said that the shift from centralised buying gave his workforce
unique problems. When government contracts were offered centrally, workers
could be taught skills particular to one large bid. But many of the
company's severely disabled workers were unable to cope with the wide range
of product specifications in a decentralised market.
The company has 10,400 employees. Although its disabled staff represent
about 85 per cent of its workforce, they command only about 75 per cent of
Remploy's payroll costs.
Remploy is in dispute with its unions over a recent pay offer, which has
prompted the GMB general union, the largest of the company's six-union
consortium, to hold a strike ballot.
The company is offering a 2.5 per cent pay rise and the only condition is
that the unions co-operate with management on absence monitoring.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Remploy chief hits back at Portillo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The statement by Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, that a
scheme to help disabled employees was 'hardly ever used' has been challenged
by the UK's largest employer of disabled workers.
Mr Tony Withey, Remploy's chief executive, said the government's decision to
scrap the priority supplier scheme would affect 85 per cent of the company's
textile contracts with the Ministry of Defence.
The scheme allows companies which employ disabled workers to bid again if
they fail to secure a govern-ment contract at the first attempt.
About 40 per cent of Remploy's business comes from the public sector.
Mr Withey yesterday met Mr Phillip Oppenheim, the employment minister, to
discuss government support for Remploy's disabled employ-ees.
The company said it had sufficient work for its textile factories until the
end of the financial year, and Mr Oppenheim ordered officials to work with
Remploy to protect employment opportunities.
Although the textile division relies heavily on the scrapped scheme, the
rest of the company has been able to win public-sector contracts without
using it.
Mr Portillo has said a government subsidy worth Pounds 80m would continue to
help companies with disabled employees to compete even though the scheme had
been scrapped.
But Mr Withey said the subsidy would not offset the loss of the opportunity
to re-bid for tenders on government contracts.
The subsidy, which is set each year, only covers the extra costs incurred by
employing disabled workers.
Mr Withey said: 'The subsidy has never been used to make us more
competitive. Our pricing has nothing to do with the subsidy.'
He said the company had often won contracts with a higher bid because of its
offer of quality services.
Mr Withey said: 'We now have a two-fold problem. We are unable to compete
with some companies because we have higher prices as a result of higher
labour costs, and the privilege that we have had in bidding for government
tenders has disappeared.'
Mr Withey said he had known about the government's intention to end the
priority scheme for about a year.
He said: 'We made it clear that a large amount of our textiles business
comes from this scheme.
'But the way it was presented to us was that we had no choice because it was
illegal under EU directives.'
The company reported turnover of Pounds 126.7m last year, up Pounds 2m from
the year before. It was able to increase sales in spite of a cut in the
government subsidy, loss of important public contracts, and increased
competition from companies which employ cheap labour from north Africa and
eastern Europe.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Ministers warned of legal muddle on VE-day events
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was yesterday faced with the possibility of a another
embarrassment over an important second world war anniversary.
Mr Don Foster, the Liberal Democrat MP for Bath, accused ministers of
creating 'considerable confusion' over next May's VE-day celebrations and
urged them to sort out a 'muddle' arising from legislation implemented
earlier this year.
He called on the government to make 'special dispensations' to allow street
parties commemorating the 50th anniversary of VE - victory in Europe - day
to go ahead 'without excessive expense and red tape' on May 8.
In a letter to Mr Steven Norris, transport minister, Mr Foster said the Road
Traffic Regulation (Special Events) Act had caused 'a considerable amount of
confusion' because of differences of opinion over the type of event it was
meant to cover.
Mr Foster said legal experts were divided about the new act, which covers
the administration of temporary street closures. District councils said it
was meant to apply to all temporary closures, while Department of Transport
officials indicated it was intended to cover only large events and not such
small events as street parties.
Mr Foster asked Mr Norris to clarify the 'anomalies which appear to exist'
and urged a 'special allowance' for the re-enactment of street parties.
Earlier this year the government bowed to the demands of veterans for a
bigger say in the events to mark the Normandy landings in June 1944, after
ministers admitted the government's approach had become a public-relations
fiasco.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Growth forecast for north Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The north of Scotland is poised to pull out strongly from a belated
recession, with economic growth expected to average 2.6 per cent a year over
the next five years, a survey published yesterday says.
The Fraser of Allander Institute, in a quarterly business survey for
Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the development agency, says the growth
will produce thousands of new jobs when a recent rise in business confidence
is matched by private-sector investment in company start-ups and expansions.
Mr Iain Robertson, chief executive of HIE Network, which groups the area's
10 local enterprise companies, said the network had triggered a number of
projects. More than 1,000 business projects had been assisted and more than
2,900 jobs created or retained. There had been more than 400 business
start-ups, record joint investment in community projects and a strong rise
in training programme successes.
Mr Robertson said that the Highlands and islands had been hit late by
recession and was only now emerging from the aftermath.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Economy set to pick up tempo: But protests are a worry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico may be emerging from the economic doldrums in which it has been
languishing for two years. If opposition protests against the conduct of
Sunday's election fizzle out or at least do not degenerate into violence,
many private economists are likely to increase the forecasts for growth
which they scaled down amid the political uncertainty of the first half of
the year.
'If we can avoid a post-electoral conflict, things will really look up,
especially on the investment side,' said Mr Jonathan Heath, head of Macro
Asesoria Economica, a Mexico City economic consultancy.
Already this year, growth has been unexpectedly high. In the second quarter,
growth was 3.8 per cent compared with the same 1993 quarter, leading to a
first half economic expansion of 2.2 per cent. In the second half, growth
should get a boost from falling interest rates - yesterday's auction showed
Mexican 28-day Treasury bill rates falling from 17.7 per cent a month ago.
But in the first half, unusually for a Mexican government which has kept a
tight rein on the budget, the motor for growth was a 27 per cent rise in
government spending.
According to Mr Rogelio Ramirez de la O, who runs the Ecanal economic
analysis company, the government's new agricultural policy - which aims to
replace guaranteed prices with direct income support to small farmers -
injected Dollars 3.8bn into the economy between February and June, alone
equivalent to more than 1 per cent of GDP.
While for seasonal reasons, the public sector budget remained in surplus in
the first half of the year, many expect a deficit by the year-end rather
than the balance forecast by the government. Some analysts think this means
that the ruling party's successful presidential candidate, Mr Ernesto
Zedillo - who has promised a 25 per cent rise in public investment next year
 -may have to begin by checking government spending.
Foreign investment has held up remarkably well in the face of uncertainty,
and many economists are expecting it to pick up significantly with a
peaceful handover of power in prospect. Foreign direct investment, excluding
foreign share purchases, reached Dollars 3.3bn in the first half of the
year, compared with Dollars 4.9bn for the whole of last year. 'Direct
foreign investment could easily reach Dollars 7bn in 1994,' says Salomon
Brothers in New York.
But growth of the country's trade and current account deficits remains a
troubling feature to many economists - and underlines to some the
overvaluation of the Mexican peso.
Most economists believe a big devaluation is out of the question. President
Carlos Salinas' three predecessors were forced into panic devaluations in
their last year of office.
With reserves perhaps around Dollars 17bn - and assuming an amenable
environment in international markets - the question becomes not whether Mr
Salinas can hold the exchange rate but whether it is sensible for him to do
so. If a depreciation is considered desirable, the government is expected to
push for it gradually, by increasing the daily slide of the peso against the
dollar from the current 40 cents a day (or about 5 per cent a year) as part
of the so-called pacto in early September.
Mr Zedillo and his advisers are sure to have an important influence over
content of the new pacto, an annual agreement between business, labour and
the government, especially if there is a decision to modify exchange rate
policy. A former budget minister and central bank official, Mr Zedillo
strongly supports economic policies of the current administration, and there
is expected to be co-operation between the outgoing and incoming
administrations.
The continuity in economic policy is likely to be underlined when Mr Zedillo
chooses his economic cabinet. Mr Jaime Serra Puche, the trade minister and a
friend of Mr Zedillo from when they were both students at Yale University,
Mr Guillermo Ortiz, the deputy finance minister, and Mr Pedro Aspe, current
finance minister, are in rough order of likelihood the three candidates most
frequently mentioned as the next finance minister.
With inflation under control, Mr Zedillo and his economic team are likely to
focus on improving efficiency of the economy over the next six years.
Advisers say the new government will seek to remove unnecessary business
regulations, improve functioning of the labour markets and commercial legal
system, overhaul the health and social security system and open the giant
state monopolies in oil to more competition.
But important as such reforms are, they are not expected to be the most
crucial aspects of a Zedillo administration. 'For the future I'm less
worried about Hacienda (the finance ministry) and more worried about
Gobernacion (the interior ministry). Politics will be to this administration
what the economy was to the last,' says Mr Heath.

FT  24 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Taiwan pressed on beer monopoly -
Regulatory bureau must satisfy Gatt by dismantling its own role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political reform has ended the one-party system in Taiwan, but the island
remains a one-beer state, thanks to Taiwan Beer, which contributes much of
the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) a year that goes to the government as a
monopoly producer of alcohol and tobacco.
However, the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau is now under pressure
to satisfy the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by ending its
regulatory role and dismantling its monopoly.
The one-beer policy is a legacy from the 50-year Japanese colonial
administration which began in 1895. Monopolies were established to control
trade in opium, camphor, salt, tobacco, spirits, matches and petroleum.
When the then Nanjing-based Kuomintang government took control of the island
in 1947, it commandeered all breweries, wineries and distilleries and
continued the Japanese administration's monopoly.
Imports are allowed, and on September 1, some 137 countries will be
permitted to sell alcohol in Taiwan, compared with 122 at present. However,
with Taiwan Beer made from rice, and thus quite different in flavour to
western brews, traditional Asian alcoholic beverages made from sorghum and
rice, as well as Japanese alcohol, remain banned. Japanese beer is sold in
Taiwan, but only where it has been produced outside Japan.
Under this regime, the market penetration of imported beer is little more
than 5 per cent, with Taiwan Beer accounting for around 94.5 per cent of
sales in 1993 on annual production of 465m litres. However, Taiwan Beer's
market share has fallen, from 96 per cent a year earlier, while beer imports
rose by 62 per cent in the year to June 30 1994.
In fiscal 1994, the Monopoly Bureau's alcohol and cigarette sales raked in
NTDollars 91.5bn (Pounds 2.2bn); while net profits have yet to be released,
they are expected to amount to some NTDollars 60bn. The bureau's substantial
earnings are divided between central and provincial government, with the
former receiving 65 per cent and the latter 35 per cent.
Taiwan Beer produces four types of beer, in three breweries: bottled lager,
keg beer, canned beer and an unsuccessful dark beer marketed under the label
Baodao ('treasured island'). A light beer was launched several years ago but
discontinued due to poor sales.
The company has also revived plans to produce a low-calorie beer to compete
with the influx of foreign rivals. Taiwan Beer contains 4.5 per cent alcohol
and 2 per cent sugar. The new brew is to have 2-2.5 per cent alcohol and 1.5
per cent sugar. But the promotion and advertising of alcohol is currently
highly restricted.
Advertising for foreign brands of beer is restricted to 120 magazine
insertions per year per label. Importers of spirits are permitted to
advertise in magazines for one year after the brand is first brought into
Taiwan. Thereafter they may not advertise. Television, radio, billboard or
any other type of advertising or promotion is banned. The monopoly bureau
does not advertise Taiwan Beer or any other alcohol which it produces.
Importers are lobbying to have these rules eased once Taiwan joins Gatt.
Foreign beer makers are also hoping they will eventually be permitted to
establish bottling factories in Taiwan, which would reduce production and
freight costs.
Other Taiwanese alcohol, such as the fiery sorghum liquor, Kao Liang, is
likely to be less affected by implementation of Gatt, than beer, but there
are import tax implications.
Taiwan is already the biggest market in the world in sales of XO grade
cognac in terms of absolute volume. Brandy imports soared 70 per cent in the
year ended June 30 to 406,828 cases of 12, while whisky imports jumped 66
per cent to 542,029 cases.
'All western products are now extremely popular in Taiwan,' explains Mr King
Lai, managing director of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising's Taiwan office.
'Before martial law was lifted in 1987, people never saw these products
because the market was closed. Now many Taiwanese are travelling overseas;
they've become more international in outlook and they're wealthy.'
But US alcohol is subject to far more lenient tax treatment than European
alcoholic beverages, with the tax on cognac and armagnac running at
NTDollars 1,000 per litre and on Scotch at NTDollars 440 per litre, compared
with NTDollars 198 per litre on US and Canadian whiskies. These
discrepancies will need to be eliminated.
The government has yet to determine how a post-Gatt tax system will work, or
when it will be implemented. New rules are expected to go into effect on
January 1 next year. The Europeans are lobbying for a tax based on alcohol
content and the US is pushing for an ad valorem system.
But the Taiwanese may settle on a combination of both, while devising a
system which retains a degree of protection for local products.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Struggle over crime bill in Senate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's crime bill ran into another brick wall yesterday,
when the administration and the Democratic leadership in the Senate fell
short in their efforts to muster enough votes to overcome a procedural
obstacle raised by the opposition Republicans.
Senator Joseph Biden, the crime bill's manager in the Senate, conceded in a
long and bitter speech yesterday evening that he was at least one vote short
of the 60 he would need to waive a budgetary point of order raised against
the bill.
Although debate will continue today while efforts continue behind the scenes
to drum up more support, the failure to bring the bill to a vote yesterday
was another devastating blow to Mr Clinton.
Without the waiver, Mr Biden said, the crime bill would die until a new
Congress could start afresh next year.
A waiver is required because the bill sets up a trust fund, to be filled
with money saved from cutting the federal government workforce, to pay for
its law enforcement measures. The trust fund was not voted on by the budget
committee, and so technically violates the Congressional Budget Act.
If the point of order is not set aside, the legislation would once again be
opened up for amendment. That would mean that sending it back once again to
the House of Representatives, which only passed it on Sunday after the
Democrats had made a series of concessions to overcome a similar procedural
obstacle.
When the crime bill passed the Senate for the first time late last year, the
Republicans voted overwhelmingly for it, and agreed to waive the budgetary
point of order.
Scenting blood from a weakened president, the Republicans moved in for the
kill to raise the point of order this time around. Senator Pete Domenici of
New Mexico claimed yesterday that the bill had been so altered in the
conference to reconcile it with the House version that the waiver he and his
colleagues had earlier supported was no longer justified.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Mexico's PRI to gain strong grip on Congress
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's ruling party is set to win large majorities in both houses of
Congress after Sunday's elections, giving the incoming administration of Mr
Ernesto Zedillo control over the legislature at least until the next
congressional elections in 1997.
The Institutional Revolutionary party had by yesterday afternoon won about
49 per cent of the presidential and legislative vote, with 75 per cent of
polling booths counted. With votes still to be counted in many of the PRI's
rural strongholds, its final vote is expected to climb towards or above 50
per cent.
The PRI was ahead in over 270 of the 300 directly elected seats in the lower
chamber, the House of Deputies. Under Mexico's electoral system, the PRI
will be awarded enough indirectly elected seats to raise its representation
to 300 of the total 500 seats in the lower house.
The centre-right National Action party will be the second largest party in
Congress.
However, the PRI's 60 per cent majority in the lower house will not be
sufficient to change the constitution without support from at least one of
the main opposition parties.
In the Senate the PRI was ahead of the opposition in 31 of the 32 states,
including Mexico City, and behind the PAN in the state of Jalisco, with half
the votes counted. The PAN was placed second in 22 states, and the leftist
opposition Party of Democratic Revolution in nine. On these figures, the PRI
would have 94 of the 128 Senate seats, the PAN 25, and the PRD 9. In
Chiapas, the only state which held an election for governor, the PRI was set
for victory.
Financial markets continued to react positively to the PRI's victory, which
unlike the 1988 presidential elections, has not been marred by reports of
large-scale irregularities. By the close the market had edged down 0.1 per
cent, giving up early morning gains. On Monday the financial markets a had
reacted positively to the PRI's big victory.
Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate of the PRD, has denounced the
ruling party victory as illegitimate, but has yet to corroborate his claims
of deliberate and widespread fraud.
Mr Cardenas has called for a protest meeting in Mexico City's central square
for this Saturday. On Monday he was joined by an estimated 15,000-20,000
supporters at a meeting denouncing the election, far fewer than he had hoped
for.

FT  24 AUG 94 / World Trade News: US lays ground for new trade talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US trade officials are nearing the end of intricate discussions with
Congress that will give the president a six-year authority to negotiate new
trade agreements. But Congress looks set to weaken US efforts to bring
labour and environmental issues into future pacts.
The discussions are, basically, over US legislation needed to implement the
global trade liberalisation measures agreed under the Uruguay Round of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. As a result of many deals cut by
Congress and the administration over the last few months, it is hoped this
legislation can be introduced next month and passed without amendment.
The legislation will also give President Bill Clinton the new 'fast-track'
negotiating authority he has requested for future trade negotiations, but in
amended form.
The fast-track process, in theory, enables the president to submit trade
pacts that Congress can only approve or reject, but not amend. This is meant
to assure US trading partners that the executive branch has the authority it
needs to negotiate in good faith.
However, Congress is retaining much of its authority over trade. Under the
new fast-track provision, the president will have to notify Congress 60 days
before starting formal trade negotiations. During that time either house may
disapprove of the proposed negotiation by majority vote.
Before signing an agreement, the president must notify Congress. The
president has to give 120 days' notice in order to allow private sector
advisers 45 days to submit reports evaluating the agreement.
After three years, the president must request a three-year extension of the
fast-track to December 15, 2000. The advisers must also submit their views.
The administration is being forced to eliminate environment and labour
concerns from the negotiating objectives proposed in the fast-track.
These were contained in the previous fast-track authorisation in 1988, but
were played down by the Republican administrations. But Mr Clinton's pursuit
of these objectives in side agreements to the North American Free Trade
Agreement has since alarmed the business community and free trade
Republicans.
The administration has promised not to negotiate agreements which authorise
sanctions against trading partners on environmental or labour practices 'in
the absence of bipartisan Congressional support'.
Congress is also retaining its right to amend the implementing legislation
for a trade pact, if not the trade pact itself.
The outcome of the discussions with Congress amounts to a qualified victory
for Mr Clinton. It will give his administration the go-ahead to seek trade
agreements with Latin American and South-East Asian countries.
But it does not apply to any agreements reached in market access disputes,
for instance with Japan or the European Union.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Cardoso further ahead of rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Brazil's former finance minister, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, has pulled
further ahead in the presidential election race, according to an opinion
poll published yesterday.
The poll, one of the largest yet carried out and published by the Folha de
Sao Paulo newspaper, suggested Mr Cardoso was far enough ahead of his rivals
to win outright in the first round of voting in October without a second
round run-off in November.
The poll, which backs others published in recent days, gives Mr Cardoso the
support of 43 per cent of the electorate. This compares with only 23 per
cent for his nearest rival, Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing
Workers' Party (PT).
Mr Cardoso's rise in popularity is almost entirely due to optimism over the
Real, the country's new currency, which was introduced on July 1 and has led
to sharply lower inflation. Mr Cardoso negotiated the currency and other
measures through Congress, before resigning as finance minister to run for
president. Since the Real's launch, his support has more than doubled from
21 per cent. Support for Mr da Silva, universally known as Lula, has fallen
during the same period from 38 per cent. Mr da Silva's advisers hope his
share of the vote has now stabilised and they can renew their attack on Mr
Cardoso. But there is concern in the PT that the election will be over in
the first round. Under Brazil's rules, the first round winner becomes
president if he polls more than his combined rivals.
According to the latest poll, Mr Cardoso would win in the first round
because Mr da Silva and the other challengers have a combined vote of only
38 per cent. This is the first time Mr Cardoso's lead over his combined
competition has exceeded the poll's margin of error of 2 per cent.
Mr Cardoso's rise has led to heady sessions on Sao Paulo's stock market. The
Bovespa index made its seventh successive advance on Monday and has
increased nearly 16 per cent in the last week.

FT  24 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Canada tussles with US over timber refund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Commerce Department has ordered an end to collection of duty on
imports of Canadian softwood lumber, but it has yet to agree to return an
estimated Dollars 450m-Dollars 500m in duties which a bilateral dispute
settlement panel said had been wrongfully collected.
A US-Canadian appeals panel last month upheld an earlier finding that
Canada's timber pricing and log export policies were not being subsidised.
This reversed a finding from the US Commerce Department, which had led to
the collection of countervailing duties.
Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, last week said the Commerce
Department had 'just the other day' ceased collecting duties and was 'in the
process of evaluating what our future course will be'. A lawyer for the US
timber industry said the binational panels which reviewed the US subsidy
ruling had no legal authority to require repayment of duties.
Mr Roy MacLaren, Canada's trade minister, has demanded refund of the duties
promptly and with interest.
A number of US senators - including the majority leader, Mr George Mitchell,
and Mr Max Baucus, chairman of the trade sub-committee - want the duties
withheld until Canada agrees to change its timber pricing system.
In a letter to Mr Brown, the senators said the issue of subsidised lumber
had mistakenly become part of the Canada Free Trade Agreement. 'Canada
exploited this oversight, and the panel process has repeatedly
misinterpreted US law,' they said.
'As the US dissenters in the subsidies cases noted, the three Canadian
members that directed the Department of Commerce to find that these
subsidies were not actionable under US law exceeded their jurisdiction and
usurped Congress's right to make US law.'
However, they say, a long-term solution may now be possible because the
Canadian provinces have essentially admitted that 'enormous subsidies
exist'. Withholding the duties could bring the parties to the negotiating
table.
The Canadian embassy said US officials might need authorisation from
Congress before paying money back.

FT  24 AUG 94 / New Argentine constitution today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's President Carlos Menem and some 5,000 officials will today swear
obedience to the country's new constitution. The ceremony promulgating it
will mark the informal opening of campaigning for next May's presidential
elections.
The 1853 constitution was amended mainly to allow Mr Menem to stand for
re-election when his term ends next year. The previous constitution banned
successive presidential terms. Lifting this ban became Mr Menem's overriding
political aim of the past two years.
As well as allowing the president's re-election to a second, four-year term,
the new constitution introduces a semi-parliamentary form of government,
broadens the powers of Congress and gives the judiciary greater
independence.
The constitution is Mr Menem's greatest personal achievement since his
election in July 1989. Last December, he overcame the opposition of the
Radical Party, led by former president Raul Alfonsn, by promising a number
of concessions in return for allowing his re-election.
The constitution incorporates referenda and entrenches a broad range of
individual rights and declarations of principles. These include recognition
of Indian lands and a restatement of Argentina's claim to the Falkland
Islands.
Argentina has protested to Britain over the UK decision to extend a fishing
exclusion zone around the Falklands, a government spokesman said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Buenos Aires. Britain confirmed it was extending the
zone to an area north of the islands known as the Gap.
Mr Guido di Tella, Argentine foreign minister, handed the protest to
Britain's ambassador, Mr Peter Hall, on Monday. Mr di Tella later criticised
remarks by British Home Secretary Michael Howard claiming there was 'nothing
to negotiate' over the islands.
London denies its decision to expand the fishing exclusion zone is related
to Argentina's renewed claims over the Falklands. But Mr di Tella called the
extension a tit-for-tat move.

The presidents of Iran and Turkmenistan were yesterday due to sign an
agreement to allow the building of a Dollars 7bn pipeline to carry Turkmen
gas via Iran and Turkey to Europe, said Iran's oil minister Gholamreza
Aqazadeh, Reuter reports from Tehran.
Presidents Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran and Saparmurat Niyazov of
Turkmenistan met yesterday to put the final touches on the deal. They were
today due to 'break the ground at a site along the pipeline route south of
Tehran,' said Mr Aqazadeh, in a symbolic start to the project.
Mr Aqazadeh said the pipeline would take six to eight years to build, with
the 1,450 km section in Iran costing Dollars 3.5bn, half of which would be
financed by Iran. The Iranian section would be transferred to Iranian
ownership after 25 years, he said.
The pipeline, which will have an initial annual capacity of 15bn cubic
metres, to be expanded to 28bn cubic metres in a second phase, is crucial
for Turkmenistan whose former gas export routes through Russia were
disrupted by the collapse of the Soviet Union. It will be by far Iran's
biggest joint project with Moslem ex-Soviet republics.

FT  24 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Otis in second Vietnam deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Otis Elevator, the world's largest lift producer, has signed its second
joint venture agreement in Vietnam since President Bill Clinton lifted the
US economic embargo against the country in February.
The Connecticut-based lift and escalator maker, part of United Technologies,
is joining forces with Ho Chi Minh City's Construction and Elevator Company
(CEC) to sell, install, maintain and modernise lifts and escalators in the
southern part of Vietnam.
Otis announced a similar deal in May with the Hanoi-based Lilama
construction concern to cover the north of the country. The US lift company
now has a majority stake in both of these ventures, in which it has invested
a total of Dollars 4.5m.
Otis Elevators has moved quickly since the lifting of the embargo, because
it had been worried that its European and other rivals might move into the
promising Vietnamese market.
Otis claims to be the first international liftmaker to return to Vietnam. In
1929 it had installed one of the country's oldest lifts at the presidential
palace in Hanoi, and formal operations began in 1950, only to cease in 1975
with the US withdrawal.
Otis believes that, with more than 15m of Vietnam's 72m population living in
eight big cities, there is substantial potential for new lift sales and
service. Plans to redress the shortage of offices, hotels and industrial
buildings should also promote demand.
The latest joint venture, to be known as Otis Saigon Elevator,
re-establishes a relationship with CEC, which under the name Engineco was
the Otis agent in Vietnam from 1968 to 1975. It will initially employ about
50 people rising to an expected 250 within five years.
Lifts and escalators will be supplied from Otis' new manufacturing plant on
Penang island in Malaysia.

Record numbers of Cuban refugees continue to make their way to the US
despite the ban on entry announced by the Clinton administration last
Thursday.
As the Navy assigned resources to support the overstretched Coast Guard to
deal with what Mr William Perry, the defence secretary, has called a 'tidal
wave of people', the US State Department said it did not expect the new
curbs to have an impact on numbers for 'some several days'.
The Florida Coast Guard picked up 2,548 people on Monday, a marked rise from
a week earlier when, under the former immigration policy, 282 Cuban refugees
were taken to Key West for registration with the Immigration and
Naturalisation Services.
Although many of the Cubans now being picked up may have left unaware of the
new policy, which refuses them entry to the US and ships them back to Cuba
for detainment at the US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, the Coast Guard has
reported that many others are aware that they will be sent to detention
camps.
State Department officials pointed to the introduction of an interdiction
policy on Haitian refugees which took a week to 10 days to cause a fall in
the numbers fleeing Haiti.

Most Japanese companies believe they have made the adjustments to their

Of about 1,000 employers it polled in mid-July, only 4 per cent said they

June. A further 6 per cent were planning such meas-ures.
A previous survey conducted last August, when the yen first touched the Y100
level against the US dollar, showed 10 per cent of companies had taken
recent action and a further 10 per cent intended to do so if the exchange
rate stayed at current levels.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Pakistan 'has atomic bomb'
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISLAMABAD, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's opposition leader, yesterday unleashed what
could be the beginning of another round of controversy over the country's
secret nuclear programme. Addressing a public rally in the
Pakistan-controlled state of Kashmir, Mr Sharif announced the country
possessed an atomic bomb, according to the Pakistan Press International news
agency.
The claim was immediately denied by a foreign ministry spokesman in
Islamabad. He restated the government position that it had acquired the
capability to make nuclear weapons but had taken a policy decision not to do
so and restricted the use of nuclear technology to peaceful purposes like
energy. 'We have the technological capability but we have taken a conscious
decision not to acquire nuclear weapons,' he said.
Some officials said Mr Sharif's statement could be meant to embarrass the
government both home and abroad. In recent years, relations with a number of
western countries, especially the US, have been strained over the nuclear
issue.
Washington cut off its large economic aid and weapon supply programme to
Pakistan in 1990, following charges that Islamabad had acquired the
capability to produce nuclear weapons. A Dollars 1.4bn deal involving the
sale of up to 71 F-16 fighter aircraft is still on hold, after the Bush
administration stopped delivery under pressure from the non-proliferation
lobby.
Pakistan has refused to open its nuclear facilities for international
inspection on the grounds that any such move must also involve India, its
neighbour and arch rival.
Other officials said Mr Sharif's statement could be linked to an
intensifying government-opposition rift. He plans to begin a nationwide
campaign by train next month in an effort to mobilise support for the
government's removal.
George Graham adds from Washington: The US remains concerned about nuclear
proliferation in the south Asian region, and is continuing its efforts to
bring about a cap on nuclear programmes there. 'We believe that both India
and Pakistan could assemble a limited number of nuclear weapons in a limited
time,' a State Department official said.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A conservative cabinet member in Japan's new coalition government yesterday
fired insults at the leader of the employers' federation in an unusually
vitriolic debate over the future of lifetime employment in Japanese
industry.
Mr Shizuka Kamei, transport minister, backed away from a battle with the
country's airlines over hiring policies, rescinding a ruling which had
halted plans by the carriers to recruit most new cabin crew on short-term
contracts. In a televised press conference, he acknowledged he had no powers
to intervene.
He added, however, that the defence of the scheme by Mr Takeshi Nagano,
president of the Nikkeiren, the federation of employers' associations,
suggested Mr Nagano cared little for job security.
The minister claimed Mr Nagano epitomised 'the thinking of 19th-century
management which doesn't give a damn about safety, pollution, security of
jobs or the rights of workers'. Mr Kamei alleged: 'His top priority is
profits and that gives me great concern'.
At a Nikkeiren seminar last week, Mr Nagano expressed disquiet over
prospects for economic reform under the new government, saying that for
Japan to emerge from its longest post-war recession, wages and prices must
be reduced.
While agreeing that employment security should remain a prime concern of
Japanese industry, Mr Nagano noted that prospects for women jobseekers were
poor and the JAL plan to recruit contract stewardesses would benefit them as
well as the company. He implied that Mr Kamei had an axe of his own to
grind.
Mr Kamei comes from the right wing of the Liberal Democratic party,
conservative partner in the three-party coalition which took power at the
end of June. Many in the LDP regard Japan's taboo on lay-offs as essential
to corporate loyalty and a cornerstone of the post-war economic success
which took place under its rule. Job security is among the areas of common
ground in the LDP's alliance with the left-wing Social Democratic party of
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister.
Japan Airlines is seeking to cut costs by hiring an initial 100 stewardesses
on hourly pay which would be equivalent to perhaps a third of that enjoyed
by its salaried flight attendants.
JAL received 2,500 applications but could not proceed because Mr Kamei,
invoking worries about how the two classes of employee would co-operate in
the event of an in-flight emergency, threatened to decline new route
applications if the plan went ahead.
Mr Nagano did not respond yesterday to Mr Kamei's outburst. The employers'
leader is chairman of Mitsubishi Materials, a producer of metal products,
electronics and cement which fell into loss last year. The pollution barb
will jog memories of a Texas copper smelter project his company shelved
after problems with US environmental regulations.
JAL could not say last night if it would revive its plan, but it needs new
cabin crew to service domestic flights from Kansai Airport, opening near
Osaka next month. JAL has been shedding staff through voluntary redundancy.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Abacha seeks to bolster hard line with shake-up: Political
moderate replaced as new chiefs are named for Nigeria's army and navy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's head of state, Gen Sani Abacha, has restructured the military high
command following his crackdown on civilian opposition last week that
widened the ethnic divide between the north and south-west of the country
and exposed divisions within the armed forces.
The government announced new chiefs of the army and navy on Monday in an
effort to bolster Gen Abacha's hard line against jailed opposition leader Mr
Moshood Abiola and banned leaders of the striking oil workers' unions. The
union leaders yesterday were reinstated until Aug-ust 31 by a federal high
court judge who said he would hear an appeal against their dismissal on that
date.
There are indications that the military changes may be followed shortly by a
reshuffle in the civilian cabinet.
Maj Gen Mohammed Chris Alli, a Christian from the Middle Belt of Nigeria and
reputed to be a political moderate, has been replaced by Brig Gen Alwali
Kazir, formerly commander of a northern army division. Rear Admiral Allision
Madueke, an Ibo who fought for the rebel Biafrans in the 1967 civil war, is
succeeded as head of the navy by Commodore Mike Akhigbe, a former military
governor of Lagos state.
There is strong speculation Gen Abacha will replace Lt Gen Oladipo Diya as
chief of general staff.
Along with one third of the armed forces, Gen Diya like Mr Abiola is a
member of the southern Yoruba tribe and was expected to press hard for the
regime to accommodate the different interest groups in Nigeria and move
quickly towards democratic rule. His position as number two has been
circumvented by Mr Aminu Saleh, secretary to the government, who is seen as
an advocate of political domination by the north.
After 24 years of army rule, the Nigerian armed forces' main role is
political rather than military and although most troops and technically
skilled personnel are drawn from from the south and the Middle Belt, a
minority of northern officers remain a dominant influence in the army and in
the key intelligence services.
The government has taken a tough political stand against the economically
powerful south-west: Lagos is the main port, the centre of banking and
commerce and the base for more than half of manufacturing industry.
The army has a nominal strength of 62,000. There are four army divisions in
the west, east and north of Nigeria which are at operational strength, and a
battalion of presidential guards in Abuja. Military analysts say that most
other units are under-strength, under-equipped and under-trained. Morale is
low and repeated late pay has been partly alleviated by the military's
lucrative share in fuel distribution since the oil workers' six-week strike
left most filling stations dry.
The hardened stance by the Abacha government appears to rule out any
dialogue or compromise with Mr Abiola and those who support his claim to
form a civilian government. In a speech last week, the head of state said
would not drop the charges of treason against Mr Abiola, who faces trial
again in Abuja on August 29.
Maj Gen Alli and Rear Admiral Madueke were key members of the military junta
which helped Gen Abacha to oust interim civilian president Ernest Shonekan
last November and force out of power the remnants of ex-president Ibrahim
Babangida's closest allies remaining in the armed forces.
After the annulment of Mr Abiola's victory in last June's presidential poll,
then president Babangida appointed Gen Alli as head of a committee of
inquiry into the issue. The committee reported that the best way out of the
political impasse was to declare and uphold the results of the June
elections.
This view had widespread support among the armed forces, most whom voted for
Mr Abiola, the Yoruba candidate from the south-west, even in the
presidential brigade of guards in Abuja, according to military sources.
As Gen Abacha acknowledged, there is still a ground-swell of support for
democracy in the armed forces.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most Japanese companies believe they have made the adjustments to their
workforces necessary to cope with the high yen, according to a survey
released by the labour ministry yesterday.
Of about 1,000 employers it polled in mid-July, only 4 per cent said they
had taken steps to shed jobs since the currency began its renewed climb in
June. A further 6 per cent were planning such measures.
A previous survey conducted last August, when the yen first touched the Y100
level against the US dollar, showed that 10 per cent of companies had taken
recent action and a further 10 per cent intended to do so if the exchange
rate stayed at current levels.
The yen closed in Tokyo yesterday at Y98.13 to the dollar, held back by Bank
of Japan intervention after strong overnight buying in New York pushed it as
high as Y97.85.
Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, international trade and industry minister, told a
press conference he was worried that the effect of the strong currency on
export performance would hinder a nascent economic recovery.
And Mr Toshio Morikawa, chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations
of Japan, while saying the country was certainly headed for an upturn,
cautioned the level of the yen would mean revival was slow.
If the currency rose further, 30 per cent of the companies surveyed by the
labour ministry said they would have to take action. Half the sample had
previously carried out some sort of employment adjustment amid the country's
three-year economic downturn.
As the Japanese lifetime employment system inhibits compulsory redundancies,
measures commonly include transferring workers to affiliates and offering
early retirement incentives. But the number of new programmes of this type
reported is falling.
The government's Economic Planning Agency said yesterday the economy was on
the dividing line between recession and recovery, according to its diffusion
index for June. The coincident index, reflecting prevailing conditions,
stood at 50 per cent. It had been above that level for the past three
months, achieving its most optimistic recent scores of 60 per cent in April
and May, but the agency said the fall was milder than expected.
The leading index, which projects conditions three to six months ahead,
stood at 54.5 per cent, compared with 58.3 per cent in May. It was the sixth
successive reading above the boom-or-bust level. The lagging index rose to
42.9 per cent, below the halfway mark for the ninth month in a row but up
from 14.3 per cent in May.
The EPA spoke of a heightened possibility the economy was moving into
recovery, and dropped a previous description of conditions as sluggish. But
it warned the July index might show no progress, because of weak industrial
output.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Dear Leader's succession may be in trouble

<TEXT>
The delay in the official appointment of Mr Kim Jong-il to the top
leadership positions in North Korea is fuelling speculation in Seoul that
his assumption of power may be in trouble following the death of his father,
President Kim Il-sung, six weeks ago.
A report yesterday by South Korea's state news agency that leaflets
denouncing Mr Kim were scattered in the foreign diplomatic section of
Pyongyang is the latest in a recent spate of largely unconfirmed stories
claiming that the Dear Leader may be facing growing opposition to his rule.
The incident coincides with a North Korean radio broadcast that warned that
'acts of betrayal by ambitious persons and conspirators' could undermine the
ruling party unless the issue of Mr Kim's succession is solved soon.
But there is otherwise little solid evidence to determine if Mr Kim is
losing control of the secretive country. Speculation about his status has
been fuelled by his failure so far to be named to the three most powerful
positions in the country: general-secretary of the ruling Korean Workers'
party, national president, and chairman of the party's central military
committee.
His absence from public view since his father's lavish funeral in mid-July
has also caused uncertainty, although Mr Kim is known for being reclusive.
The haggard appearance of the 52-year-old Mr Kim at the funeral services
prompted rumours he is in poor health. The diplomatic corps in Pyongyang has
speculated for years on the issue.
Seoul government analysts, who believe that the delay in Mr Kim's takeover
may be due to his failing health, have cited as evidence North Korean
broadcasts that quote citizens wishing him good health.
North Korean diplomats abroad have dismissed talk about a problem in the
succession, explaining that the delay in the transfer of power is due to an
extended period of mourning for the dead that is traditional in Korea.
Some western analysts in Seoul agree with that explanation. 'It might appear
unseemly for Kim Jong-il to take charge quickly. It could take several
months for the party and parliament formally to convene and nominate him to
the leadership posts,' Mr Michael Breen, an analyst for Merit Consultancy in
Seoul.
But he added that if the transfer of power is not completed by the end of
the year, it could signify that Mr Kim is indeed in trouble.
Many analysts agree with the recent assessment by Mr Lee Hong-koo, the South
Korean deputy prime minister for national unification, that Mr Kim may be
delaying his formal assumption of power until he arranges a reshuffle of top
officials and promotes a younger generation of technocrats loyal to him.
This could be a 'complex and time-consuming process' in a society based on a
strong hierarchical structure, Mr Lee declared.
The most serious source of opposition to Mr Kim is believed to be from the
military-backed old guard who supported his father, but distrust the younger
Kim's revolutionary credentials because of his supposed belief in economic
reforms and the gradual opening of the isolated country to the outside
world.
North Korea may now be following a common historical pattern in Korea in
which the death of a powerful leader usually triggers a generational shift
in leadership. One indication that Mr Kim may be successful in achieving
control was the recent return of his step-brother and potential rival, Mr
Kim Pyong-il, to Helsinki as North Korean ambassador after spending several
months in Pyongyang.
If the power transfer is proceeding smoothly, analysts expect Mr Kim will
assume formal leadership either on September 9, the anniversary of the
establishment of North Korean state in 1948, or October 10, the 49th
anniversary of the founding of the ruling party.
The US and South Korea will be closely watching for any changes in North
Korea's recent framework agreement to open its nuclear facilities to
international inspections. A retreat by Pyongyang on this accord could
indicate the growing strength of the North Korean military in a possible
power struggle. South Korea is reluctant to hold a proposed summit meeting
with North Korea, postponed because of the death of President Kim, until the
Pyongyang succession is completed.

FT  24 AUG 94 / S Africa cautious on scrapping currency controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Liberalisation of South Africa's exchange control regulations will not be
possible until the country gets an international credit rating, Mr Chris
Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, said yesterday.
Delivering his annual report in Pretoria, Mr Stals said it was clear the
existing system would have to be scrapped to ensure sustainable, long-term
growth for the country.
'In the long run and in the interest of future economic growth, South Africa
must liberalise its foreign exchange market and revert to a system of
unitary floating exchange rates,' he said.
However, Mr Stals noted that in other countries exchange controls were
abolished only as part of a macro-economic restructuring programme, often
with the help of international institutions, and that at the very least
South Africa must wait until it had full access to international capital
markets.
South Africa's two-tier currency comprises the commercial rand, used for all
regular balance of payments transactions, and the financial rand, used by
foreigners as a discounted investment currency. Exchange restrictions have
been in place since the 1960s.
'The abolition of exchange controls in isolation without any supportive
measures may cause serious disruptions in the initial phase of the
transition and force the reintroduction of old controls, or even the
application of other new direct controls over markets, all of which may be
more damaging to the economy,' he said.
South Africa has appointed Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, to help it
get an international credit rating from the main agencies, a process
expected to be completed by October.
In addition, Mr Stals reiterated his previously stated preconditions for the
scrapping of the financial rand, including a narrowing of the differential
between the two exchange rates and a rise in foreign reserves, currently
able to cover only five weeks' imports.
In recent months, continued speculation over demise of the investment
currency has led to severe gyrations in its exchange rate, while fears over
the inflationary pressures such a move might unleash have contributed to
soaring government bond rates.
Responding to the recent upturn in the inflation rate, which rose in June to
7.5 per cent from a 21-year low of 7.1 per cent in April, Mr Stals signalled
that the Reserve Bank would probably have to tighten monetary policy to help
lower inflationary expectations and cautioned the new government against
trying to increase spending.
'Many of us have a desire to force-feed the economy beyond its actual
potential and to exert pressure on the monetary system to accommodate these
desires by simply creating more money,' he warned.
Mr Stals also said that while he was confident the country's capital account
would continue to improve, it would be 'naive' to believe that huge amounts
of capital would flow into the country even if exchange controls were
lifted. Social and political stability, economic viability, sound fiscal and
monetary policies and productivity improvements were of even greater
importance for most foreign investors.

Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama arrived in the Philippines
yesterday to be confronted by angry women demanding compensation for being
used as sex slaves in the second world war, Reuter reports from Manila.
Police kept about 50 of the women, waving banners demanding 'Compensation
Now', more than 100 metres from the luxury Manila Hotel where Mr Murayama
was staying. The women are demanding Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 130,000) each
in compensation. They were led by Ms Rosa Henson, the first Filipina to end
decades of shamed silence in 1992 and tell of her experience as one of
200,000 women forced to work as prostitutes for Japanese soldiers.
Mr Roberto Romulo, the Philippine foreign minister, told reporters the
comfort women issue would be discussed when Mr Murayama and President Fidel
Ramos hold formal talks today. Mr Murayama is expected to repeat apologies
for Japan's wartime atrocities as well as discuss economic and security
issues with leaders of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore
during a week-long swing through the region.
Mr Ramos will seek to boost trade with Japan and ask for an increase in
official development assistance to the Philippines, which amounted in 1993
to Dollars 721.5m. Japan, the Philippines' leading donor, recently pledged
Dollars 1.5bn in assistance for 1994. Total trade between the two countries
reached Dollars 5.8bn in 1993, up by 20 per cent from the previous year.
About 200,000 comfort women, most Koreans but also Filipinas, Chinese,
Taiwanese, Indonesians and Dutch, were forcibly recruited by the Japanese
army in the war to provide sex for their troops.

Lesotho's king must reinstate the democratically elected government he
ousted last week, South African President Nelson Mandela said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Cape Town.
King Letsie III's representatives failed to make their case to Mr Mandela
and other African leaders gathered at a summit in Gaborone, Botswana. After
returning from Botswana, Mr Mandela said King Letsie and Prime Minister Ntsu
Mokhele would attend a meeting in South Africa tomorrow.
'We feel the government of Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhele must be reinstated
and it is on this basis that we are going to have a discussion with both
parties,' Mr Mandela said.
Last week, Mr Mandela and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe appeared to
rule out military intervention in Lesotho.
King Letsie was also facing mounting pressure at home. Lesotho businesses
observed the second day of a general strike to protest against the
government's dissolution. Shops were closed and school children stayed away
from classes.

<TEXT>
Destruction of the earth's protective ozone shield is continuing in both
southern and northern hemispheres, according to the World Meteorological
Organisation, Frances Williams reports.
The WMO says that in March this year, ozone levels over western Europe were
10-20 per cent below normal. For the winter-spring 1994 period, levels over
the entire northern hemisphere averaged 2-3 per cent below seasonal
long-term values. While this did not match the record ozone deficiency of 17
per cent in February and March 1993, the WMO says the cumulative ozone
decline since the 1970s over the northern hemisphere is continuing.
In the Antarctic, which experienced the worst-ever ozone 'hole' in autumn
1993, ozone levels also fell well below normal (for pre-ozone 'hole' years)
between February and April 1994.

Sony, the Japanese consumer electronics group, is planning a Dollars 10m
investment in India to market and make colour TVs, broadcasting equipment,
software and other high-tech products, Stefan Wagstyl reports from New
Delhi.
The company, which secured approval for its proposals this week from the
Indian government, intends to start local production of television tubes and
other components over the next three years.
Sony has yet to announce details of its investment programme, which is
modest in an industry in which a single large factory can cost Dollars 100m
and more. But Sony's decision will be a boost for India's economic
liberalisation policies.
The relevant government committee has approved 65 projects which together
envisage foreign investment totalling Rs5bn (Pounds 102m). Other proposed
ventures include a co-operation between the state-owned Indian Telephone
Industries and NKT Electronic of Denmark to make fibre optic transmission
systems.

<TEXT>
The UN hopes to mount its biggest-ever human rights operation in an attempt
to persuade millions of Rwandan refugees to return home, Frances Williams
reports from Geneva.
Despite appalling conditions in the overcrowded camps in neighbouring Zaire
and elsewhere along Rwanda's borders, the 2.1m mainly Hutu refugees have so
far been reluctant to go back to Rwanda for fear of reprisals from the
Tutsi-dominated Rwandese Patriotic Front government.
Under a proposal by Mr Rene Degni-Segui, special UN human rights rapporteur
for Rwanda, which has been accepted in principle by the RPF government, up
to 200 human rights monitors would be deployed throughout Rwanda to ensure
there were no such reprisals, and to help investigate the massacres of some
500,000 civilians, mainly Tutsi, by supporters of the former Hutu-led
administration.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, has asked the committee of
legal experts charged with collecting evidence on violations of
international humanitarian law to report their findings by the end of
October. This could be followed by a UN decision to set up an international
tribunal to try the guilty.
In his second report on human rights violations in Rwanda released
yesterday, Mr Degni-Segui expressed concern that Radio Television Libre des
Mille Collines, operated by the former Rwandan government, was still urging
Hutus to leave Rwanda and was threatening reprisals against those who
returned. Only about 100,000 refugees have so far gone back. Apart from
those outside Rwanda, 1m-2m people remain displaced within the country.

France's visible trade surplus dipped to FFr6.25bn (Pounds 750m) in June
from a revised FFr7.62bn in May, according to seasonally adjusted data
released by the Customs Office. A sectoral breakdown of the adjusted trade
data revealed that gains in food and energy trade offset a decline in the
industrial and military surplus to FFr3.83bn from FFr6.37bn. The food
surplus advanced to FFr3.67bn from FFr2.78bn, while the energy deficit
narrowed to FFr5.81bn from FFr6.24bn. Figures on trade with France's leading
trading partners showed that its surplus with the other 11 members of the
European Union fell to FFr1.19bn from FFr2.38bn, although the surplus with
Germany widened substantially to FFr901m from FFr188m. France's deficit with
Japan widened slightly to FFr2.16bn from FFr2.13bn, while the deficit with
the US narrowed to FFr1.38bn from FFr1.43bn. Also yesterday the national
statistics office INSEE reported that French consumer prices were unchanged
in July from June, for a year-on-year rise of 1.7 per cent.
The annual rate of inflation in the European Union fell 2 percentage points
year on year to a seven-year low of 3 per cent in July, the European
Commission's statistics office reported. It was the first drop in the annual
rate in five months, and takes the figure to the lowest point since March
1987, Eurostat said.
Hungary's industrial output rose 8 per cent by volume in the first half of
1994 compared with the first half of 1993, the Central Statistical Office
reported. It said production fell a seasonally adjusted 2.7 per cent in June
from May.
Net Spanish tourism receipts rose 30 per cent in the first six months of
1994, against the same period last year, to stand at Ptas 959.6bn (Pounds
4.8bn), the tourism secretariat said.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Kuchma acts on exchange rate: Ukraine leader's decree falls
far short of complete liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Leonid Kuchma yesterday sent a mixed message about Ukraine's
prospects for economic reform with a decree intended to unify the country's
currency exchange rates.
The decree sets out, without a specific timetable, to close the yawning gap
between the official state-set exchange rate for the karbovanets and the
open market rate. It proposes to do so through a complicated mathematical
formula based on Ukraine's balance of payments, monetary emissions and
inflation rate.
But, as the first litmus test of the new administration's resolve to bring
Ukraine's chaotic economy to heel, the decree falls far short of complete
liberalisation of a single free-floating rate, advocated by the
International Monetary Fund. It does not specify when the rates will be
unified or even guarantee this will happen.
At a press conference, Mr Kuchma's economic advisers, who said the decree
was a compromise with advocates of a fixed rate, hoped that the karbovanets
would be free-floating by the end of the year. They justified the gradualist
approach by saying it would avoid an immediate inflation shock and give the
government an opportunity to build up its hard currency reserves to support
a free floating currency.
Mr Kuchma's economic team intends to abandon its mathematical approach to
the exchange rate in favour of market forces once a stabilisation fund,
provided by the IMF, is available.
The decree also reopens the inter-bank currency exchange, blamed and closed
last November for stoking inflation, and lowers a punitive tax on hard
currency revenues.
However, Mr Kuchma, who still has time to set a reformist agenda in the
honeymoon period following his election earlier this summer, may not
completely satisfy an IMF mission now in Kiev, working on a reform programme
to free a Dollars 700m initial loan. The loan would be the first step to
releasing a Dollars 4bn package promised at last month's Naples economic
summit.
Currency liberalisation is seen as critical by western economists because
the current restrictions are a principal contributor to market distortions
and a massive capital flight.
The karbovanets, an unstable currency which replaced the Russian rouble in
1992, yesterday traded for around 46,800 to the dollar on the street; the
official rate, used by privileged importers and less fortunate exporters,
was set this week at 20,500:1.
With the currency losing its value daily, trying to unify the rates 'is a
little like a dog chasing his tail', said a western economist, particularly
now that Ukrainians will hold on to their hard currency if the official
state rate is set to go up.
The step, long-awaited in Kiev, does tip a hat to reform by reducing from 50
per cent to 30 per cent the share of hard currency revenues that companies
must exchange at the lower official rate. This causes capital flight,
estimated at Dollars 1bn per month, and creates a shadow economy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's 1995 budget will give priority to cutting public sector deficits
and reducing social security charges, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, budget minister,
said yesterday.
Mr Sarkozy, who is aiming to reduce the budget deficit to FFr275bn (Pounds
33.6bn) from a targeted FFr300bn this year, added that income taxes would
only be lowered if deficit targets were not jeopardised.
He took a tough line on reducing expenditure to prevent a rise in interest
rates and support France's economic recovery. 'Today, growth is there, but
we must consolidate. To do that, we must avoid an increase in interest rates
by controlling indebtedness and reducing the deficit,' he said.
French long-term interest rates have already risen by more than 2 percentage
points this year, partly because of the turmoil in international bond
markets.
The strong performance of the German economy, which has raised concerns
about the Bundesbank's willingness to reduce interest rates further, has
also prompted economists to question the scope for cuts in France's
short-term borrowing costs.
Mr Sarkozy is due to present his budget proposals at the end of September
and is seeking to reinforce an impression of fiscal discipline ahead of next
spring's presidential elections.
Said one economist at a French merchant bank: 'The government is anxious to
demonstrate its credibility. That means talking tough and sticking to their
targets.'
The minister played down the significance of a fall in manufacturing
production in June, claiming that the underlying trend had shown steady
improvement. The fact that 92,000 jobs had been created since the start of
the year demonstrated that government policy was yielding results.
Next year's budget plan is believed to based on 3 per cent growth in gross
domestic product, compared with 2 per cent this year. Economics ministry
officials declined to comment on the growth projections, but said the
economy had recovered more quickly than expected this year.
France's Socialist party, banking on worsening rivalries within the ruling
centre-right, may delay choosing a presidential candidate until next year,
Mr Henri Emmanuelli, party leader, told Le Monde newspaper yesterday. The
presidential election is due next April.
Although neither has formally declared his candidacy, the Gaullist prime
minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, and former premier Mr Jacques Chirac are
engaged in a bitter rivalry for the conservative nomination.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Benetton grand prix team changes gear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Benetton Formula, the leading grand prix racing team this year, is ending
its eight-year partnership with Ford, its engine supplier, in favour of
Renault. The French carmaker announced yesterday it had reached agreement to
supply Formula One engines to the Benetton team for the next three years
starting in 1995.
The deal comes only two weeks after the British Williams racing team renewed
its contract with Renault to supply engines for three more years.
The Renault coup of securing contracts with two of the leading F1 teams is a
considerable blow to Ford and to Cosworth Engineering, a subsidiary of
Vickers, which builds the engines for Ford.
The Benetton team, with its German driver Michael Schumacher, is currently
leading the 1994 Formula One world championship having won seven of the
season's first 10 races.
Despite its success with the Ford Zetec-R V8 engine built by Cosworth,
Benetton has decided that its fortunes next year will be enhanced by using
the same Renault engines as the Williams team, its arch rival.
Mr Flavio Briatore, managing director of Benetton Formula, said he was
confident that the new partnership with Renault would 'enhance the
performance of both parties.'
Renault said that the deals with Benetton and the Williams racing team
underlined its resolve to maintain a long-term presence in Formula One. 'The
objective is to win grand prix and to be champion of the world,' said Mr
Patrick Faure, director of Renault Sport. 'Our presence in Formula One is
only justified by winning.'
Renault said nothing had been hidden from the Williams team. 'At the
beginning they were not very enthusiastic. But they understood our
arguments,' the company said. Benetton and Williams would be supplied with
identical engines in 1995.
The attraction for Renault is to be teamed with Michael Schumacher, who has
emerged as the leading Formula One driver this season, ousting Williams from
the head of the championship.
Ford, which mounts one of the biggest motor sports programmes of any of the
world's carmakers, sought last night to put a brave face on the loss of the
Benetton contract.
Mr Peter Gillitzer, director of Ford Motorsport strategy in Europe, said the
company was 'presently reviewing' its plans. 'The success of the Ford
Zetec-R engine is unquestioned and it still has substantial development
potential. It is a very competitive unit. We are currently talking to a
number of people about our future strategy.'
Ford Cosworth engines are being used by five teams in this year's
championship, including Minardi, Arrows Footwork, Simtek and Larrousse, but
the Benetton team is its key contract.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Tidal wave of roubles engulfs tiny Caucasus 'offshore zone':
Russian companies are queueing to enter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past few weeks television screens across Russia have been flooded
with a shadowy image of a group of weary businessmen discussing their
difficult encounters with Russia's demanding taxman. Then a door flies open
and light streams into the room. 'Your tax problems are over,' a reassuring
voice croons. 'Register your company in the republic of Ingushetia and you
will be freed from taxes.'
At a time when Russia's airwaves are crowded with the mellifluous but empty
promises of dream merchants, this remarkable offer is actually genuine.
A presidential decree which came into force on July 1 has given the republic
of Ingushetia, a small region in the Caucasus next door to war-torn
Chechnya, the right to become an 'ofshornaya zona', the newly coined Russian
term for offshore tax haven.
Only fully privately-owned companies may register in the offshore zone, but
for those who do the benefits are tremendous: companies legally registered
there pay no local or regional taxes, only 20 per cent of federal taxes and
just half of regular import and export tariffs.
These benefits have not been lost on Russian businessmen, who are making
their way in droves to a group of gleaming white marble buildings set in a
grove of fir trees on the outskirts of Moscow. These are the booming
headquarters of the Bin Financial Corporation, the sole company empowered by
the Ingush government to register companies in the offshore zone.
Sitting on a soft leather sofa beneath pink chandeliers, Mr Mikhail
Gutseriev, the 36-year-old president of Bin and architect of the offshore
scheme, cannot quite believe his luck. He came up with the idea two years
ago when, in what has become standard practice for Russian businessmen, he
set up an offshore company in Cyprus.
'I thought to myself, why should these offshore zones, where me and my
friends were putting all of our money, exist only abroad?' said Mr
Gutseriev, an ethnic Ingush who fled the embattled Caucasus two years ago to
make his fortune in Moscow. 'I thought, why not create one here in Russia?'
For Russia's leaders, already facing a huge shortage of revenue and
struggling to prevent capital flight, making it simple and legal to avoid
taxes seems incredible. However, permitting the Ingush republic to establish
itself as an offshore tax haven presents a clear political advantage for the
Kremlin. Ethnically related to the Chechens, whose successful and stubborn
assertion of independence over the past two years has been a thorn in the
Russia's side, Ingushetia has become one of Moscow's scarce allies in the
unstable Caucasus region.
'(Russian President) Yeltsin and (Russian Prime Minister) Chernomyrdin saw
that this off-shore zone could help to stabilise the Caucasus,' Mr Gutseriev
explains. 'Its time for everyone there to stop running around with
machine-guns and start running around with money.'
This principle seems to have been taken to heart by the Russian and foreign
companies beating a trail to Bin offices in Moscow and several other cities
in Russia. 'The demand is absolutely unlimited,' Mr Gutseriev claims. 'We
get between 500 and 600 phone calls a day from all parts of Russia.' The
zone is bringing in about Dollars 100,000 a day just from the Dollars 4,000
registration fee companies must pay.
However, that registration price - paid so far by more than 1,200 companies,
half of them in Moscow - is just the first part of the financial windfall
for the Ingush republic and Mr Gutseriev's company. Those federal taxes and
customs duties paid by companies in the offshore zone do not go into the
Kremlin's coffers; they belong entirely to the tiny, impoverished
Ingushetia.
Over the next two years, Mr Gutseriev estimates that registration fees and
taxes will produce at least Dollars 1bn. About 10 per cent of that goes to
Bin, which is also prospering thanks to another provision of the scheme. To
benefit from the offshore zone's tax breaks, registered companies must do
all their banking through the Bin bank, which is part of the Bin group of
companies.
This clause is bringing in so much money that Mr Gutseriev can hardly
contain himself. Racing over to his desk, he produces the bank's daily
balance sheet. 'Rbs23bn (Pounds 6.9m at the market rate) flowed into our
accounts today alone,' he says. 'And its like this every single day. We have
so much money I don't know what to do with it any more. Perhaps you have
some investment suggestions?'
Mr Gutseriev's main concern is that Bin and the Ingush offshore zone will
become victims of their own success. His voluble account of his scheme's
progress is occasionally interrupted as he reminds himself: 'Maybe I
shouldn't be telling you all of this, because if people discover how much
money we are making we will be in mortal danger from the mafia.'
His other fear is that, as more and more companies register, other regions
will lobby for the same privilege, and political pressure will mount to stem
the flow of money out of the federal treasury. 'It's absurd,' commented one
western businessman. 'If this is allowed to continue, pretty soon all of the
Russian economy will be registered offshore and no one will formally be left
doing business in Russia itself.'

<TEXT>
Albania urged the US and the Nato alliance yesterday to press Greece to stop
'provocative acts'. This marks a further deterioration in relations between
the two Balkan neighbours, at odds over the ethnic Greek minority in
Albania. President Sali Berisha recalled Albania's envoy from Athens on
Monday as a protest, after a Greek aircraft flew over Albanian territory
dropping leaflets calling for the overthrow of the Tirana government.
Albania brushed aside Greece's explanation that the flight was an act of a
renegade aviator who stole a crop-duster, and has accused Athens of
launching a 'Cold War' against Tirana. Tensions have risen since the trial
for spying of five ethnic Greeks opened in Tirana this month. Greece says
the trial is aimed at intimidating Albania's Greek minority.

German interior minister Mr Manfred Kanther yesterday ordered the German
domestic security agency, the BfV, to monitor the far-right Republicans to
see if the party should be listed as group opposed to the constitutional.
This follows the Republicans' announcement of an alliance with the
nationalist German People's Union (DVU). Mr Franz Schonhuber of the
Republicans and Mr Gerhard Frey of the DVU announced they would work
together to unite nationalist forces before the October 16 general election.
Reclassifying the Republicans as anti-constitutional would not bar them from
elections, but they would be under constant surveillance. The two party
leaders, previously rivals, are united in opposition to proposals to
liberalise German citizenship laws to allow dual nationality.

A top adviser to Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said yesterday that an
ambitious project to build an oil terminal near the Black Sea port of Odessa
should be re-examined and at the very least scaled down. The terminal is
aimed at reducing Ukraine's dependence on Russian oil imports, possibly by
importing oil from the Middle East. Plans call for an annual capacity of 40m
tonnes, equivalent to Ukraine's needs. 'The question of building an oil
terminal must be re-examined. It is a shame this was approached not from an
economic standpoint but rather under the pressure of political
considerations,' Mr Kuznetsov said. Construction of the terminal was ordered
by Ukraine's former president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk. Work began in May, but
was halted last month by a court order after claims the land for the project
had been acquired illegally.

Magistrates looking into one of Italy's worst ecological disasters have put
110 people under investigation and shut down 48 firms, police said
yesterday. They said the rubbish-lined river Sarno, which empties into the
Gulf of Naples just north of the Amalfi coast resort area, had for decades
been the dumping ground for raw sewage and untreated industrial waste.
Police said some 1,200 tonnes of sea-bound waste had been filtered out since
the investigation began two months ago and all the towns and companies
inspected in the area dumped their waste directly into the river. Those
under investigation include the mayors of San Valentino Torio and Nocera
Superiore. Judicial sources said they expected a further 100 local officials
would be placed under investigation.

France and Germany warned the Bosnian Serbs yesterday they would bear the
responsibility for more bloodshed if they insisted on rejecting the latest
peace plan. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, and his German
counterpart, Mr Klaus Kinkel, called on Bosnian Serb leaders to reconsider
their opposition ahead of a referendum they plan to hold on their territory
next weekend. The two ministers also appealed to Serbian-led Yugoslavia to
allow international monitoring of its blockade against Bosnian Serbs imposed
to force them to accept the peace plan. In the Serb-held part of Croatia, UN
relief officials struggled to provide food and water for thousands of Moslem
refugees who fled fighting in the north-west Bosnian enclave of Bihac. The
refugee exodus followed the defeat of rebel Moslem leader Fikret Abdic,
whose forces were routed by Bosnian government troops two days ago. UN
relief officials said 30,000 refugees were still marooned in miserable
conditions after the Croatian government refused them entry to territory it
controls.

Russia and China, for decades rivals for the leadership of the Communist
world, yesterday took another step towards reconciliation when Russian
officials announced that the two states will sign in September an agreement
not to target strategic missiles at one another. Mr Mikhail Bely, a Russian
foreign ministry official, said the missile agreement would be one of a
number of deals to be concluded during a ground-breaking visit of Chinese
President Jiang Zemin to Moscow next month. The agreement echoes similar
documents Russia has signed with the United States and the UK. The emerging
Sino-Russian detente points to a lessening of military and political
tensions between the two states, which reached a peak with border clashes in
the 1960s. But economic competition between the two countries, particularly
in the booming Pacific Rim region where Russia has restricted the entry of
Chinese traders, is intensifying.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Turkish wrangling delays reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's domestic political wrangling looks set to delay the release of a
much needed World Bank structural adjustment credit, raising doubts over
whether the government can meet its longer term economic recovery targets.
For much of the normally quiet summer months, the conservative-led coalition
of Mrs Tansu Ciller has been taken up with a series of crises, with media
attacks on the prime minister's property acquisitions in the US, legal
setbacks to the privatisation effort, and a controversial cabinet reshuffle
which has raised questions over the government's durability.
With such a hectic agenda, Mrs Ciller has still not responded to the World
Bank's policy recommendations, submitted in mid July, making it increasingly
unlikely that the Bank's board will be able to approve release of a
structural adjustment credit in October as planned.
The Bank's recommendations cover privatisation, public sector enterprise
reform, social security, tax and farm subsidy reform as well as an overhaul
of the entire incentive system. The Bank credit was expected to be in the
range of Dollars 250m-Dollars 500m, released in two roughly equal tranches.
One explanation for the government's failure to respond to the World Bank is
simply official complacency, following what the Bank acknowledges as the
early success in implementing the April 5 stabilisation measures.
However economists point out that many of the steps taken - tax charges on
the wealthy, fuel tax surcharges - are one-off measures, rather than
sustainable sources of revenue for the government. 'Without some movement on
the adjustment issues, Turkey may find itself in a sticky situation next
year,' warned one western economist yesterday.
Adjustment measures are central to the revenue targets announced by Mrs
Ciller. Sales of state companies are earmarked to raise Dollars 5.2bn by the
end of 1994, half of which is destined to help close the deficit which is
targeted to be halved to 9 per cent of GNP.
To date, the only significant sell-off is a 21 per cent minority stake in
the privately managed Tofas car company, a joint venture with Fiat of Italy
and a local producer.
Rulings from the constitutional court, Turkey's supreme legal authority,
currently block the government's use of decree powers to speed up
privatisation. Last week the court passed an injunction to freeze the
legislation passed by parliament to sell off the telecommunications monopoly
PTT.
With GNP growth in 1994 expected to slow down more sharply than anticipated,
economists point out that tax collection is also likely to drop, making it
doubly vital to take the adjustment measures.

said to contain information the company considers confidential and it
credits Absolut's huge popularity to advertising firms in the US, rather
than to company officials in Sweden. After the author, Mr Carl Hamilton

FT  24 AUG 94 / Big Mac chokes on Kassel takeaway tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It's been a difficult summer in Germany. First, 80kph speed limits were
introduced temporarily on some of the country's speed-ridden Autobahns. Now,
the price of the beloved Bratwurst could rise following a court decision
allowing new taxes on fast food packaging.
'Here's comes the tax on Currywurst and Big Macs]' warned Bild Zeitung,
Germany's biggest circulation newspaper. How exactly consumers will react is
a matter for speculation. So far, only Kassel in central Germany is levying
the tax which it introduced in July 1992, charging 50 pfennig on each
synthetic plate and 20 pfennig on disposable cups.
Two McDonalds restaurants and two makers of drinks dispensers promptly sued
the Kassel authorities but last Friday the federal administrative court
swept aside any doubts that the tax was legal.
Normally sleepy Kassel has rarely hit the headlines so dramatically. The
town hall switchboard is jammed and Mr Hans-Jurgen Schweinsberg, the
municipal spokesman, says at least 750 people have rung asking for details
about the new charge.
McDonalds, which runs 535 restaurants in Germany, has vowed meanwhile that
it will use every legal means to fight what its spokesman called 'this
absurd tax' - including taking the case to the European Court. It warned
that prices of some cheaper items could rise by a quarter and said it was
doing everything possible to reduce waste through a corporate environmental
programme which has been running since 1987. Since then napkins have shrunk
by 18 per cent - saving 204 tonnes of paper annually - and hamburgers are
now wrapped in paper which is 72 per cent recyclable.
Kassel officials, who dreamt up the tax to reduce the city's annual 500m
tonne rubbish mountain, are not impressed and claim it works better than
Germany's complicated Duales System, a nationwide network which guarantees
to recycle all packages and materials which carry the 'Green Spot'.
Says Mr Schweinsberg: 'The Duales System is not much help if you want to
reduce the amount of waste. All it does is provide you with a method to
recycle it.'
Kassel claims morover that bad habits are changing. Many snack stands now
serve chips in ice cream cones and give customers their drinks in glasses
for which they charge a deposit. Milk, often served in throw-away plastic
containers, is now available in small jugs.
Last year, the tax raised DM30,000 (Pounds 12,600) for Kassel. So far, this
year, the figure is only DM5,000 - the best evidence, according to Mr
Schweinsberg, that the mountain of fast food packaging is getting smaller.
Another bonus for the town authorities is that the four companies which
brought the action now owe about DM1m in unpaid back taxes.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Chernomyrdin 'to expose' army graft

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin is preparing an all-out attack on
corruption in the armed forces, Sevodnya, a leading Moscow daily, reported
today.
The newspaper alleges that army generals, who are appealing to the
government for more funds and warning that the military may be unable to pay
soldiers' salaries in the autumn, are siphoning off money from the armed
forces' budget.
Citing unnamed sources close to Mr Chernomyrdin, Sevodnya claims that the
prime minister, who is struggling to resolve Russia's mounting debt crisis
without triggering a new round of inflation, plans to expose and oust
corrupt senior generals.
The newspaper's story, which reporters say was leaked by high-ranking
military officials, alleges that generals in the armed forces' Central
Budget and Financial Administration are profiting by earning interest from
military funds which they claim have been lost in Russia's labyrinthine
financial system. The funds are eventually found and returned to the
military treasury, but not before serious delays in the payment of the armed
forces' bills have occurred.
This allegation comes in the wake of government claims last week that the
payments' crisis in other sectors of the Russian economy is in part due to
corrupt factory directors and suggests that the government is looking for
culprits on whom to pin the blame for the debt mountain.
The latest controversy comes at a time when the Russian military is already
being shaken by another, more public, crisis. Russia's high command is
trying to send the outspoken and popular officer, General Alexander Lebed,
from his power base in the 14th army in Moldova to command Russian troops in
war-torn Tajikistan, on the Afghan border.
But General Lebed, who resisted the defense ministry's efforts to remove him
from his post and disband the 14th army earlier this month, is proving
difficult to unseat. Colonel Mikhail Bergman, a 14th army officer who is the
general's closest confidant, said that General Lebed has refused to go to
Tajikistan.
'They are trying to push him (General Lebed) away to the periphery,' Colonel
Bergman said. 'They are sending him under fire and hoping that maybe he will
die.'
Colonel Bergman said that if General Lebed were to be removed from his
command of the 14th army for rejecting his new orders, 'we officers and
soldiers of the 14th army will form partisan brigades'.
Together with the corruption allegations, whose high-level military sources
suggest an internal effort to undermine General Pavel Grachev, the minister
of defence, General Lebed's recalcitrance indicates growing rifts within the
ministry which was once the pride of the Soviet Union. General Lebed, whose
calls for the imposition of a military dictatorship and scathing
denunciation of Russia's government has made him the darling of the officer
corps, could become a locus for disaffected soldiers.
Colonel Bergman is unstinting in his praise of the young general, whom he
describes as 'a second Kutuzov', in a reference to the military leader who
brought Russia victory in the Napoleonic wars. Colonel Bergman describes
General Lebed as 'twice as strong as Arnold Schwarzenegger with a memory so
powerful he need never commit anything to paper'.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Recovery at Lloyd's may be delayed by bad debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bad debts and declining investment returns - as well as the continuing
burden of claims on policies underwritten in the 1980s and earlier - will
hold back the expected recovery in profits at Lloyd's, according to Chatset,
the company which monitors the London insurance market.
Chatset expects Lloyd's to report a profit of Pounds 800m for the 1993
underwriting year, when results are reported in 1996, in line with the
market's three-year accounting system.
It estimates, however, that up to Pounds 500m of the profit might be needed
to meet so-called long-tail liability insurance claims arising from US court
awards for asbestos-related diseases, pollution and other health hazards.
Such claims can emerge years after policies were underwritten.
Lloyd's hopes to tackle the problem by setting up a new reinsurance company,
NewCo, early in 1996, into which it aims to transfer all liabilities on
policies sold before 1986.
Aside from this, says Chatset, 'two horrors lurk - worsening investment
returns, exacerbated by inadequate reserves for bad debts, and further
reinsurance failures'.
The fall in investment returns on premiums, mainly as a result of recent
turmoil in international bond markets, will hit results for the years
1992-94, for which accounts are still to be closed.
During 1993, syndicates earned returns of some 6 per cent on their
investments. But the first half of 1994 has produced a 'dismal return', the
average across the market being a profit of 0.5 per cent on dollar
investments and a loss of 2 per cent on sterling investments.
Chatset expects the situation to improve in the second half of 1994, but
says that 'it will remain a disastrous year for investment' with returns
down 'perhaps' by between Pounds 200m and Pounds 300m.
Overall, Chatset expects Lloyd's to post a loss for the 1992 year of Pounds
135m, when results are reported next year. Again though, this deficit will
increase substantially when the extra reserves for earlier years are taken
into account.
Total bad debts due to unrecoverable reinsurance claims, as a result of the
failure of a number of reinsurance companies, could account for more than
Pounds 300m. The figure is already taken into account in the 1991 loss of
some Pounds 2bn, but similar problems could depress results in future years,
Chatset believes. Chatset notes that the 'failure of insurance companies has
continued apace', with the list including the subsidiaries of London United
Investments, the financial conglomerate which collapsed in 1990.
The market's total losses since 1988 amount to some Pounds 7bn. Earlier this
year it reported a loss of some Pounds 2bn for the 1991 underwriting year.
Lloyd's has already allowed its Names - individuals whose capital supports
the market - to credit some Pounds 440m of the expected 1993 profit against
recent losses. Separately, Chatset is critical of errors and omissions (E&amp;O)
underwriters at Lloyd's, who insure the agents being sued for negligence by
Names. It reports 23 syndicates have increased reserves against potential
E&amp;O claims following the failure of the Lloyd's out of court settlement
offer earlier this year.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Body Shop undergoes US federal probe over franchises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Body Shop International is under investigation by the US Federal Trade
Commission in relation to its franchise operations in North America.
Body Shop last night confirmed the investigation, which focuses on disputes
between the company and its franchisees in the US. It said: 'We are aware of
the FTC inquiries which are routine and about which we have no concerns.'
News of the investigation emerged amid continuing controversy within the
ethical investment sector about allegations concerning the UK-based
cosmetics and toiletries retailer's 'green' and ethical policies.
The FTC refused, as part of its normal policy, to comment on whether any
investigation was taking place into Body Shop. The US agency said it had
undertaken 40 to 50 franchise investigations over the past several years, of
which a majority had led to legal action. However, it stressed that each
case needed to be judged on its merits and none should be pre-judged.
The FTC said its investigations normally considered allegations of unfair or
deceptive practices by franchise operators, or more general breaches of US
franchise rules.
Details of complaints from former Body Shop franchisees in the US form an
important part of a forthcoming article in Business Ethics, a
Minneapolis-based magazine, and other pieces due to be published in the next
few weeks.
In a statement Body Shop, which has about 130 US franchise shops, said: 'It
is standard practice for franchise organisations to have arguments with
franchisees. We have no more arguments in the US than in the UK or any other
country.
'Indeed independent analysts note that we have remarkably few such conflicts
for a company of our size. Government agencies in the US have accused us of
nothing. This is just more scaremongering.'
The FTC is believed to have formally launched its investigation in March,
and it has since issued a number of subpoenas to require witnesses to
testify.
Separately, New Consumer, a Newcastle-based organisation which has
criticised Body Shop International, yesterday made public a letter to the
company calling for information which would allow it to verify the
retailer's 'trade not aid' claims and for details of the ingredients in its
products.
Mr Richard Adams, director of New Consumer, said Body Shop had refused to
provide such information.
Several of the leading UK ethical funds said yesterday they were considering
reviewing their views on Body Shop after details of the allegations became
public.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Silence in HK auction room as developers snub land sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time in a decade, the Hong Kong government auctioneer heard
only silence yesterday when a plot of public land was put on the block. And
for two other prime lots, after almost 10 minutes without a bid, China came
to the rescue with a face-saving offer.
The result of the auction was as much about troubled relations between the
Hong Kong government and developers, as it was about longer-term confidence
in the territory's property market.
The auction hall was packed, as it generally is for the regular government
sell-offs, but the biggest property developers opted to send middle managers
rather than the senior officers who typically attend.
But the lack of bids stirred fears about the fate of Hong Kong property
prices, which have fallen by at least 12 per cent since their peak of March.
The mood has shifted after an estimated 200 per cent leap in prices over the
past three years, when developers competed for commercial and residential
lots offered by the government.
Analysts who argue that the market is not ready for a real fall say the
present turbulence results from the tension between the government and the
developers since plans were announced to cool the market in March by
increasing the flow of land. This tension has been heightened by a
corruption investigation against leading property developers.
Yesterday's auction was, in effect, left in the hands of one bidder,
Chinese-backed Citic Pacific, which clinched two plots at the opening bids
of HKDollars 950m (Pounds 79.4m) and HKDollars 220m - sharply less than
market expectations, which were as high as HKDollars 1.2bn for the first
plot, a residential site which Citic plans to develop into about 300 flats.
Citic's role was a positive sign for some observers who interpreted it as a
vote of confidence from China in Hong Kong's long-term prosperity.
Mr John Corrigall, the auctioneer, stressed that one Tuesday auction was not
wholly indicative of the outlook for the property market, but confessed to
being 'a little disappointed'.
He attributed the poor response to a rise in interest rates. Hong Kong banks
put up their main lending rate by 50 basis points to 7.75 per cent last
Friday.
But there was at least one happy man, Citic's managing director Henry Fan,
who emerged smiling from a scrum of TV crews. 'It was a pleasant surprise,'
he said. 'We never expected the non-existence of competition. We seldom have
the chance even to put our hands up.'
The tension between government and Hong Kong developers is unlikely to end
quickly.
The colony's Independent Commission Against Corruption is now seeking to
establish whether developers colluded at a May land auction to divide up
lots among themselves and minimise their outlays.
But analysts fear that the investigation and attempts to control developers
could harm the property and financial markets. About 65 per cent of the Hang
Seng Index is linked to the property market, and with some private forecasts
of falls of 50 per cent or more in property prices, bidding silences could
become all the more eerie.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Sherlock loses battle with NFC old guard: Pay-out for
transport group chief could reach Pounds 750,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Sherlock has resigned after just 18 months at the helm of NFC, the
UK's largest transport and logistics group. He could receive up to Pounds
750,000 in compensation.
The former Bass director had been brought in to shake up a company
controlled by long-serving NFC executives, but ultimately the old guard won.
Mr Sherlock was on a three-year contract and was paid Pounds 254,618 last
year. NFC would give no indication of the likely compensation being
negotiated, but it will substantially exceed the Pounds 395,000 he received
in 1992 from his similarly sudden departure from Bass.
The NFC share price fell 14 1/2 p to 185 1/2 p on the announcement, which
was accompanied by disappointing third-quarter profits figures.
NFC would provide no reasons for the departure of its chief executive but it
follows a dramatic clash of personality and strategy with fellow director
Robbie Burns, who resigned in May after 23 years with NFC.
Mr Burns has now agreed to rescind his resignation. Mr James Watson,
chairman, and Mr Trevor Larman, finance director, will cover the chief
executive's responsibilities until a replacement is found.
NFC, formerly National Freight Corporation, was bought from the government
by its employees in 1982, and has made significant efforts to retain a large
employee shareholder base and a paternalistic management culture.
Mr Sherlock was the first outsider to be brought in at a senior management
level. He had been expected to provide a fresh perspective and implement a
shake-up of what appeared to be a complacent top management.
Six of the company's directors have been with NFC for more than 20 years and
the commitment to change appears to have been far from unanimous.
Mr Sherlock made himself unpopular with the former chairman, Sir Peter
Thompson, who attacked NFC's handling of a Pounds 263m rights issue last
December, which diluted the proportion of shares held by employees.
One of NFC's corporate quirks is that employee shareholders enjoy double
voting rights so long as they collectively retain more than 10 per cent of
its shares. That barrier is now almost breached, and Sir Peter claimed NFC's
traditional values were being put at risk.
Mr Sherlock also faced the opposition of Mr Burns, who had been successful
in building up Exel, NFC's logistics business, which arranges the
distribution of goods for producers and retailers, and was the engine behind
NFC's profits growth.
Mr Sherlock was also beginning to disappoint the City. Yesterday's profit
statement was well below analysts' expectations. NFC reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 76.6m for nine months to July, against Pounds 63.2m in the
same period last year.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Christie speeds to gold in 100-metres
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
England's Linford Christie salutes the crowd at the Commonwealth Games in
Victoria, Canada, yesterday after taking the gold medal in the 100-metres.
It was the second time he has won the title.
Christie, who has proved himself the world's supreme sprinter in spite of
his age of 34, was in a class of his own as he sped to a Commonwealth Games
record of 9.91 seconds.
Welshman Colin Jackson also retained his 110-metres hurdles title.
However, England's success was marred as it emerged last night that a member
of the Commonwealth Games squad tested positive for drugs at the European
Championships in Helsinki earlier this month.
England team manger Alan Lindop did not name the athlete, but shot-putter
Paul Edwards admitted to reporters he had been told something was amiss with
his Helsinki drug test. However, he denied he had taken a banned substance.

Pakistan has the atomic bomb, opposition leader and former prime minister
Nawaz Sharif (left) admitted. The private PPI news agency reported him as
confirming the fact at a rally in the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir.
In the past, the country said it had the capability to make nuclear weapons
but had decided as a matter of policy not to make them. Some officials said
Mr Sharif's statement could be meant to embarrass the government on home and
foreign policy fronts.

Former United Nations secretary general Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, pictured

he will make an announcement on September 23, on whether to stand in the
Peruvian presidential election next April, Reuter reports from Lima. In a
statement late on Sunday, Mr Perez de Cuellar said he was seriously
considering a request from several sectors of Peruvian society to run for
president. 'I will soon resume my pilgrimage around the country and, on
September 23, I will formally announce my final decision,' he said. Earlier
on Sunday, he had told the meeting at Villa El Salvador that he was 'an
independent candidate.' See Observer, Page 13.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Efforts to curb C0 emissions 'lagging'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Efforts by the industrialised countries to stabilise their carbon dioxide
emissions at present levels will have only a minor effect on the build-up of
C0 concentrations in the earth's atmosphere and so on global warming, a
leading climate change scientist warned yesterday.
Prof Bert Bolin, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), said that even to stabilise CO concentrations at twice present
levels would require all countries, developed and developing, to cut
emissions below 1990 levels.
Stabilisation at 1990 levels by the industrialised nations alone, in line
with commitments under the United Nations climate change convention, would
reduce accumulated emissions over the next century by less than 10 per cent.
'This indicates that current commitments are not sufficient to stabilise
atmospheric concentrations,' Prof Bolin said.
He was addressing representatives of about 150 governments at the start of a
meeting intended to prepare for the first ministerial conference on the
climate change treaty in Berlin next spring.
One of the main issues the meeting must consider is whether to strengthen
the treaty by proposing a new protocol restraining emissions of carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
Berlin conference proposals for treaty amendments would have to be put
forward by the end of September.

FT  23 AUG 94 / More oil losses as Lagos strike turmoil worsens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Further losses in oil production and the continued closure of the main
commercial banks yesterday hindered the plan by Nigeria's military regime to
break the six-week oil industry strike and get the economy back to normal.
Anglo-Dutch Shell, which operates about half of the country's 2m b/d oil
industry, announced yesterday the temporary closure of its Forcados
terminal, which exports about 500,000 b/d. Shell has not disclosed how much
of the other 500,000 b/d produced at its Bonny Terminal is lost because of
political strikes by the two oil workers' unions, Nupeng and Pengassan,
aimed at ending military rule and installing jailed opposition leader Mr
Moshood Abiola as president.
But world oil prices, heavily influenced in recent weeks by events in
Nigeria, fell sharply yesterday despite closure of the Forcados terminal.
The price of the benchmark Brent Blend for October fell to Dollars 15.75 in
late London trading yesterday, 60 cents down on its close last Friday.
Traders say the fact that Nigerian oil exports have been maintained despite
production cuts associated with the strike has reduced market fears of
supply shortages. World supplies of high-quality light crude oils, such as
those produced in most Nigerian fields, are currently plentiful because of
relatively high production levels in the North Sea.
Mr Don Etiebet, oil minister, said yesterday that many of the oil workers
had reported to work after being ordered back to their jobs by the military
ruler, Gen Sani Abacha.
Oil industry officials said, however, it was too early to assess if the
strike had been broken.
The biggest refinery, Port Harcourt, closed more than a week ago. The next
biggest, Warri, has not yet been restored after an overhaul begun in March
and the smaller Kaduna refinery can produce little except fuel oil, of which
there is a surplus since many factories are shut.
The closure for the past month of some of the banks is also causing the
government concern. Mr Aminu Saleh, secretary to the government, warned
banks yesterday that unless they opened by tomorrow he would 'review their
licences'.
Instructions from the government to the four or five biggest commercial
banks, with a wide network of branches throughout Lagos, failed to persuade
them to open their doors to the public yesterday.
Many companies pay salaries through these banks and some employees have been
unable to get their July pay. The big commercial banks, which were all
privatised last year, hold most of the banks' deposits and if the government
closed them it would paralyse the banking system.
The banks, which are not releasing cash to the public, took part yesterday
in the latest auction of foreign exchange in which Dollars 100m will be sold
to manufacturers and importers. The acute shortage of foreign currency in
Nigeria has reduced the auctions from fortnightly to once a month.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Russia may pay compensation to Stalinist victims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Millions of victims of Stalinist repression could be compensated for their
confiscated property as Russia continues to exorcise the trauma of its
Soviet past, writes John Thornhill.
According to the Itar-Tass newsagency, the Russian government has passed a
resolution promising to reimburse innocent victims of repression either by
returning their original property or paying the cash equivalent. Details
remain sketchy and the complications of implementing such a plan are vast.
It is also likely that approval would first be needed from President Boris
Yeltsin.
The scheme would certainly open up a Pandora's box of highly-emotional
claims. During Stalin's 30-year rule, many millions were persecuted,
including whole ethnic groups such as the Russian Germans, Ingushis and
Crimean Tartars. Establishing the claims of respective parties would be
fraught with difficulties.
Itar-Tass reported that all citizens of Russia and the other republics of
the former Soviet Union would be eligible for compensation as well as
foreign and stateless victims. The heirs of the repressed could also inherit
their relatives' claims.

FT  23 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Newspapers up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The beginning of the end of the newspaper price war hove in sight as the Sun
raised its cover price and the rest of the sector breathed a sigh of relief
and saw their share prices respond accordingly.
Some of the more hardened publishing analysts suggested that the decision by
Mr Murdoch's flagship tabloid to lift its price by by 10 per cent to 22p was
cynically timed to soften the effect of News Corp's full year figures
tomorrow. The company is expected to announce profits of ADollars 282m
(Pounds 134.2m) against ADollars 360.5m last time and much of the hit will
have come from the Sun and Times price cuts.
Daily Mail Group bounced 10 to 1025p, Mirror Group 2 to 145p and Daily
Express parent United Newspapers 4 to 547p. However, The Telegraph fell 10
to 368p. SG Warburg consider 359p as a fair price for the stock following
the group's hit from its price cut in June.
Water stocks performed well as one securities house was said to be
recommending them as an income fund play in preference to some regional
electricity companies.
Smith New Court was mentioned as the motor behind the price moves although
the house specialists said their influence was exaggerated. Nevertheless the
leading water stocks stood out and some analysts pointed out that Anglian,
which rose 10 to 567p was now well in line for a return to the FT-SE 100.
Meanwhile Thames improved 8 1/2 to 545p, Severn Trent 5 to 598p and North
West 8 to 577p.
The recs were mixed with Eastern Electricity dipping 7 1/2 to 802p and
London 3 to 702p. There was also some switching into British Gas which held
firm at 302p and was the most heavily traded stock in London with 10m shares
traded. The shortage of stock and some early bidding saw a very brief spate
of 'backwardation', the situation where bid and offer prices are reversed.
A weak oil price and reports of a breakdown at its strike-hit plant in
Nigeria affected Shell Transport in early trading. The shares were down 10
at worst and recovered to close 7 weaker at 714p.
Industrial group Charter advanced 15 to 770p, after it raised its offer for
Esab, the Swedish welding equipment group, and also declared the offer
unconditional.
Defence electricals group GEC gave up 8 to 294p as talk that the company was
lining up a big acquisition did the rounds in the market. Dealers also
attributed the decline to general profit taking following last week's strong
advance, prompted by talk of a bid from industrial giant BTR which has now
faded. BTR ended the session 2 ahead at 378p.
The prospect of new orders from the Middle East cheered engineering group
GKN. The shares added 2 to 628p.
A stock overhang depressed Granada and the shares eased 13 to 502p. Thorn
EMI was firm ahead of today's first quarter figures. The shares hardened a
penny to 1063p.
Stores group Body Shop trailed 7 to 229p following negative press comment on
payment. Lloyds Chemist closed unchanged at 304p, after Goldman Sachs
crossed 1.6m shares at 303 1/2 p.
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel tumbled 14 to 290p, after a weekend press
report said it might cut prices on travelling through the tunnel. The
prospect of stiffer cross-Channel competition weakened ferry operator P&amp;O 10
to 692p. Negative press comment on director's pay at Tiphook left the shares
3 lighter at 32p.
Building and construction stocks were mixed in thin trade ahead of results.
AMEC, which reports in early September, closed 3 up at 115p following a
recommendation from Goldman Sachs but Tilbury Douglas fell 8 to 591p. Shares
in Brandon Hire gained 3 to 84p making a rise of 35 per cent in under four
weeks.
Marley, the materials and automotive components group, is forecast to
provide the first important pointer to the sector's performance with
tomorrow's interim profits. The shares were steady at 155p.
A return to profit and an announcement by chemicals group MTM of the first
dividend for three years saw the share price recover 6 to 85p.

FT  23 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Milk concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Unigate and Northern Foods, two of the UK's leading dairy
producers, eased after both groups issued profits warnings as a row about
government plans to deregulate the milk industry moved into the public
domain.
Speaking as part of the Diary Trade Federation, both companies said current
profits would be hit by Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m respectively on signing up
to supply contracts with Milk Marque, the successor to the Milk Marketing
Board.
The plans are due to take effect in November and both companies said they
were reluctant to sign the deals as they would lead to lower profits, job
cuts and price rises. The DTF said yesterday it was seeking Judiciary revue
over the government's handling of the programme.
Unigate gave up 3 to 374p, in trade of 2.2m and Northern relinquished 7 to
216p, on volume of 4.8m. Several brokers said they were considering
downgrading current-year profits estimates by the stated figures.
Mr Carl Short at Strauss Turnbull said: 'The possibility of farmers creaming
off higher profits, partly at the expense of consumers could lead the
government to consider setting up a regulatory body to oversee Milk Marque
policy.'

FT  23 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo up on talk of US link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals giant Glaxo Holdings resisted the market's nervousness as
the legacy of US buying at the end of last week was helped by support ahead
of figures in a fortnight and takeover optimism.
Reports in the Sunday press that Glaxo was preparing a link with PCS, the US
pharmacy benefits management company recently acquired by Eli Lilly gave an
early lift to the stock which was up 11 at best.
This was further helped by optimism over the full-year dividend.
Pharmaceuticals analyst Mr Robin Gilbert of Panmure Gordon spoke at the
morning meeting and argued that the company would announce a second-half
dividend of 18p this year against 15p last year, giving 27p for the full
year.
Glaxo is set to announce its figures for the year to June on September 8 and
expected to publish profits of around Pounds 1,850m against Pounds 1,675m
last year. The shares ended the day 3 better at 639p.

FT  23 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A recovery in UK gilts helped stock index futures rally off the day's low in
a session that was dominated by renewed fears of inflation and higher
interest rates, writes Joel Kibazo.
There was an early buyer of the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100
after it opened at 3,211 and the buying sent it to 3,214 within minutes of
the opening. This turned out to be the high of the day for the early
interest dried up as sellers emerged, leaving September to drift lower over
the next hour.
Dealers said the premium was substantially eroded which gave traders an
opportunity to unwind arbitrage positions.
The release of revised UK GDP figures for the second quarter once again led
to fears on inflation and talk of an increase in interest rates.
This sent September sharply lower and over the next few hours it tested a
line of resistance as it fell to the day's low of 3,167.
The steady performance of gilts together with a better than expected opening
on Wall Street helped the contract bounce and September finished at 3,183,
down 25 on its previous close and around 9 points above its fair value
premium to cash of about 6 points. Volume was 11,357 lots.
It was a quiet day in traded options and total turnover was 20,598 lots.
Some 8,637 contracts were traded in the FT-SE 100 option.

FT  23 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 fails to hold on to early
gains - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London equity market market launched another determined attack on the
3,200 level on the FT-SE 100 index. But, as with previous recent attempts,
it was rebuffed and the index finished the session weaker after suffering a
sharp decline in mid-afternoon.
At the close the FT-SE index was 20.1 lower at 3,171.3, while the FT-SE Mid
250 index, bolstered by another strong performance by many utility stocks,
ended 4.1 off at 3,749.8.
Once again it was a sharp sell-off in international bonds that triggered a
reversal in equities, although there were plenty of reasons for taking
short-term profits in UK equities, dealers said. They also pointed out that
the UK equity market had outperformed its European counterparts for much of
the day reflecting sizeable switching across the Continent.
London was badly affected by a steep upward revision of Gross Domestic
Product for the second quarter which revived worries in London that the
economy may need to be restrained in order to choke off inflationary
pressures.
Earlier, the trading session begun with the equity market in good form.
Marketmakers hoisted prices at the outset, with the FT-SE 100 almost seven
points ahead at the opening and looking to go better as gilt-edged stocks
made progress.
However, the GDP figure and a sudden sharp fall in German bunds caught the
market on the hop, and a near 10-point rise around 9.00am was transformed
into a near-10 point fall within an hour. The next downward lurch occurred
as Wall Street opened sharply lower and 16 points down, before staging a
moderate rally.
The FT-SE 100 hit the day's low point of 3,164.7, down 26.7, shortly after
US markets opened but then stabilised as cheap buyers emerged.
Senior dealers expressed no real surprise at the market's decline, pointing
to the relatively low level of activity in London where turnover came out at
499.1m shares, well down on recent levels. Non-FT-SE stocks accounted for
almost 62 per cent of turnover in equities.
Customer business was also said to have suffered yesterday and was expected
to come in lower than last Friday's 1.27bn figure.
Market strategists were uneasy over the GDP numbers. One said that although
economic growth was strong there were definite signs that inflationary
pressures were increasing. 'The details mean that second quarter profits
will be better than the market is currently looking for and could also mean
there will be a shift out of bonds, where the market will fret about
inflation, and into equities, ' said one market observer.
A senior trader at one of the UK integrated securities houses said that
while the London market felt okay at current levels and that there had been
no real selling pressure, he was concerned at the absence of support from
London institutions when the big European markets fell away.
The banking sector provided the FT-SE 100's best individual performer in
NatWest where analysts were predicting a strong chart break-out and
forecasting a short term level of 510p. NatWest's potential outperformance
would come at the expense of Barclays and HSBC, it was said.
Utilities were again heavily traded with Smith New Court said to have been
recommending a switch from selective electricity stocks into water shares.
Nikko, the Japanese-owned stockbroker said it was hard to see what was going
to inspire the market in the short term, with no important economic data
this week to inspire or deter the market. The broker did point out, however,
that the market has been boosted of late by bid rumours and that a cash bid
in the FT-SE 100 would provide the momentum for the FT-SE to break through
the 3,200 level.

FT  23 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Bond market puts pressure on
US stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Most US share prices slipped yesterday as a weak dollar triggered further
declines in the bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 3.89 lower at 3,751.22, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 1.37 at 462.31. Volume on
the Big Board was a light 235m shares, as declining issues led advances by a
four-to-three margin. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite
was up a scant 0.32 at 445.77, but the Nasdaq composite had dipped 0.14 to
close at 742.29. Stocks were set back for the fourth straight session as
investors eyed developments in the foreign exchange markets with concern.
The dollar lost further ground against the yen and D-mark amid doubts over
US-Japanese trade talks and sagging confidence in the Clinton
administration. The weak dollar in turn unsettled the Treasury market, where
bonds posted heavy losses.
With no fresh economic data on offer to brighten the picture, share prices
opened with moderate losses, but they managed to improve slightly during the
afternoon.
Cyclical issues across the board posted small losses, as fall-out over last
week's move to higher interest rates showed no sign of abating. One
exception was 3M, up Dollars 1 at Dollars 55.
Eli Lilly shed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 55 7/8 on a report that Glaxo was
interested in buying a piece of the drug maker's business rather than
acquiring the entire company.
On the Nasdaq, Novell gave back Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 14 on the heels of
a profits warnings issued late Friday.
Neutrogena jumped Dollars 6 1/4 to Dollars 34 3/4 after Johnson&amp;Johnson
agreed to buy the soap and shampoo company for Dollars 35 1/4 a share. J&amp;J
edged Dollars  1/8 lower to Dollars 49 1/8 .
Canada
Toronto stocks ended steady for the second straight session, in quiet
trading. The TSE-300 composite edged down 0.66 points, or 0.02 per cent, to
4,186.42, with declines leading advances by 370 to 327.
Mexico
The stock market soared and the peso strengthened against the dollar as
investors cheered the apparent victory of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party in Sunday's presidential election, signalling a
continuation of the government's free-market policies.
The key IPC index of 37 leading shares closed up 50.79 points, or 1.88 per
cent, to 2,758.97.
The new peso firmed 2.5 centavos to close same-day trading at 3.3380/3280
new pesos against the dollar.
Mexican stocks had rallied both in Mexico City and in New York in recent
weeks as polls showed Mr Ernesto Zedillo heading for victory.
On Monday, shares in Telefonos de Mexico were the most actively traded issue
on the New York Stock Exchange, rising Dollars 1.25 to Dollars 66.625.
Brazil
Sao Paulo rallied for the seventh straight session to close up 4.8 per cent
in heavy trade after bullish news on the presidential race sparked a strong
buying bout by foreign and domestic investors.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares ended up 2,475 at 53,858
points. On the Rio bourse, the ISENN surged 4.0 per cent to 20,782 points.
Volume was high at 518.3m reais (Dollars 584.6m).

FT  23 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dollar weakness threatens
earnings-led recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US dollar down by another 3 per cent against the D-Mark in less than two
weeks put more question marks against the proposition of the fast track,
export-led European earnings per share recovery, writes Our Markets Staff.
Weakening bonds, and bond and equity futures markets did the rest.
FRANKFURT fell by more than a percentage point on the session, the Dax index
losing 25.78 at 2,123.79, and weakened again after hours, the Ibis-indicated
Dax ending the afternoon at 2,113.37 after the dollar, US treasuries and
equities opened lower in New York.
Turnover stayed low, falling from DM5.2bn to DM4.7bn. At Merck Finck, in
Dusseldorf, Mr Matthias Welticke said nearly a fortnight ago (when the Dax,
coincidentally, was close to last Friday's level) that it only made sense to
buy German equities at 5 per cent below their historic high, 2,270 on the
Dax, if there were a realistic chance of exceeding this level in the
foreseeable future.
'That requires a fundamental trigger', said Mr Welticke, 'and this can only
be a better outlook for bonds and interest rates.' His colleague, Mr
Horst-Kaspar Greven, noted yesterday that the September bund future was
testing resistance on the downgrade.
Mr Greven added that the past two weeks had seen the beginning of the German
half-year results season - 'below expectations in general,' he remarked,
'but, then, the expectations have been exaggerated.' Yesterday's example was
Mannesmann, down DM7.70 to DM447.80.
MILAN took its cue from the political scene following some positive comments
from government ministers over the weekend. Financial markets were
especially comforted by remarks made by the labour minister indicating that
there would have to be a reform of the pensions system in the 1995 budget,
which is due to be discussed next month.
The Comit index closed 14.99 or 2.3 per cent to 676.14.
Opposition to pensions reform had been one of problems facing the
administration of prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. A feeling that divisions
within the coalition government might be on the mend was sufficient
yesterday to prompt a modest rally, albeit in low volume.
Olivetti was one of day's the biggest gainers, rising L125 to L2,390.
PARIS was shaken by events in the bond market, while general equity activity
remained low. The CAC-40 index slipped 28.70 or 1.4 per cent to 1,972.63,
after a session low of 1,964.
Turnover picked up to FFr3.2bn from Friday's FFr2.2bn.
Eurotunnel, which is not an index constituent, weakened FFr1.40 to FFr24.15
on weekend newspaper reports, on which the company had no comment, that it
might cut prices for freight and car users.
The other Euro-stock, Euro Disney, closed unchanged at FFr10.30. In a
comment on last week's resignation of the group's finance director, Mr
Michael Woodcock of Nikko Europe noted that the news should have come as no
surprise, given the number of senior staff who have left the organisation.
Nevertheless, he added, 'the shares are likely to remain weak, with the
focus on rebuilding image and improving revenues'.
AMSTERDAM weakened in line with the general downward trend on the continent,
although it is seen as particularly vulnerable to the weaker dollar. The AEX
index eased 3.12 to 409.33.
The market was also hosting another week of corporate results.
Gist-Brocades, the biotechnology group, came in with half year figures at
the lower end of expectations and the shares subsequently fell Fl 1.70 to Fl
47.30.
KNP BT, the paper company, which is due to report half year data on
Thursday, was off Fl 1.00 at Fl 48.40 in line with the market.
ZURICH was characterised by lack of confidence in the short term, and low
volume as the SMI index closed 24.6 lower at 2,532.4. Derivatives-led
selling hit prices early in the day and cyclicals came under pressure, BBC
falling another SFr24 to SFr1,176 and Georg Fischer SFr50 to SFr1,460.
However, the picture was little brighter elsewhere, with Roche certificates
down SFr65 at SFr5,625, UBS SFr11 lower at SFr1,080 and CS Holding down
SFr12 at SFr523.
MADRID moved with the declines in the dollar and its domestic bond market
and continued its downward career, nearing the 300 support level as the
general index fell another 2.97 to 303.21.
Banesto's new chairman said that the recently troubled banking and finance
group had entered a new phase which should lead to a relatively rapid return
to profitability; but this did not impress Santander which assumed control
of Banesto after the April 25 auction of the company; Santander's shares
dropped Pta110 to Pta5,050.
STOCKHOLM liked the opposition social democrats' election manifesto,
published late last Friday. Bonds rose and the Affarsvarlden General index
fell only 2.4 to 1,421.3.
HELSINKI, closing early in the day, seemed to ignore trends elsewhere in
most of Europe as domestic bond yields continued to decline and the Hex
index rose 12.8 to 1,888.9, up nearly 20 per cent this year. However, it
closed well below its intraday high of 1,906.4.
TEL AVIV staged a slight recovery following Sunday's 10 per cent fall which
was prompted by a government proposal to introduce a 10 per cent capital
gains tax on share profits from January 1. The stock exchange authorities
had also suspended the 10 per cent limit by which share prices were allowed
to move.
The Mishtanim index yesterday gained 3.72 or 2.25 per cent, to 168.90 in
high turnover of Shk220m. The exchange was closed for two days last week
following the government announcement.

FT  23 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa sees solid gains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equities made solid gains in spite of weakness on European bourses and a
sell-off in the domestic bond market. Dealers said that industrial stocks
remained dull as investors searched for new direction, but gold and mining
related shares showed strength. De Beers bounced back after a decline on
Friday, adding R3 to R110. Anglos were firm, adding R4 to R262.
The overall index added 48 to 5,847, industrials 4 to 6,593 and gold 50 to
2,246.
Housewares, the retail debutante, came in at a premium to its 200 cents
issue price, opening at 250 cents and rising to a session high of 280 cents,
before closing at 265 cents, in turnover of R4m.

FT  23 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei down again in
face of yen's continued strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The yen's continued strength against the dollar eroded investor confidence
and the Nikkei lost ground on arbitrage selling in low volume, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 average fell 118.12 to 20,394.58 after a high of 20,538.21 in the
morning and a low of 20,380.48 in the final hour of trading. Domestic
institutions and dealers remained inactive as arbitrageurs unwound their
positions.
Volume totalled 182.5m shares against 254m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks fell 6.37 to 1,637.45 and the Nikkei 300 declined 1.16 to
297.78. Declines led advances by 642 to 288 with 225 unchanged.
In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged ahead by 0.09 to 1,326.30.
The yen, which rose to a three-month high last Friday, hit share prices of
exporters. Sentiment was also hurt by weak technical data, with the Nikkei
index heading down towards the 26-week moving average.
'The market is opaque on very low volume,' said Mr Alex Kinmont, strategist
at Morgan Stanley, adding that the weakness in high-technology exporters was
having a negative effect on an otherwise stable index.
Meanwhile, some traders feared a recurrence of last year's East Japan
Railway fiasco, when confusion over trading in the railway group's shares
prompted a sharp downturn in share prices following its listing.
Many market participants are wary of a similar situation triggered by Japan
Tobacco's listing in October. 'If Japan Tobacco is priced over Y1m it will
take too much money out of a thin market,' said one analyst.
Most high-technology stocks lost ground. Ricoh lost Y12 to Y946 and Hitachi
declined Y6 to Y979.
Brokers were hurt by the prospects of lower than expected earnings, because
of low trading volume. Nomura Securities fell Y10 to Y2,270 and Daiwa
Securities declined Y50 to Y1,560.
Buying by overseas investors supported steel companies. NKK rose Y1 to Y284
and Kawasaki Steel added Y4 to Y411, but others were lower on profit taking,
with Nippon Steel down Y6 to Y362.
Some drug makers, unaffected by currency movements, gained ground. Sankyo
rose Y30 to Y2,330 and Takeda Chemical Industries added Y10 to Y1,260.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 131.21 to 22,848.85 in volume of 82m shares.
Roundup
Sentiment was generally mixed in the region. Bombay was closed for a two-day
holiday.
SINGAPORE slipped on a bout of profit-taking in blue chips. Foreign
institutions were said to be main culprits behind the selling wave. The
Straits Times Industrial index shed 26.23 to 2,230.94.
Property and shipyard stocks were particularly hard hit, with DBS Land
skidding 8 cents to SDollars 4.58. However, Malaysian shares traded over the
counter extended their recent winning streak, as speculators pushed the UOB
OTC index 8.84 higher to 1,253.97.
KUALA LUMPUR itself closed higher in the heaviest trading in six months, on
speculative buying spurred by a string of takeover announcements in recent
sessions and on renewed hopes for an early general election.
The composite index added 9.50 to 1,150.20 as volume swelled to 591m shares,
the highest since 621.5m on Feb 22. Telekom Malaysia rose 60 cents to
MDollars 21.50.
SEOUL climbed in brisk trade as a widely expected downward correction failed
to materialise. The composite index closed 15.90, or 1.7 per cent firmer at
962.96.
TAIPEI ended off its highs as late profit-taking eroded early gains. The
weighted index finished 32.76 stronger at 6,838.60 after peaking at
6,902.17. Cement shares, laggards in recent sessions, led the winners while
previous favourites such as electronics and plastics dropped on selling by
institutions and brokerage houses.
SYDNEY edged higher in a dull session ahead of a flurry of big corporate
reports later in the week.
Goodman Fielder was the most actively stock, rising by a cent to ADollars
1.48 with 4.4m shares changing hands on renewed talk that it may be taken
over.
The Australian Financial Review reported that Goodman has been soliciting
offers from friendly food groups to fend off major shareholders who have
requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting for October 13 to vote on the
board's composition.
HONG KONG closed higher on late afternoon buying by foreign brokerage
houses. Investors spent most of the day sidelined ahead of today's land
auction and Thursday's announcements of interim results from Cheung Kong and
Hutchison.
The Hang Seng Index firmed 52.89 to 9,457.33; turnover was thin at HKDollars
2.79bn. Much of the late buying was concentrated on the index heavyweights,
HSBC and HK Telecom. HSBC climbed HKDollars 1.25, or 1.4 per cent to
HKDollars 89.25, while HK Telecom added 40 cents to HKDollars 16.65.
However, mainland Chinese stocks suffered as the H-share index lost 17.56,
or 1.4 per cent, to 1,235.11 after sell orders emerged following the release
last week of weaker-than-expected results from Tsingtao Brewery, which ended
five cents lower at HKDollars 6.15.
COLOMBO dropped sharply on the first day of trading since the People's
Alliance came to power last week. Turnover was thin as foreign and domestic
institutional investors awaited further clarification of the new
government's economic policies. The all share index fell 17.21 to 999.92 in
a session dominated by retail selling.

FT  23 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Markets in perspective
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The tightening of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve a week ago today
was warmly received by the world's equity markets, although the performance
was not all one way. Malaysia and Mexico featured on the positive side,
although the latter's 3 per cent gain on the week in local currency terms
could be attributed to expectations ahead of last weekend's presidential
election of a victory for the ruling PRI party.
Malaysia, too, was driven higher as much by domestic news as by that coming
out of Washington. Good inflation data for July helped prompt the upward
move, while an announcement from the central bank on regulatory changes in
an effort to encourage the flow of overseas funds into the country was an
additional stimulant.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Swedish krona recovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A combination of fundamental and technical factors yesterday helped the
Swedish krona stage a sharp recovery on the foreign exchanges, writes Philip
Gawith.
The currency improved on the back of a better tone in the bond markets,
helped by investors who were short of the currency at the end of last week,
needing to square their positions.
The krona finished in London at SKr4.933 against the D-Mark from SKr5.008 at
Friday's close.
Elsewhere, the dollar and sterling continued to suffer at the hands of the
firmer D-Mark. The dollar closed at DM1.5309, from DM1.5396, and at Y97.96
from Y98.47.
Sterling finished over a pfennig lower at DM2.3729 from DM2.3836. Against
the dollar, however, it was firmer, closing at Dollars 1.5501 from Dollars
1.5483. Analysts said that both the dollar and the pound were the victims of
poor sentiment, rather than concerted selling pressure.
In Europe the D-Mark was little changed. It closed at FFr3.430 against the
French franc, from FFr3.431. Against the Italian lira it closed at L1,020
from L1,021.
The catalyst for the recovery in the krona was last Friday's fiscal
proposals from the opposition Social Democratic Party, predicted to win next
month's general election. The market, concerned by Sweden's large budget
deficit, was impressed by the SDP's plans to reduce the budget by SKr61bn
over the coming four years.
Sentiment was also helped by comments from Skandia, the large insurer, on
the basis of the SDP proposals, that it would be prepared to buy Swedish
state bonds again. Markets' were recently shocked by Skandia's decision to
boycott purchases of state bonds owing to the country's weak fiscal
position.
Mr Keld Holm, international economist at Lehman Brothers in London, said the
krona had quite significant momentum in the longer term, with the potential
to appreciate to SKr4.60 over the next year.
In the short term, however, he cautioned that uncertainty, particularly over
the November referendum concerning Sweden's accession to the EU, could well
see the krona retreat back towards the SKr5.00 level.
The market's view about the weakness of sterling is that it is currently a
cause for vigilance, rather than anxiety. The UK currency has not yet become
the target of speculative pressure, its level still being almost exclusively
a residual of movements in the larger currencies, particularly D-Mark and
dollar. The trade weighted index finished at 78.2, from a close of 78.5 on
Friday.
Although the pound is now 25 pfennigs below the DM2.62 it reached before the
February rate cut, it is nine cents higher against the dollar, up to Dollars
1.55 from Dollars 1.46.
The government does not have an explicit exchange rate target, and there is
little support for the view, notwithstanding fears in the gilt market, that
the Bank of England might be tempted to raise interest rates to support
sterling. Mr Peter Fellner, gilt strategist at Natwest Markets, commented:
'It is always the pace (of the decline) as well as the level that matters as
far as the Bank is concerned.'
He said the Bank would probably become concerned if the trade weighted index
was, on a sustained basis, to lose a few points a day.
The prospect of higher rates, because of currency weakness, would probably
only arise when the Bank deemed the level of sterling sufficient to
constitute an inflationary threat. At the moment it is possible to argue
that the Bank is enjoying the best of both worlds. Mr Neil MacKinnon notes
that UK exporters, who send roughly two-thirds of their products to the EU,
will be welcoming the pound's weakness against the D-Mark.
The Bank, however, will not be too concerned about sterling's strength
against the dollar. The US is more important than the EU in terms of the
cost of imported goods, and sterling strength will thus help curb
inflationary pressures.
The Mexican peso firmed against the dollar after partial results showed the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party keeping power in general elections.
It closed in London at 3.315 pesos from 3.3815 pesos on Friday.
Analysts said sentiment towards the US dollar remained negative. Mr
MacKinnon said the position of the market was broadly neutral, with
interbank traders driving it lower. He said there was no evidence of selling
pressure from fund managers.
In the UK money markets the Bank of England provided Pounds 574m liquidity
at established rates, after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 550m. Overnight
money traded between 3 and 4 3/4 per cent.
In the cash markets, three month LIBOR was unchanged at 5 7/16 per cent.
Activity in the futures markets was very quite, with the December short
sterling contract trading 13,494 lots to close at 93.37 from 93.38.
In Germany the December Euromark contract closed unchanged at 94.84. Call
money rates were little changed at 4.85/4.95 per cent.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Business as usual for rubber
pact

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rubber producers did not renew demands for higher reference prices at an
International Natural Rubber Organisation meeting here yesterday, leaving
the group free to sell rubber at current prices, officials said, reports
Reuters from Kuala Lumpur.
Mr Aldo Hofmeister, Inro's outgoing buffer stock manager, said its executive
council met and decided to continue with current buffer stock sales without
changing the reference price.
'The executive council has decided to continue selling,' he said after the
conclusion of the special executive meeting. Most of Inro's 26 members
attended.
Inro began selling from its 220,000-tonne buffer stock on July 8 after world
prices spiralled to 6-year highs.
The group has sold most of its stockpile, except for unspecified amounts in
its US and British warehouses, but the disposals have failed to cool the
world market.
Mr Hofmeister said the option to revise the reference prices, which guide
the buffer stock manager in buying or selling, was mentioned but not
discussed.
'All three options of either suspending, reviewing the rate of sales or
revising the reference price were brought up but the council decided on the
status quo,' he added.
Producing countries have long demanded higher reference prices - an issue
holding up negotiations for a new price stabilisation pact, the
International Natural Rubber Agreement III.
The second round of talks to to negotiate Inra III will be held in Geneva
from October 3 to 14.
Several delegates who attended Monday's meeting said none of the delegates
from the producing countries discussed the reference price issue.
'The producers must be satisfied with the price as it is,' one delegate
said.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper under renewed pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Copper prices came under renewed pressure at the London Metal Exchange
yesterday after last week's failure to break overhead resistance.
The three months delivery price, which last Thursday had briefly flirted
with levels above Dollars 2,430 a tonne, closed yesterday's late afternoon
ring trading session at Dollars 2,392 a tonne, down Dollars 15.50 from
Friday. And the selling continued in after hours trading, when the price
broke through resistance around Dollars 2,390 to touch Dollars 2,374, its
lowest since August 4.
Many traders believe the copper market will have to settle into a lower
trading level until the end of the northern hemisphere summer, when reduced
industrial activity keeps demand for the metal low. They will be watching
today's LME warehouse stocks report for some indication a resumption of
physical activity; after a long decline stocks began rising at the start of
this month, since which they have gone up 4.5 per cent.
Other LME markets held relatively steady. Notable among these was aluminium,
which closed at Dollars 1,487 a tonne, down just Dollars 2.50 on the day,
despite disappointment with the latest set of production figures from the
International Primary Aluminium Institute Institute.
Traders had been hoping that the figures, for July, would show that
multilaterally agreed output cuts were still eating into stocks of the
metal, which remain excessively high. But at 38,000 tonnes a day July
production was unchanged from June (though 2,100 below July, 1993).
'One month's figure does not mean cutbacks have finished,' one analyst told
Reuters, 'but we will have to watch the situation closely.'
Aluminium market watchers have been warning that current price levels - 30
per cent up from the end of last year - could discourage some producers from
curbing output.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: European coal outlook bleak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bleak outlook for coal in Europe in the coming decade but buoyant demand
in China and elsewhere in Asia is predicted by the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe in its latest annual report on the world coal market.
World coal use, production and trade fell in 1993, as a result,
overwhelmingly, of big reductions in Europe, which are expected to continue
this year and for the foreseeable future, the report says.
While world output dropped by 1.8 per cent last year to 3.43bn tonnes,
production in the European Union slumped by 13.2 per cent and in central and
eastern Europe by 8.9 per cent.
At least 10,000 EU coal mining jobs will be shed in 1994 and about 150,000
are likely to go in the former Soviet bloc countries over the next 10 years,
according to the ECE.
'It is a tragic predicament that, in spite of constantly increasing
productivity, the underground and difficult coal mining in Europe will not
be able to reach the competitiveness of countries overseas where coal can be
mined opencast and easily,' the ECE comments.
By contrast, further strong growth in demand and output is predicted for the
main coal consuming and producing countries in Asia, which now account for
well over 40 per cent of the world market. China alone is expected to boost
output by 250m tonnes by the turn of the century. Australia and Indonesia
are readying to increase coal exports by 40m tonnes each over the same
period, the report says.
Nevertheless, the ECE cautions that the need to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions to curb global warming could lead to coal being challenged by more
environmentally friendly fuels worldwide.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norilsk problems seen hitting
Russian nickel sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Problems at Norilsk, the world's biggest nickel producer, are likely to
cause Russian exports of the metal to the west to fall to about 95,000
tonnes this year, a 14 per cent drop from the 110,000 tonnes expected at the
begining of 1994, according to Mr Jim Lennon, analyst at Macquarie
Securities, part of the Australian banking group.
There was a two-day strike at Norilsk earlier this month because of
persistent non-payment of salaries, Mr Lennon points out. There is evidence
that Norilsk is being starved of cash for even routine maintenance because
the Russian government is taking 80 per cent of the profit on nickel in tax
and all Norilsk's platinum group metals profits.
The recently-privatised Norilsk still owes its workforce about Rbs150bn
(Pounds 45m) and the company says that the city of Norilsk needs Rs 2,000bn
to repair its infrastructure.
Mr Lennon recalls that the nickel market in the west was tipped into a
massive supply surplus by Russian exports which rose from 70,000 tonnes in
1988 to a peak of 160,000 tonnes (including secondary, or recycled,
material) in 1992. Between 1991 and 1993, nickel stocks in the west rose by
nearly 150,000 tonnes, most of the excess accumulating as Russian cathode in
London Metal Exchange warehouses.
This forced down prices to an all-time low in real terms of Dollars 1.82 a
lb at the end of September last year. Since then, prices have recovered
despite a continued rise in stocks because of money pouring into the nickel
market from investment funds.
Mr Lennon says that about 29,000 tonnes of Russian nickel, which had been
stockpiled in Russia during the winter, arrived in the west in July and
August. Only 6,000 tonnes found its way to LME warehouses and the rest is
assumed to have gone directly to end-users, or has been stockpiled, possibly
as collateral for loans.
Demand in the west for nickel - used primarily in the production of
stainless steel - is growing strongly and consumption is forecast by Mr
Lennon to rise by 6.7 per cent to 713,000 tonnes this year and by a further
8.9 per cent to 776,700 tonnes in 1995.
However, the recent price rise has encouraged western producers to increase
output and he predicts that production will rise by 5.6 per cent this year
to 589,300 tonnes and next year climb to 629,000 tonnes. Once imports from
the former eastern bloc are taken into account, this will leave the western
market with a small deficit this year but one of more than 30,000 tonnes in
1995.
Mr Lennon sees three months delivery nickel prices on the LME rising to
Dollars 3 a pound (Dollars 6,612 a tonne) by the year-end to give a 1994
average price of Dollars 2.65 (Dollars 5,840), rising to an average of
Dollars 3.30 (Dollars 7,273) next year.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bull market forecast to resume
in October
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Copper's bull market has some way to run and prices are likely to peak at
above Dollars 1.20 a pound (Dollars 2,645 a tonne) in the first half of
1995, suggests the Bloomsbury Minerals Economics consultancy organisation.
The sale of surplus copper stocks may depress prices later this month and
September to the Dollars 1- to Dollars 1.05-a-pound range (Dollars 2,204 to
Dollars 2,314 a tonne), but they are likely to start firming again in
October.
It will not be until the second half of 1995 that the copper market will see
a slight supply surplus again, 'signalling the probable end of the bull
phase,' BME suggests in its latest Copper Briefing Service newsletter.
Mr Peter Hollands, the editor, points out that western world copper
consumption is on track for a 500,000-tonne or 5.5 to 6 per cent increase
this year - to 9.635m tonnes - and one of 350,000 tonnes, or 3.5 to 4 per
cent, in 1995.
Compared with that, western world copper output can be expected to slip by
50,000 tonnes or 0.5 per cent to 9.045m tonnes this year because a
100,000-tonne increase in Latin American output will be more than offset by
falls in Japan and Europe caused by shortages of custom concentrates and
blister (intermediate materials). Next year, however, western world
production is set to grow by about 500,000 tonnes or 5.5 to 6 per cent.
Even though net imports from the former eastern bloc countries can be
expected to rise from 225,000 tonnes last year to 335,000 tonnes, there will
still be a supply deficit of 255,000 tonnes in 1994, BME suggests. It
expects the deficit to fall to 110,000 tonnes in 1995.
However, in the first half of 1995 a deficit of about 115,000 tonnes is
forecast and, as a result, by mid-year western stocks will fall to just
under 1m tonnes - equivalent to only 5.3 weeks of consumption.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iron ore market expected to
build on recent recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery in the world iron ore market that began last year picked up
strength in 1994 and should accelerate in 1995, according to the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
It says next year should see the long-awaited reversal of three successive
years of declining iron ore prices.
World iron ore exports rose by nearly 8 per cent to 398m tonnes in 1993,
leading to a marked reduction in exporters' stocks, while global iron ore
output rose by 2.5 per cent to 942m tonnes. The stimulus from the booming
Chinese economy more than offset a sharp drop in mining and steel-making in
the former Soviet Union, the report notes.
China imported more than 30m tonnes of steel last year, boosting steel
output (and thus iron ore consumption) in all the main steel-exporting
nations. Iron ore imports also soared, by 30 per cent, confirming China's
position as the world's most dynamic market for current and future iron ore
demand.
Already the largest iron ore producer, China mined 225m tonnes last year, an
increase of nearly 15 per cent over 1992. However, domestic production meets
only 70 per cent of the country's needs, Unctad points out. China's iron ore
consumption rose 16.6 per cent to 258m tonnes in 1993 or more than a quarter
of the world total.
Unctad says that world iron ore trade remained strong in the first half of
1994, propelled by even faster growth of Chinese demand, smaller than
expected declines in Japan and accelerating economic recovery in most other
regions. It expects 'a significant upsurge' in global steel and iron ore
demand in 1995 which 'augurs well for the recovery of iron ore prices'.
Prices have come under pressure from leading consuming countries on the one
hand and from strong competition among suppliers on the other, threatening
the profitability of the industry and especially high-cost producers.
However, Unctad says falling prices have not dissuaded the industry from
investing in replacement and additional capacity.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries sharply lower on Dollars
weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds moved sharply lower yesterday as the dollar continued to
weaken against other leading currencies.
Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 27/32 at
99 9/32 , with the yield rising to 7.554 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 25/32 , to yield 6.227 per cent.
After holding fairly steady on Friday, bonds across the board resumed a
decline which had begun the day after the Federal Reserve's decision last
week to boost short-term interest rates.
In the absence of any fresh economic statistics, the focus yesterday was on
the foreign exchange markets, where the US currency lost further ground
against the yen and the D-Mark amid concerns over US-Japanese trade talks.
Bond traders fear a weak dollar may discourage overseas investment in
US-denominated securities.
There was also concern over this week's influx of new supply. The market
faces the auction of Dollars 17.25bn in two-year notes today, followed by
the sale of Dollars 11bn in five-year securities tomorrow. Amid the current
pessimism, demand could prove disappointing.
That prospect put the market on the defensive. Bonds across the board
registered moderate losses in the early going, but the damage grew more
pronounced as the session progressed. However, traders stressed that the
damage was exaggerated by light activity.
Fears that German inflation could nudge above 3 per cent this month and
rumours of a large sell order wiped around a half-point off German
government bonds soon after the opening. The weakness in bunds dragged down
other European markets in the morning but they later recovered.
Dealers said that although bunds stabilised at lower levels, after the
rumoured selling failed to materialise, the mood remained bleak and volume
thin. Even the continued strength of the D-Mark failed to support bund
prices.
A further depressant was the Bundesbank's announcement that it would be
holding an auction of four-year treasury notes next week.
The news focused the market's attention once again on the Bundesbank's large
funding programme. Dealers believe the central bank is aiming to raise
around DM6bn from the auction.
On Liffe, the September bund future went as low as 91.00 at one stage but by
the late afternoon it recovered to 91.23, down 0.13 point on the day. Volume
was relatively robust for August.
UK gilts bounced back from the day's lows and moved into positive territory
in the afternoon, though sterling's fall to a 1994 low against the D-Mark
was seen to have limited gains.
The market was cheered by the second-quarter GDP data which according to Mr
Simon Briscoe at SG Warburg showed no inflation, weaker consumer demand and
a shift to exports. 'The GDP numbers do promise an appealing future for
gilts,' he said.
The September long gilt future on Liffe stood  1/4 point higher at 100 13/32
in the late afternoon, off the day's low of 100 3/8 , in low volume of just
over 36,000 lots.
Elsewhere, the Italian and Swedish bond markets bounced back after last
week's weakness which had followed the interest rate rises in both
countries. The 10-year Swedish yield spread against bunds narrowed by around
50 basis points to 385 points after reaching almost 500 points last week.
Italian 10-year government bonds rose by just over a half-point.

FT  23 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: HK plan to ban kickbacks
stirs up a hornets nest - Fund managers in Hong Kong are divided on cash
commission rebates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong fund managers are putting the finishing touches to their
submissions on an issue that has stirred up a hornets' nest: proposals to
ban fund managers' from keeping cash commission rebates.
The Security and Futures Commission (SFC), the watchdog for the colony's
financial markets, circulated its proposals last month, prompted by
developments overseas and domestic concern. It is believed that less than
half of the colony's fund managers accept cash commission rebates - the
portion of broker's commission which is sometimes refunded to the fund
manager.
The SFC says that in the US, UK and most continental European markets these
rebates - or kickbacks - are effectively barred from winding up in managers'
coffers; instead, they are channelled back to the fund to benefit investors.
Jardine Fleming, the loudest dissenting voice and a recipient of rebates,
disputes this, saying it is market practice instead of regulation which has
dictated the end of rebates in the UK and Australia.
Mr Chris Russell, director of Jardine Fleming Holdings, which has USDollars
4.5bn under management in Hong Kong authorised funds, quotes sections from
the rulebook of the UK Investment Management Regulatory Organisation which,
he says, show that rebates retained by fund managers in the UK - so long as
they are disclosed - are not banned.
'Chapter 2 rule 1.6 talks about inducements, which are basically illegal,'
he says. 'That chapter specifically excludes disclosed commissions from
being an inducement. It is fair to say in that case, these things are
generally allowed rather than disallowed so long as they are disclosed.'
Jardine itself is in favour of fuller disclosure.
For fund managers who receive rebates, the stakes involved in losing them
are high. After canvassing portfolio managers, the SFC found certain
managers receive rebates ranging from 25 per cent to well over 100 per cent
of management fee revenues.
Managers of units trusts who are authorised to retain cash commission
rebates will usually receive a rebate of between 0.125 per cent and 0.25 per
cent of the transaction value in cash and will be separately invoiced, by
the broker, for a 0.50 per cent commission. Brokerage commission rates for
institutional-size transactions in Hong Kong stocks usually range from 0.25
per cent to 0.50 per cent of transaction value.
In contrast, unit trusts that do not accept cash rebates can usually
negotiate in Hong Kong full-service brokerage rates from 0.25 per cent to
0.35 per cent of transaction value.
According to a survey commissioned by the Hong Kong Investment Funds
Association which boasts 42 fund management companies as full/overseas
members, 65 per cent of respondents support the proposal to ban rebates
while 21 per cent oppose it and 14 per cent are indifferent.
There was more support for the SFC's related proposals, which advocate
greater disclosure and stricter rules to govern the acceptance of 'soft
dollar' benefits, goods or services received from brokers in return for
business. News screens, software and research fall into this category.
Fund houses hold differing standpoints on soft commission, but it is the
rebate issue which has most sharply polarised the HKDollars 350bn (USDollars
45bn) industry (the value of funds managed in over 900 SFC authorised
vehicles; however, the SFC reckons an additional HKDollars 1,000bn in other
institutional portfolios is managed from Hong Kong).
In the opposite corner from Jardine Fleming stands Fidelity Investments,
which has more than USDollars 2bn in its Hong Kong authorised mutual funds.
Fidelity is firmly opposed to these kickbacks.
It argues that a fund manager who receives additional cash every time he
trades suffers a conflict of interest since frequent buying and selling, or
'churning', raises his own monetary rewards. Moreover, brokers may not
always be selected on the basis of his service, but the size of his
commission, which is detrimental to the interests of the investor.
While Fidelity can be accused of making a virtue out of necessity - being
prohibited from retaining rebates in the majority of big markets where it
operates - their argument is winning altogether more sympathy than that of
Jardine Fleming. Brokers generally believe Jardine is whistling in the wind,
and that the SFC will proceed to ban rebates.
Jardine Fleming says if it were to take this route the SFC would build a
stricter regime in Hong Kong than that which operates in the UK and
Australia and jeopardise the colony's competitive edge.

FT  23 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Attention centres on D-Mark issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A handful of D-Mark issues were the main focus of an otherwise quiet day in
the eurobond market.
Chemical Bank lead-managed two floating-rate note issues, DM150m for Union
Bank of Finland and DM80m for Landsvirkjun, Iceland's national power
company.
The Landsvirkjun issue, which has a five-year maturity, pays a coupon of
three-month Libor plus 22 1/2 basis points and was priced at a discounted
margin of 28 basis points over Libor. According to the lead manager, the
notes saw demand from banks and non-bank investors, mainly in Europe.
The Union Bank of Finland issue, however, was widely criticised as being too
tightly priced. It pays a coupon of three-month Libor plus 15 basis points
and was offered at a discounted margin of 18 basis points over Libor. 'Why
should I buy a BBB/A3-rated Finnish name when I can get Italy at around the
same level?' asked one syndicate official.
The establishment of money market funds in Germany, which have been
permitted since August 1, has created increased demand for money-market
paper. However, according to one Frankfurt dealer, the funds so far have
been buying mainly domestic paper. Still, 'once they've exhausted the
domestic market, they'll start buying sovereign names', he said, adding that
he expects to see increased issuance of D-Mark FRNs in coming months.
In the dollar sector, dealers are looking to a wave of Japanese
government-guaranteed issues in coming weeks. Japan Highway is expected to
lead the way today or tomorrow with a Dollars 500m 10-year offering priced
to yield around 30-35 basis points above US Treasuries. It is expected to be
followed by deals from Japan Finance Corp for Municipal Enterprises, the
Japan Development Bank, the Metropolis of Tokyo and the Cities of Kobe and
Yokohama.
Argentina will borrow Dollars 500m from commercial banks for 18 months,
according to the country's finance secretary Mr Roque Maccarone, Reuters
reports. The loan, led by Credit Suisse and Chemical Bank, will cover a
shortfall in government financing created by delays in privatisations of
several state companies, he said.
Meanwhile, Columbia is preparing a Dollars 150m sovereign eurobond issue for
the end of September for offer principally in Asian markets, said deputy
finance minister Mr Francisco Azuero. He said details were still being
worked out, but the idea was to use Dollars 100m for early repayment of more
expensive foreign debt and to employ the remaining Dollars 50m on government
spending.

FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: Goodman sets date to face music
 -Australian institutions are calling for boardroom changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Goodman Fielder, the beleaguered Australian food company, yesterday said it
would hold an extraordinary general meeting on October 13, at which
shareholders would be able to vote on boardroom changes.
The meeting was requisitioned last week by Agrifood Investments, controlled
by Mr Doug Shears, a Melbourne-based businessman, plus three big
institutional investors. The board met at the weekend to discuss its
response.
The unhappy investors are recommending the reappointment of two executive
directors at Goodman - Mr Barry Weir, chief executive, and Mr Michael Brown,
finance director - but suggesting that separate votes be taken over the
removal of seven other directors. Four replacement candidates, all of whom
have previous food or consumer products industry experience, have been lined
up.
While the setting of an EGM date may take a little heat out of the Goodman
situation, it seems unlikely that any temperature change will be permanent.
The problem at Australia's largest food company is one of poor profits
performance, and a share price which has gone nowhere for about five years.
Measured against the Australian stock exchange food and household goods
index, Goodman shares have underperformed by 55 per cent since January 1989.
At one level, this looks like another saga of a 1980s corporate creation
felled by the harsher climate of the 1990s. For while Goodman is the leading
food company in the Australasia region, boasting revenues of over ADollars
4bn (USDollars 2.9bn), it was put together through a flurry of acquisitions
and mergers in little more than a decade.
Companies incorporated into the group ranged from Davis Consolidated
Industries, best known for its gelatine products, to New Zealand's Wattie
Industries. One of the last acquisitions, in 1992, was Uncle Toby's, a
Melbourne-based manufacturer of cereal-based products whose products range
from Vetta pastas to cake mixes. Uncle Toby's executive chairman was Mr Doug
Shears and, as part of the deal, he acquired a 3.5 per cent interest in the
larger group.
Two years ago, a chunk of the Goodman empire was shed when the Wattie
operations in New Zealand were bought by Mr Tony O'Reilly's Heinz group for
ADollars 428m. Nevertheless, Goodman today comprises a diverse bag of
businesses - from food ingredients, poultry, and some Dutch bakeries, to a
large domestic milling and baking division, and a smattering of Asian
subsidiaries producing mainly baked goods or margarine/oils.
A fair portion of these interests are at the commodity end of the food
industry, where low-cost production becomes all-important. Some of Goodman's
larger divisions - such as poultry and bakeries - have faced intense price
competition in recent years. And the group has admitted that more emphasis
on innovative marketing and product development may be necessary for a
sustained upturn.
In the meantime, earnings have stagnated. Operating profit before abnormals
stood at ADollars 117.2m in the last full year to end-June 1993, compared
with ADollars 124.8m in 1988-89. Earnings per share were 10.4 cents,
compared with 12.7 cents five years earlier. Gearing remains fairly high - a
legacy of the acquisition trail. The ratio of net debt to equity, excluding
goodwill, at end-1993 was about 75 per cent.
In spite of this - and in the face of persistent stock market speculation -
no bidder has emerged to take over, or dismember, this assortment of
interests. Management was changed last year, but the current chief
executive, Mr Barry Weir, has suggested that improvement will only come
through a overhaul of the individual businesses.
The group, he told shareholders in a letter earlier this year, was capable
of making a 9 per cent to 10 per cent return on sales across its various
operations. But he warned: 'The problem is not so simple we can solve it
through the straightforward cutting away and disposal of one or two of our
major business groups'.
This has done nothing for the Goodman Fielder share price which sagged to
ADollars 1.25 two months ago and closed yesterday at ADollars 1.47. Mr
Shears was issued his shares at ADollars 1.70. Institutional investors are
justifiably dismayed. One of the trio supporting the EGM call put the case
bluntly yesterday: 'What is needed is a strategy in place for Goodman
Fielder which the market can have confidence in, and which puts some support
into the share price'.
A second aspect to the Goodman saga is the role which three institutions -
the AMP, Bankers Trust, and the State Authorities Superannuation Board -
have played. While it has become common practice in the US and UK for
institutional fund managers to manoeuvre directors in and out of office at
poorly performing companies, it is a rare sight in Australia.
A number of local fund managers admit they are anxious to see the Australian
market shed its low-quality reputation.
Last year, institutions fought and won a battle over Rupert Murdoch's plan
to introduce differential voting rights at News Corporation. Now there are
plans by the Australian stock exchange to introduce corporate governance
rules, along the lines of Britain's Cadbury report. So should the Goodman
episode be seen as another example of this stepped-up vigilance? And should
it carry a warning message to other lacklustre companies?
'Yes and no', said Ms Elizabeth Bryan, general manager of investments at
State Superannuation Corporation, one of Goodman trio. 'No one wants to
reach a point where this sort of action is necessary. It is unusual, but we
have a duty to ensure a company has strategies that engender profits and
support for the share price.'

exploration deal

Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian steel and resources group, said
yesterday it had signed an agreement with the China National Offshore Oil
Corporation, to explore for oil and gas in the Pearl River Basin.
This is the ninth agreement which the company has signed with CNOOC, in
recent times, to search for oil and gas in the Bohai, South China and Yellow
Seas.
BHP Petroleum will hold a 100 per cent interest in the contract area, which
covers about 3,640 sq km and is located about 180km south of Shantou, and
will act as operator. Exploration is expected to start in the fourth quarter
of 1994.
Niugini Mining, which is controlled by Canada's Battle Mountain, said
yesterday it had signed an agreement with Indian government-owned Hindustan
Zinc, to explore and develop gold projects in India.
Gold production in India has dwindled to minimal levels, but the two
companies said they believed there could be potential for bulk low-grade
discoveries around old mining centres, and noted that some of the geology
was fairly similar to that of Western Australia.
Directors of Bougainville Copper, which is controlled by Australia's CRA
group but quoted on the Australian stock exchange, said the reopening of the
controversial Panguna mine on Papua New Guinea was unlikely in the near
future, in spite of reports that PNG security forces had recaptured the
area.

FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: VW aims to double Polo sales
with updated range

<TEXT>
Volkswagen, the leading European carmaker, is aiming to almost double sales
of its VW Polo small car in western Europe with the launch of an updated
range developed with an investment of DM1.8bn (Dollars 1.5bn). Mr Ferdinand
Piech, chairman of the VW management board, said the group was aiming to
increase sales to 350,000 in 1995 from 189,000 last year.
The launch of the new generation Polo is a vital step for the VW group,
which is seeking to recover from record losses suffered last year and to
arrest the erosion of its market share in west Europe. Mr Piech said that
the improvement in western European new car demand in the first six months
had faltered in July, when VW new orders had fallen back to the same level
as last year.
VW had a strong order book from the second quarter, which would cushion its
production in the autumn, but he warned that its financial performance could
be harmed if the renewed weakness in demand carried on through the second
half of the year. Last week he forecast that the VW group would break even
for the full year following a DM1.94bn net loss in 1993.
The new generation Polo, which was unveiled in Paris yesterday and which
will go on sale in most west European countries in the late autumn, will be
built at VW's plants at Pamplona in northern Spain and at its main plant at
Wolfsburg in northern Germany.
VW has fallen far behind its main rivals in the west European small car
market with its outdated current Polo, which was first launched in 1981, and
is still dangerously dependent on its Golf/Vento small family car range. The
Polo languished in sixth place last year in the small car segment of the
west European market with sales of only 189,000; behind the Ford Fiesta
(444,000), the Renault Clio (425,000), the Fiat Uno (352,000), the Opel
Corsa (346,000) and the Peugeot 106 (268,000).
The small car sector is gaining in importance and accounts for around 29 per
cent of all new car sales in western Europe. VW urgently needs a competitive
car in this market, where both General Motors of the US (Opel in continental
Europe and Vauxhall in the UK) and Fiat of Italy have launched strong rivals
in the shape of the Fiat Punto and the new generation Opel/Vauxhall Corsa.
Mr Piech conceded that the group had waited too long to replace the current
13-year-old Polo and said that VW was aiming to cut its model life cycles to
six years.

FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: Competition adds fire to battle
in the air - How Brazil's three airlines are struggling to survive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's three main airlines are cutting costs and seeking international
alliances in a drive to counter the harsh economic environment.
The carriers - Varig, Transbrasil and Vasp - have been hit by weak demand
and by partial, but long-overdue, deregulation which has put pressure on
revenues through increased domestic competition. On international routes the
airlines face excess capacity and fierce competition from US carriers.
To add to the pressures, lack of co-operation among the three has blocked
some attempts to cut capacity and reduce costs.
These problems have forced the carriers to reduce costs in radical
restructuring programmes. Thousands of jobs have been cut, aircraft have
been returned to leasing companies, and leases are being renegotiated.
In March, Varig, Latin America's largest airline with sales of Dollars 2.5bn
last year, suspended lease payments on 50 of its 80 aircraft and cut 2,600
jobs.
Since then it has agreed to return four wide-bodied aircraft to leasing
companies and is negotiating the return of another five. These measures are
saving the airline Dollars 16m a month, according to Mr Rubel Thomas,
chairman.
He forecasts that, after losing Dollars 97m in the year to December 1993,
the company will return to operating profit next year. Varig, controlled by
an employees' foundation, has lost more than Dollars 1bn in the past six
years.
Varig, says Mr Thomas, has cut capacity by 14 per cent in the past year and
is making money on domestic routes, where it has a 50 per cent market share.
Competitors say its success is due to its ownership of half the busy Sao
Paulo-Rio de Janeiro air shuttle and its dominance in overseas flights
allows it to act as a feeder airline within Brazil.
Mr Thomas says Varig must also improve its international performance since
it relies on those operations for more than half its revenues. Traffic
between Brazil and the US has increased from 900,000 passengers in 1989 to
an estimated 1.5m this year.
The increase has prompted Brazilian and US carriers to increase weekly
flights from 40 to 61, hurting margins.
Brazilian carriers have also faced more aggressive competition from American
Airlines and United Airlines, which began flying to Brazil after the US
renegotiated an air services agreement in 1989.
Brazilian governments have always backed Varig, but officials say airlines
can no longer rely on government support.
Varig has linked with a US partner, Delta Airlines. It began a code-sharing
agreement with Delta in June, and is now flying daily to Delta's Atlanta
airport hub with connections to about 250 destinations in North America. The
agreement, which also involves Varig in Delta's frequent flyer programme, is
expected to improve the Brazilian carrier's international profitability,
analysts say. Brazil's other two main airlines have been less successful in
finding international partners.
Transbrasil plans to cut 1,500 workers from its 5,000 workforce, and founder
Mr Omar Fontana says he is considering the sale of 40 per cent of the
company to a consortium of Brazilian and European banks.
Vasp, which the state of Sao Paulo privatised in 1990, had a negative net
worth of nearly Dollars 400m at the end of last year. It cut its workforce
by 2,000 last year, and returned nearly half its fleet of 59 aircraft to
leasing companies. This has led to a big cut in financing costs, but there
are still uncertainties about how it can continue to service its net debt,
which last year approached Dollars 400m.
The shake-up follows years of over-regulation, when Varig was the only
Brazilian airline allowed to operate internationally and Vasp and
Transbrasil were given protected routes in the domestic market.
This closed shop was partly opened in 1991 and 1992 under former president
Mr Fernando Collor, who deregulated air fares and allowed regional airlines
to offer non-stop routes between big cities.
Marilia acute accent on first i (TAM), have been profitable in recent years.
Unfortunately for the three main carriers, the deregulation coincided with a
continuing fall in domestic demand.
Due to Brazil's economic problems the market shrunk from 15bn revenue
passenger kilometres in 1989 to 11.2bn last year and has fallen by another 5
per cent in the first half of this year, says Mr Sergio Kuczynski,
Transbrasil's planning director.
But the airlines have largely refused to co-operate on rationalising
flights. Mr Gandra says the DAC has been unsuccessful in calls for more
codesharing and cutting domestic capacity.
Hopes that an economic stabilisation plan, launched this month, will boost
demand led the airlines to postpone further capacity cuts at a meeting with
the DAC in June, says Mr Thomas.
Although the companies are attempting to tackle their problems, analysts
believe the restructurings are overdue and that further cuts will be needed
to secure their long-term future in an increasingly turbulent environment.

FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: Intel and AT&amp;T in conferencing
system deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The threat of a damaging standards war in personal video-conferencing
similar to the VHS and Betamax battle which divided video recorder
manufacturers receded yesterday when AT&amp;T and Intel said they were working
together to build a compatible system.
Personal video-conferencing, where participants can see both each other and
work papers on their personal computer screens while holding a telephone
conversation, has been hailed as the future of business communications.
Intel, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer has developed a system
which can be installed in a PC in conjunction with a miniature video camera
to create a desk-top video conferencing system.
AT&amp;T, the largest US telecommunications carrier has an obvious interest in
increasing traffic on its network through advanced services, such as
tele-conferencing.
Mr John Petrillo, president of AT&amp;T business communications services said:
'This agreement will provide a technology base for making video and data
calls with a PC as accessible and easy to use as calls with a telephone.'
Conventional video-conferencing systems used by large companies cost Pounds
40,000 or more and are comparatively inflexible. Desk-top video costs only
about Pounds 3,000 in addition to the cost of the PC.
A concern has been that Intel's video-conferencing system, called Proshare,
is not compatible with the accepted standard for large video-conferencing,
called H320. The worry was that a industry-wide row over the two standards
could slow progress. Proshare is cheaper than H320 but does not have all its
facilities.
Yesterday's agreement between AT&amp;T and Intel means that customers will get
'seamless integration between Intel's Proshare and AT&amp;T's network services',
the groups said. The two companies will build a technology bridge between
the two standards.

FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: Last Kassbohrer division sold
off
</HEADLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The all-terrain vehicles division of the private Kassbohrer automotive group
has been taken over by the German arm of the Schroder Ventures group for an
undisclosed sum.
The senior management, led by Mr Erwin Wieland, will participate in the deal
and continue to run the business.
Schroders &amp; Partner Beteiligungsberatung, however, will hold the
'overwhelming' majority of the stake, Schroders said last night.
The buy-out, Schroders' fifth this year, was among the five biggest recorded
in Germany, the finance house said.
The division turned over DM169m (Dollars 110m) last year and is best known
for its Pisten Bully piste bashers which prepare and groom ski runs.
Some 9,000 have been delivered in the past 25 years. It also makes beach
cleaning vehicles and a small range of tracked vehicles.
Employing a staff of 300, with 200 in the main base in Ulm, it claims to
have a 65 per cent share of the European and a 50 per cent stake in world
markets for piste preparation equipment.
Schroders said yesterday the Canadian Bombardier group, which had long been
interested in the business, had dropped out after making an offer considered
to be too low by creditor banks and the out-going Kassbohrer family.
The disposal completes the break-up of the 100-year-old Kassbohrer group.
This follows the recent agreement to sell the Setra marque bus business to
Mercedes-Benz.

TVX Gold, an aggressive Toronto-based international gold producer, has
withdrawn a CDollars 2.3bn (Dollars 1.6bn) joint bid with Kinross Gold,
another medium-sized Canadian producer, for Lac Minerals.
TVX and Kinross revealed their friendly share exchange proposal on August 1.
It was rejected by Lac, as were bids from Royal Oak Mines and American
Barrick Resources. Lac said it wanted to remain independent. TVX and Kinross
wanted to split Lac's assets, with TVX taking the Chilean properties and
Kinross the Canadian properties.
TVX said yesterday it was not in its shareholders' interest to pursue the
merger.
Royal Oak's revised CDollars 2.4bn bid is due to expire tonight and American
Barrick's CDollars 2.1bn offer expires on Friday.
The Ontario Securities Commission decided on Friday that Lac must dissolve
its poison pill shareholder protection plan if either bid is accepted by 66
per cent of its shareholders.

<TEXT>
Kersaf Investments, the South African-based leisure group, which has
widespread interests in hotels, casinos and cinemas, boosted after-tax
profit by 4 per cent for the year to June to R443.4m (Dollars 124m) from
R427.6m.
Turnover increased 8 per cent to R2.22bn from R2.05bn, while operating
profit rose 7 per cent to R574.2m from R536.1m a year ago. The dividend was
raised to 150 cents a share from 147 cents.
Although analysts regarded the results as satisfactory, most were
disappointed at the final figures in light of the 15 per cent rise in
pre-tax profit reported at the half year.
The group attributed the drop in the second-half earnings largely to unrest
during March in the former homeland of Bophuthatswana where Sun
International's Sun City and Lost City, the largest contributors to group
revenues, are based.
The trouble deterred tourists.

Bombardier, the inter-national aerospace, transit equipment and snowmobile

Mr Laurent Beaudoin, chairman, said the profit gain came from strength in
all sectors.
Profit for the three months ended July 31 was CDollars 54.5m (USDollars
39.4), or 33 cents a share, against CDollars 39.2m, or 25 cents, a year
earlier. Revenues were CDollars 1.17bn against CDollars 1.11bn.
First-half profit was CDollars 106.9m, or 64 cents a share, up 36 per cent
from CDollars 78.4m, or 50 cents. Revenues were CDollars 2.34bn, up just
over 1 per cent.

Sales grew 16 per cent to SKr3.86bn, reflecting the group's continuing
acquisition programme. The most recent purchases were in Portugal and Spain.
Securitas and Finland's Metra group agreed to merge their lock businesses to

turnover after deals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Wella haircare group expects recent acquisitions to boost turnover by 20
per cent to DM3.5bn (Dollars 2.3bn) this year, according to an interim
report published yesterday.
Brands acquired from SmithKline Beecham and Sebastian in the US had already
expanded sales 12.5 per cent to DM1.5bn in the first half, it said, when
pre-tax profits also surged 14.4 per cent to DM75.5m.
While stressing that profits growth had outstripped the rise in turnover so
far, the company made no earnings forecasts for the full year, when results
from the recently-purchased Muehlens group are expected to be included.
The former private owners of Muehlens, best known for the original 4711 eau
de cologne brand, traditionally never published earnings figures. Although
the company claimed 20 per cent of the German women's perfume market, it is
believed family quarrels had led to losses in recent years.
Wella said that even excluding the acquisitions, group sales increased 4 per
cent in the first half. Economic conditions had affected business in
hairdressing salons which are its main outlets. Sales in Germany had fallen
2.4 per cent as a result, although signs of a recovery had emerged after a
weak first quarter.

FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: CME seeks strength through
harmonisation - The exchange plans to merge its financial and agricultural
sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is close to making a fundamental shift in
governance that for the first time would give its member banks and other
financial traders a free hand in guiding its future.
The realignment would put the exchange, which already doubles its business
very five years, in an even stronger position to compete internationally and
allow it to venture into new product areas.
The CME is home to the world's largest futures contract, eurodollar or
short-term dollar interest rate futures, and boasts the most expensive
memberships of any exchange. Seat values are approaching Dollars 1m, with
the most aggressive bidders international banks which find the CME plays an
essential role in their interest rate risk management and derivatives
strategies.
In spite of its high profile in global financial markets, the CME's roots
are in agricultural products, and until recently a small handful of pork
belly and live cattle traders had final say on important items on the
exchange's agenda. Having a few 'cowboys' hold sway over a group of
international banks has long been viewed as inappropriate - particularly
when sensitive issues of financial regulation are being considered - but
because the agricultural block holds most of the voting power, there seemed
little prospect for change.
Now, long-time chairman Jack Sandner, is manoeuvring a quiet revolution. He
hopes to merge the exchange's robust financial division with its obscure but
politically powerful agricultural sector as early as October.
'It's time to harmonise the agenda of the exchange,' he says. 'We have two
different interest groups, and on some issues the division has the potential
to tear us apart. To avoid parochial issues and arguments, we have to unify.
We're really here to facilitate trade, and that is what we need to focus
on.'
Five years ago such a statement could have cost Mr. Sandner his chair.
However, with CME seat values double what they were last year, Mr Sandner is
enjoying unprecedented popularity at the exchange, and has the backing of
important membership blocks.
The US futures industry also appears to be ready for the shift, with several
executives noting that this summer's merger of New York's two largest
exchanges set a valuable precedent for the Chicago initiative. As with the
New York merger, the CME is prepared to dip into its treasury to compensate
its agricultural members for their loss of political clout and the premium
their memberships have commanded.
Although the consolidation is being played in Chicago as a purely internal
issue, it has serious implications for the exchange's future. With its
Reuters-owned after-hours trading system, Globex, eclipsed by successful
systems elsewhere, the exchange faces difficult decisions about investing in
other ex-pit trading technology.
A unified membership that could share equally from returns on such
investments would give the exchange a freer hand at strategic planning.
Similarly, Mr Sandner's initiative to make the exchange a for-profit entity
would also be forwarded by a self-interested membership.
The consolidation might also breathe new life into the CME's languishing
agricultural futures, and into new contracts that have difficulty attracting
traders.
One by-product of the CME's soaring seat prices is that the price of entry
into the exchange is now so high that few traders can afford to linger in
inactive pits.
The reorganisation is expected to open these pits to more of the exchange's
existing membership, and may also produce a new, inexpensive 'mini-seat'
that could be used exclusively for trading small contracts.

FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: Repsol ahead at Pta79.85bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Repsol, the main Spanish oil group, reported a 15 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits for the first half of the year to Pta79.85bn (Dollars 614m)
compared with Pta65.61bn at the same stage last year.
The company, in which the state holds just over 40 per cent, said the
improvement reflected the first signs of recovery from Spain's 1993
recession, with a recent increase in fuel consumption.
It had been achieved against a background of lower crude oil prices,
especially in the first quarter, and in spite of tighter refining margins in
the second quarter, Repsol said.
Net profits after deduction of minority interests rose by a similar margin
to Pta49.68bn from Pta43.16bn, on revenue about 9 per cent higher at
Pta1,151.37bn.
Operating results were 20 per cent up at Pta88.41bn, while net cash flow was
16.5 per cent higher than last year at Pta107.39bn.
However, the fall in crude prices brought a sharp drop in operating profits
from exploration and production, which fell 47 per cent to Pta7.36bn. The
average price per barrel produced by the group during the six-month period
was Dollars 15.10, compared with Dollars 17.10 in the same period last year.
This was offset by a recovery in chemical activities, which showed operating
profits of Pta5.31bn following a loss of Pta4.58bn in the first half of
1993. Repsol said this reflected higher margins for basic and intermediate
products, cost-cutting and improved competitiveness following the trip
devaluation of the peseta in 1992-93.
Operating profits in refining and marketing rose by almost 13 per cent, and
in the gas sector by almost 22 per cent.
The company recently reached agreement with BP to purchase 90 service
stations in south-west France.

FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: Walt Disney in German satellite
TV venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Walt Disney yesterday announced its first significant new media investment
in Europe - a joint venture with CLT Multi Media, the Luxembourg-based
international broadcaster.
The two groups plan to launch a German satellite television channel
specialising in family entertainment in January.
The deal could herald the launch of a number of similar Disney-backed
channels in other European countries including the UK.
Disney last year acquired a 25 per cent shareholding in GMTV, the commercial
breakfast television service in the UK. For years Disney has been looking at
the development of the European cable and satellite market. A potential deal
with Mr Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television before the merger with British
Satellite Broadcasting failed to materialise.
Mr Michael Eisner, Walt Disney chairman and chief executive, said yesterday
the venture with CLT 'provides us with a perfect opportunity to develop a
family programming service in Germany and to evaluate the potential for
similar services elsewhere in Europe'.
At the moment Disney has a programme supply agreement with ARD, the
terrestrial German broadcaster, which runs until the end of next year.
Disney made it clear yesterday the agreement is unlikely to be extended and
there will now be talks to see when it can be concluded.
The deal with CLT, whose television interests include television channels in
Germany, France, Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg, will be on a 50-50
basis.
The new channel, which will be available to an estimated 30 to 35 per cent
of German television households, will be called Super RTL to distinguish it
from CLT's existing German language channels RTL and RTL 2.
The new channel, which will be carried on German cable networks, will
include Disney animation, feature films and live action.
Disney has also agreed in principle to become a long-term programme supplier
to CLT Multi Media.

FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: Banesto sees 'positive' result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) yesterday attempted to reassure
shareholders it was on a stable footing, eight months after a summary
intervention by the Bank of Spain.
Mr Alfredo Saenz, chairman of the group controlled by Banco Santander, said
it was already 'a normalised bank' and forecast that the second half would
produce 'more positive' results after a first-half loss of Pta21.8bn
(Dollars 168m).
He said the bank had engaged US lawyers to contest a suit filed this month
in New York by Carlisle Ventures, a unit of Northwestern Mutual Life
Insurance. Carlisle claims it was misled when it subscribed to a Banesto
capital increase in 1993 and is seeking repayment of Dollars 27.5m. The
institutional tranche of the Pta94bn rights issue was priced at Pta1,900 a
share, compared with yesterday's closing price of Pta1,075.
The Banesto shareholders' meeting yesterday approved a motion of censure
against the previous management, which was removed by the Bank of Spain in
December.
Consolidated 1993 accounts published yesterday showed losses of Pta584.6bn,
with total non-performing assets for the group increasing to Pta898.1bn from
Pta257.4bn in 1992. Mr Saenz said the bank had made 'encouraging progress'
in recovering non-performing loans. Revised 1993 losses for the parent bank
were Pta577.9bn, compared with a pre-tax profit of Pta23.8bn last time.
Mr Saenz said the bank had decided to cancel its contract with accountants
Price Waterhouse and entrust its future audits to Arthur Andersen.
The meeting marked the completion of a rescue plan involving a Pta180bn
capital injection, aid of Pta285bn to mop up non-performing assets, and a
Pta315bn interest-free loan from Spain's Deposit Guarantee Fund.

Celsius, the Swedish defence group privatised last year, yesterday announced
pre-tax profits of SKr379m (Dollars 48.6m) for the first six months, up 20
per cent from SKr315m a year ago.
The group attributed the improvement to structural change and greater
efficiency and to a SKr600m increase in sales to SKr6.7bn.
However, its performance had been dragged down by turbulence in the bond
markets, which sharply lowered returns from last year's very high levels and
cut financial income to SKr33m from SKr205m, the group said.
The fall meant the group did not feel the full benefits of a strong advance
in operating income to SKr346m from SKr110m. Orders rose SKr800m to
SKr5.8bn, including a SKr270m order to build four minehunters for the
Swedish navy.
The group forecasts a full-year profit of SKr800m, compared with SKr721m
last year. It anticipates continued growth in operating income as well as
higher return on its financial investments.

FT  23 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Thinking small gives 600 Group a cutting
edge - A look at new expansion opportunities which are being created in
traditional markets / Tackling Asia's Tigers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Humidity can be a problem for both man and machine in Singapore, which is
why the local subsidiary of 600 Group opened a new air-conditioned showroom
there earlier this month to help boost sales of its machine tools.
However, in contrast to the climate created, Mr Richard Verrier is far from
cool on the prospects for the machine tool and materials handling group in
Singapore and neighbouring countries.
Markets may vary considerably from country to country but there are plenty
of opportunities, said Mr Verrier, director and general manager of both
George Cohen Far East and George Cohen (Malaysia), based in Singapore and
Selangor, Malaysia, respectively. Mr George Cohen was the founder of 600
Group.
Along with many UK engineering companies, 600 Group has had a presence in
the region for decades, but has recently reorganised its management to
improve the performance of the businesses.
Its activities in Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and New Zealand have been
placed under the overall control of Mr John Leverett, managing director of
600 Machinery Australia.
In its most recent annual report, 600 Group said the change had led to
significant cost savings and 'we are now well positioned to exploit the many
expansion opportunities which exist in the countries of the Pacific Rim'.
Mr Verrier said sales from Malaysia and Singapore, along with Hong Kong,
were running at Pounds 6m-Pounds 7m a year. 'But I have no doubt they will
increase, following the restructuring.'
The company's aim is to expand its Asia Pacific activities into new
countries and territories, starting this year. On a longer-term basis, Mr
Verrier said Singapore would be the nucleus for exporting to Thailand, Sri
Lanka, Burma and Indonesia, and he would also be looking at trading with
Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.
But he is not ignoring Singapore, as the new showroom testifies. The group's
machine tool sales effort for the island state was strengthened
significantly in May with the arrival of Mr David Gibney to head the local
machine tools division.
Both Mr Gibney and Mr Verrier believe that, for perhaps the first time, 600
Group has the opportunity to take on the Japanese and Taiwanese lathe
producers through the new range of Tornado machines produced by its
Colchester Lathe offshoot.
The small, 'no frills' computer controlled CNC lathes, launched in April
following an unprecedented market research exercise among small engineering
companies, have proved an immediate success.
In Singapore, the machines are being aimed at 'apartment factories',
subcontractors which are demanding increasingly sophisticated CNC machines.
But Mr Verrier is also hopeful of winning big orders for machine tools from
Singapore's fast-growing engineering education sector.
Elsewhere in Singapore, the main prospects are in the company's emerging
high-technology businesses, such as its laser marking system which has
applications in the electronics industry. The system was launched in
Singapore late last year, while the 600 Group electro-optical products have
yet to be launched there.
Mr Verrier sees these products supporting sales in Singapore as the focus of
the company's more traditional industrial products shifts to Malaysia,
reflecting a transition apparent at other UK engineering companies operating
in Singapore.
'The hub of machine tools sales is going to be Malaysia in the next few
years,' he said.
In machine tools, 600 Group is well established in Malaysia's education
sector, but needs to penetrate better the industrial sector. Again Mr
Verrier hoped the company could achieve this with the Tornado range and 'hit
the Japanese where it hurts'.
His target is the country's small machine shops. The projected growth in
Malaysia's automotive industry and plans to subcontract more machined
automotive parts, make this an attractive sector. And, like its Singapore
counterpart, it is looking at buying CNC rather than manual machine tools.
But the big opportunity for 600 Group in Malaysia is for sales of its
materials handling equipment to the palm oil industry. A shortage of labour
in parts of the country is encouraging plantation owners to look at
mechanised methods of collecting the fruit.
Mr Verrier is working hard to promote 600 Group's Hiab truck-mounted cranes
for the job of hoisting 600kg bunches of fruit on to trucks, and said the
cranes needed to be tough to do that 60 times a day.
That is one reason why there is less competition in the Malaysian materials
handling than in its Singapore counterpart, where Mr Verrier said 28
companies offered truck-mounted cranes. Of these, half were serious rivals,
and most were Italian producers which 'really undercut on price'.
Mr Verrier also sees other opportunities in Malaysia for sales of materials
handling equipment to a commercial and construction sector for which this
kind of equipment is relatively new.

FT  23 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Cookson in east European venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cookson, the specialist industrial materials group, is forming a joint
venture with Thyssen of Germany to manufacture and supply the central and
east European markets with special refractories and systems used in the
steel continuous casting process.
The joint venture agreement involves Vesuvius International, Cookson's
Belgium-based subsidiary and Dolomitwerke Wulfrath, a Thyssen subsidiary.
Vesuvius will hold a 75 per cent stake in the new joint venture while
Wulfrath will hold the balance.
Both partners will inject their shares in their own existing east European
joint venture companies - Vesuvius Czechoslovakia Trinec and Ceramika
Wulfrath Skawina - into the new company. The local Czech and Polish partners
in the existing joint ventures will remain shareholders.
Mr Stephen Howard, chief executive in charge of Cookson's group corporate
development and chief executive of the Vesuvius division, said the joint
venture would enable both Cookson and Thyssen to lessen the risk involved in
eastern Europe and to establish a closer working relationship.
The central and eastern European markets represent annual steel production
of about 170m tons with German production representing about 30 per cent of
this.
The joint venture will initially have sales of between Pounds 25m and Pounds
30m a year, but turnover and profits are expected to grow quickly as the
switch to continuously cast steel production takes place.

FT  23 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Aerospace Engineering 71% ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aerospace Engineering, the precision engineering group, lifted pre-tax
profits by 71 per cent from Pounds 214,000 to Pounds 367,000 during the year
to April 30.
Mr John Davis, chairman and chief executive, said the group was benefiting
from the rationalisation programme completed last year. The balance sheet
was strengthened, he added, following the sale of a surplus property in
Swindon.
There was improved demand for printed circuit boards and the group expected
microwave board demand to continue growing.
Turnover of continuing activities slipped to Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 17.6m).
Earnings per share rose from 0.25p to 0.64p and the dividend is held at
0.75p with an unchanged final of 0.5p.

FT  23 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Sycamore plans Pounds 1.7m refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sycamore, the laboratory, office and garden furniture manufacturer, has
announced a refinancing with the issue of Pounds 1.7m convertible loan stock
and a Pounds 500,000 bridging loan, subject to shareholder approval.
The refinancing is necessary because of continuing losses at the group,
primarily at its Cygnet laboratory furniture subsidiary. Mr Andrew Johnson,
chairman, said Cygnet had been placed in receivership and the group would
now concentrate on its profitable Deanes office furniture business.
Royal Bank of Scotland and Tufton Capital, a corporate recovery specialist,
have agreed to subscribe to the new stock, which will be convertible into
ordinary shares representing up to 80 per cent of the enlarged share
capital. Existing shareholders will be able to subscribe to an amount equal
to the number of shares that would arise if one third of the loan stock were
immediately converted at a price equivalent to 90 per cent of the conversion
price of the loan stock.
The group also announced a Pounds 1.84m pre-tax loss for the six months to
end-March, compared with a restated loss of Pounds 1.88m. Turnover fell from
Pounds 11.1m to Pounds 9.7m, although sales rose 53 per cent to Pounds 4.7m
at Deanes, which made operating profits of Pounds 408,000 (Pounds 140,000).
In January the group sold HCL Fasteners and Ashworth Leisure for a total of
Pounds 600,000.
Mr Johnson said the first half did not include the full impact of Cygnet's
receivership, or further 'substantial' asset write-downs.
Losses per share worked out at 0.84p (1.89p) and there is no interim
dividend.

FT  23 AUG 94 / UK Company News: MTM plans Pounds 16.7m expansion - Better
agrochemicals showing behind return to black with Pounds 1.13m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MTM, the chemicals company which almost collapsed two years ago, yesterday
announced details of a new acquisition strategy aimed at rebuilding the
group.
It is planning to spend up to Pounds 16.7m of its cash reserves to establish
three or four core businesses in sectors such as bio-technology, ceramics
and instruments.
The move follows an aggressive divestment programme, culminating last month
with the sale of its agrochemicals subsidiary to United Phosphorus for
Pounds 10.5m - the last subsidiary inherited from the previous management.
Having sold most of its assets to BTP last year to reduce debt, the group
has emerged with just one business: Colin Stewart Minchem, a minerals and
chemicals processor acquired for Pounds 11.8m earlier this year.
'The old MTM no longer exists and there will be no more bad news,' said Mr
David Swallow, chairman.
The shares rose 6p to 85p yesterday after the company announced first half
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.13m, against losses of Pounds 11.9m last time.
Mr Swallow said the turnround was due mainly to an improved performance by
the agrochemicals business, where a new management team has cut costs and
consolidated operations at two sites.
The figures were also flattered by Pounds 221,000 of interest receivable,
compared with payments of Pounds 3.7m, and a Pounds 418,000 contribution
from CSM.
Announcing an interim dividend of 0.5p - the first since 1991 - Mr Swallow
added: 'We want to get MTM on a sound long-term footing, and this is the
start.'
With the balance sheet strengthened by the agrochemicals disposal and funds
raised by the placing and open offer earlier this year, the group has began
eyeing technology-related businesses.
Likely acquisitions range from established profitable companies to emerging
businesses which promise to be cash generative.
Earnings per share were 3.73p (losses of 60.6p).
COMMENT
MTM is a speculative buy. Uncertainty surrounds the on-going inquiry by the
Serious Fraud Office, which is investigating the former management, and
there is no guarantee that their successors will find the right acquisitions
to bolster shareholder value. Nevertheless, second half contributions from
CSM and the sale of surplus property - including the Rudby Hall headquarters
when the market capitalisation was Pounds 214m rather than Pounds 19m -
should lift full year profits to Pounds 2.5m. The shares look pretty cheap
on a forward multiple of 14.8, but the risks remain.

FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: Investment losses push Hibernian
in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hibernian Group, the third largest insurance company in the Irish Republic,
reported a pre-tax loss of IPounds 6.24m (Pounds 6.2m) for the first six
months of 1994, against restated profits of IPounds 31.5m.
The result was after realised and unrealised investment losses of IPounds
18.1m (gains of IPounds 21.2m). Operating profits were 15 per cent ahead at
IPounds 11.8m (IPounds 10.2m).
After a tax credit of IPounds 2.67m (IPounds 11.6m debit) losses per share
emerged at 7p against earnings of 38.9p. The interim dividend is raised by 9
per cent to 2.5p (2.3p).
Hibernian, which earns more than 80 per cent of its non-life income in
Ireland, saw general insurance profits rise by 7 per cent to IPounds 9.4m
(IPounds 8.8m), largely reflecting an improved underwriting performance.
Underwriting losses were cut to IPounds 7m (IPounds 8.46m) - mainly because
of the effect of past premium rate increases - and helped offset a reduction
in income from investments to IPounds 16.4m (IPounds 17.3m).
Premium income increased by 8 per cent to IPounds 108.9m.
Operating profits from life assurance and pensions business increased by 67
per cent to IPounds 2.42m (IPounds 1.45m). New annual premiums increased by
43 per cent to IPounds 5.3m, with Hibernian increasing its market share.
Single premium sales amounted to IPounds 19.1m, compared with IPounds 35.1m.
Last year single premium business was boosted by sales of guaranteed bonds.
The group said that 'severe volatility' in world stock markets during the
first half of 1994 caused a fall in the capital value of investments of
IPounds 18.1m, with shareholders' funds decreasing to IPounds 95.5m compared
with IPounds 100.1m at December 31. Net assets per share amounted to 185p
(195.5p at end-December).
Mr Cecil Hayes, general manager finance, said that despite the investment
losses the group had still outperformed the Irish gilt and equity markets.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Brian Duker, chairman and chief executive of BDA Holdings, has been
removed from the board of the property investment and development group.
This follows an extraordinary meeting on Friday when shareholders holding
10.14m ordinary shares, or 56.01 per cent of the equity, voted in favour of
the resolution to remove Mr Duker. Holders of only 629,136 shares (3.48 per
cent) voted against.
The meeting was called by two non-executive directors, Mr Richard Wollenberg
and Mr Nigel Jamieson, who now intend to take an active role in running the
company.
Mr Wollenberg, formerly non-executive deputy chairman, has taken over as
chairman. He said BDA 'intends to build out its existing developments and
land bank and will seek new opportunities to take the company forward'.
Mr A Dawes, presently in charge of building operations, has been appointed
general manager. The board plans to seek additional directors in due course.

FT  23 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Warburg to act as custodian for Halifax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest, has appointed SG Warburg's
custody and investor services division to handle the administration of its
new unit trust business, due to be launched early next year.
The move is part of a growing trend among providers of retail investment
products to assign administration and custody functions to third-party
providers in an effort to reduce costs. Efficient management of custody and
administration increasingly requires significant investments in systems
technology which are too large for all but the largest groups.
Last year, Henderson Administration and Gartmore, two fund management
companies with significant retail products, formed a joint venture to handle
the back-office custody and administration business for their own and
others' funds.
The other leading provider in the UK is Premier Administration, a division
of US-based Mellon Bank, a significant participant in the global custody
business.
Warburg is already the custodian for the new start-up retail financial
products business of the Leeds Building Society and the retail products
business of Invesco, the fund management group. 'This is a business where
economies of scale really do make a difference,' said Ms Elizabeth Corley,
director of Warburg's custody and investor services division. About Pounds
3bn to Pounds 4bn of Warburg's custody assets are those of third parties.
'What we have found is that their interest is less pure custody and more
administrative services,' she said. Rules governing unit trusts make
explicit requirements on the pricing of units, frequency of fund valuations
and transfers of ownership of units.

FT  23 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Meyer shake-out continues as Jewson chief
resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The management shake-out at Meyer International is continuing with the
announcement yesterday that Mr Richard Reynolds is resigning as chairman and
managing director of Jewson, Britain's biggest builders' merchants chain and
the company's largest subsidiary.
Mr Reynolds, 45, who joined Jewson at the age of 16, had been managing
director of the subsidiary since 1986. He is also resigning as a main board
director of Meyer. The company said that Mr Reynolds would be leaving on
September 30 'to pursue other interests'.
The company is thought to have regarded Mr Reynolds as a good operational
manager, but not the right person to pursue the strategic development of the
builders' merchants business which is expected to expand as construction
demand increases.
It is the third major board change to be announced at Meyer in less than a
year. Mr Richard Jewson last autumn announced that he was quitting as
chairman and chief executive of Meyer after the company decided to split the
two roles in line with the Cadbury committee recommendations.
Mr Jewson, who became chairman in 1991, said that he did not disagree with
the board's decision to divide the two roles, but did not want to become a
non-executive chairman, nor did he wish to go back to being chief executive,
his earlier post.
He was succeeded as chief executive by Mr John Dobby, managing director of
Meyer since October 1991. Mr David Kendall, chief executive of BP Oil
between 1985 and 1988 and chairman of Bunzl until last year, was appointed
non-executive chairman of Meyer in April.
Until a successor for Mr Reynolds is appointed, Mr Dobby will take over
responsibility for running Jewson, which contributed 35 per cent of Meyer's
turnover and 41 per cent of operating profits in the 12 months to end-March.
Group profits for the year rose from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 41.6m while
sales increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 1.2bn. Jewson's operating profits
rose by 78 per cent to Pounds 20.7m.
Meyer said yesterday that sales at Jewson, helped by a rise in new
housebuilding, were higher in the first four months of the current financial
year than at the corresponding stage last year.

net income by 34%

Hongkong Bank of Canada, an indirectly-held, wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC
Holdings, reported consolidated net income up 34 per cent to CDollars 23.1m
(Pounds 10.7m) for the third quarter of 1994, against CDollars 17.2m in the
comparable period last time.
Total assets at July 31 were CDollars 15.5bn, up 21 per cent from the
CDollars 12.8bn at end-July 1993. Return on average equity for the period
was 17.5 per cent, against 14.1 per cent.
Mr Bill Dalton, president and chief executive, said the growth of the
balance sheet, tight cost controls, and prudent credit management had all
contributed to a 'record nine months for the bank'.
The risk/asset ratio stood at 8.8 per cent at the period end, and the Tier 1
capital ratio was 5.5 per cent.

FT  23 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Coventry advances 27% to Pounds 16.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coventry Building Society yesterday reported a 27 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 16.5m for the first half of 1994.
Against a background of intense competition for personal savings, the
society took in only Pounds 43m in net retail receipts - including interest
added to savings accounts - against Pounds 187m last time.
Mr Martin Ritchley, chief executive, said that the sector as a whole had
suffered an outflow in the first half of the year. The society is expected
to pursue retail deposits more aggressively in the second half of the year.
He emphasised, however, the importance Coventry attaches to raising money on
the wholesale markets, which is cheaper at present, to fund its mortgage
lending. Mortgage lending was slightly higher in the first half of the year,
at Pounds 216m (Pounds 208m).
Provisions against bad and doubtful mortgage debts fell to Pounds 1.3m
(Pounds 4.2m).
Total assets rose to Pounds 3.05bn (Pounds 2.82bn).
There has been speculation that Coventry, the UK's 15th largest society,
would be a potential target for a bank or other financial institution. But
Mr Ritchley said its results showed it was able successfully to maintain its
independence.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Mannesmann forecasts return to the black for the full year:
German giant slashes first-half losses to DM27m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Economic recovery, restructuring and the first trickle of profits from its
new telecommunications division reduced Mannesmann's first-half losses to
DM27m (Pounds 11.3m), from DM467m.
Forecasting a return to profit for the full year after a 1993 deficit of
DM513m, Mr Joachim Funk, chairman, said yesterday that more cost-cutting was
needed and the group planned to expand foreign manufacturing 'rapidly'.
'Economic recovery does not mean Germany's structural problems are
resolved,' he said in a letter to the workforce and shareholders. In the
light of international price pressures, German costs were still too high.
Total capital spending of DM761m was 6 per cent higher than in the first six
months of last year. The domestic share fell 3 per cent, while investment
abroad was up 50 per cent.
The group reported a 12 per cent rise in exports to DM4.7bn and a 17 per
cent jump in turnover to DM4.7bn at foreign subsidiaries. Group sales
increased 10 per cent to DM14.2bn.
The reduction in losses was helped by unspecified first-time profits from
the D2 mobile telephone network, which incurred a DM240m deficit last year
after launch costs. The network had 680,000 subscribers at the end of June,
compared with 300,000 a year earlier, and a further 20,000 were signed up in
July.
Although no details were given, restructuring costs were also likely to be
markedly lower than last year, when heavy redundancy and early retirement
payments boosted the annual total to DM515m.
Vehicle components and trading activities returned to the black. Tubes
manufacture broke even in the review period, while core heavy engineering
and the relatively small electrical business were still making losses.
Although the value of plant construction contracts was down, group-wide
incoming orders rose 19 per cent to almost DM17bn. Recovery in the
international automotive industry pushed sales up 10 per cent while new
orders rose 18 per cent. Job cuts reduced the workforce by 4 per cent.

FT  23 AUG 94 / LDDS buys long-distance unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Williams Companies, the Oklahoma-based gas pipeline operator, has agreed to
sell its WilTel long-distance telephone business for Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds
1.6bn) to LDDS, the acquisitive US telecommunications group.
Three months ago Williams rejected LDDS's initial bid of Dollars 2bn but
yesterday Mr Keith Bailey, the company's chairman, said the revised offer
from LDDS represented a 'full and fair value' for WilTel.
The takeover, subject to regulatory approval, will create a long-distance
carrier in the US with the size to compete with AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint, the
three dominant operators in the industry. On completion, LDDS will control
about 4 per cent of the Dollars 65bn US long-distance market, compared with
a 10 per cent share for Sprint, 20 per cent for MCI, and 60 per cent for
AT&amp;T.
The deal is part of a gradual consolidation of the US telecommunications
industry, which has seen the blurring of boundaries between long-distance
and local carriers, and between the sector and the cable television and
computer industries.
LDDS said it had secured Dollars 3.25bn in bank loans from a syndicate, led
by NationsBank of North Carolina, to pay for the all-cash acquisition of
WilTel, and to refinance some existing debt. The purchase is its second big
deal this month. Three weeks ago it agreed to buy IDB Communications, a
national satellite-based phone carrier, for Dollars 895m.
Based in Mississippi, LDDS buys access to long-distance lines in bulk and
resells the access at a profit. With revenues of Dollars 1.14bn last year,
it has the fourth largest long-distance customer base in the US, and
specialises in serving small to medium-sized businesses, mainly in the
south-east, south-west and Midwest.
WilTel, which provides companies and other phone carriers with voice and
data transmission services via its 11,000-mile advanced national fibre optic
network, reported an operating profit last year of Dollars 89.7m on revenues
of Dollars 958m.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Charter wins over Esab dissidents: Bid raised to Pounds 286m
in effort to clinch full control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charter, the UK industrial group, yesterday broke the deadlock in its
stalled bid for Esab, the world's leading welding equipment supplier,
raising its bid by Pounds 26m to Pounds 286m and winning the immediate
acceptance of the key Swedish institutional shareholders that had rejected
the original offer.
The move brought to 84 per cent the share of Esab's capital and voting
rights pledged to Charter and is almost certain to ensure the UK company
wins the 90 per cent acceptances it needs to achieve a complete takeover.
Charter made the new bid of SKr380 per A and B share, up from the original
bid of SKr345, unconditional.
The first offer, made at the end of June, was recommended by the Esab board
and accepted by Incentive, the Wallenberg family industrial group that is
Esab's controlling shareholder. But it was blocked when five institutions
holding some 20 per cent of the voting capital rejected it as underpriced
following a sharp rise in Esab's shares, to as much as SKr365, and a jump in
the company's profits forecast.
Charter, with 54 per cent of Esab secured, initially baulked at raising an
offer which had initially represented a 20 per cent premium to the market
price. But Mr Jeffrey Herbert, Charter's chief executive, said yesterday it
was not satisfied with a simple majority shareholding. 'At the end of the
day we are far happier with 100 per cent ownership. That is why I have
increased the offer - and the performance of the business has fully
justified the offer we have now made.'
The new deal was worked out last week between Charter and the 4th Fund, a
state pension fund which was the biggest shareholder after Incentive. Five
other leading institutions also accepted the new terms.
Charter, which is also assuming Pounds 130m in debt, will part-fund the deal
through a Pounds 93m one-for-four rights issue at 560p per Charter share.
All Esab shareholders will benefit from the new offer, adding SKr150m to the
SKr1.3bn Incentive will receive for its 48 per cent stake. The acquisition
of Esab, which had a turnover in 1993 of SKr7bn, will more than double
Charter's size and add a fourth leg to its interests in building materials,
coal and rail track equipment.
Trade unions at Esab campaigned against Charter, portraying it as a foreign
predator that would run down Esab's operations in Sweden. But Mr Herbert
said yesterday Charter intended to keep the present management in place.
'Esab is becoming part of a group that is used to running international
businesses and which in the last four years has invested Pounds 150m in
growing businesses,' he said.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Investments lift Citic Pacific 46% to HK1.2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong-listed arm of the Beijing foreign investment
company, Citic, yesterday topped market expectations when it announced a 46
per cent surge in net profits to HKDollars 1.2bn (Pounds 100m) for the first
half of 1994.
In April, the group issued HKDollars 3.82bn of shares, partly to finance
tunnel and property acquisitions. As a result earnings per share rose by a
more modest 30 per cent to 62.3 cents compared with 47.8 cents last year.
Turnover crept up 5 per cent to HKDollars 6.5bn. Shareholders are to receive
a dividend of 13 cents a share, up 3 cents.
Profits were lifted by the group's long-term investments. Citic holds 12 per
cent of Hongkong Telecom, the colony's monopoly supplier of fixed-line
services, and 12.5 per cent of Cathay Pacific, the international airline
which last week announced an 18 per cent rise in earnings. It is the first
time a full six months' contribution has come in from Hongkong Telecom at
the interim stage.
Dragonair, the Asian airline in which Citic has a 46 per cent stake, made
progress as additional flights were added to main destinations.
Contrary to market expectations of a sluggish year for its motor trading
business, Mr Larry Yung, chairman, said margins were maintained at last
year's levels.
Citic has recently acquired for HKDollars 3.4bn a 50 per cent stake in
Discovery Bay, a self-contained community on one of Hong Kong's outlying
islands. Mr Yung said an application had been made by co-owner Hong Kong
Resort Company to build additional floor area, a new pier and a tunnel
linking Discovery Bay to the airport road system. 'Directors of Citic
Pacific will be actively involved in discussions with the government on this
matter which is of considerable strategic importance,' he said.
The first two 350MW generators of Citic's 56 per cent-owned Ligang Power
Station are now fully operational. Installation of the next two generators
is planned to start shortly, with completion of the first scheduled for late
1997.
Citic has invested in a 25 per cent interest in Phase I of the Pudong Power
Station with four 300MW generators, the first of which is expected to start
commercial operation by the end of next year.
Mr Yung forecast that full-year earnings would show a 'substantial increase'
on 1993.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Pillar follows debut with a Pounds 60m spending spree
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pillar Property Investments, which started trading only eight days ago, has
lined up Pounds 60m of acquisitions including a Northampton shopping centre
and the office complex that houses the Mermaid Theatre, in London's
Blackfriars district.
The deals are symptomatic of a management which built up Arlington
Securities - acquired by British Aerospace in 1989 - and came into Pillar in
May with the aim of transforming it into an active property investment and
development group.
Pillar is paying Pounds 28.5m to Provident Mutual for the 254,000 sq ft
Weston Favell Shopping Centre, which will be partially redeveloped. However,
the Provident Mutual can withdraw if Pillar does not also complete the
purchase of the Blackfriars properties by August 26 for about Pounds 30m.
Pillar would acquire the long lease on two office blocks at Numbers 1 and 2
Puddle Dock, occupied by KPMG Peat Marwick and Touche Remnant. It would also
buy a sub-lease over the Mermaid Theatre.
Mr Raymond Mould, Pillar's chairman, said: 'It would offer us a good income
stream, a good location, and the scope for a major redevelopment.' He was
confident that the deal would be signed this week.
Redevelopment of Puddle Dock would be complicated by the Mermaid Theatre.
The City of London holds the freehold interest in the properties, while
Gomba Holdings, owned by the Shamji family, has a long-term 'pepper-corn
lease' on the Mermaid. Mr Mould said Pillar had the option to redevelop on
top of the existing theatre.
It could also reach an arrangement with the Shamji family and the City of
London, probably involving relocation of the unoccupied Mermaid. The site is
on the fringe of the City and would have to compete for tenants with other
redevelopment projects, including Greycoat's Paternoster project in St
Paul's.
The shopping project is being injected into Pillar's Pounds 250m
joint-venture retail property fund with Canada's largest public pension
fund, Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec.

FT  23 AUG 94 / US group digs deeper into UK undertaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Service Corporation Inter-national yesterday more than doubled its
'strategic' stake in Britain's second largest funeral business, Plantsbrook,
to 8.4 per cent, and the US company said it intended to buy more.
Mr Peter Hindley, Plantsbrook's chief executive, said he had received no
communication from SCI, but commented: 'I doubt whether they would want to
be a long-term passive shareholder; that's not their style.'
SCI, North America's largest burial company, has sent shockwaves through the
sombre world of UK undertaking this summer. It launched and won a hostile
bid for Great Southern Group and followed this up 11 days ago with the
purchase of a 2.9 per cent stake in Great Southern's largest listed
competitor.
In the Great Southern bid, SCI took on the Field family, which controlled 56
per cent of the company. Plantsbrook also presents a formidable hurdle in
the form of France's largest burier, Pompes Funebres, which owns 46 per
cent.
Mr Hindley said: 'The French have said they are happy with Plantsbrook and
it has become a large part of their business.' But with deregulation of the
French funeral industry affecting its market share, Pompes Funebres faces
some difficulties at home.
Plantsbrook's share price rose 12p to 175p yesterday, compared with 100p
prior to SCI's expression of interest, providing the French with an option
to sell for a substantial profit. It is understood that SCI has spoken to
Pompes Funebres.
There is little geographical overlap between Great Southern and Plantsbrook.
If the latter were acquired, SCI would have a UK market share of close to 15
per cent.
However, the purchase of Plantsbrook's Dignity in Destiny, a scheme for
pre-payment for burials, would give SCI a large part of the so-called
'pre-need' market, due to the pre-eminence of Great Southern's Chosen
Heritage plan. This might result in a bid referral to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
SCI also announced yesterday that all investors who sold shares in Great
Southern on August 2 and 3 could apply for compensation - due to an error in
an offer announcement - by submitting claims to its brokers, Cazenove, by
September 17.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Sterling and Dollars continue decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar and sterling continued their parallel decline yesterday, with the
pound finishing at a 17-month low against the D-Mark, writes Philip Gawith.
In spite of the release of buoyant UK GDP and trade data, sterling lost over
a pfennig against the D-Mark to finish in London at DM2.3729 from DM2.3836
on Friday. Against the dollar, it closed firmer at Dollars 1.5501 from
Dollars 1.5483. Later in New York it gained a little against both
currencies.
Sterling has now lost 25 pfennigs from a high of DM2.62 in January. Over the
same period it has risen by 9 cents against the dollar, from Dollars 1.46.
Analysts said the pound was being caught in the backwash of the movements of
the dollar and the D-Mark. There was no evidence that it had become the
object of speculative pressure in its own right.
The dollar is slipping back towards the lows of DM1.5165 and Y96.55, touched
on July 12. Yesterday it closed nearly a pfennig lower, at DM1.5309 from
DM1.5396. It also slipped below Y98, closing at Y97.96 from Y98.475.
Sentiment towards the US currency remains negative, with the market
concerned about the state of US-Japan trade talks, whether the Fed is
winning the fight against inflation and the weakness of the Clinton
presidency.

FT  23 AUG 94 / Pentagon seeks sweeping cuts in weapons spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Pentagon has ordered a sweeping review of almost all its main weapons
programmes in an effort to squeeze defence spending over the next five years
into a shrinking budget.
The military services have been told to prepare to cancel, delay or arrange
substitutes for all their most costly equipment plans, including the Air
Force's F-22 fighter, the Army's Comanche helicopter, the Navy's Aegis
destroyer and the Marines' V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft.
Mr William Perry, the defence secretary, said the services had requested
more money for the 1996 fiscal year than the administration's budget would
allow.
He had therefore 'given them some guidance on where to cut' to ensure that
service chiefs did not try to preserve pet weapon systems by scrimping on
operations and training budgets, which he views as essential if US forces
are to maintain full readiness.
'This doesn't mean that they'll be cut. It's just to say that these are not
sacred cows,' Mr Perry said yesterday.
In a memorandum to service chiefs, Mr John Deutch, Mr Perry's deputy,
targeted 10 key weapons programmes for cancellation or delay.
Mr Deutch told the Air Force to develop a plan for delaying acquisition of
the F-22 fighter, built by Lockheed and Boeing.
The Air Force currently plans to acquire over 48 F-22s a year, starting in
1998, at a cost of Dollars 71bn.( Pounds 45.8bn).
The F-22 is the Air Force's most cherished project, and delaying its
acquisition would complicate plans for replacing the F-16 strike aircraft in
the next century.
But Army officials have already started sniping at the F-22, which they say
is designed to give a degree of air superiority that will never be needed
against the third-world enemies the US is now likely to face, and has only
limited ground attack capability.
The Army, in turn, faces the prospect of cancelling its only two major
programmes: the Comanche helicopter and the Advanced Field Artillery System.
The Navy has been asked for plans to slow its shipbuilding programme to an
average of either 2.5 or 2 destroyers a year, with additional delays for its
new attack submarine.
Mr Deutch also asked the Marines to submit the most promising helicopter
alternative to the controversial Osprey, which takes off like a helicopter
but then swings its rotors down to fly like a propeller-driven aircraft. Top
Pentagon officials have tried for years to kill off the expensive and still
experimental aircraft.
Senior members of Congress and government auditors have been warning for
some time that the armed services have failed to scale back their
procurement plans enough to fit within today's budget limits.
But cancelling some of the Pentagon's highest profile weapons systems is
sure to attract criticism from opponents who have attacked the Clinton
administration for cutting defence spending too much.

FT  23 AUG 94 / DTI ends electrical companies'cartel at exhibitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Department of Trade and Industry officials moved yesterday to end a monopoly
enjoyed by five electrical companies which supply London exhibition halls.
The decision, taken after a long delay by Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate
affairs minister at the DTI, implements a recommendation first made by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission in a report in 1990.
The MMC found that five electrical companies - Ecando Systems, Business
Design Centre, Lightpower Exhibitions, S. Seymour (Electrics) and Johnson
Smith and Company - were operating a complex monopoly which inhibited
individual exhibitors from having any say in buying electrical services.
The report concluded there was a direct tie between these electrical
contractors and individual hall owners, including Earls Court, Olympia,
Wembley, Novotel Hotels and the Barbican.
These links were against the public interest, the MMC found, because, among
other things, the payment of commission to hall owners and/or exhibition
organisers distorted competition between electrical contractors.
According to the 1990 report the five contractors had around three-quarters
of the market for exhibition halls in London which in 1988 was worth Pounds
8.3m.
The DTI yesterday said procedural difficulties accounted for the delay in
implementing the MMC's report. A spokesman said it was only in March 1993
that Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, was invited by
the DTI to negotiate voluntary undertakings from the five companies.
But, undertakings to stop monopolistic practices have apparently been
unforthcoming - forcing yesterday's DTI order. The order will:
Make it unlawful for a hall owner to place limitations on the electrical
contractors who may provide contracting services in their hall other than on
objective safety grounds;
Prohibit the payment of commission by any electrical contractor to a hall
owner.
In the case of exhibitions where an organiser and electrical contractor are
part of the same corporate group as the hall owner, the order also prohibits
the nomination of any person as an electrical contractor, unless the
contractor has been selected by a competitive process as offering the lowest
scheduled prices.
Ms Caroline Moore, spokeswoman for P&amp;O Exhibition Services - the new name
for Ecando Systems - said in response to the order: 'I cannot comment until
we have a chance to study the minister's statement.'
The conference business in London is worth about Pounds 250m.

FT  23 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Underwriting profits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hardly surprising that the Inland Revenue is examining whether
sub-underwriting commissions received by pension funds can be brought into
the tax net. A recent study for the Office of Fair Trading concluded that
profits from underwriting were excessive. And, much as the pension fund
industry protests that one-off disasters like the 1987 BP share sale can
wipe out years of profits, to the outside world the business looks like
money for old rope. Tax officials are unlikely to be put off by arguments
that the sums of money are just not worth collecting.
The issue will turn, in the first instance, on the almost theological
question of whether pension funds are engaging in a trade when they
sub-underwrite share issues. That, in turn, revolves around whether the
activity is a regular or only an occasional source of profits. If the
industry loses this point, it will fall back on the argument that, in
sub-underwriting issues, it is effectively selling issuers put options. So
any trading it is engaged in is option trading - an activity where it
already has tax exemption.
The industry's final line of defence will be that taxing sub-underwriting
fees will push up the cost of capital. All other things being equal, taxing
the commissions would tend to increase the cost of capital because
sub-underwriters would put up their fees or leave the market. But, if
profits are as high as most observers think, a tax could be easily
accommodated without any adverse effect.

FT  23 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Sterling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult to judge whether the downward drift of sterling simply
reflects the weakness of the dollar or is a sign of anxieties closer to
home. Yesterday's economic figures give no obvious reason to worry.
Second-quarter growth was higher than anticipated, but exports led the way.
The currency markets can hardly fret about the balance of payments. Consumer
spending has fallen back since the end of last year, which together with
last week's retail price figures should soothe nerves about inflation. Even
the political worries which unsettled financial markets earlier in the year
have faded.
With growth running so far above trend, inflationary pressures are sure to
reassert themselves. But that should not undermine sterling so long as the
market is confident that interest rates will be raised in good time. The
nagging doubt may be that recent data makes an early rise unlikely, after
which other considerations - notably the political party conference season -
are excuses to delay.
If the markets are tempted to try to force the chancellor's hand, though,
considerable pressure will be required. After the retreat from the exchange
rate mechanism two years ago, the exchange rate is hardly high on the policy
agenda. Besides, on a trade-weighted basis sterling has lost only 5 per cent
this year and is well above the low-point touched last February. While a
steadily devaluing currency must give the authorities pause for thought in a
period of above-trend growth, sterling's strength against the dollar might
actually help keep input costs under control.

FT  23 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Mannesmann
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Restructuring old businesses and diversifying into new ones are paying off
for Mannesmann. The group's mobile communications venture made its maiden
profits contribution in the first half. That should please foreign investors
in particular, who have bought the stock on the basis that Mannesmann
Mobilfunk was the German equivalent of Vodafone.
Equally, the painful process of cutting jobs and shifting production to
cheaper locations outside Germany helps explain the swing into profit by the
automotive components businesses and the move to break-even by the tubes
division. Mannesmann's new chairman, Mr Joachim Funk, yesterday made clear
there is more of the same to come.
But the news from Mannesmann's large engineering and plant division was
mixed. Orders rose 34 per cent compared with the previous year - ahead of
the German average increase of 26 per cent. The disappointment was that this
has yet to show on the bottom line. Some of the blame can be attributed to
the seasonality of the plant side of this business. But there are also
suspicions that Mannesmann has been bidding unsustainably low prices to
retain or even increase its market share. Continued growth from Mobilfunk
and recovery of Mannesmann's cyclical businesses will drive profits higher
over the next few years. But, with the shares already trading on about 15
times next year's earnings, the stock does not look cheap.
