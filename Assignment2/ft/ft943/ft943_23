FT  20 AUG 94 / The Nature of Things: A simple pill to beat the body clock -
Clive Cookson explains how our brains tune in to the rhythm of life and how
we can reduce jet lag
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Within each of us ticks a biochemical clock, which has evolved to keep our
minds and bodies in tune with the natural cycle of night and day. Most
people know how it feels to be out of step with their internal clock,
through jet lag after an intercontinental flight or the exhaustion of
working night shifts. They may not know, however, that there are now
scientifically valid ways to re-set the clock.
Biologists proved during the 1960s and 1970s that there really was an
internal circadian rhythm (not to be confused with new-age 'biorhythms'
which claim, without scientific foundation, to relate cyclical events in
your life to your date of birth). And they showed how the clock affects
people's performance in a wide range of mental and physical tasks, as well
as their susceptibility to disease and response to drugs.
In the 1980s it became clear that a hormone called melatonin plays a key
role in regulating the daily cycle. Melatonin is produced by the pineal
gland, which Rene Descartes, the great 17th-century philosopher, decided
must be the seat of the soul because it was the only unpaired structure he
could find in the human brain.
Animal experiments showed, however, that the main clock lies not in the
pineal gland but in the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus, an organ no larger
than a grain of rice. (Although it is convenient to think of a single
circadian clock, there are in fact several timekeepers acting together to
control the daily rhythm - and we have other clocks controlling different
cycles including the annual rhythm of the seasons.)
Research in the 1990s has given scientists hope that they will soon discover
the precise molecular mechanism of the clock. It should then be possible to
intervene directly to synchronise your internal cycle with the world
outside, if you are flying across time zones or working nights. There might
also be new treatments for sleep-related disorders and some mental illnesses
that are related to faulty internal time-keeping.
As in so many other fields of current biomedical research, genetics seems
set to provide the answer to the riddle of the clock. Biologists have found
clock genes in primitive organisms (frq in bread mould and per in fruit
flies) and this year Joseph Takahashi and colleagues at Northwestern
University near Chicago caused great excitement by creating a mutant breed
of mice with no circadian rhythm. The mice have a defective gene which the
American researchers called clock (for circadian locomotor output cycles
kaput).
Clock is the first circadian gene discovered in a mammal. Scientists expect
now to move quickly to find out exactly what protein the normal version of
the gene, cloc, makes and then to propose how it could work as a clock in
conjunction with other genes.
Any clock must be based on a periodic or oscillating system. Man-made
instruments use physical oscillators: a pendulum in a grandfather clock, a
vibrating atom in an electronic clock.
Our body clock probably uses a chemical oscillator based on the
transcription of genes. Think of two genes, A and B. If A makes a protein
that switches on B, and B makes a protein that switches off A, the feedback
can cause a natural oscillation in the system, with a characteristic period.
The natural free-running period of the human clock is close to 24 1/2 hours.
When volunteers live for many weeks in isolated windowless chambers, where
there are no clues about the time outside, they follow a pattern of waking,
sleeping and other activities in which each 'day' lasts slightly longer than
a real day.
In our normal lives, the internal circadian clock is constantly being re-set
by signals from the world around us. Much the most important of these
'zeitgebers' is the presence or absence of bright light.
In darkness the pineal gland produces melatonin, whereas daylight stops its
production. Presumably the melatonin acts in some way on the clock cells in
the suprachiasmatic nucleus to adjust their chemical oscillation.
Although natural zeitgebers can bring the cycle forward or push it back by
an hour or two within a day, more serious desynchronisation - in the form of
jet lag - can take as much as several days to overcome. However there are
ways of speeding up the process by reinforcing the signals.
One is exposure to bright light. But the simplest step is to take a
melatonin tablet before going to sleep at night. Tests with small groups of
volunteers indicate that melatonin reduces the time intercontinental flyers
feel jet lag by about a third, without adverse side-effects.
Unfortunately, no pharmaceutical company has taken up melatonin as a
commercial product and carried out large-scale trials to prove its safety
and to discover what doses work best. The lack of interest is explained by
the fact that melatonin is a simple natural molecule which is easily
synthesised and not eligible for patent protection. So drug companies
calculate that the potential financial returns would not be sufficient to
justify spending several million pounds on the clinical trials required to
obtain a licence for melatonin.
Yet, through a loophole in the regulations, melatonin can be sold as a
nutritional supplement so long as no medical claims are made for it. You can
buy it from some health food suppliers in the US and Europe, but not from a
chemist's shop as a jet lag pill.
Josephine Arendt, a pioneering jet lag researcher at the University of
Surrey, says she takes melatonin 'and so does almost everyone else in the
field. It is tragic that it has not been developed by the pharmaceutical
industry,' she adds.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Attractive Italians - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON and JILL JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asda has a particularly good range of Italian wines this summer, and its
prices are keen. Barbera d'Asti 1990 Gemma is just Pounds 3.99 and is
bursting with ripe, chestnut and fruit flavours, displaying bite but not
harshness.
Chianti Classico 1990 Quercia al Poggio at Pounds 4.99 is an underpriced
plum cleverly extracted from the somewhat dubious pie that is modern Chianti
(which can offer DOCG wines, supposedly Italy's crema della crema, for sale
at Pounds 2.99). Maurizio Castelli is oenologist at this fine estate, and
the seductively fragrant, substantial wine has benefited from its stint in
new French barrels.
A chance for city slickers to enjoy a free lunch next month. The second City
food and wine fair is being held at Sutton's Hospital, Charterhouse, London
on September 22 from 11am until 7pm. Some of the city of London's best-known
food businesses will be offering product samples including: Ashby's, the
butcher's and Ashdown, the fishmongers, both of Leadenhall market; City
Herbs, of New Spitalfields Market; Philip Dade boulangerie and patisserie,
of Middlesex; Mostly Smoked, of south London; Spicers Hampers, of Kent and
many more.
Not only is it an opportunity to sample a glass of Jacquesson 'Perfection'
brut non-vintage champagne, courtesy of Mayfair Cellars (which is organising
the tasting), but you can probably drink it from a Riedel glass, too.
Admission is by invitation only. If you would like one, send details of your
company and position to: John Trendell, Mayfair Cellars, 14 Rushworth
Street, London, SE1 ORB. Tel: 071-928 8899 or fax: 071-401 8041.
Snod's welsh pork and leek sausage. Now there's a name to conjure with.
Particularly as the sausage is being produced by two brothers, Hugo and
Oliver Woolley, in Kent. Their traditional hand-linked products, using prime
cuts of meat, natural casings and no artificial additives, are drawing a
loyal following in Tunbridge Wells. The shop offers 18 varieties. I like the
sound of Mrs Goudini's Italian sausage - coarse ground pork, garlic, Italian
wine, oregano and basil - and also Alan Woodward's Sussex Village sausage
with herbs, spices, juniper and a hint of gin. Freezer packs are available
but there is no mail order service - yet. The address is: The Hugo Oliver
Sausage Shop, 37 Monson Road, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, TNI 1LS. (Tel:
0892-545644). JJ
Talking of sausages . . . those who want to make their own can obtain
casings from The Natural Casings Company, PO Box 133, Farnham, Surrey, GU10
5HT. Tel: 0252-850454. Fax 0252-851284. A Pounds 5.50 pack of hog casings
(post and packing included) contains 25 yards (enough to make 20lbs of
sausages), seasoning, plus instructions and recipes.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Journalist takes a risk to get
himself into print - Max Hotopf fled Fleet Street to become his own boss. It
was, a rewarding decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When he left university Max Hotopf had no idea that within 12 years he would
be the head of a publishing corporation. His career, in fact, got off to a
bad start. After a year teaching English as a foreign language he worked as
an advertising executive and an invoice clerk.
'I was fired and made redundant twice by the age of 24,' said Hotopf, 36,
who gained a combined honours degree in politics and sociology at Durham
University.
Casting his mind back he thinks this is no bad thing. 'It gave me the desire
to succeed - and above all, to make money,' he said.
By the age of 29, after working in public relations and as a journalist on a
computer magazine and then Accountancy Age, Hotopf gained a job on the city
staff of the Daily Mail. It was a good job. He earned more than Pounds
30,000 for a four-day week. But after nearly four years he decided to leave
and start his own business newsletter.
'My colleagues thought I was mad to leave a good job in a recession to form
a new venture in an area known to be risky,' Hotopf said. 'I had the burning
desire to start my own business. But it was a tremendous gamble as my wife
and I had recently bought a 14th century house in a Suffolk village, and a
second baby was on the way.
'Somehow I just didn't see myself as becoming a city editor. Really I saw
starting my own business as growing up, and I knew there was money to be
made in business newsletters - providing you get the arithmetic right.'
With a Pounds 105,000 mortgage and a large medieval house in need of
extensive renovation it was important to get it right first time. He did.
But before that there had been a false start.
While at the Daily Mail, Hotopf and a colleague had tried to start a
newsletter on management consultancy. 'Unfortunately my partner gave the
game away. Word of our plans leaked out and somebody else got a similar
project off the ground first,' Hotopf said. 'I regarded this as bragging and
I was very angry.'
His new venture started in September 1991, with immediate mailing of the
first details of his new newsletter - PC Europa - to 1,200 potential
subscribers.
'It was a crucial exercise. It really had to pull in the first subscribers,
as we had no plans to sell advertising and only a recent legacy of Pounds
20,000 to live off if the venture failed,' Hotopf said.
The mailshot pulled in 30 subscribers of Pounds 300 each from Europe, North
America and the Far East. It was a response of nearly 3 per cent - very good
by mailshot standards. 'It pulled in a vital Pounds 9,000 and gave us
confidence and credibility,' Hotopf said.
A key element had been a deal with American Express which allowed its credit
card to be to use for payment.
'I knew it would be very difficult to get credit card company recognition
from the onset,' Hotopf said. 'When Amex initially refused me I rang their
press office and said I was from the Daily Mail. I explained why I thought I
should be eligible.
'It hinged on the question of resale and the fear of the credit card
companies that unknown new customers might resell goods bought on a credit
card that they have not paid for. I was able to convince them that my
newsletter had no resale value.'
Eventually, representatives of Amex visited him in his home and viewed his
business plan. Shortly after gaining Amex approval, he also won over Diner's
Club.
The other fundamental to start-up success was wording. Hotopf named his
newsletter PC Europa. The description underneath the name on the front of
the 24 page publication is very precise. It reads: 'Authoritative
newsletters on Europe's pc markets.' It is very specific, and aimed at a
precise target area. Hotopf liked the name Passant - his mother's maiden
name - so he called his tiny company by the grand title of the Passant
Publishing Corporation.
'Although the word corporation has little meaning in English company law,
the title had a ring to it, and also the feel of credibility. I felt the
word corporation would appeal to the Americans and the Japanese,' he said.
The home of the Passant Publishing Corporation was the equally
grand-sounding Church House, in the High Street of the pretty village of
Nayland, near Colchester. Subscribers were not to know this was Hotopf's
home.
Rebecca, who trained as a doctor and is her husband's business partner,
remained at home to run the business while caring for the couple's children.
Hotopf travelled to the crucial computer exhibitions.
After less than three years subscribers total 800, Hotopf has a staff of
two, and at his year-end in August he expects turnover to top Pounds
300,000. Profitability stands at about 30 per cent.
The company also produces three annual directories - Distributors in Europe
 -the top 500; PC Retailers in Europe; and The new PC Assemblers.
'My main worry is the current rate of renewal. The experts say it should be
around 80 per cent, and we are not hitting this figure,' Hotopf said.
'Keeping quality up is my top priority. A regular flow of up-to-date
information is the key. However, despite the arrival of Mark Russell (a
26-year-old languages graduate) five months ago, I think we might have let
it slip slightly.'
Hotopf and Russell do all the interviewing and writing, 90 per cent of which
is by telephone. The third member of the team is administrator Robert
Rennie.
By far the biggest overhead - Hotopf currently works from a small office
near his home with a rent of Pounds 350 a month - is his telephone bill. It
averages Pounds 1,000 a month because of the high proportion of
international calls.
As the owner of a successful and profitable specialist business newsletter
one might think Hotopf's eyes would be on expanding the Passant Publishing
Corporation. But he will not be drawn on this.
'First of all I want to produce three or four more reports,' he said. We are
currently limited by the size of our office so a move is the next thing on
the cards. Then I'll take a hard look. I can double the turnover of the
business from doing a few more reports and improving the quality and
circulation of the newsletter, so maybe this will be the course to follow.'

FT  20 AUG 94 / Lunch with the FT: The world in a spin around Planet Earl -
Lucy Kellaway grabs a bite with a hamburger king
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Earl's public relations man had initially suggested that I meet the
hamburger king in Las Vegas. I could attend the opening party of the newest
of the Planet Hollywood restaurants and get to meet the stars at the same
time.
Not wanting to be difficult, I asked if I might lunch with Robert Earl a bit
nearer home. The second suggestion was an evening party, to be given by Earl
at Planet Hollywood in London for Michael Caine, Arnold Schwarzenegger and
Jamie Lee Curtis in honour of a new film I had not heard of.
Twenty odd years ago Robert Earl was a humble catering student and a waiter
at The Savoy. Now he is the classic entrepreneur, having turned an initial
investment of Pounds 50,000 into over Pounds 50m through three themed
restaurant chains. These days he comes with all the trimmings: the private
jet, and so many glamorous friends that seeing him on his own was going to
be a problem.
I explained that the 'Lunch with the FT' articles involved eating lunch with
the guest, preferably without half of the film trade there too. Earl's PR
agreed that I could meet the man alone at Planet Hollywood London at 1pm on
the day of the party. That would be perfect, I said.
In the event it was not perfect at all. The amplifiers were pumping out rock
music so loudly, at the Pounds 8m theme burger bar off Piccadilly Circus,
that I could feel the leopard skin banquette vibrating underneath me.
'Look] That's Robert', said the PR, pointing at the huge screen above our
heads on which was playing the film of the Pounds 1m bash given last year to
launch the restaurant. He kept up an amiable patter about Arnie, Bruce
Willis and Sylvester Stallone, each of whom owns a small stake in the Planet
Hollywood chain.
Eventually the man himself arrived, tiny, tanned, in a dazzling shirt and
Planet Hollywood bomber jacket.
'Have you ordered?' he asked in a high-pitched voice with traces of a North
London accent. I said no, so he ordered for me, telling a waitress to bring
Diet Coke and a selection of the house specialities.
'I'm going to Paris with Arnold in the morning. This afternoon I'll be at
Harvey Goldsmith's office at three,' he said to the departing PR. 'Do you
know Harvey Goldsmith?' he asked me. 'Not personally,' I said.
Looking at me doubtfully he inquired whether I was 'in- house' at the FT,
and what I wrote about. So I described my job, and in return he described
his. 'I've just left an event in Las Vegas with Andre Agassi and Don
Johnson. I'm here in London because my partner Arnold Schwarzenegger is
premiering in a movie called True Lies.'
He told me how many millions the film had already made in the US, how many
hundreds of celebrities would be at his party that night, and how many
thousands of fans would be lining the streets outside. Later that week he
would be in Tel Aviv opening a restaurant, then back to see his family in
Orlando for a day, before going on to Dallas. 'It's a very typical week,' he
said.
The next day he was off to Paris to the new site on the Champs Elysee. 'We
are opening a restaurant there in March. That'll be our second attack into
Europe. You are sitting in our London restaurant having lunch.'
This obvious point served as a prelude to some more tendentious statements.
'This is the highest grossing restaurant in Europe. We do in excess of
Pounds 15m a year,' he said pronouncing every word carefully making sure I
was taking it in. 'We're pleasantly surprised we have not been labelled a
tourist trap - if you look round the room it is full of Brits.'
I was not quite sure how to respond. Part of the Planet Hollywood magic was
meant to be the permanent queue outside, yet when I arrived there had been
no one waiting at all, and the the people at the next door table looked
suspiciously Japanese. Yet such was Earl's insistence that I felt sure it
was my mistake: last Tuesday must have been a freakish day.
He stopped, smiled and blew a kiss. 'One of my favourite waitresses,' he
explained. 'Worldwide, there'll be 15 Planet Hollywoods by next week, 20 by
the end of the year, 40 by the end of next year, and 100 by the end of the
century.' People in India, in Jakarta and in Seoul will soon have the chance
to eat their burgers surrounded by bits of film memorabilia, watching movie
clips, and hoping to catch a glimpse of Sylvester Stallone.
'Stallone is here for four months filming. He's at the restaurant every
night. He loves England. Being single he loves it even more.' This struck me
as a non-sequitur, but I let it pass.
A waitress skipped up to the table. 'That's quick]' he yelled at her above
the din. 'We must have influence]' Pointing to the dishes she was laying on
the table, he explained: 'These are like deep fried won-ton with barbecue
cheese, that's chicken in American cereal called Cap'n Crunch, and that's
blackened shrimp - quite spicy - and that's creole mustard sauce.'
He popped one from the first plate into his mouth but then sat back sipping
his Diet Coke, leaving me to battle singlehandedly with enough food to feed
a family of five for a week. 'Are you going to have a main course after
this?' he asked. 'No? Are you sure? A Caesar Salad? Try one?' He ordered for
himself a small bowl of plain pasta with nothing on it.
I asked if he got fed up with the food there. 'No]' he said vehemently. 'No,
you can get everything here, everything. Shelly good morning,' - turning to
address a well-groomed woman behind him. 'Just look at the success,' he said
gesturing around him. 'That's Marilyn Monroe's dress over there. That's Judy
Garland's dress. That one (pointing at a large winged vehicle dangling from
the ceiling) is worth Pounds  1/4 m and is from You Only Live Twice.'
In an attempt to change the subject, I asked about his other business
interests. A few years ago he considered buying Tottenham Hotspur but was
unwilling to do battle with Alan Sugar. Now he has turned his attention to
basketball, and that very week had spent 'a few hundred thousands' buying a
British basketball team in partnership with Harvey Goldsmith.
'This sport is going to take off here,' he said, in a way that brooked no
argument. 'Sky TV has adopted it. Budweiser has adopted it. It's sweeping
the world. Some people will show you numbers that say it's bigger than
soccer. Look at that gremlin up there.'
He points at a green plastic monster sitting on top of the bar. The waitress
brings his modest dish. 'Hey this is getting quick] I'm really impressed]'
he said.
I invited him to talk about his childhood. His father, also Robert Earl, was
a 1950s crooner, while his mother ran her own business in the clothing
trade. He told me he had been entrepreneurial right from his days at
catering college. 'Even now, I wish to be more successful. I'm being very
honest with you, aren't I?' he said, putting his face rather too close to
mine. 'Most people would like my job.'
'I wouldn't,' I replied, thinking of the need to be so relentlessly
positive. 'Most people would, most people would,' he said, putting me right.
'My partner and I (film producer Keith Barish) flew over here on Concorde.
We laughed and worked and giggled the whole time. People thought we were
crazy. We'd go from talking about multi-million pound deals to physically
strangling each other.'
The waitress came again and he forced me to have a pudding: 'Have the
brownie and ice cream, or the bread pudding with whiskey sauce.' He had
another Diet Coke.
He complained that he was suffering from a summer of excess, listing the
exclusive resorts he has visited this year with his family, usually in the
company of the Schwarzeneggers and the Barishes.
The manager came over to say that Roger Myers, head of the Pelican Group -
of which Earl owns 11 per cent - was there. To detain him a bit longer (we
had had just 45 minutes together) I asked if his 90-year-old secretary was
still alive. 'I came back for a big tear-jerker funeral early this year,' he
said sadly and, brightening, added: 'But I made her famous just before she
passed away. I got her government recognition, she was on television,
journalists came from all over to see her. I threw a great 90th birthday for
her at her golf club.'
He was looking restless, trying to leave. I asked about the Dollars 1.5bn
law suit filed against him by a partner of the Hard Rock cafe group, which
Earl helped build up in the 1980s. The allegation is that the Planet
Hollywood is a copy of the Hard Rock format; but Earl seemed unconcerned.
'I've never laid awake at night over anything. I go to bed and go to sleep.'
As he left, I asked if the FT could pay for lunch. To my surprise, he said
'sure'. For the next 10 minutes I tried to catch someone's eye for the bill.
But no one seemed interested, so I gave up, and crept out past the queue
which by then had formed outside.

The table shows capital gains tax indexation allowances for assets sold in
July.
Multiply the original cost of the asset by the figure for the month in which
you bought it. Subtract the result form the proceeds of your sale; the
balance will be your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose you bought shares for Pounds 6,000 in September 1985 and sold them
in July 1994 for Pounds 13,000. Multiplying the original cost by the
September 1985 figure of 1.509 gives a total of Pounds 9,054.
Subtracting that from Pounds 13,000 gives a capital gain of Pounds 3,946,
which is within the CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800.
If selling shares bought before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982
figure. The RPI in July was 144.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Gifts to a wife
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I am non-resident for tax purposes but my wife and I will soon return to
live in the UK. Before then, I wish to give her some of my shareholdings so
(a) we can take advantage of separate annual CGT exemptions after our
return, and (b) we can realise capital gains made while I am exempt from CGT
through non-residence.
If I simply give her the shares, will she be treated as having acquired them
at market value on the date of the gift or at the (considerably lower) value
at which I bought them, plus the relevant indexation?
Although the matter might be debatable, I think your wife would acquire the
shares at your base cost (plus indexation) up to the date of your disposal
to her. If you want her to own the shares with a base cost equal to their
market value, then she will have to acquire them in her own right. (Barry
Stillerman).

FT  20 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Who pays the bill?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have received from my solicitor the draft of a trust deed setting up an
interest-in-possession trust. My son and daughter are the immediate sole
beneficiaries for their lifetimes, sharing the income but leaving the
capital (including capital gains) intact. They are to be followed by my two
grand-daughters, on the same terms.
In the matter of inheritance tax, my solicitor now tells me that 'a person
who has the right to income arising from a trust fund (or the right to the
use of it, if it consists of, say, property or chattels) is treated as
owning the trust fund, and it is taxed on his or her death as if it were
part of his or her overall estate.' Is this correct? And, if so, who pays
the tax?
My solicitor now suggests that I should consider switching (with a very big
increase in his fee) to a discretionary trust, but I do not wish to do this
unless there are really good reasons.
Your solicitor is correct in that, if your children have an equal life
interest in the trust fund, then 50 per cent of the value of that trust fund
will be held in their respective estates.
If you survive for seven years from having made the gift to the trust, then
there will be no inheritance tax on your death. On the death of each
respective child, their respective estates will bear the inheritance tax on
the underlying value of the fund at that time.
Your children have the ability to relinquish their life interest so that the
assets pass down a generation at some future time.
I am not sure a transfer of the trust fund into a discretionary settlement
would be appropriate, but I would need to know much more about the situation
to advise further. (Answer by Barry Stillerman, of accountant Stoy Hayward).

FT  20 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Taxing US dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Am I correct in making the following assumptions?
1. That stock dividends in foreign companies - in this case, US companies -
are, in effect, the equivalent to bonus scrip issues in the UK.
2. That when a US quoted company does a share split - through issuing, say,
a one for one stock dividend - there is no liability to UK income tax.
3. That that there is no liability to US tax for the US stock dividends.
The answer to your questions is yes. The term stock dividend (or scrip
dividend) is used in the UK to mean an issue of bonus shares as an
alternative to a cash dividend, generally speaking. The usage in the US is
different.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Safe custody of documents
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Because of the charges which her bank intends to make for the safe custody
of her share certificates, an elderly widow is keeping them in her house. In
the event of a fire or burglary, she would have to pay to get them replaced.
Is there any other risk?
Apart from the cost of replacing ordinary share certificates, there is
simply the matter of the trouble and confusion that may be caused by their
loss or destruction. If any of the certificates are 'bearer' certificates,
then they are of value in their own right and should be protected as much as
cash.
We suggest that everyone makes a will. Very often, the solicitor that draws
it up is happy to keep the original in the office safe at no charge. Such
firms may well be prepared to offer safe custody of share certificates, too.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Recently, I sold my allocated holding of Eurotunnel rights issue. As the
proceeds are not subject to capital gains, will they now form part of my
general income for taxation?
A sale of rights IS subject to capital gains tax, so your question is based
upon a misunderstanding. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets CGT13
(The indexation allowance for quoted shares) and CGT14 (Capital gains tax:
an introduction). Although both are out of date, they should help you to
grasp the basic principles.
Selling rights may produce an allowable loss (with transitional indexation
relief), or a chargeable gain (after indexation relief), or a zero result
(with a reduction in the CGT base cost of the original shares). It all
depends upon the background facts and figures and (in some cases) the
taxpayer's choice.

On May 18, I used a Woolwich cash card at an Abbey Link cash machine in
Milton Keynes. I requested Pounds 30 but received only Pounds 10. However,
Pounds 30 was debited from my account. I notified both the Abbey National
and Woolwich. On June 17, I received a letter from the Woolwich to say that,
as no fault had been found with the machine, I would not get a refund.
We suggest you contact the Banking Ombudsman at 70 Gray's Inn Road, London
WC1 8NB (tel: 071-404 9944) as a first step. Abbey National is now a bank
and not a building society. The Building Society Ombudsman, covering the

FT  20 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: The electricity shares that never arrived
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having applied for shares in the 1993 Northern Ireland electricity share
offer, I was sent the wrong form. As a result, I was allocated none. I have
approached NatWest Registrars, the Belfast Department of Economic
Development and, most recently, the Securities and Futures Authority. The
SFA told me:
1. The activities of registrars 'are not defined as investment business'
under the Financial Services Act and 'regrettably (they) cannot investigate
this matter nor give an opinion on it.'
2. 'The conduct of registrars is the responsibility of the firm that
employed them.'
3. That my dispute lies with the department that employed NatWest. But I
have already contacted it, to no avail.
Can you suggest, nearly one year later, how I might realistically obtain
satisfaction without protracted expensive independent legal action?
NatWest Registrars was employed by Northern Ireland Electricity plc to
administer its share offer. We think you should complain to the NIE if you
feel its agents have given you what obviously sounds like a raw deal. Its
address is: Company Secretary's Department, NIE plc, PO Box 2, Danesfort,
121 Malone Road, Belfast BT9 5HT. Tel: 0232-661 100. (Murray Johnstone

You should try first to sort it out with the trustees or managers of your
pension scheme, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. If they cannot resolve it,
then write to the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (Opas), which is
free. The pensions ombudsman will not investigate your case until Opas has
screened it first but the two bodies do share the same offices.
Opas has published two free leaflets designed to answer questions asked most
often about occupational schemes.
Where is My Pension? looks at problems faced by people who have moved jobs
and have lost track of any pension entitlement they might have.
Winding Up a Pension Scheme covers some of the most common problems raised
by members when their scheme is in the process of being wound up.
Complaints about personal pensions are not handled by the pensions ombudsman
but by the insurance ombudsman. But the new Personal Investment Authority,
the self-regulating body which has replaced Fimbra and Lautro, has set up an
ombudsman's scheme as well.
Its remit is somewhat unclear but it should handle some areas of private
pensions, particularly marketing and sales.
The Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the chief regulator for the
financial services industry, can direct investors to the correct ombudsman
and outline the complaints procedure of each.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Causes for complaint - Scheherazade
Daneshkhu looks at the pension ombudsman's report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pension transfers headed the list of complaints made to pensions ombudsman
Michael Platt last year, according to his annual report* this week - the
third since the office was set up in 1991.
Platt said transfer values and the time taken to make transfers had been
continuing problems over the years. Another recurring complaint related to
the size of pensions. Some people found the amount was less than they had
been led to believe, or that it was paid late. In some cases, they did not
get a pension at all.
In one case, two men accepted redundancy and early retirement on the basis
of estimates provided by their employer. But their lump sum payments were 20
per cent less than expected because the basis on which they had been
calculated was wrong.
The men said they would have continued to work had they known the correct
figures - and their complaint was upheld by Platt, who directed the employer
to make good the difference.
He said most disputes were the result of 'inadvertence, inefficiency,
oversight or failure of communication' rather than intentional malpractice
or fraud. And he pointed out that the number of complaints received last
year - 2,179 - had to be seen in the context of the 20m people with rights
to an occupational scheme.
He was, however, concerned at the conflict of interest that could arise for
some pension trustees, especially those administering small schemes. Indeed,
the largest award he had made - of Pounds 190,000 - went to the victim of
such a conflict.
In this case, a man complained that his pension had not been paid since he
retired. But the company of which he had been a director, and which was sole
trustee, said he owed it money.
Although the scheme rules allowed the company to recover debts from
benefits, it needed a court order or arbitrator's award. Since it had not
attempted to obtain either, the ombudsman decided that, by refusing to pay
the man his benefits, 'it had placed its corporate interests first'.
Platt said: 'Trustees are often appointed from the management of the
sponsoring company, or the company itself may act as trustee . . . (the)
possibility of conflict of interest is greater in small companies where
management may have a proprietorial interest.'
He also noted an increase in complaints about delays in winding up schemes
and stressed that, when schemes were wound up with too few assets to pay
benefits, 'I cannot conjure funds out of nowhere'.
Although Platt welcomed the government's proposed compensation plan, he
believed that limiting it to losses caused by fraud, theft or
misappropriation of assets, meant that 'members of some schemes may still be
at risk of losing some or all of their entitlement, with no means of
effective redress'.
In all, the ombudsman ordered Pounds 907,000 to be paid to wronged pension
scheme members. This amount went to the 44 people whose cases he upheld
wholly or in part.
What is striking about the ombudsman scheme is the high percentage (90 per
cent) of complaints investigated which are upheld. On the other hand, only a
tiny proportion of cases are taken up - last year, only 49 out of 2,179
complaints received.
Almost a third of all complaints was referred to the Occupational Advisory
Pension Service, since they had not gone there first as procedure dictates.
In another third, the ombudsman decided an investigation was inappropriate,
mainly because there was no evidence of maladministration or injustice.
A further quarter of complaints were outside the pension ombudsman's
jurisdiction. Half of these belonged to a different complaints body and were
forwarded to it.
Some of the rest fell outside the time limit. This is three years from the
date of the events which led to the complaint, or three years from the date
the complainant first became aware of those events.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: A name that spans the world - The
Professionals / Joanna Slaughter on investment managers. Today / Rothschild
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The story of the five sons of Mayer Amschel Rothschild has become merchant
banking's answer to the tale of Dick Whittington. Nearly 200 years ago, the
entrepreneurial siblings established businesses in the principal cities of
Europe. Today, it is little exaggeration to say that nearly everyone has
heard the name Rothschild.
Peter Sullivan, managing director of Rothschild Asset Management, the
group's London-based investment management arm, agrees that instant name
recognition is a significant advantage when selling his firm to private
clients. But Sullivan describes Rothschild as 'still a family business. It
is run by members of the family, who are in here every day. We are managing
portfolios for the Rothschilds, and that teaches you the way the family
wants its money to be run'.
Sullivan says private clients have their money managed in exactly the same
way. Thus, it can be assumed that the Rothschilds favour a conservative,
low-risk and highly-controlled investment policy with an emphasis on broad
diversification. Theirs is not a bank that takes huge risks.
Marketing director Peter Rees adds: 'The style flows so much from the
organisation and its history. It has all the qualities that are associated
with the Rothschild name. It is the traditional approach to running private
client money. The approach does not include advisory investment management.
All RAM private clients have their portfolios managed on a discretionary
basis.'
Sullivan has another point. 'Mistakenly, people believe that you need an
enormous amount of money to come to Rothschild. But Pounds 50,000 will
secure an investor all our skills.' This sum provides a gateway to
Rothschild's managed fund service. Those who want a portfolio of direct
equity holdings need at least Pounds 500,000 to justify the Pounds 5,000
minimum annual management fee.
One of the most rigorous disciplines at RAM is strict adherence to a series
of benchmarks and parameters. A benchmark is agreed with each client, on the
basis of his investment objectives and risk tolerance, and there are six
onshore and six offshore model portfolios, with investment criteria ranging
from fixed interest through to 'optimal growth.'
The present model growth portfolio for a UK private client has 65 per cent
in UK equities; 7 per cent in North America; 12 per cent in Japan; 4.5 per
cent in Europe; 4 per cent in the Far East, excluding Japan; 4 per cent in
emerging markets, and 3.5 per cent in cash.
Sullivan says: 'What is paramount in people's minds is the risk they are
taking. Quite often, the client will start with a low risk tolerance but,
over time, they may move to another benchmark and model. Clients probably
will always look back towards some cash benchmark, but to have a portfolio
100 per cent invested in cash is just as high risk as to have a portfolio
invested in equities.'
Asset allocation is set by a team of senior specialists from each major
investment sector, and implementation is controlled tightly. Sullivan
explains: 'The fund manager doesn't have much autonomy and scope on asset
allocation. Managers would be questioned if they strayed because senior
personnel are constantly looking at the overall balance of the portfolios.'
The portfolio managers also have restricted elbow room when it comes to
stock-picking. The firm runs 30 core stocks in the major markets and these
are represented in all private client portfolios. There is also a list of
130 to 140 UK stocks, from which the portfolio manager is free to choose.
The same process occurs in the other major markets.
This approved list is reviewed each week and, when stocks are removed from
it, they also come out of clients' portfolios. Similarly, a manager cannot
buy shares in a company if it is not on the list.
RAM looks to the work of the major research houses as far as the core stocks
are concerned, but conducts its own research into middle line and smaller
stocks. 'We think this is where we can add value,' Sullivan says.
The portfolio managers will look at derivatives and hedging mechanisms where
appropriate, but these always are used to reduce risk. Portfolios may, for
instance, be hedged back into the client's base currency and, late in the
1980s, RAM was one of the first major investment houses to institute a
derivatives policy that, effectively, protected its clients in Japan on the
downside while giving them 130 per cent of the index on the upside.
Collective funds are used for investment in overseas and smaller companies,
but the selection is not confined to the house unit trusts. 'We look very
carefully at a whole universe of funds,' says Sullivan. None is considered
unless it has been in the top quartile of its sector for three years.
Recognition that investment services must find more efficient ways to run
private client money has prompted a quiet revolution within Rothschild over
the past three or four years, according to Sullivan. It has raised its
profile significantly, and 65 to 70 per cent of new private client business
now comes from solicitors, accountants and other intermediaries.
There is a director responsible for every client, while portfolios are run
by a fund manager and an administrator. 'We have a very skilled team of
managers,' says Sullivan. 'We don't use private clients as a training ground
for graduates.'
Somewhat surprisingly, given the bank's long history, comparatively few
clients represent 'old money'. Typically, they have acquired assets after
building up a successful business. Rees suggests that the Rothschild name
provides them with 'that little extra bit of security', and adds: 'Our
strength is that we will do nothing to damage that name.'

FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Now it's Catch-22 at C&amp;G
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not quite Catch-22, but the arrangements for members of Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester building society after the Pounds 1.8bn Lloyds Bank cash takeover
offer have brought to light a new ver-sion.
Catch-22 was that if an airman was crazy, he could be grounded: all he had
to do was ask. But as soon as he did, he was deemed not to be crazy  - and
had to continue flying.
Catch-C&amp;G is that the investors who do not benefit under the revised cash
payments scheme - and who are, of course, most likely to want to challenge
the plans - are those who became members after the end of 1992.
But only those who have been members for two years can call for a special
meeting to force C&amp;G to discuss its proposals - ahead of the special meeting
the board plans to call next year, anyway, to vote on the bid.
C&amp;G is not alone among the larger societies in having rules saying that a
special meeting can be called only after a resolution from 100 members of at
least two years' standing with at least Pounds 100 in their accounts.
Woolwich, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Leeds Permanent all have similar
provisions.
The position is only slightly easier in the two largest societies. At
Halifax, it takes 200 members of 56 days' standing with Pounds 100 in their
accounts to call a special meeting - but there is a two-year qualifying
period and a minimum of 100 members for any special resolution to be
discussed.
At Nationwide, 100 investors who became members at the end of the previous
financial year and have at least Pounds 100 can call for a special meeting.
But the board does not have to agree to one unless there is a qualifying
resolution where, again, the two-year threshold applies.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Insurers change tack - Not so long
ago, premiums were soaring. Now, they are starting to fall as companies
chase business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Storm damage, subsidence and theft claims late in the 1980s led to big
increases in home insurance premiums. But companies are now again seeking
customers actively, according to Tom Walton, manager of Towry Law Insurance
Broker Services. And the hunt for new business is proving good news for
consumers.
Walton says: 'Rates are down, particularly for buildings insurance, but
contents rates are beginning to soften as well. A number of new insurers are
coming into the market and prices should gradually reduce for the next 12
months.'
Some of the keenest competition comes from the telephone-based direct
insurance companies. They are eager to exploit the public's appetite for
cheaper insurance and its distaste for the selling methods of some building
societies, which 'tie' mortgage and insurance in one non-negotiable package.
Direct Line, the insurance subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, has dubbed
this particular practice 'a billion pound burglary'. Direct Line's research
suggests that nearly 13m UK householders pay an average 20 per cent more
than they need for their household insurance and the company claims that, on
average, its premiums are 20 per cent lower than those for policies arranged
by building societies.
There are, however, many variables attached to insuring your home and
belongings, and the cheapest premium does not always represent the best
policy. Recently, the Household Mortgage Corporation compared the block
buildings and insurance policy it offers its borrowers with the policy
issued by a leading direct insurer.
It found that the latter excluded a number of risks, including accidental
damage, and concluded: 'Despite the advances in marketing and use of
technology by the new insurers, block policies which use the lender's
negotiating power to maximise the cover available to customers can still
provide better value.'
Insurance companies no longer sell buildings insurance at a flat premium.
Instead, they rate the cost according to postcodes to reflect the insurer's
experience of subsidence, heave, flood and theft. But there is no unanimity
among the insurers on rating areas and this can throw up both pricing
anomalies and bargains.
Prospective policyholders also should look at excesses, which can be
triggered by different types of damage or can be applied to all claims. The
risk of subsidence invariably carries an excess, with Pounds 1,000 a common
figure and a hefty Pounds 3,000 not unknown.
Other points to check with buildings insurance are if the policy extends to
garages, greenhouses and garden sheds, and whether alternative accommodation
is provided in case of disaster. The property itself should be insured for
its re-building cost, not its market value or council tax valuation.
With contents insurance, claims are met on one of two bases:
replacement-as-new or indemnity, which is the replacement cost, less wear,
tear and depreciation. Most policies require buyers to insure their
possessions for their full value, but some base premiums on the number of
bedrooms and provide a maximum sum insured. This strategy makes for
simplicity but also means that people run the risk of being under-insured.
Segmentation is a buzz word in the contents insurance market. There are
policies designed for the young, the 'grey' market of the over-50s, and for
high net worth individuals who are credited with taking greater care of
their possessions than the rest of us.
The National &amp; Provincial building society has just launched three insurance
policies designed respectively for first-time buyers, families, and for the
mature whose children have left home. Premiums on the first-time buyer
option are around 30 per cent cheaper than for the others. At the same time,
the society is keeping its existing comprehensive policy on sale.
A spokesman explains: 'We are retaining our existing Homepack policy, which
is a bit expensive but is a cover-all, sleep-easy option. Our new policies
are more keenly priced and segmented.'
Certainly, market segmentation has led to cheaper premiums for older
customers. Norwich Union cut household insurance premiums for 'mature'
customers by as much as 30 per cent in some cases earlier this month, while
Provincial Insurance's HomeCover 50 Plus buildings and contents policy
offers both a mature householder discount and a no-claims discount.
Most insurers also give discounts for good quality security and alarms,
regardless of the age of the policyholder, and some reward members of
Neighbourhood Watch schemes.
While the extent and relevance of the cover is crucial when choosing
household insurance, price is the bottom line for most people and Walton
says: 'There can be a difference of 50 per cent between the most, and least,
competitive policies on the market.'
Consumers should get a quotation from both an insurance broker and a direct
insurer. Look at the actual cover provided by the most competitively-priced
policies and ask some questions about service, particularly the length of
time taken to settle claims.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: When cover can be at a premium -
Those seen as higher risk can lose out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While household insurance premiums may be falling generally after the huge
rises of the past few years, the picture is not equally rosy for everyone.
Insurers are battling for a share of the profitable, low-risk end of the
market, but this can leave anyone seen as higher risk out in the cold. Those
who do not fit into the insurers' favoured market segments, or who have made
claims recently, may find personal evidence for falling premiums hard to
come by.
The bad news, if you are one of the thousands of home-owners to have made
subsidence claims in recent years, is that you probably are stuck with the
same insurer for the foreseeable future. Only in exceptional circumstances
would most insurers take on properties with a previous subsidence problem.
If, say, your house is less than 10 years old, has been under-pinned fully
and is in an area not generally prone to subsidence, some insurers would
consider it. But if it is pre-war and built on clay soil, the chances of
being accepted by a new insurer appear to be practically zero.
The only way out is to move. Fortunately, if you do want to sell up, most
insurers will continue to insure a property already on their books which has
a history of subsidence claims, even if it changes hands.
One or two recent claims for theft or accidental damage may also make it
extremely hard to change insurers at present The message from Norwich Union,
for instance, is that if you have had a theft claim for more than Pounds
1,000 in the past year, you should forget about switching insurers for the
time being.
Likewise, if you have had three buildings or contents claims of any size
within the past three years, the Norwich is unlikely to take you on,
although it will look at the background: claims for one-off storm damage
will be treated more sympathetically than a series of accidental damage or
loss claims.
Evidence of improved security can sometimes help if your record is tainted
with recent burglary claims. In some places, better security is compulsory -
many insurers now refuse to cover inner city properties unless they meet
minimum security standards, usually involving five-lever mortice deadlocks
on the front door and locks on ground floor windows or french doors.
Red-lining, cherry-picking, or a frequent unwillingness to quote for certain
types of business are tendencies to which insurance companies are loath to
admit. But the anecdotal evidence is that direct insurers are more likely to
decline to quote than traditional insurers. Callers are occasionally told,
quite bluntly, that their postcode is uninsurable.
Yet, since postcode-based rating is based largely on insurers' own claims
records, the same postcode might trigger a different response elsewhere.
Direct insurers tend to have much tighter underwriting criteria, partly
because the staff providing quotes over the phone are not themselves
underwriters and must stick to fairly rigid guidelines.
Where other insurers might look closely at the circumstances, and raise
premiums to take account of increased risk, the direct companies sometimes
seem to prefer to turn business away.
So, if yours is a 'problem case' and you have been finding the direct
insurers less than welcoming, it could pay you to turn back to the brokers,
who can scour the more obscure corners of the market for amenable insurers.
As most brokers deal only with a limited number of insurers, talking to more
than one could improve your chances of finding a good deal. Mortgage lenders
may also be prepared to help if you are having trouble with buildings
insurance, where they have a vested interest.
The last-ditch option, if you are having difficulty finding insurance at a
reasonable price, is to accept a lower level of cover.
This could involve indemnity-only cover, which means that pay-outs for
stolen or damaged possessions are reduced for wear and tear rather than the
new-for-old replacement which is standard with most policies.
In extreme cases, insurance might be available - or affordable - only if you
cut out cover for theft altogether and limit the insurance to fire, flood
and other catastrophes.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Let the children decide - Diary of a
Private Investor / Kevin Goldstein-Jackson explains why his daughters have a
summer task
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Summer holiday time and the children are getting restless. My eldest
daughter, aged 12, has suddenly become very fashion-conscious and is urging
yet another visit to the local Etam shop where she and her friends love the
Tammy Girl clothes.
No wonder Etam's 1994 annual report says the company 'has one of the faster
stock turns in the retail trade' and listed pre-tax profit up 28 per cent on
the previous year. I wish I had bought shares for my daughter in 1985: she
would have more than doubled her money.
Instead, in 1985, I used money provided by a relative to buy each of my two
daughters a baby bond. These were offered by the Tunbridge Wells Equitable
friendly society and were promoted as a 'tax-free investment for children
aged 0-18'.
Basically, it was a 10-year, unit-linked endowment policy which could be
funded by monthly instalments totalling Pounds 100 a year, or with a lump
sump of Pounds 800. I chose the lump sum method.
The promotional literature claimed the bonds would achieve a minimum
'estimated value' after 10 years of Pounds 2,004 but added that, under
certain circumstances, this could reach Pounds 2,767.
I think it is unlikely that either figure will be achieved. In April this
year, just 18 months before their maturity date, a statement showed the
bonds were worth just Pounds 1,420.59 each.
A society official explained: 'In a contract of this nature, where growth in
unit prices is dependent on investment expertise and the underlying economic
climate, it is impossible to predict the eventual policy value at a
particular time in the future.'
My daughters are now old enough to understand fully the value of money and
the importance of sound investment. They are not very impressed by the baby
bonds.
When these mature, they intend to find a good home for the proceeds. Indeed,
they believe they can do better by choosing their own direct investments.
They prefer to buy shares in individual companies rather than investing via
a unit trust. This is, partly, because they remember the pleasure (and
profit) they gained a few years ago when they owned shares in the Walt
Disney company of the US. They appreciate visiting and using the products
and services of the companies in which they have invested.
Since they have travelled widely, they also understand the vagaries of
fluctuating currencies. That is why the profits from their investment in
Disney were put into a bank account - in Swiss francs.
It is no longer sufficient for banks to offer money boxes, comics and other
freebies. What concerns my children most is how much interest they will get.
My youngest daughter has an account with the National Westminster bank but
only a small amount remains on deposit there.
Most of the rest has been transferred to a Young Sovereign account with the
Skipton building society. This earns 6.5 per cent gross a year and, if she
does not withdraw anything until December 1, she will get an additional 2
per cent gross.
A Young Sovereign account can be opened with a minimum initial deposit of
Pounds 25. Since many banks and societies pay interest of only 1 or 2 per
cent to many of their young savers, Young Sovereign has big attractions to
children who are serious about investment.
As my daughters do not pay tax, they have registered with the Inland Revenue
(on Form R85) provided by the building society to receive their interest
without having any tax deducted.
It is important also to remember that, subject to certain conditions,
children have the same income and capital gains tax allowances as adults.
The Inland Revenue leaflet IR110, A Guide for People with Savings, is
available from tax offices and includes a section that covers children's
accounts.
Young people are naturally inquisitive. I have, therefore, set my daughters
the holiday task of asking their young friends to name their favourite
products and predict the next trend or craze.
Perhaps the results will lead to a company in which my daughters can make a
profitable investment. It might even be Etam.

FT  20 AUG 94 / The Week Ahead: Thorn is aiming to make sweet music
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Analysts on Tuesday will be examining with interest the results from Thorn
EMI. This will be the first time the music and rental group has reported on
a first quarter.
Music accounts for nearly two-thirds of Thorn's profits, and operating
figures of between Pounds 45m and Pounds 55m are being forecast for the
division out of total overall profits of between Pounds 67m and Pounds 77m.
A goodwill write-down on the sale of some non-core assets should bring in
pre-tax profits around the Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m mark. Thorn's rental
business, which includes Rumbelows in the UK and Rent-A-Centre in the US,
should chip in with operating profits of around Pounds 25m.
Interim pre-tax profits at Kerry, the Irish meat, dairy and food ingredients
group, are expected to be up about 10 per cent to IPounds 15m when its six
months' results to June 30 are announced on Wednesday. Lower margins in the
dairy and red meat divisions are expected to be more than offset by
continuing strong growth in the group's expanding food ingredients and food
divisions, according to Dublin analysts.
The continuing rationalisation and re-structuring of Wace, the pre-press and
specialist printing group, is expected to pay off on Tuesday with first-half
profits ahead 42 per cent to Pounds 10m (Pounds 7m). Its re-focused UK
operations are also likely to make a healthy contribution, although demand
remains patchy in the US and flat in continental Europe.
Marley, the building materials group, is expected on Wednesday to report a
sharp increase in first-half profits following exceptional gains from the
sale of its French roof tile subsidiary and increased volumes in the UK
market. Pre-tax profits could reach Pounds 26m (Pounds 13.2m), with the
disposal of Alsace-based Bisch contributing about Pounds 8m to the total.
Slough Estates, the UK's largest industrial property group, is expected on
Wednesday to announce interims of around Pounds 31m for the first half of
1994, up from Pounds 28.8m. The group has made no meaningful asset disposals
during the period, and the performance for the year is likely to reflect
improving occupancy levels and the phasing-out of incentives for rental
agreement.
The Telegraph, reporting on Wednesday, is expected to make first-half
profits of about Pounds 34m-Pounds 35m, up from last time's Pounds 28m. The
continuing price war with The Times (and, latterly, the Independent),
affected only nine days of the half; thus, it should not have dented the
predictions. After an 18 per cent advertising revenue growth in the first
quarter, the second saw some slippage although 1993's second quarter had
been robust. Analysts are asking if future advertising growth will balance
the inevitable circulation revenue shortfall.
Guardian Royal Exchange, the smallest of the composite insurance companies,
is expected to post pre-tax profits of between Pounds 120m and Pounds 140m
when it reports interims on Thursday. The company revealed profits of Pounds
65m at the same stage last year. Like its competitors - three of which
reported better than expected first-half profits earlier this month - GRE
should benefit from the buoyancy of trading conditions in the UK where
premium rates increases, more selective underwriting and milder weather are
allowing underwriting profits.
Problems at a number of its US offices will depress profits at Willis
Corroon, the insurance broker, when it reports interims on Thursday. Pre-tax
profits are expected to fall to between Pounds 50m and Pounds 55m, compared
with Pounds 63.1m last year. The group, formed by the merger of Willis Faber
and Corroon &amp; Black in 1990, also has been hit in the US by the defection of
a large team of construction insurance specialists to a rival company.
A maiden contribution from Securiguard will ensure that Rentokil remains on
a strong growth track when it announces interim results on Thursday.
Analysts expect pre-tax profits to exceed Pounds 83m for the six months to
June, representing a 24 per cent increase. Securiguard should contribute
close to Pounds 7m of the additional earnings, but Rentokil's core
businesses should continue to show rapid growth.
Weir Group announces its interims on Thursday, with Panmure Gordon
forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.6m, up from Pounds 16.7m a year ago
(which included a Pounds 2.43m exceptional item for redundancy and
reorganisation costs). This would put the Glasgow-based pumps and
engineering products group on course to fulfil City estimates of Pounds
40m-Pounds 43m for the full year, compared with Pounds 37.5m in 1993.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Filofax have been remarkably consistent in buying stock and chief executive
Robin Field is the most recent, acquiring 13,500 shares at 203p. This
concentrated level of purchasing started at the beginning of May 1992 when
the shares were 31p.
Timothy Barker, the vice-chairman of Kleinwort Benson, has sold 13,000
shares at 520p following the company's announcement of interim results on
August 8. He still holds more than 19,000.
Dealings by board members at Forward Technology, the audio and video
cassette company, give a mixed impression. Early in the week, Paul Jeffries,
one of the executive directors, bought 60,000 shares at 60p, increasing his
holding by more than 10 per cent. Just two days later, the company announced
that Gordon Allen, the non-executive president, had sold 750,000 at 23p,
even though they were trading around the 49p mark.
The reason was that 500,000 shares were bought from him because of a call
option, while the others were sold at a discount.
Sanderson Electronics, a company in the support services sector, supplies
computer software and hardware. Chairman Paul Thompson has sold 3m shares,
worth more than Pounds 2.5m - the largest transaction of the week. But he
still holds more than 27 per cent of the company.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Credit warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People holding credit cards could lose out under the reforms of consumer
credit proposed by the Office of Fair Trading, the Consumers' Association
warned in a report published this week. It attacked the new limits
recommended by the OFT within which card issuers should be liable for goods
or services misrepresented or not delivered.
The removal of credit providers' 'joint and several liability' was
recommended by the deregulation task force set up by the Department of Trade
and Industry. In June, the OFT concluded that the protection should remain,
but within slightly narrower limits. It said the minimum transaction for
which it applied should be raised from Pounds 100 to Pounds 150, while the
upper limit should be set at Pounds 25,000 rather than Pounds 30,000.
Jean Eaglesham, of the CA, said it was 'iniquitous to raise the lower limit
while lowering the upper', particularly as the average credit card purchase
was just Pounds 40. But the OFT said the rise in the lower limit, the first
since 1985, would be in line with keeping the liability to relatively
high-priced goods and services. It did not believe significant transactions
now protected in law would be excluded by the fall in the maximum.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Careful planning can keep your
estate safe - Scheherazade Daneshkhu explains how to hold the Revenue at bay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many people will not leave enough when they die to fall within the scope of
inheritance tax. But plenty of others will - and, for them, it is worth
thinking about IHT planning while they are alive. Otherwise, the Inland
Revenue, rather than their heirs, could get most of their estates.
There are a number of misconceptions about IHT, however. The 10 most common
are:
1. Special relief is available for private property. Wrong. Some people
confuse some of the capital gains tax provisions with those of IHT. Your
principal residence is exempt from CGT - but it falls within your estate for
IHT purposes.
2. IHT applies only to the rich. Wrong. The first Pounds 150,000 of an
estate is tax-free, but anything above this is taxed at 40 per cent. Given
the rise in house prices over the past decade or so, a lot of people,
particularly in the south-east, will find that their main residence alone is
worth much more than Pounds 150,000.
Solution: Make use of your nil rate band (see 3 below) and of all your other
exemptions to whatever extent is practicable. These include:
An annual Pounds 3,000 gift to an individual. This can also be carried
forward for a year, which allows you to give away Pounds 6,000 if you have
not used up last year's exemption.
A limitless number of 'small gifts' per tax year, each of a maximum of
Pounds 250 to any individual.
Wedding gifts of Pounds 5,000 from each parent (Pounds 2,500 from each
grandparent and Pounds 1,000 from anyone else).
Gifts to charity and to a qualifying political party plus works of art (so
long as the public gets access to them).
If you give away enough, your estate might elude IHT. But 'potentially
exempt transfers' (see 5) escape the tax only if you remain alive for seven
years after giving the assets away. And the danger with giving away too much
is that you might not leave yourself enough to live on. One way round this
is to make use of trusts (see 6).
3. I have made a will so I don't have to worry about IHT. Wrong. A will
simply ensures that your assets are distributed in accordance with your
wishes. It does not save tax unless it has been worded to take account of
IHT.
Solution: Ask your solicitor for guidance about IHT. You will want to ensure
that your nil rate band - at present, the Pounds 150,000 you can leave
without IHT being payable - is used up. (See 4 and 6).
4. I can leave everything to my spouse. This might seem an ideal solution,
since transfers between spouses are exempt from IHT. But what if you and
your spouse die at the same time?
Even if you are survived by your spouse, the problem is only postponed - and
probably worsened since, by the time they die, the assets are likely to have
appreciated further. And leaving all your assets to your spouse also wastes
your nil rate band.
Solution: Barry Stillerman, of accountant Stoy Hayward, suggests drafting a
will leaving assets worth the nil rate band to (for example) children. This
bequest would then be free of IHT and would reduce the value of assets left
to your spouse. (But see 6).
5. I can give assets away but still enjoy their benefit. No. If you make a
gift but still continue to benefit from it (such as giving your house to the
children but continuing to live in it, or taking income from investments
handed over to them), it will be treated as yours.
Solution: You can retain a benefit, such as continuing to live in the
property given to your children but paying rent at the market price. But
Steve Midwinter, of accountant Touche Ross, points out: 'The rent could be
kept to a minimum by accepting, as tenant, obligations to keep the home in
good repair.'
Caroline Garnham, of solicitor Simmons &amp; Simmons, says a partner could leave
capital to his spouse in trust for her life.
At a later date, the trustees could apportion part or all of the capital to
the children but without excluding the spouse from future benefit. But
Garnham warns: 'This type of planning must not be done without good
professional advice.'
If you want to make a genuine gift, be sure it is documented and dated so it
will count as a 'potentially exempt transfer.'
6. I do not trust my family so I cannot plan for IHT. Many people may find
that tax-efficiency and practicality do not accord. If you make gifts to
your spouse or children in the belief that everything is being kept in the
family, there is the awful possibility that the spouse might walk out or the
children turn against you.
So, while it might be a good idea for IHT purposes to change the ownership
of the house in which you live from 'joint tenants', where the survivor owns
the house, to 'tenants-in-common', where each owns half the house and leaves
the other half to the children, there is a danger that they could force a
sale on the surviving parent.
Solution: Use a trust, but take independent professional advice about it.
John Battersby, of accountant KPMG Peat, recommends an accumulation and
maintenance trust for young children or grand-children. This allows assets
to be held in trust for the surviving spouse so they can have the benefit of
income without being able to stop the capital from passing to the children
or other intended beneficiaries.
Stillerman also suggests drafting the will so that the estate is left in
trust. This would leave assets within the family should, for example, a
widowed spouse remarry.
7. If I give assets away and live for seven years, I will escape tax. You
might escape IHT - but what about CGT? Depending on their value, you might
incur a large CGT bill by transferring assets, whereas there is no CGT at
death.
Solution: CGT holdover relief was all but abolished in 1989, but it remains
available when a chargeable transfer (as opposed to a potentially exempt
transfer) is made for IHT purposes.
Clive Scott-Hopkins, of independent financial adviser Towry Law, says the
only chargeable transfer of any significance is into a discretionary trust -
a flexible type of trust in which the trustees have discretion regarding
those to whom payment of income and capital can be made.
Thus, he suggests creating a discretionary trust under which, as long as
assets within the nil rate band of Pounds 150,000 are transferred, there
will be no IHT to pay and CGT will be deferred until the assets are sold.
After seven years, the nil rate band comes back into use again.
8. Only UK residents pay IHT. Wrong. If you are UK domiciled, you will be
liable to IHT on your global assets even if you are no longer resident in
the UK (unless there is an over-riding double taxation treaty). It is also
possible for someone who is neither UK resident nor UK domiciled to be
liable to IHT if they own assets directly in the UK.
Solution: Garnham says a non-UK domiciled person can avoid IHT on UK assets
by holding them through a foreign company. But she warns that care is needed
to ensure that, by avoiding one tax, another is not incurred.
9. IHT is payable only on death. Not necessarily, as should be clear from 7.
Transfers into a discretionary trust are, technically, liable to IHT; but
the rate at which they are taxed is 0 per cent on the amount within the nil
rate band. Any excess above that will be taxed immediately at 20 per cent
(instead of 40 per cent, as is usually the case under IHT) on the excess as
long as you survive for seven years.
If you die any earlier, tax is payable at 40 per cent, although 'tapering
relief' reduces the tax charge by 20 per cent each year after three years,
according to Scott-Hopkins.
Solution: Make sure you choose the most suitable trust for your purposes and
that it is structured in such a way as to escape as much tax as possible.
Professional advice is needed here.
10. I have read everything I need to know about IHT. Unfortunately not.
There is a lot more detail which cannot be covered in an article of this
length. For one thing, Midwinter points out that many people miss out on 100
per cent business property relief because holdings within a family company
are not structured to take advantage of it.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Markets: Fed tickles stock market behind the ears - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy on Tuesday by raising
two key interest rates, the financial markets rallied strongly. Bonds shot
higher, and stocks soon followed, buoyed by optimism about the outlook for
inflation. Wednesday was a day of consolidation, with share and bond prices
mostly holding their own as investors digested the implications of the Fed's
move. The implications, it was generally agreed, were positive.
By Thursday, however, the mood had changed abruptly. The spectre of
inflation reappeared, sending bonds into a nosedive. By the end of the day
they had lost most of the ground gained two days before, and the stock
market, following the bond market like a slobbering puppy on a leash,
recorded similar losses. The developments illustrated how vulnerable the
markets are, and how uneasy investors feel about the future.
On the surface, the culprit behind this week's turnaround in sentiment was
the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's report showing worrying rises in
manufacturing prices throughout its region. The news set the inflation alarm
bells ringing in the bond market, and forced traders and investors to
reevaluate their judgment - made on Tuesday - that the five interest rate
increases engineered by the Fed this year would be enough to keep inflation
low for the foreseeable future.
It seemed a rational judgment at the time. As expected, the Fed had
tightened policy after its open market committee met on Tuesday morning.
What was slightly unexpected was the vigorous nature of the move: an
increase in the federal funds rate (the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans) from 4.25 per cent to 4.75 per cent, and an
increase in the more important discount rate (the interest rate the Fed
charges on loans to banks and other depositary institutions) from 3.5 per
cent to 4 per cent.
The markets had been looking for a 25-basis point increase in the two rates,
but instead of reacting gloomily to the move, investors rushed to buy bonds
in the belief that the Fed's action proved its determination to snuff out
inflationary pressures in the economy. The hope on Tuesday was that the rate
rises would be the last for some time, and that they would lay the
foundation for a sustainable rebound in bond prices.
The stock market felt in much the same way, at least at first - the Dow
jumped 24 points after the Fed's tightening as equity investors looked
forward to a relatively prolonged period of interest rate stability. After
all, the problem that had been troubling stocks throughout the spring and
summer was uncertainty about the immediate outlook for monetary policy. The
Fed's decisive action appeared to remove that uncertainty.
Within two days, however, those views had altered, and quite radically. Yet,
while the bond market was worrying primarily about inflation in the wake of
the Philadelphia Fed's data, the stock market was troubled by a more
disturbing thought - that the tightening of monetary policy this year will
not only slow down the economy, but also slow down (and possibly quite
significantly) the rate of corporate earnings growth.
The sharp sell-off in cyclical and car manufacturers' stocks on Thursday was
clear evidence of this concern. Caterpillar and Boeing, and the big three
car stocks of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler all tumbled because these
companies' earnings are tied closely to the ups and downs of the economy.
The selling showed that investors were looking ahead and seeing nothing but
clouds on the horizon. As Richard Cripps, an analyst at the broking house
Legg Mason, put it: 'Their stocks peak about a year and a half before
earnings do. People now are looking over the mountain.'
If Cripps is right, then the stock market could be in for an unpleasant
period ahead. Amid all the worry about inflation and interest rates, the one
thing that has propped up stock prices in the past few months has been the
robust and sustained growth of corporate earnings. Now, Wall Street fears
that the Fed's aggressive tightening of policy will to remove that prop from
under the market.
And as if this were not enough for the markets to fret about, the troubles
of the dollar returned this week. On Thursday, talk by US and Japanese trade
negotiators knocked the dollar-yen rate down from Y100.21 to Y98.57, a
decline which contributed to the bond market's own slide that day. Stock
market investors seemed to ignore it, but if the US currency's woes do not
end soon, they may not be able to ignore it for long. As a difficult summer
for the markets draws to a close, a difficult autumn looms.

FT  20 AUG 94 / The Markets: Calor finds rumours a gas - Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Calor Group, the bottled gas supplier, has stumbled across an unusual way to
draw in new investors. Wait for a few adverse rumours and, after an initial
fall, the shares might end higher than before.
This was the case early this week when Calor found itself the victim of
Sunday press reports that a vicious price war had broken out in the bottled
gas market.
Esso, it was claimed, was moving in on Calor's patch by selling bottled gas
for less than half price. This would inevitably destroy Calor's margins, and
almost certainly erode its more than 50 per cent market share.
The reports puzzled Calor's executives, who had spent the weekend hosting
their so-called arch rivals at the Gatcombe Park Horse Trials.
The reports also puzzled the financial community, which could not understand
Esso's allegedly aggressive attempts to take share in a mature market firmly
dominated by a single player.
Nevertheless, the immediate reaction was to sell the shares and ask
questions later. It now appears that the 'price war' was little more than
retailers' normal summer discounting of cylinders traditionally used for
winter heating.
There is also a huge price difference between cylinders sold to stockists
and those sold to individual consumers.
Fierce competition has been a fact of life for almost 10 years in the UK
liquid petroleum gas (LPG) market.
Prices have been squeezed by the arrival of aggressive new entrants in the
mid-1980s and by declining demand as central heating replaced mobile heaters
and more homes were connected to the British Gas network.
LPG is also a very local market, with producers, in general, serving
specific regions. Esso, for example, operates largely in the south of
England. This allows national suppliers such as Calor to price according to
local competition.
Calor has met the pricing problem by tackling costs. Over the last two
years, the group estimates it has reduced these by some 20 per cent. Last
year, Calor reported to its shareholders that, in spite of lower prices,
margins and market share had been maintained as a result of the on-going
rationalisation.
To add to that success, industry sources say prices of LPG are beginning to
stabilise at last. This year, says Esso, prices have stayed at well above
the lows of the last two years. For example, the average industry wholesale
price for a 47kg cylinder is about Pounds 17-Pounds 18, compared with the
lows of Pounds 13.
Analysts say Calor is well placed after the ravages of recent years. With a
low-cost base and strong balance sheet, the group is able to focus on
developing other businesses in growing markets. For example, the natural gas
joint venture with Alliance could open substantial opportunities when
British Gas loses its monopoly after 1996.
Calor also has a growing operation supplying bottled gas to the eastern
European markets, and is applying its gas expertise to dispensing beer and
soft drinks.
While these operations are estimated to be breaking even at the moment, they
are expected to start making real returns in the next two to three years.
This, say analysts, is at least how long it would take anyone to affect
seriously Calor's position in the UK bottled gas market.
In the end, the adverse publicity may have done little more than wake
investors up to Calor's strengths, says one analyst.
The most compelling attraction was probably the dividend, which returns a
yield of 6 per cent, against a market average of less than 4 per cent. 'The
story got people to look at the company and decide it was cheap,' the
analyst says.
The revived interest in this closely held stock inevitably led to a jump in
the share price on Tuesday. But, by Friday, Calor had drifted back to below
its pre-rumour price.
Calor is unperturbed. Indeed, it may have learned a useful lesson from the
events of the past week.
'We are even thinking of adopting this as a tactic if ever we need new
investors,' said one employee, jokingly.

FT  20 AUG 94 / The Markets: Inflation falls, analysts seek other worries -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Positive domestic economic news, including an unexpected fall in underlying
UK inflation to its lowest level for 27 years, helped the FTSE-100 climb 43
points on Wednesday and pierce 3,200 briefly on Thursday.
The US Federal Reserve's decision to increase its key discount rate by half
a percentage point to 4 per cent late on Tuesday also helped calm market
anxieties over nascent inflationary pressures across the Atlantic.
Subsequent US economic data was less encouraging and the UK market faltered
after Wall Street opened lower on Thursday, but the FTSE-100 rallied on
Friday to close the week 49.1 points higher at 3,191.4.
The Fed's move, coupled with the decision by the Bundesbank on Thursday to
leave the German interest rates unchanged, will add to the pressure on other
countries to react quickly and decisively should signs of renewed
inflationary pressure emerge.
Market expectations about European interest rates were thrown into turmoil
the previous week by the unforeseen rise in rates by Italy and Sweden. The
absence of a German rate cut has therefore made it increasingly likely that
the interest rate reduction process in continental Europe is at, or very
close to, an end.
'The lack of easing by the German authorities has left the continental
European equity markets vulnerable,' notes Kleinwort Benson. NatWest
Securities agrees that continental European markets have reached: 'a
significant risk point as the primary engine for the continental European
markets shifts from being led by interest rate reductions to being driven by
the prospects for earnings and dividends.'
Market optimists argue that the UK has crossed this Rubicon and should now
be driven by the continued recovery of corporate profits but some analysts
argue that London is locked into the same interest rate bind as Wall Street.
With anxieties about domestic inflation allayed but not yet dismissed, some
argue the best news for equities would be a pre-emptive intererst rate
strike. 'For equities to be able to make significant further ground in the
short term we need to see a decline in long gilt yields,' says Charterhouse
Tilney Securities.
'Ironically the best news for the gilts market would be a rise in base
rates, a move which would provide confirmation that the Treasury intends to
be pro-active in terms of its counter-inflation policy.'
Such a strategy entails its own risks, particularly when weak money supply
and retail sales data continue to indicate the fragility of the UK economic
recovery. As a result, not even the most bearish forecasters are suggesting
that UK base rates are heading back into double figures.
NatWest Securities argues accordingly that retail investors will have to get
used to a much lower return on cash deposits than the 10.5 per cent average
they have enjoyed over the past decade.
One effect of low deposit rates is that unit trust sales have held up in
spite of the weak market since the start of February. NatWest expects net
unit trust trust sales of Pounds 11bn this year with perhaps Pounds 2bn of
this directed towards UK equity income funds.
Since UK equity income trusts are restricted to investment in companies with
a yield at least 10 per cent higher than the FT-SE-A All Share index,
NatWest Securities argues that strong flows into income funds will restrict
the yield divergence between sectors.
Indeed, as the chart shows, as short and long term interest rates fell
through 1993, so the yield spread between different sectors, based on year
two yield forecasts, narrowed.
Then, as gilt yields bounced back towards 9 per cent after February, the
sector yield spread widened as high yielding sectors tended to underperform.
More recently, as gilts found a bottom, the rebound in the equity market has
been led by some of the highest yielding sectors including utilities,
pharmaceuticals and selected financials.
This was the case again last week as the sparsity of results forced a
relatively quiet market to focus on other issues.
On Monday the markets were given a timely reminder of the dangers in
interest rate forecasting as HSBC Holdings, the international banking group
and last of the UK banks to report, revealled that it had largely abandoned
bond trading on its own account after losing Pounds 123m on bond and
interest rate-related trading during a turbulent first half.
The news overshadowed a 24 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds
1.46bn, aided by a sharp fall in bad debt provisions. The interim dividend
was raised by 14 per cent to 8p, but that was insufficient to head-off a
decline in the group's share price which closed 39p lower on the week at
720p.
On Tuesday, Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, reported a 10 per cent
increase in third-quarter pre-tax profits which came in at Pounds 282m,
towards the lower end of analysts's expectations.
The results showed the benefits of the Dollars 3.4bn Quantum Chemical
acquisition last autumn, as the US-based polyethylene and propane group
contributed Pounds 46m to profits on sales of Pounds 344m. Hanson's shares
closed the week 8 3/4 lower at 256 1/2 p.
Hanson also figured in one of the wilder market rumours of week: that GEC
might be a potential target for one of the big conglomerates such as BTR or
Hanson. Most analysts dismissed the rumour asserting that GEC was much more
likely to emerge as a predator than a target.
Meanwhile BICC, the UK cables and construction group, announced a 26 per
cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from a restated Pounds 50m to
Pounds 63m. The group also said it is planning to treble its cable sales in
the fast growing Asia Pacific by the end of the decade. BICC closed the week
18p lower at 400p.

Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's financial markets are expected to show a muted reaction next week
if the country's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) led by
Ernesto Zedillo, wins Sunday's presidential election.
A PRI victory has already been factored into the recent rally in equities.
Since the end of July the IPC index of the 37 most traded stocks has risen
by almost 20 per cent, and the market has recovered all of its local
currency losses due to pre-election nerves earlier in the year. However, it
still remains among the weakest performing Latin American bourses in dollar
terms over the same period.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family Building societies' figures reflect
mixed picture - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Savings inflows into building societies continued their yo-yo pattern last
month, with net receipts of Pounds 286m after net withdrawals of Pounds 104m
in June, according to figures from the Building Societies Association.
Adrian Coles, BSA director-general, said it was not clear that inflows will
continue given the strength of competition in the retail savings market.
Societies' lending figures reflected a mixed picture and Coles said it was
too early to claim a sustained recovery is underway here. New net lending
rose to Pounds 1.16bn in July, a slight increase on June's Pounds 1.15bn but
up by a more significant 14 per cent on July last year. However net new
commitments, which are for loans agreed but not yet made, fell to Pounds
3.22bn down 10 per cent on June's figure.

FT  20 AUG 94 / The Markets: Salaries, yes, but what about service? -
Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The easiest and quickest job offer I ever got was from a company called
something like FARDA Financial Services. The man in charge wore a black and
white dogtooth suit, a chunky gold name bracelet, and rings.
It was not a demanding interview. He did most of the talking, all the while
standing energetically over me, but little of what he conveyed was about the
work itself.
'See that woman over there,' he said, as a figure brushed past. 'She's been
with us just four months and she owns a Porsche already. And that man there
has paid off his mortgage this month.' The 'staff' were glued to their
telephones and the open plan office buzzed with all the industry of bees in
a hive.
Advising people on financial products did not seem an unskilled task but the
man reassured me that, in fact, it was very easy and the company would give
all of a week's training. What about the wonderful salaries? 'We don't pay a
salary; everyone here is self-employed - it's much better for tax reasons.'
It was my introduction to the world of financial services and
commission-selling. I did not enter it.
Admittedly, this company was at one end of the commission-driven sales scale
but there are many, particularly tied agents - authorised to sell the
products of only one company - who earn a living by pushing to sell and
whose work has little to do with providing a financial 'service' or even
'advice'. That is why the recent move towards salaries in place of
commission is worth a cautious welcome.
This week, Sun Life joined the small but growing band of companies,
including Norwich Union and Barclays Life, switching to salaries. The shift
is, in part, a reaction to commission disclosure - which comes into force in
January - but also in response to growing criticism of selling by
commission.
The July edition of Money Management, an FT publication, quoted Sir Bryan
Carsberg, director-general of the Office of Fair Trading, as saying:
'Disclosure should alert consumers to the salesman's incentive to complete a
sale and to the potential bias which might result from the variations in
commissions available.'
He went on to cite how the sale of a unitised with-profit bond would earn
the salesman 5 per cent commission and a unit trust 3 per cent - but a Tessa
(tax-exempt special savings account) would result in none. Small wonder that
many commission-based advisers prefer to sell with-profit bonds rather than
Tessas.
Given the degree to which the financial services industry is wedded to
commission, however, it will not be easy to divorce them. So, it is
difficult not to be sceptical about the introduction of salaries while the
commission incentive remains, or when bonuses are linked to sales
performance.
The Prudential offers a basic salary of only Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 4,000 -
scarcely a whole-hearted embrace of the salary structure. Norwich Union says
it is paying its agents selling life and pension policies a more realistic
basic annual salary of Pounds 12,000 as well as commission.
At Knight Williams, an independent financial adviser, staff could be
forgiven for feeling bemused. They have been through virtually all the
remunerative permutations available. At one time, they received greater
commission for selling Knight Williams' products than those from outside;
this differential was removed last year after unfavourable press comment.
In March, KW said it had moved the staff to minimum annual salaries of
Pounds 15,000 in conjunction with annual bonuses. This month, though, it cut
salaries by 10 per cent pending the outcome of a public argument with a band
of disgruntled KW investors.
The same scepticism about changes in remuneration also applies to those
independent advisers contemplating a move to fees instead of commission.
IFAs are independent only to the degree that they are not limited to selling
the products of a single company.
The cultural divide between fees and commission is great, and the risk is
that some IFAs may under-estimate its span to the detriment of consumers'
interests. Instead of selling products, they need to think in terms of
selling advice, even if that means charging some clients money for advising
them to do nothing.
'It is not enough just to think of switching from commission to fees,' said
David Norton, chairman of the Institute of Financial Planning, who
identifies impartiality as the key to the fee-based culture.
'In order to charge fees, you have to get the advice right and add value.
People will not be prepared to pay a fee for what is simply prescribing a
product.'
David Harris, of fee-based adviser Chantrey Financial Services, says that he
is concerned that some commission-based advisers will simply calculate what
they would have earned in commission and send the client a bill for the
amount as a fee.
Instead, he adds, 'we should be striving to be seen in the same light as
professional advisers such as solicitors and accountants' by using a
computerised time management system and giving a worthwhile service.
When that makes getting a job at companies like FARDA Financial Services
much harder in the future, then the new system will look as if it is
beginning to work.

FT  20 AUG 94 / The Czech millionaire bandwagon: Emotionally and culturally
ravaged, a repressed country is regaining its self-confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The police were waiting to arrest Michal Horacek at Prague airport when he
came back from his first trip to America in 1974.
Now one of the Czech Republic's fast-growing club of
millionaire-entrepreneurs, he had refused to join the communist youth
movement and had forged the movement's stamp, one of many bureaucratic
hurdles which had to be circumvented before gaining his coveted exit visa.
Fifteen years later, in 1989, Horacek, a song writer, together with Michal
Kocab, his pop-star brother-in-law, was called in to help Ladislaw Adamec,
the last communist-era prime minister, come to terms with the break-up of
the old regime.
Now, as central Europe prepares to celebrate the fifth anniversary of
communism's collapse, the Czech republic is emerging as a rejuvenated force
and an example to the rest of the eastern bloc.
The extent of its transformation would have seemed astonishing to Adamec at
that meeting in his Prague flat on the eve of the 'velvet revolution'. The
communist leader, frightened by the domino-like collapse of other communist
regimes, had called on Horacek as the founder of an organisation called
most, or 'bridge'.
'Dissidents could not talk to the government and the government could not
talk to the dissidents. So Kocab and I decided to form most. At the time
both of us enjoyed a sort of cult status thanks to our bitter-sweet songs
and a column called 'letters of love and hate' in the magazine Mlady Svet
(Young World),' Horacek recalls.
'Suddenly the government found itself isolated and desperately needed to
find a 'bridge' to the people. So they called on us,' he says.
'The most unforgettable moment in my life took place a few days later when I
appealed to a vast crowd in Wenceslas Square to forgive the secret police.
After a silence, voices started chanting back 'we forgive you' and the crowd
took it up. Many people now say we did the wrong thing. But the police were
armed, anything could have happened and suddenly what could have been a
vicious circle of recrimination and violence was broken.'
Five years later Horacek, sits in a spartanly furnished office on the top
floor of a grim, Soviet-era hotel block in an unfashionable Prague suburb.
He is plotting the future growth and direction of one of the post-communist
Czech republic's fastest-growing private companies, a betting company
felicitously named Fortuna.
'I started the company in March 1990 as Czechoslovakia's first private,
joint stock company. We are the local bookmakers who allow ordinary people
to place a bet on anything.' Fortuna, which operates in more than 70 towns
and villages around the country, replaced the tired state-run lotteries. 'We
became an immediate, incredible success across the country,' he says. After
four years of rapid growth the company is 'highly profitable', employs 440
people and will turn over an expected Dollars 40m this year, he adds.
'All new entrepreneurs in this part of the world have had to learn
everything from scratch. Four years ago I went to the World Bank and they
gave me a comic book to explain the basic principles of a capitalist
economy,' he recalls. 'We started off in a maelstrom of changing laws, many
of them retroactive. But it is at times like these that fortunes are made,
and it is wonderful to be in the midst of it all.'
Giving people what they want, after 50 years of a centrally planned economy
devoted to steel, heavy engineering and guns, is an essential element in the
emergence of a new breed of entrepreneurial business men and women who are
transforming the Czech economy at breakneck speed - and making fortunes in
the process.
Many are close friends steeped in the free-thinking, Bohemian traditions of
this quintessential middle-European country which neither Soviet tanks nor
the plodding, unimaginative communists they kept in power were ever quite
able to suppress.
Lubomir Kratochvil, another entrepreneur, used to write the music for Michal
Horacek's lyrics. Vladimir Dlouhy, then a card-carrying communist party
member and now minister of industry, played bass in their band, Jazz Q.
A couple of years ago Kratochvil founded the Golem Club, Prague's exclusive
club for millionaires which meets in the cellar of a former medieval
monastery in the heart of historic Prague. He whizzes around in a soft-top
sports car, and presents a business card which includes the telephone number
of his private aircraft and helicopter.
Clearly he is having a ball as the prime mover behind Bonton, a fast-growing
music and media group, at least partly inspired by the example of Richard
Branson, whom he recalls meeting in London in the late 1960s when Branson
was setting up Virgin Records. Bonton is currently raising Dollars 15m
through a private placement organised by CS First Boston.
The fact that Prague, the centre of Czech political, cultural and economic
life, is a small town gives a special flavour to the Czech economic revival
which has been master-minded by its spiky, self-confessed 'Thatcherite'
prime minister, Vaclav Klaus.
Today, Klaus dresses in smart suits, is an habitue of the international
conference circuit, noted for his sharp tongue and inability to suffer fools
gladly. It was different five years ago. He then emerged from 20 years of
obscurity in the central bank and other institutions, devouring western
economic literature as the man with the clearest idea of where the
Czechoslovak economy should go.
'Klaus came and offered his services as an economist. He was there, he was
intelligent and he was against chaos. It was vital for us not to be seen as
just a bunch of dreamers and philosophers. He was modest, used to drive a
Trabant and seemed to know what he was talking about,' Horacek remembers.
Now, like other leading entrepreneurs, Horacek is unstinting in his praise.
'Without Klaus we would have gone through a very painful and difficult
transition. He has shown what a difference one man can make.'
As Klaus, initially the finance minister, enters his third year as the
country's premier there are growing signs of economic nationalism
accompanying the self-confidence which is returning after the end of 50
years of foreign occupation.
It is reflected in the desire of the Czech republic's smartest and most
talented people to recreate, by themselves as far as possible, the wealth
and style which made the inter-war Czechoslovak republic richer and more
culturally dynamic than Switzerland, and technically on a par with Germany.
The task of catching up, after 60 lost years under Nazi and Soviet
occupation, has been made more difficult by the cultural and economic loss
caused by the destruction of Czechoslovak Jewry and the exodus of the
educated people during communist rule.
However, for many Czech and other expatriates from east and central Europe,
life in the diaspora provided an opportunity to refine their skills and
educate their children in good schools and universities. Many who stayed
retreated into a form of 'internal migration' where they nurtured their
private beliefs. Both experiences are now reserves to be drawn on.
This new energy, aided by access to technology and wages less than one-tenth
of German rates, is being harnessed to modernise the technical skills and
ingenuity which made Czech lands the industrial powerhouse of the old
Hapsburg empire. Industry is being refocused by new companies while the old
communist behemoths are being slimmed and privatised - such as the former
state-owned engineering company Skoda Pilsen - or sold. Foreigners have
acquired Volkswagen/Skoda Automobilova, the glass company Sklo Union and the
state tobacco monopoly.
With increasing frequency German companies, or foreign companies operating
in Germany, such as AVX, the UK subsidiary of a Japanese electronics
company, are simply unbolting their equipment from plants in
high-labour-cost Germany, shifting them by rail or truck and reassembling
them over the Czech border where skilled labour is prepared to work for
wages kept low by heavy government excess-wage taxes and weak or
non-existent unions. Some companies, such as AVX, work their plants on a
seven-day basis around the clock.
Low wages are thought to be a transient phase. Real incomes have been rising
thanks to trade liberalisation, a stable exchange rate, a low inflation rate
and wider availability of goods and services.
But the most dynamic growth in the rapidly emerging post-communist economy
is concentrated in the long-neglected service sector. In tourism, retailing,
banking, finance and property refurbishment - as well as betting shops and
record companies - jobs are being created to absorb the shakeout from heavy
industry. The service sector is also where fortunes are being made.
Ravaged emotionally and culturally this century, Czechoslovakia nevertheless
escaped the physical destruction which afflicted most other countries in the
region and saw entire Polish cities, such as Warsaw, razed.
Ironically, 50 years of communism preserved hundreds of medieval,
renaissance and baroque towns and villages in both the Czech and Slovak
republics as the communist leaders let old centres decay.
These jewels are now being refurbished, repainted, regilded and polished -
and foreign tourists are flocking to them. The Czech republic's stable
currency, growing reserves and healthy current account surplus would not be
possible without the billions of dollars spent by tourists to Prague and the
famous spa towns such as Karlsbad.
As central Europe marks the fifth anniversary of the domino-like collapse of
communism, the explosive growth in Czech tourism and the emergence of
service-orientated companies shows how far economic transformation has
progressed - and how one of Europe's most repressed countries is regaining
its wealth and self-confidence.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Long View: So where's the binge?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For those who devote serious bathtime to pondering the means by which
Kenneth Clarke will live up to the great inflationary tradition of Maudling,
Barber and Lawson, recent economic data make for an exceptionally slow start
to the day.
The housing market, a familiar source of trouble, remains unusually groggy.
Monetary aggregates are peculiarly well behaved. The consumer's idea of
living dangerously is to splash out on a pair of shoes and spend more on
very competitively-priced food in the supermarket. The big question about
British economic policy is not where's the beef, but where's the binge.
While the chancellor and Eddie George, his opposite number in Threadneedle
Street, are agreed that interest rates will have to rise sooner or later,
the economic news conspires to deprive the Governor of the chance to
demonstrate his macho monetary credentials.
This is no doubt frustrating for an unelected central banker who has
unexpectedly been granted a greater say in monetary policy by an elected
politician. Yet for the rest of us the message should be to lie back and
enjoy an increasingly well-balanced, non-inflationary recovery.
But that, of course, is an unwelcome message, however seasonal, for the
masochistic British. So for the benefit of domestic readers, and with
apologies to the international brigade who lost their appetite for gilts so
long ago as February, this column will live up to its title and look beyond
the present benign conjuncture. Where is the next inflationary threat going
to come from?
The first point on which to be clear is that there certainly will be another
bout of inflation. In the absence of a gold standard or any other anchor for
monetary policy, the question is simply how and when. But without a much
bigger commodity price shock than the world has seen this year, or a huge
monetary disturbance of the kind that followed the collapse of the Bretton
Woods fixed exchange rate system in the early 1970s, the threat is local,
not global. It hinges on the competence of individual governments.
Here, then, is the first clue. The Treasury is now forecasting growth in
demand at a comfortably reassuring level of three per cent. Never forget
that in 1988, when GDP growth soared to unsustainable heights, the Treasury
had been forecasting a slow-down which provided the basis for a give-away
budget.
What that tells us is that Treasury forecasters have as much difficulty as
the rest of us in grasping how the economy works. And one of the perennial
questions about the entrails of the economy is just how much spare capacity
exists to cope with a surge in demand beyond Treasury expectations.
No one really knows the answer. So one plausible inflationary scenario might
start with the gap between actual and potential output turning out to be
narrower than the Treasury economists think. On the elimination of the gap,
inflationary bottlenecks would loom because of a shortage of domestic
supply.
The problem would then be compounded if the chancellor's tax-cutting
instincts were encouraged by over-optimistic assumptions about the shrinkage
of the structural component of the budget deficit - the deficit that remains
when the economy returns to its sustainable trend level of output.
It is at this point that the markets' version of Murphy's law could reliably
be expected to intervene. What worries those involved in international
capital is default risk: the fear that governments will lose control of
their budget deficits and resort to inflationary financing via the banking
system while the currency is allowed to collapse.
That is partly why the lira was under pressure last week and why the Italian
authorities raised interest rates in spite of minimal inflationary pressure
in the domestic economy. It also explains why Swedish bond prices have been
so weak and why, in part, Sweden raised rates too. The public finances of
both countries are in a mess. Markets are understandably worried about the
politicians' will to confront their problems.
Britain is not in a comparably messy fiscal position. Clarke surprised
everyone with his readiness last November to grasp fiscal nettles both this
year and next. Yet, with medium-dated gilts yielding more than nine per cent
and sterling drifting against the D-Mark, there is clearly a problem of
credibility. That was the message in the markets' entirely perverse response
to good news on inflation this week. They punished the currency for no
better reason than that a test of the chancellor's readiness to raise
interest rates was deferred a little longer.
Weaker sterling today may not matter because - even on the most pessimistic
assumptions - the output gap is some way from closing. In the absence of
constraints on supply the impact of higher import prices on the domestic
price level is thus unlikely to be great. If anything the effect would be
helpful since it would encourage a bias towards export-led rather than
consumption-led growth. But later, in the midst of a pre-electoral boomlet,
devaluation would be another matter.
When markets are in punitive mood, their prophecies tend to be
self-fulfilling. Just as today's penal real interest rates in Sweden and
Italy will drive these countries into default unless they can find a way of
providing fiscal reassurance to investors, a sterling plunge could become
self-feeding as the inflationary consequences worsened with each downward
lurch. Back, in fact, to Lord Barber and the dog days of 1974.
It need not happen; nor should it. The bond markets are over-reacting to
Clarke, who shows every sign of being an underrated chancellor, with the
potential to break moulds as well as to grasp nettles. On the record so far,
his pre-electoral tax cuts will be within the bounds - well, just - of
market acceptability. The risk Clarke runs is political, not economic. His
reward for good economic behaviour may well be to deliver a supremely
healthy economy to Labour's Tony Blair.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Railtrack advisers urge labour relations shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation of Railtrack could be delayed indefinitely if the company
fails to overhaul working practices and make big productivity improvements,
according to government financial advisers.
The consultants believe the 10-week series of strikes by signalling staff
has so damaged the company's image with potential investors that it would be
impossible to sell before the next election without a big shake-up in labour
relations.
Some of the advisers, who are City merchant bankers and accountants, are
pressing ministers to introduce personal contracts as the clearest signal to
the City that Railtrack's working practices have changed for the good.
The company, which owns Britain's rail network, would prefer to settle the
industrial action without introducing personal contracts. But its directors
increasingly favour offering the 4,500 signal staff individual contracts if
the dispute is not settled by the end of the month.
Ministers had hoped to sell Railtrack for more than Pounds 3bn before the
next election as the final act of railway privatisation.
The Department of Transport said yesterday: 'The dispute has made no change
to the government's plan for privatisation nor has it affected the
privatisation programme.' However, a senior Whitehall official said that
since the timing of the sell-off had never been 'formally announced',
ministers could argue that their privatisation plans had not been affected
by the dispute if it was postponed.
Most of Railtrack's revenue comes from track access charges paid by private
rail companies for the right to run trains on the rail network. The access
charges are set by Railtrack but need the rail regulator's approval.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said: 'With the best
working practices and industrial relations the owners of Railtrack would
still not control fares or access charges - which is not how most people
like to run their business.'
According to figures released yesterday by Mr Dobson, British Rail and
Railtrack are spending more than Pounds 27m on privatisation advice. The
government has already paid out Pounds 19.9m to its consultants. 'Railtrack
alone is spending Pounds 16.5m on privatisation - three times the cost of
settling the signalling dispute,' Mr Dobson said.
The original offer in June of 5.7 per cent, which was withdrawn because it
would have breached the government's public sector pay constraints, would
have cost Pounds 5m.
Another 24-hour strike of signal workers is due to start at noon on Monday
and a further 48-hour strike was called by the RMT transport union
immediately after the August bank holiday weekend. It will last from noon on
August 30 to noon on September 1.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Germany's plutonium smuggling saga turns into farce
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
German police and secret service agents denied yesterday that they had been
misled in their hunt for contraband plutonium.
The federal and Hamburg police disowned a self-proclaimed undercover agent -
a V-man in local jargon - arrested earlier this week in Bremen handing a
faintly radioactive smoke detector component to a journalist.
The journalist, who tipped off the arresting officers, is also being
questioned. Although the federal police admitted the arrested man had been
signed up two years ago as a sort of official agent, his services had been
called on only once since then.
The 'agent's' lawyer stood by his client, accusing the authorities of using
undercover agents to gauge supply and demand in Germany for illicit nuclear
material. Official hints suggest agents are trying to infiltrate the
underground market.
'Our security people know would-be Russian smugglers have been testing the
European market for months,' one said. 'It is important to discover how
potent the would-be sellers are.'
One foreign observer said the real problem was a lack of co-ordination and
inter-agency rivalry between the galaxy of law and security enforcement
agencies involved.
'I would be astonished if they were actually co-ordinating anything,' he
said. Apart from federal and local police, the internal and external
security agencies, frontier protection services and customs agents have a
hand in stopping plutonium smuggling.
Meanwhile, Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, security adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
flew to Moscow to address the issue of preventing the theft of nuclear
material from Russian plants.
Mr Schmidbauer was said in Bonn to have received 'very constructive signals'
from the Russian anti-espionage chief.
The meeting sought to build on a promise from Moscow to allow German experts
to work jointly with Russian specialists to check security in a Russian fuel
reprocessing plant. Further evidence of a constructive approach after a
chaotic week of charge and counter-charge emerged from the Russian foreign
secret service. 'The plausibility of the theft of nuclear material applies
in every country and it cannot be excluded here,' a spokeswoman said.
In Germany, broadcasters featured an interview with a Bulgarian who claimed
the component seized in Bremen was really part of a poison gas detector from
a factory under his control.

FT  20 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: UK construction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The last thing the nervous housing market needs is a rise in interest rates,
so this week's unexpectedly good July inflation figures provided a little
reassurance. There was scant cheer elsewhere. The 10 per cent drop in
building societies' net new commitments compared with the previous month
suggests the housing recovery has not merely stalled but is stuck in a
ditch. Given that the economic background could scarcely be better it is
hard to see what would dig it out, barring that illusive improvement in
consumer confidence.
Housebuilders are being squeezed at both ends. Materials price rises are
sticking. Meanwhile, stagnant new house prices will soon start to make life
hard for those builders who stocked up their land banks in the expectation
that prices would start to rise.
Having bid up the leading construction groups' shares last year on the basis
of the housing recovery, investors are now focusing on their commercial and
infrastructure sides. It is not a pretty picture. Although volumes are up,
margins are thin with low interest rates reducing the cash-flow benefit of
advance payments. BICC warned this week it could see little respite with any
growth dependent on the long hoped-for flood of private sector
infrastructure projects. The construction sector has underperformed the
market by 20 per cent since its February peak. Given the downbeat comments
which are likely to accompany the forthcoming reporting season it is hard to
see it climbing out of the hole in a hurry.

FT  20 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors who put money into quoted Lloyd's of London funds last autumn must
be disappointed with their performance. Most stand below the price at which
they were floated. In addition to turbulent stock and bond markets, which
have eroded the funds' asset values, underwriting rates have softened. Funds
which initially traded at a premium to net assets in anticipation of
underwriting profits have fallen to a discount. This year's crop of new
Lloyd's companies is likely to be smaller - perhaps Pounds 200m to Pounds
400m will be raised. Even so, they will need to make a convincing case.
If Lloyd's keeps up its record of innovation, though, the new batch of
companies will look different from the previous one. Rather than unit
trust-style vehicles which invest in a wide range of syndicates, the new
breed will provide capital for a single managing agency or even a single
syndicate. Shareholders will be backing the skills of an agency and its
underwriters, making the investment more akin to buying shares in a
traditional insurance company.
Such vehicles will only be listed if the stock exchange waives its usual
requirement for a three-year trading record. The exchange will have to
consider whether companies with all their eggs in one basket at Lloyd's are
too risky for the public market. But it is difficult to argue that
single-syndicate funds would be more volatile than biotechnology companies,
which recently won a similar exemption from the exchange. Investors
confident of their ability to pick winners at Lloyd's should be given the
opportunity to try.

FT  20 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Railtrack
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not strictly true that Railtrack's privatisation depends on the
strike-ridden company making big productivity gains - much as that is what
the government's highly paid financial advisers are telling it. Even less so
is privatisation contingent on personal contracts being imposed on the
signalling staff. In fact, prospective shareholders would be rather
disappointed if the bulk of the efficiency improvements Railtrack is able to
deliver came before privatisation. In other privatisations, the main staff
cuts and changes in working practices have occurred after companies have
been freed from state control. Not only are such changes easier to bring
about once unions know they cannot hope to involve politicians in an
industrial dispute. It is precisely the post-privatisation drive for
efficiency that has proved so profitable for investors in the energy, water
and telecommunications sectors.
That said, investors would clearly need to be confident that Railtrack's
management was not so broken by the current strike that it was incapable of
taking firm action after a share sale. If Mr Jimmy Knapp, the rail union
leader, was able to claim a famous victory in the dispute, shareholders
would indeed be unnerved. This point is not lost on Railtrack directors and
helps explain the company's tough line. Ministers too have an interest in
hanging tough. Privatisation receipts of around Pounds 3bn would make that
pre-election tax cut just that much easier.

FT  20 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Dog days for the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is bad luck for the US Federal Reserve that the warm glow of approval for
its half-point rise in interest rates lasted less than a day. Survey data
pointing to inflationary pressure in the US economy - and a slight worsening
of the bilateral trade deficit with Japan - subsequently sent the dollar
back below Y100 and DM1.55. Stock and bond markets fell in sympathy. But the
authorities should not be surprised. The consistent message from the markets
this year is that rising interest rates are only one ingredient in the
recipe for a stronger dollar.
The Bundesbank's decision not to cut rates this week also suggests that
interest rate differentials may not be as favourable as dollar bulls had
hoped. The German central bank's tough line this week contrasts with
lingering doubts about the willingness of the Fed to tackle inflation if its
latest measures prove to be inadequate. Even if the Bundesbank cuts rates
again this autumn, financial markets will herald the floor in German rates -
which could again be bad news for the dollar.
This need not imply a currency crisis. The dollar closed the week a shade
above the lows last month and higher interest rates may start to attract
investors into short-dated dollar assets. But it is difficult to imagine
overseas investors flooding into US stocks and bonds while the uncertain
climate persists. With no sign of progress on trade and nagging worries
about inflation - not to mention President Bill Clinton's renewed political
difficulties - the dollar looks certain to remain vulnerable.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Asian growth nations lead UK exports rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asia's 'tiger' nations and Latin America are the fastest growing markets for
British exporters, with much of the growth coming from the engineering and
chemicals sector, according to official figures released yesterday.
The report, from the Central Statistical Office, also says Britain's trade
position with non-European Union countries has gradually improved.
Excluding oil and other erratic items, exports to non-EU countries, which
represent about 40 per cent of UK trade, rose by 3 per cent in the three
months to July, compared with the three months to April. Imports fell by 0.5
per cent in this period, gradually reducing the UK trade deficit.
Although there was a rise in Britain's exports to most regions of the world,
the fastest growth occurred in goods sent to the Asian 'tigers', Japan and
Latin American countries.
Exports to the newly industrialised Asian countries of Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand were 25 per cent higher in the
three months to July compared with the same period a year ago.
Exports to Latin America were 30 per cent higher in the three months to July
compared with the same period a year ago, and 15 per cent higher than in the
three months to April.
The CSO said that the growth was occurring from a relatively low base. Total
UK exports to the Asian 'tigers' were about Pounds 650m last month, while
exports to Latin America were about Pounds 200m. By contrast, exports to
North America were Pounds 1.55bn in the three months to July, 5 per cent
higher than in the previous three months.
But with most of the growth in the emerging markets coming from engineering,
chemicals and pharmaceutical sectors, UK trade groups called on British
companies to step up their efforts to exploit the export potential, not
least because they enjoy an advantage over other European rivals given
sterling's weakness against the D-Mark.
Mr Robin Eader, deputy director general of the Institute of Export, said:
'The potential for export growth in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan is
enormous - Glaxo is out there, ICI - all the big UK companies.'

FT  20 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slips as week ends on
soft note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks ended a volatile week on a soft note yesterday, as a skittish bond
market held most share prices in check, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished off 0.32 at 3,755.11, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 inched 0.51 forward to 463.68.
In the secondary markets, the Nasdaq composite edged 0.26 ahead to 742.43,
while the American SE composite outperformed the other indices, rising 1.90
to 445.45, Trading activity was moderate. Only 278m shares were exchanged on
the NYSE despite extra activity generated by the monthly expiration of
options on stock index futures and individual stocks. The 'double witching'
activity had a negligible impact on prices.
Indeed, investors struggled to find any source of inspiration. There was no
fresh economic news and the dollar, which had triggered declines in stocks
and bonds the previous session, held fairly steady against other leading
currencies.
The absence of news appeared to give a measure of support to the Treasury
market. But the benchmark 30-year government bond was showing losses for a
third straight day, reinforcing a negative tone that emerged in the
aftermath of Tuesday's move by the Federal Reserve to tighter money.
Stocks opened lower and drifted a shade under their opening values for most
of the morning. Just after midday, however, the leading indices nudged into
positive ground, only to recede again later.
The Dow industrial index would have fallen more sharply without another good
performance by IBM, which gained Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 68 1/8 .
A day earlier, Merrill Lynch raised its 1994 earnings projection for the
computer company, pushing its share price up to Dollars 66 7/8 . Yesterday
that valuation led Mr David Wu, an analyst at SG Warburg, to lift his price
target for the stock to at least Dollars 80 by mid-1985.
But most cyclical issues drifted. Among the most nota ble movers, Deere
dropped a further Dollars 1 to Dollars 65 7/8 while Navistar International,
up Dollars 1 at Dollars 15 7/8 , continued to benefit from a positive
earnings report.
In the energy sector, Mobil stood out with a Dollars 1 gain to Dollars 81
5/8 while JP Morgan's Dollars 1 1/8 decline to Dollars 63 1/4 was the
highlight in banking.
The NYSE's most actively traded issue was 20th Century Industries. The
insurance company dropped 22 per cent or Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 12 3/4
after a California court decided to allow a referendum designed to force a
cut in premiums charged by companies in the state.
Canada
Toronto stocks ended little changed in moderate trading with the TSE-300
composite index rising just 2.64 points, or 0.06 per cent, to 4,187.08, for
a gain on the week of about 12 points. Declines led advances 341 to 331 but
volume fell to 47.43m shares from 57.02m.
NOVA Corp. gained  1/4 to 13  1/4 . A Merrill Lynch analyst upgraded the
company to medium-term 'above average' from 'neutral.'
Royal Oak lost  1/8 to 5  1/2 , American Barrick added  1/4 to 30  7/8 and
Lac edged up  1/8 to 13  7/8 .
Mexico
Mexican equities ended firmer in the last session before presidential
elections scheduled for Sunday.
The IPC index of 37 leading shares closed 9.94 points higher just above the
psychological 2,700 point-barrier at 2,708.18, a gain of 0.37 per cent.
'The market was very firm all day,' one trader said. 'Investors remained
optimistic about the elections.'
Venezuela
Caracas stocks closed up sharply in brisk trading buoyed by the recent
plunge in domestic interest rates, traders said.
The independent Merinvest index rose 3.89 per cent to 144.10 on volume of
10m shares.

FT  20 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Zurich hopes that the agony is finally
over - Ian Rodger on the embattled Swiss equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the agony finally over? That is certainly what dazed investors in the
Swiss market are hoping now that the big banks and the pharmaceuticals
giant, Roche, have reported their disappointing interim results.
But there is little sign of optimism about a quick or substantial recovery
from the 14 per cent slide in the all share Swiss Performance index since
the beginning of February. The blue chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) of 22
leading shares has tumbled even more, 18 per cent over the same period,
because of the heavy weighting of Roche and the bank shares.
After so many unpleasant surprises in the first half of the year, many
analysts are unwilling to predict a specific target for the main indices
over the next few months. Others are cautious. 'I can see the SMI up 10 per
cent by the end of the year, with most of the action in the fourth quarter,'
says Mr Frederick Hasslauer, of Bank Sal Oppenheim in Zurich.
Mr Serge Ledermann of the Geneva bankers, Lombard, Odier has pencilled in a
similar rise for the SPI to 1,900, but only if interest rates remain stable
and the dollar strengthens slightly.
Many analysts say, with varying degrees of conviction, that the market has
now found a secure base, with the SMI around the 2,600 level. They point out
that since its last downward jag in June, caused mainly by the weakness in
Roche, the SMI has moved within a narrow range between 2,500 and and 2,600.
But opinions vary enormously on what will happen from here. For Mr Hasslauer
and others, the blue chips are unlikely to recover their lustre for some
time, so the emphasis should be on the cyclicals and second tier shares. In
both categories, selection is crucial.
There is much enthusiasm in some quarters for ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the
power engineering group, in spite of the dour response to its interim report
on Wednesday. The Brown Boveri bearer shares, at SFr1,259 in advance of the
results, dropped quickly to SFr1,215, in spite of the 31 per cent rise in
net income and a positive outlook.
Mr Simon Marshall-Lockyer of Kleinwort Benson in London says he would not be
surprised if there was further profit taking in BBC in the near term. But he
argues that prospects in the medium term are very exciting because of the
huge demand for new electric power capacity in China and other fast growing
Asian countries.
Mr Marshall-Lockyer also likes Ciba because of its strong chemicals content,
the cement giant Holderbank and Swissair.
Much maligned in the past two years, Swissair has bounced back in the past
few weeks following publication of statistics revealing improved loads and
yields. Also, a very bullish report from Union Bank of Switzerland,
upgrading the registered shares to a 'strong buy', has helped push them from
SFr790 to SFr865 in the past two weeks.
Mr Thomas Kalbermatten, the UBS analyst, sees them going to SFr900 'quite
quickly'. He says that demand for business class seats is picking up and
that Swissair has a better quality business class than some rivals. Also,
its cost cutting programmes are beginning to show results, he believes.
Second tier enthusiasts got a jolt two weeks ago when the leading department
store group, Grands Magasins Jelmoli, bought the controlling interest in an
appliance retailer, Fust, from the Fust family. To the anger of a number of
analysts and British institutions, Jelmoli offered minority shareholders a
lower price for their Fust shares than it offered the family.
There were fears that this discrimination, still allowed under Swiss law,
would snuff out international investors' enthusiasm for shares of other
smallish, family controlled companies. But Mr Marshall-Lockyer, for one, is
maintaining a heavy weighting for second tier shares, recommending the
mechanical engineer, SIG, the packaging machinery group, Bobst, and the
textile machinery groups, Zellweger and Rieter.
For other analysts, the play on cyclicals in the main European markets,
including Switzerland, is largely over. On Thursday, Thomas Pfyl of Bank J.
Vontobel in Zurich revised his BBC rating from buy to hold, saying that
after a very good run, the share was unlikely to continue to outperform the
market.
Some analysts are beginning to suggest that, given the renewed volatility of
currencies and interest rates, the defensive qualities of the traditional
Swiss market leaders - the pharmaceuticals, Nestle and the banks and
insurance companies - could soon return to favour.
Mr Marc Polydor, of Banque Scandinave en Suisse, points out that although
financials began to slide in February, they have underperformed the market
for a year. 'I think we could see some comeback of interest sensitive
stocks. Most of the bad scenarios have been discounted,' he says.
Among the big banks, analysts generally prefer CS Holding, the group built
around Credit Suisse. Its shares performed the worst among the big three in
the first half, the bearers falling 22.5 per cent. Yet its interim profits,
last Wednesday, were not as badly down as those of its two rivals.
'We think the CS shares have been oversold,' Ledermann of Lombard, Odier
says.

FT  20 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses fall on weakness in
bond markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed weakness in bond markets, and inflation worries in the US gave
bourses an uncomfortable run into the weekend, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT went tamely into the expiry of the Dax option, the key index
easing 3.99 to 2,149.57, down 1.2 per cent on the week, against a striking
level of 2,150. The Ibis indicated Dax fell further to 2,143.84 in the
post-bourse.
Turnover stayed low, down from DM5.9bn to DM5.2bn. The two main stories of
the day were in second rank blue chips: Schering, the pharmaceuticals group,
and Lufthansa, the airline and prime privatisation candidate.
Schering, which fell DM42.50 to DM915 on Tuesday on news that two of its
drugs were under official scrutiny, lost another DM9 to DM899, 6.1 per cent
down over four days. Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok at Robert Fleming in Frankfurt
said that around 10 per cent of Schering's revenues could be affected.
Lufthansa, initially, reacted well to an interim report which indicated that
recovery was on the way, hitting an intraday peak of DM217; the euphoria did
not last, and the shares closed 70 pfg lower at DM214.80 before subsiding to
DM211.50 after hours.
PARIS finished the session in a subdued mood with the CAC-40 index slipping
9.21 to 2,001.33, barely changed on the week and, as last week, just holding
the 2,000 support ahead of the weekend. The session saw a low point of
1,993.89, against an intraday high of 2,0209.51.
Turnover remained modest at FFr2.2bn.
Generale des Eaux, which reported a slight increase in half year sales, lost
FFr3 to FFr533 while Eurotunnel, which reported sales figures for the first
time - FFr19m for the second quarter - slipped 15 centimes to FFr25.55.
Danone, which denied reports that it might sell its jam making division,
lost FFr12 to FFr832.
AMSTERDAM featured activity in Fokker, the aircraft manufacturer, following
disappointing half year results which came after the close of business on
Thursday. The group's shares dipped to a day's low of Fl 15.10 before
closing off 90 cents at Fl 15.90.
The AEX index slipped 1.72 to 412.45 as it faced further pressure from
options expiry, a week's fall of 0.5 per cent.
MILAN made progress as investors bought shares in BCI and Telecom Italia.
BCI rose L130 to L3,680 while Telecom Italia, whose shares began to trade on
Thursday, gained L120 to L4,310.
The Comit index rose 16.32 to 661.15, up 2.6 per cent on the week.
Kleinwort Benson,in a comment on the Italian equity market, said that the
recent decision by the Bank of Italy to raise interest rates had not only
dispelled doubts over its independence but also placed the government in
'the most uncomfortable position at the worst possible time . . . The only
good thing about the recent events is that the pressure on the government to
act has increased'.
Kleinwort's said that it expected the government to follow a tight monetary
policy and forecast that the market would rise to the 800 level in the next
three months.
ZURICH fell by a percentage point on the day and by much the same on the
week, the SMI index losing 25.9 at 2,556.8 in low volume. In banks, selling
turned to CS Holding, down SFr14 to SFr535 while UBS, the most active stock,
lost SFr19 at SFr1,091. SBC, this week's villain in the sector, recovered
SFr2 to SFr376.
MADRID declined for the sixth consecutive session, the general index closing
0.90 lower at 306.18, 2.1 per cent lower on the week in turnover of
Pta27.5bn.
One or two construction stocks bucked the trend, with Cubiertas up Pta290 at
Pta10,400 and Uralita Pta75 better at Pta1,535.
HELSINKI had another good day after Thursday's 1.35 per cent gain, the Hex
index rising 38.1, or 2.1 per cent to 1,876.1, 3 per cent higher on the
week.
Economists looked at budget plans and said that the Finnish government had
lived up to its promise by keeping next year's budget expenditure, and the
deficit with set limits. This, they said, was good news for the economy, and
for financial markets.

FT  20 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Yen drives down Nikkei
in volatile region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The yen's renewed strength against the dollar discouraged investors, and
share prices lost ground for the first time in four trading days, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index fell 350.07, or 1.7 per cent, to 20,512.70 on arbitrage
unwinding, leaving it down 0.7 per cent on the week. The index opened at the
day's high of 20,803.36 and hit a low of 20,501.20 just before the close.
A sharp rise in the yen against the dollar triggered by the US trade deficit
with Japan prompted the sell-off. The dollar fell to a three week low, below
the Y98 level.
Some domestic financial institutions, including public pension and insurance
funds, were seen supporting share prices at lower levels, while overseas
investors bought construction, steel and chemical stocks.
Volume was 254m shares against 266m. The Topix index of all first section
stocks fell 19.27 to 1,643.82 and the Nikkei 300 declined 3.82 to 298.94.
Declines outnumbered advances 856 to 149, with 147 issues remaining
unchanged.
In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.16 to 1,332.20.
Export oriented stocks were hit by the yen. Nissan Motor, the day's most
active issue, fell Y23 to Y787, while Sharp declined Y60 to Y1,790 and
Hitachi Y25 to Y985.
Steel makers fell on profit-taking amid active trading - Nippon Steel fell
Y6 to Y368 and Sumitomo Metal Industries declined Y1 to Y338.
Chemicals, which had been popular among foreign investors recently, were
mixed. Sumitomo Chemical rose Y5 to Y580 on afternoon buying, while
Mitsubishi Kasei dropped Y11 to Y551 on profit-taking.
Some construction companies were supported by overseas investors.
Penta-Ocean Construction rose Y9 to Y639 and Obayashi Y4 to Y706.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 209.84 to 22,980.06 in volume of 56.1m
shares.
Roundup
The region was volatile.
HONG KONG took profits amid concern over some key earnings reports due next
week, and fears of an prime rate rise which were justified by a lift of half
a percentage point after the market closed. The Hang Seng index ended down
114.45 at 9,404.44, down 6 per cent over the week.
In London trading the indicative index was quoted at 9,407.
Dealers said expectations for next week's batch of earnings were still
relatively high, but investors were selling on worries that they could leave
share prices still lower.
BOMBAY's BSE index closed 65.55 lower at 4,468.78 as speculators sold ahead
of four days of holidays and investors kept to the sidelines. The BSE fell
0.9 per cent over the week.
TAIWAN rose 180.22, or 2.7 per cent to 6,776.38 in heavy turnover of
TDollars 109bn, for a week's gain of 2.2 per cent. The market rumour was
that major players, overbought in recent bullish sessions, were trying to
push up prices before selling; analysts expected heavy profit-taking to
emerge in coming sessions. Financials were major gainers, with ICBC soaring
TDollars 6, or 6.7 per cent to TDollars 95.50 and China Development Corp up
TDollars 6.50 to TDollars 137.
MANILA strengthened 26.3 to 3,006.7, flat on the week in volume of 4.99bn
shares. Bargain hunters entered the market after the index dipped to 2,980.
KUALA LUMPUR shrugged off the overnight fall in Wall Street and returned
strongly in the afternoon. The KLSE composite index closed at 1,140.70, up
4.36 to gain 2.8 per cent on the week as analysts suggested that market
sentiment remained bullish. Sitt Tatt rose 65 cents to MDollars 6.50 on a
massive restructuring exercise.
SYDNEY saw a rally in golds as it ended the week 0.5 per cent up, with the
All Ordinaries index 5.5 lower at 2,061.3.
The golds index rose 52.0 to 2,177.8 after bullion broke out of a two-week
slumber to gain more than three cents overnight. Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie,
which topped turnover among resource stocks with almost 11m shares
exchanged, rose six cents to ADollars 1.17.
WELLINGTON saw renewed buying in the afternoon to end lower on moderate
turnover. The NZSE-40 index fell 6.65 to 2090.73, a rise of almost one per
cent on the week.

FT  20 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong demand for recs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investor appetite for the regional electricity stocks (recs) remained
insatiable yesterday with strong gains across the board. Driving the stocks
forward was continuing speculation of potential bid and merger activity, as
well as strong talk of share buy-backs and special dividend payments.
Underpinning the bullish tone were a combination of broker and company
roadshow presentations to institutional investors, all of which were
highlighting the highly positive view taken by the industry and observers
post the Offer distribution review just over a week ago.
Yesterday came suggestions that East Midlands would be unveiling a Pounds 2
a share special dividend with its interim figures next month. There was also
further talk of stake building following the 2.9 per cent block bought in
Eastern by a US institution shortly before the Offer review.
There were strong performances across the board, although one dealer was
keen to point out that turnover was not exceptional. Yorkshire surged 31 to
718p, South West 26 to 767p, South Wales 32 to 787p, Norweb 30 to 805p, East
Midlands 29 to 742p and Eastern 29 1/2 to 809 1/2 p. As a point of
reference, Eastern shares have risen 10 per cent since the Offer review on
August 11.
The generators were also attracting attention as the recs caught up with
their ratings. Scottish Power stood out, Panmure Gordon recommending the
shares, which jumped 16 to 423p with 8.5m traded.
The strength in the recs was also turning some investors, particularly in
income funds, towards the water stocks. Yield considerations helped Thames
rise 19 1/2 to 536 1/2 p, Severn Trent 17 to 593p and Northumbrian 27 to
711p.
A large seller of stock in Lloyds Chemist, the high street drugs group, sent
the shares into retreat, ending the session 8 down at 304p. Dealers
speculating on the sale were pointing the finger at one of the big US
shareholders as the seller of the 8 per cent stake, which is thought to have
been sold by Goldman Sachs via Smith New Court. The 10.3m shares were sold
into the market at 293p a share in two large blocks and were believed bought
by a number of UK institutions.
Boots rallied after falling in late trading on Thursday on talk of a rival
thyroid drug from Glaxo. Analysts were dismissive of the tale and the shares
opened brightly and were supported by rumours of a share buy-back. These
were seemingly emanating from presentations by the company to institutions
in which fund managers' fears over any dilution coming from the sale of the
pharmaceutical division were being allayed with the buy-back hints. Boots
shares climbed 8 to 547p.
Bargain-hunters in British Gas which has underperformed the market
throughout the year, helped the shares advance 7 to 302p, in trade of 6.1m.
The shares are favoured by Nomura Securities and this week it issued a
strong buy circular on the stock. Analysts at the broker said: 'Regulatory
uncertainity has been instrumental in the 20 per cent underperformance of
the shares since December last year. However, the regulatory fog is now
starting to clear.' They concluded: 'The current yield relative is too high
for a company capable of increasing its dividend in the medium term.'
Food retailers awoke from their recent slumber with Argyll Group responding
to a profits upgrade. Smith New Court was said to have been responsible. The
shares added 6 to 288p. Kwik Save managed to steady at 597p despite negative
press comment.
Market speculation over an increase in the price of The Sun from 20 to 22p,
and a less likely possibility that The Times would follow with a 5p jump,
pushed Mirror Group up 5 to 138p. Analysts suggested that the price war
between The Times and The Telegraph was unlikely to end soon but added that
if the former raised its price, it would mark the beginning of the end of
the war, in which The Times has gained most ground. However, they suggested
that News International had significant scope to raise the prices of its
newspapers since The Sun was 7p cheaper than its main rival, The Mirror, and
the bulk of revenue generated by The Times came from advertising profits.
Shares in The Telegraph lost 3 to 378p in turn-over of 1.2m shares. Pearson
fell 5 to 629p ahead of interim results. United Newsspapers moved up 8 to
543p.
Relaxation of ownership rules in ITV increased market speculation of
possible takeover bids, strengthening TV contractor share prices. Scottish
TV put on 8 to 429p, Ulster TV 14 to 619p and Yorkshire TV 17 to 351p, its
highest price since February.
Positive comment by James Capel pushed constructions group Vibroplant up 2
to 105p. Analysts expected the sector to pick up next week when a batch of
company results are to be announced, in which they would especially focus on
the company reports. The ruling earlier this week by a US district judge
that a class action settlement involving 20 companies including components
group T&amp;N was fair, continued to boost the shares. They hardened another 2
to 249p.
Shares in engineering group Siebe were down 24 at the day's worst before
steadying to close 17 off at 583p, after a close look at the company
accounts by several brokers revealed that the company had taken an Pounds
11.3m profit on the sale of assets as an operational profit rather than as
an exceptional item. Analysts suggested that profits should thus be lowered
by that amount.
However, Mr Paul Compton at Credit Lyonnais among those to study the
figures, said the shares price fall was 'something of an extreme reaction to
comments made at a morning meeting.'
The group's shares have from time to time been vulnerable to comments made
about its accounting policy.
The falls on the Hong-Kong and Tokyo markets hurt services group Inchcape
which has interests in Hong-Kong and is an importer of Japanese cars into
the UK. The shares relinquished 9 to 477p, after trade of 1.7m.
Elsewhere among oils, turnover in Dragon Oil was a massive 263m shares as
two funds said to be connected to Morgan Grenfell changed stakes. The shares
closed unchanged at 1 3/4p.

The expiry of the August index options was the main feature in an otherwise
lacklustre session in the derivatives, writes Joel Kibazo.
The mid-morning expiry was without incident and total volume in the sector
came to 34,232, of which 16,679 was done in the FT-SE 100 option and 7,923
in the Euro FT-SE option. Dixons was the busiest stock option with a total
of 1,334 lots dealt.
In futures, volume in the September contract on the FT-SE 100 was 10,415
lots as it ended the session at 3,208, up 9 on its previous close.

FT  20 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market closes the week in good
form - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK equities shrugged off the debilitating effects of weak international bond
markets, as the big institutions preferred to concentrate on the positive
news on the domestic economy rather than outside influences.
But there was no denying that a steep decline in German bunds around
lunchtime, and a weak performance by US bonds took some of the shine off the
London market.
UK gilts, which began the session in reasonably good shape, were sold off in
mid-session after news that a leading member of the Bundesbank Council said
he was keen to keep German interest at their present levels for the near
future.
Gilts rallied at the close, however, closing around six ticks higher on
balance responding to news that there will be no gilts auction this month.
The FT-SE 100 index closed 8.8 higher on the session at 3,191.4, thereby
extending the rise on the week to one of 49.1. The FT-SE Mid 250 index,
which had been left behind the senior FT-SE index for much of the week,
staged a rapid advance, thanks largely to a scintillating performance by the
utilities areas of the market.
The regional electricity sector, easily the market's outstanding performer
both before and after the electricity distribution review, galloped ahead
with the Scottish generators and Northern Ireland Electricity, left behind
by the English recs, catching the eye of the big institutional buyers.
Panmure Gordon, the stockbroker, was again an aggressive supported of
Scottish Hydro. Dealers said the big bull points in the recs included
potential share buy backs, the probable sale of their stakes in the National
Grid and increasing talk of the likelihood of stakebuilding and takeover
bids in the sector.
Turnover in equities jumped to a week's high of 853.3m shares, with
non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounting for a much higher than usual 75 per cent of
activity, largely thanks to a big cross in Dragon Oil, one of the market's
penny stocks. turnover in Dragon was recorded at 263m shares, or 30 per cent
of overall share volume.
The value of customer business in the market on Thursday was recorded as
Pounds 1.58bn, well up on recent levels.
Share prices weakened at the outset of trading with marketmakers happy to
chop their opening levels after a fairly hefty decline on Wall Street
overnight, but quickly encountered support as the FT-SE future began to pick
up and a number of marketmakers moved in to fill in some worrying short
positions. But it was clear that the real upward push in the market came in
the utilities areas. The expiry of index options was also seen as one of the
driving forces in the market.
The market moved into positive territory as the index options expired and
thereafter made gradual progress, shrugging off the setback in gilts at the
same time.
There was no real lead for London from the US where Wall Street had posted a
minor gain shortly after London closed.
Equity market strategists continued to adopt a positive view of recent
economic developments. Mr Richard Jeffrey at Charterhouse Tilney, the
stockbroker, said: 'The equity market is in excellent shape; the only
problem is the gilts market which doesn't seem to believe the inflation
story in the UK. It is difficult to see equities making any significant
progress until gilt yields fall by at least 50 points.' Mr Jeffrey said he
remained happy with his year-end forecast of 3,600 on the FT-SE 100.
Mr Jeffrey said he expected the public sector borrowing requirement for the
year to undershoot, coming out in the low Pounds 30bns against a Government
target in the high Pounds 30bns. 'The UK economy is probably the best
performing economy of any of the leading international economies, ' he
added.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Dollar wobbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US dollar yesterday lost further ground on the foreign exchanges as
negative sentiment towards the US currency persisted, writes Philip Gawith.
Despite repeated Bank of Japan intervention during Asian trading, the dollar
ebbed lower to close in London at Y98.475 from Y99.025. Against the D-Mark,
it finished at DM1.5396 from DM1.5456.
Elsewhere attention was focused on the Swedish krona, as the market awaited
details of the opposition social democratic party's budget savings plan. The
figure of a SKr61bn cut over four years was well received by the market, and
the krona closed in London at SKr5.008 from SKr5.048.
After losing a pfennig during early trade, sterling firmed slightly to close
at DM2.3836 from DM2.3889.
There was no fresh data for the dollar to respond to, but Mr Avinash
Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan (Europe), said its renewed
weakness 'was a reminder that it is the level of rates that matters, rather
than the process of raising them, so long as the level is seen as
inappropriate.'
He noted also that the incentives currently for Japanese investors to buy
dollar assets was low. The rate differential between US and Japan is
currently only 300 basis points, historically the minimum level required to
get Japanese investors into the dollar. This is insufficient when set
against the risks of further trade tensions, with the September 30 deadline
in procurement talks looming.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at the Bank of America in London, said
the dollar, like various European currencies, was reflecting political
issues. Whereas President Clinton's authority is under assault, Chancellor
Kohl in Germany has seen his ratings improve considerably since the turn of
the year.
'Politics are now almost as big an issue as the numbers and interest rates,'
said Mr Hawkins.
Sterling failed to profit from a better than expected set of trade figures.
The July deficit with non-EU states was Pounds 418m, compared to a market
expectation of about Pounds 600m.
Mr Hawkins noted that current sterling weakness was overwhelmingly a
residual effect of movements in dollar/D-Mark, rather than a case of
independent currency weakness. Recent good inflation data, however, which
have probably delayed the prospect of higher rates in the UK, could have
contributed to market disappointment in the pound.
The average rate of discount at the weekly treasury bill tender fell to
5.254 per cent from 5.375 per cent. In the cash market sterling three month
LIBOR slipped to 5 7/16 from 5 1/2 .
Mr Ross Jones, a director at Gerrard and National, said the current
difference between cash and futures market rates was 'staggering'. The
December short sterling contract finished at 93.38, seven basis points up on
the day, but still discounting 135 basis point rise in rates by the end of
the year.
Mr Jones commented: 'I don't think there is a need for a rise in rates this
year on any grounds.'
In its daily operations, the Bank of England provided Pounds 425m assistance
at established rates compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 600m.
Overnight money traded between 4 and 5 per cent.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): LME gains erased as
stocks rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Metal Exchange contracts generally lost most or all of their earlier
modest gains yesterday following the announcement of increases in stocks
held in exchange registered warehouses.
The exception was aluminium, which was able to hold steady on news of a
9,525 stocks fall, although that was somewhat less than had been expected.
For this metal, however, the gains of Wednesday and Thursday had only
cancelled out the falls of the previous two days, which revealed strong
support around the Dollars 1,470-a-tonne mark for three months delivery
metal. At yesterday's close the three months price stood at Dollars 1,489.50
a tonne, down Dollars 1 on the week.
In contrast copper, the LME's flagship contract, had been testing the upper
limits of its recent trading range.
Building on last week's modest rally the three months price attempted on
Thursday and yesterday morning to break decisively through overhead
resistance at Dollars 2,420 a tonne. But these forays faltered at Dollars
2,435 and Dollars 2,427 respectively, the second after the LME announced
that there had been a 5,475-tonne rise in warehouse stocks, the seventh in a
row. That took the stocks figure to 353,575 tonnes, up 14,975 so far this
month.
By the close three months copper was down to Dollars 2,407.50 a tonne,
Dollars 5 lower on the week, and that helped to knock the stuffing out other
LME contracts.
Only lead ended the week with a net rise - of Dollars 5.75 to Dollars 581 a
tonne for three months delivery - reflecting general recognition of its
sound fundamentals and the approach of the northern hemisphere winter, boom
time for the replacement car battery market. But reaction to copper's fall
and to its own continuing stocks rise had resulted in a Dollars 11.50 fall
yesterday, confounding traders hopes that the price might soon regain the
Dollars 600-plus levels last seen on August 4.
At the London bullion market meanwhile the gold price extended last week's
sell-off before staging a cautious rally. The low of Dollars 376.25 a troy
ounce was reached on Tuesday, but by yesterday's close it was up to Dollars
382.10, a gain of Dollars 4.60 overall.
After support had held at the low speculative buyers, who thought the market
had become oversold, were encouraged by a US interest rate rise, traders
explained. And after a later break through resistance between Dollars 378
and Dollars 379 they began to think in terms of a renewed assault on the
Dollars 383 level above which the last rally stalled, although that hurdle
looked 'formidable'.
The London Commodity Exchange coffee market was firing on all cylinders at
the start of the week as it caught up with the previous Friday night's news
of an unexpectedly bullish US Department of Agriculture estimate of
June/July frost damage to the 1995-96 Brazilian crop. It put the total loss
at between 30 and 40 per cent, close to an earlier Brazilian government
assessment and at the top end of the range suggested by market analysts.
In response the November delivery futures price at the LCE shot up Dollars
157 on Monday and added another Dollars 55 on Tuesday morning, reaching
Dollars 3,485 a tonne. But by then the market had had enough. Starved of
further bullish news, speculators started to take their profits and by last
night's close close the price had been marked down to Dollars 3,315, having
regained, on balance, just Dollars 45 of last week's Dollars 277
retrenchment.

FT  20 AUG 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wool prices have continued to advanced on a broad front, and as auctions
have been resumed in the new selling season the pace has tended to
accelerate. There are variations between sectors. Finer merinos are in short
supply, and remaining stocks held in the official Australian stockpile are
low. Demand meanwhile is building up with fashion one factor, and
anticipation of shortages to come another. The world crossbred wool
situation is also obviously firmer with supplies and stocks seen as liable
to fall short of demand. Only with middle micron merinos is the Australian
stockpile seen as a holding factor, and this is not enough to prevent price
rises here also. Wool international's Eastern states market indicator closed
706 cents yesterday, compared with 693 a week ago. The spices report was not
available for this edition.

FT  20 AUG 94 / International Company News: Dramatic turnround at
Saab-Scania
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saab-Scania, the Swedish vehicle and aerospace group controlled by the
Wallenberg family, yesterday announced a dramatic surge in earnings in the
first half of the year. It posted a pre-tax profit, after financial items,
of SKr1.2bn (Dollars 153.8m) after a pro-forma loss of SKr264m in the same
period last year, writes Hugh Carnegy.
The group said it expected earnings in the second half to be even stronger
than in the first, when a leap in sales and earnings in its Scania truck
division was the driving force.
A return to profit at half-owned Saab Automobile will not be included until
the full-year report.
The results will prove encouraging to Investor, the Wallenberg holding
company which took over 100 per cent of Saab-Scania in 1991 as a cash
generator, but then saw its earnings subside. Investor is due to report its
half-year results next week.
Saab-Scania's results, which restated last year's figures to reflect
accounting changes, showed that group sales rose to SKr14.46bn in the first
half, from SKr11.91bn last time. Operating income before depreciation jumped
to SKr2.14bn from SKr699m.
Sales in the Scania division, which includes the truck operations, rose to
SKr12.37bn from SKr9.26bn, as demand for trucks in western Europe grew by 10
per cent. In Brazil, the growth figure was 25 per cent and in Argentina it
was no less than 80 per cent.
Orders in the first half rose 50 per cent to 18,600 trucks and buses from
12,300. Operating profits for the division soared to SKr1.6bn from SKr173m.
The picture was, however, less encouraging in the Aircraft and Defence
division. Sales at Saab Defence, which include the new JAS 39 Gripen
all-purpose fighter aircraft, fell to SKr1.56bn from SKr1.73bn. Sales in
Saab Aircraft, which include the Saab 340 and Saab 2000 regional airliners,
tumbled to SKr486m from SKr1.05bn.
Overall, sales in the Aircraft and Defence division fell to SKr2.09bn from
SKr2.64bn, and there was an operating loss of SKr200m compared with a loss
of SKr156m in the same period last year.

FT  20 AUG 94 / International Company News: Goodman Fielder board studies
call for overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Goodman Fielder, the embattled Australian food group, is due to
meet today to discuss its response to the requisitioning of an extraordinary
general meeting by three big institutional shareholders and Mr Doug Shears,
a Melbourne-based businessman. Mr Shears acquired a small interest in
Goodman when he sold his Uncle Toby's group to Goodman in 1992.
The unhappy investors - who include the Australian Mutual Provident, Bankers
Trust and the State Authorities Superannuation Board - are seeking to
overhaul the Goodman board.
Their requisition notice suggested that two executive directors - Mr Barry
Weir, managing director, and Mr Michael Brown, finance director - be
reappointed, but that votes been taken over the removal of the remaining
seven incumbents.
The dissidents have put forward four potential replacement names. These
include Mr Neil Lister, an executive with one of Mr Shears' companies; Mr
John Keniry, a former Goodman executive; Mr Jon Petersen, formerly with
Mars' Asian division; and Mr Ken Nielsen, a former chairman of Unilever
Australia.
Goodman Fielder was built up through a series of acquisitions during the
late 1970s and 1980s under its former New Zealand-based chairman, Mr Pat
Goodman. Today, it spans businesses ranging from food ingredients such as
gelatine to cereal-based foods such as pasta and bread.
Although a large player in some local markets - such as bakeries - it has
posted poor returns recently. Net profit before abnormals was ADollars
117.2m (USDollars 86.8m) in the year to end-June 1993, on sales of almost
ADollars 4bn. The previous year's figure was ADollars 108.1m.
Despite speculation that Goodman could be ripe for takeover, no industry
buyer has stepped forward.
Earlier this year, Mr Barry Weir - who took over as managing director in
December - told shareholders the group was aiming for long-term margins of
between 9 and 10 per cent across all businesses.

<TEXT>
Norsk Hydro and Texaco yesterday announced plans to form a joint-venture
marketing company to bolster their position in the Scandinavian petroleum
products market.
By combining their service station networks, the companies say they will
hold 20 per cent of the Norwegian gasoline market and 17 per cent of the
Danish market. They will also have a significant presence in the diesel and
heating fuel markets.
Each partner will hold 50 per cent of the new company, which is expected to
become operational on January 1 1995.
The venture aims to draw on Hydro's strong Scandinavian presence and
Texaco's international experience and marketing expertise.
It excludes the companies' other Scandinavian interests, including the North
Sea and Scanraff refinery in Sweden. Texaco will continue to market its
aviation and marine fuels and lubricants in Scandinavia separately.
Mr Torstein Bergem, Norsk Hydro executive vice-president, said: 'The
proposed joint venture will enable us to successfully meet the challenges of
the increasingly competitive Danish and Norwegian markets.'
Texaco said the project was in line with its worldwide plan to cut costs and
strengthen core businesses.

FT  20 AUG 94 / International Company News: Lufthansa on course to resume
paying dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lufthansa, the German flag-carrying airline, said it expected to make an
operating profit this year and confirmed earlier suggestions that it would
resume dividend payments.
The company, which last paid a dividend on ordinary shares in 1989, updated
earlier estimates and reported pre-tax earnings for the first six months of
DM105m (Dollars 68.2m) compared with a DM221m deficit last time.
Higher sales had been reflected in increased earnings for the first time in
years, it said. The same applied to average yields in passenger traffic.
Lufthansa, which is preparing for the first tranche of a two-stage rights
issue in the next few weeks, is still majority-owned by the German
government. However, Bonn has said it will dilute its holding by not taking
up its rights, in accordance with its privatisation plans.
The airline has been a strong favourite in the German stock market lately,
as news of its progress has dribbled out. After crashing to losses of DM426m
in 1991, and deficits of DM390m in 1992 and DM92m last year, analysts expect
it to earn between DM100m and DM200m net this year.
According to the company, a 7.8 per cent cut in the workforce, coupled with
increased sales had lifted productivity per employee by 18 per cent over the
same part of 1993.
Labour costs fell 4 per cent and, although the number of flights rose 7.5
per cent, fuel costs fell. The group, which includes the Condor charter
fleet, carried 17.6m passengers in the review period, a rise of 3 per cent.
Freight tonnage, a particularly strong performer at its home base in
Frankfurt airport, rose 18 per cent.
In a separate development, local politicians said the Frankfurt city
authorities might be prepared to sell part of their 28.9 per cent stake in
Frankfurt airport.
Although the Social Democrat administration remains sceptical about
privatisation, budget constraints and falling tax revenues have forced it to
seek other sources of income.
Other main stakeholders in the airport are the government of the state of
Hesse, with 45.2 per cent, and the federal government with 25.9 per cent.

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hongkong Bank yesterday launched its maiden floating-rate certificates of
deposit (CDs), raising a minimum HKDollars 1bn to secure medium rate
funding.
The CDs are likely to become the first private debt issue eligible as
collateral to the discount window run by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,
the colony's de facto central bank.
Ultimately, this should enable the bank to raise funds at more favourable
terms, as the CDs may be able to be to be used in sale and repurchase
agreements (repos). The bank would need to secure an A- rating for the CDs
before the HKMA will accept its bid. If Hongkong Bank is successful in
securing the rating, this would be the first issue by a commercial bank to
be accepted as Repos.
Bankers expect the final size of the issue, which marks the colony's biggest
deposit-taker's first floating-rate CD market, to swell to double or even
treble the original HKDollars 1bn.
The three-year CDs will be priced at 25 basis points above the one-month
Hong Kong interbank offered rate (Hibor), which stood at 4.8 per cent
yesterday.
The HKMA amended its rules in March, paving the way for certain instruments
other than exchange fund bills and notes and government bonds to be used as
collateral for the liquidity adjustment facility.
Hongkong Bank last tapped the debt markets in a big way last November, when
it raised HKDollars 3bn through a 10-year subordinated collared
floating-rate note. Hang Seng Bank, the Hong Kong banking subsidiary of
HSBC, tapped the CD market for HKDollars 2.2bn in May this year.

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Reliance Industries, the textiles and petrochemicals conglomerate, boosted
first-quarter sales by 25 per cent, and is confident of improved results for
the year.
Mr Dhirubhai Ambani, chairman and managing director, told the annual meeting
yesterday that sales rose to Rs16.48bn (Dollars 525.3m) compared with the
first quarter of last year.
'Reliance has emerged as India's largest corporation in terms of sales,
gross profit, net profit, net worth and assets,' Mr Ambani said. He added
that India's liberalisation programme had given the company 'unprecedented
freedom to set new and even more ambitious goals', meaning there had been
'an all-round improvement' in the group's performance.
Reliance achieved a record total income of Rs54.61bn last year, with a net
profit of Rs5.75bn on sales of Rs53.45bn, compared with last year's profit
of Rs3.22bn on sales of Rs41.06bn.
Mr Ambani said the Rs50bn expansion programme, most of which was dedicated
to the construction of new plants at Reliance's Hazira petrochemicals
complex, could allow the the company to emerge as a 'world ranking player'.
The first of the new plants is expected to commence production from early
1995, increasing the company's production capacity to 6m tonnes from 1.4m
tonnes.
Reliance's capacity for the production of polyester will increase to 550,000
tonnes a year from 200,000 tonnes, making it one of the top 10 polyester
producers in the world. The company's petrochemicals complex at Jamnagar in
Gujarat will house the world's largest paraxylene facility. Production
capacity of this feedstock material will rise to 1.38m tonnes a year.

FT  20 AUG 94 / International Company News: Highland Gold hit by lower
production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Highland Gold, the Papua New Guinea-based mining company controlled by
Queensland's MIM group, said profits in the year to end-June fell to K21.6m
(Dollars 22.9m), compared with K26.3m in the previous year, reports Nikki
Tait.
The downturn was largely blamed on lower production from the large Porgera
gold mine, in PNG's Enga province, in which Highlands has a one-quarter
interest. Higher production costs there also contributed to the fall.
Highlands' revenues in the year amounted to K107.5m. Its share of Porgera
gold production was 294,417 ounces at an average realised price of USDollars
369 per oz.
There were no abnormal items, either in 1993-94 or 1992-93, and operating
profits last year stood at K35.8m kina against K49.9m.

Wooltru, the South African food and clothing retailer, boosted net income 68
per cent to R255.7m (Dollars 71.6m) in the year to June 30 from R151.8m a
year ago, reports Mark Suzman in Johannesburg.
Sales grew 20 per cent to R6.68bn from R5.56bn, while net income before tax
rose 57 per cent to R389.8m from R247.6m last year. The dividend was raised
40 per cent to 28 cents, up from 20 cents.
Mr Colin Hall, chief executive, expects the company's strong growth to
continue. 'The results are excellent. All the divisions have performed very
well indeed,' he said.
The growth came from all three main divisions, with flagship Woolworths
leading the way with a 21 per cent advance. It attributed this to improved
systems and logistics and the successful introduction of an in-house charge
card to all stores.
The company has decided to issue the final dividend of 18 cents in the form
of scrip by way of a capitalisation issue rather than a cash payingment.

Mr George Soros, the international investor, has taken a 9 per cent stake in
Banco de Colombia, one of Colombia's biggest banks, Reuter reports from
Bogota.
The shares were acquired from Bancol, which controls the bank, according to
a Bancol source.
A source at Citivalores, the Colombian brokerage which carried out the
transaction on the Bogota stock market, said the deal involved Bancol
selling approximately 9 per cent of Banco de Colombia stock for about
Dollars 62.5m.
Bancol, which is a holding company controlled by the Gilinski family, bought
75 per cent of Banco de Colombia from the Colombian government when the bank
was privatised at the start of the year.
Last May, the Gilinskis applied to the Colombian Securities Superintendency
for authorisation to sell a stake of up to 9.5 per cent in the bank.

FT  20 AUG 94 / International Company News: Varig loss doubles to Dollars
245m

<TEXT>
Varig, the Brazilian airline, reported a loss of Dollars 245m for the first
half of 1994, more than double the Dollars 117m deficit for the same period
last year.
Brazil's economic problems, continued high operating expenses and leasing
and interest costs were largely responsible for the deterioration, Varig
said.
Varig launched a financial restructuring in March, suspending payments on 50
leased aircraft and returning five, and renegotiating lease agreements. It
also announced the loss of 2,600 jobs.
However, in the first half of the year the company's financial costs
increased by Dollars 24m, to Dollars 145m, compared with the same period
last year, while flight operating costs increased by Dollars 59m, to Dollars
695m. Varig also highlighted an exchange-rate loss of Dollars 37m, caused by
the appreciation of the yen against the dollar.
On Tuesday the company, which is controlled by an employees' foundation,
announced it would be offering seats on its board to creditors General
Electric and McDonnell Douglas in return for help in restructuring a Dollars
600m Eximbank-financed debt. It will also offer a seat to a representative
of its Brazilian creditor banks, to which it owes about Dollars 250m in
short- term financing.
According to Varig, the restructuring measures will represent annual savings
of Dollars 300m by 1996.
The company says it is making an operating profit on its domestic routes,
where it has a 50 per cent market share, but is losing money on
international flights due to overcapacity and fierce competition from US
airlines.

FT  20 AUG 94 / International Company News: Pioneer sees signs of profits
recovery
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pioneer, the Japanese maker of audio and video products, believes it is on
the way to recovery after a series of operating losses blamed on the strong
yen, domestic recession and price-cutting by competitors.
Foreign exchange gains and royalty income, together worth nearly Y2.7bn
(Dollars 27.2m), enabled Pioneer to report a marginal group net profit of
Y257m for the first quarter ended June, down steeply from the previous
Y6.86bn. Last year's quarterly figure was larger than the Y6.57bn achieved
for the whole of the year, as the profits decline deepened through 1993.
Pioneer is curtailing capital spending by a further 2.5 per cent, to
Y28.3bn, this year. However, it is boosting research and development outlays
by a modest Y200m to reach Y29.9bn, as its seeks new products to stimulate
consumer demand.
The group warned of 'stiff and unrelenting competition in our major
markets', and said the direction of the Japanese economy and the yen were
uncertain. However, it is forecasting Y8bn in consolidated net profits for
the year.
First-quarter sales fell 6.6 per cent to Y116.3bn, with domestic and
overseas demand both down. Video products were up 4.9 per cent, but car
electronics, its biggest sector, showed a 9.5 per cent decline.
Sales of audio-visual software such as compact discs dived 35.1 per cent in
the absence of hit records. The sector, which the company separated out
yesterday for the first time, contributed Y8.85bn, less than one-tenth of
all revenues.
The decline in profits was made more acute by the inclusion last time of a
Y4.88bn extraordinary credit reflecting a change in tax accounting. Stripped
of that, quarterly net earnings per share a year ago were Y11.02 compared
with Y1.43 in the latest three months.

FT  20 AUG 94 / International Company News: Saab Auto returns to the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Saab Automobile, the Swedish carmaker, yesterday reported its first
quarterly profit for five years. It was also the first profit under the
management of General Motors of the US, which became joint owner of the
company with Sweden's Saab-Scania in late 1989.
Saab said a sharp rise in sales, reduced costs, and the weakness of the
Swedish krona were the factors behind a SKr726m (Dollars 93m) turnround to a
SKr203m pre-tax profit in the second quarter from a SKr523m loss in the same
period last year. The second-quarter surge also produced a first-half
pre-tax profit of SKr104m, against a SKr684m loss in the first half of 1993.
The company said it was 'on track' to make a modest full-year profit in 1994
after five successive years of losses. The total deficit since GM bought in
and took over the management was more than SKr11bn. During that time, GM and
Saab-Scania, which is part of the Wallenberg family empire, have pumped more
than SKr8bn in new capital into the company to keep it afloat.
This year has at last brought an upturn, with unit sales rising 26 per cent
to 45,200 in the first half from 35,800 in the same period of 1993. Combined
with the fall in value of the krona, this pushed sales in the first half up
to SKr8.75bn from SKr7.75bn.
With the workforce cut in half, to 7,900, over the past few years, Saab's
break-even level is now around 83,000 unit sales a year: it expects to sell
94,000 cars this year, compared with 73,600 last year, a record low.
A large part of the turnround is attributable to the Saab 900 model launched
last year, which drew heavily on GM components and was billed as the car
that would make or break the company. It accounted for 27,500 of the
first-half unit sales, while the bigger and older Saab 9000 accounted for
17,700.
Saab said sales in the US, its biggest market, rose to 10,837 units in the
first half from 9,400 last year. This upward trend should continue in the
second half, as sales of the recently-launched 900 cabriolet model take off.
Meanwhile, a rebound in the Swedish new car market sent Saab sales at home
soaring to 9,268 units in the first half from 4,878 last year.

FT  20 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Thomas Jourdan recovery continues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Thomas Jourdan, the maker and marketer of consumer goods, continued its
recovery in the first half of 1994 with operating losses on continuing
businesses falling from Pounds 146,000 to Pounds 40,000.
However, after charging Pounds 3.65m this time for goodwill previously
written off to reserves and Pounds 221,000 closure costs for two businesses
 -Woodstock Furniture and Corby France - the pre-tax deficit came out at
Pounds 4.17m, against Pounds 465,000 restated for FRS 3.
Mr Keith Whitten, chairman, pointed out that the goodwill write-off had had
no effect on either cash or shareholders' funds and added that the combined
closure costs of the two subsidiaries were at the lower end of his earlier
estimates.
As a supplier to the retail trade, the bulk of turnover and all profits
would be earned in the second half, in the period before Christmas, he
explained.
'Our companies are in general trading significantly better than last year,
in what is still a very modest improvement in demand for consumer products
over the market as a whole.'
First-half sales on continuing operations were Pounds 8.97m (Pounds 8.36m)
and losses per share on the same basis came to 0.89p (1.49p). A maintained
interim dividend of 0.5p has been declared.
Gearing at 46 per cent was substantially unchanged from last June's level -
the increase from the December level of 19 per cent reflected the usual
seasonal movement.

FT  20 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Union International calls in receiver at
New Zealand arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL and SIMON DAVIES

<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union International, the food processor and distributor controlled by the
Vestey family, has called in a receiver for Weddel, its lossmaking New
Zealand business, after it was unable to get bankers to support
restructuring plans.
Up to 3,500 people employed at the company's four plants, were yesterday
told they no longer had jobs. The shut down marks one of the biggest loss of
jobs in New Zealand's industrial history.
It also marks the end of an association between the Vestey family and the
New Zealand meat industry that goes back to 1900.
Mr Terry Robinson, chief executive, described the move as 'very sad'. He
said Union had endeavoured to push through a group restructuring which could
have returned the business to profit, but could not get the necessary
short-term financing.
The New Zealand business had been ring fenced, and its collapse will have no
meaningful impact on the parent company.
The Weddel group has four large works which slaughtered 10 per cent of the
country's sheep and 15 per cent of the beef cattle. It was the fourth
biggest meat processor and exporter in the country.
Mr Robinson said the company had made a profit of close to NZDollars 20m
(Pounds 7.8m) in the year to September 1992, but had since been hit by
overcapacity in the industry, and slackening demand from the US.
Mr Alan Isaac, the receiver, said Weddel's problems were similar to those of
the rest of the industry: too much slaughter capacity for a dwindling amount
of stock, too much competition, and adverse exchange rate movements.
He said Weddel had secured debt of NZDollars 170m and unsecured creditors,
including staff and farmers, who were owed NZDollars 35m.
Mr Isaac is also acting as receiver for Fortex, another large meat processor
which collapsed five months ago with losses of about NZDollars 160m.
A Weddel statement said that every effort had been made to restructure the
company. Earlier this year Union abandoned attempts to float part of it
through the New Zealand Stock Exchange.
Union has had its own financial difficulties, and under a standstill
arrangement with its bankers in 1992 it was unable to provide capital for
its New Zealand subsidiary.
Union's debt peaked at Pounds 420m, but following the agreement with its
banks in 1992 it has pursued a policy of asset disposals. In 1993 it sold
Pounds 100m of businesses in the UK, Brazil and Australia and at the end of
1993 it had net debt of Pounds 124.6m.

FT  20 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Brewers' spirits gain more froth - Some
optimism is returning to the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like their summer ales, brewery executives have been in a lighter mood in
recent months. The decline in beer sales is showing signs of slowing, and
the wholesale price wars which have pulverised the industry are begining to
abate.
News last week that both the Treasury and a parliamentary committee are to
examine the rate of excise duty - the industry's current big bug-bear - has
added further froth to brewers' spirits.
'A small amount of optimism is beginning to creep into the industry,'
conceded Mr Anthony Fuller, chairman of Fuller Smith &amp; Turner, the
London-based brewer. 'It's early days yet, but things might be on the turn.'
The picture has been brightened by the hot summer weather, giving some
relief to the embattled pub trade and accelerating sales at off-licences,
which were also lifted by an increase during the World Cup.
Although beer sales are forecast to fall again in 1994 as a whole,
continuing the trend of the past 15 years, the decline is slowing. In 1983,
UK beer consumption stood at 38.3m barrels. Last year, it had slipped to
35.6m, with industry forecasts for the current year down at about 35.2m.
Kleinwort Benson, the stockbroker, predicts that the 1.6 per cent
year-on-year fall in sales seen in the past five years will ease to 1 per
cent this year. It says these will continue for several years hence as
cultural and demographic changes continue to affect the industry.
'Basically, the population is getting older and drinking more wine at home,'
says Mr Andrew Holland, Kleinwort's brewing analyst.
The industry has been slow to adapt to the decline, and excess capacity has
resulted in a vicious price war in the wholesale market. 'The major
companies have nailed their colours to the mast of market share, which
they've been defending whatever the cost,' said Mr David Thompson, managing
director of Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries, the Midlands-based brewer.
'It's still having an adverse effect on margins.'
Mr Holland is moderately more upbeat. 'Things are definitely not getting any
worse. The big brewers now realise that their wholesale pricing policies are
just not working and have to be changed.'
This is likely to mean more brewery closures. In a recent report, SG
Warburg, the merchant bank, suggested that the beer industry producing at 90
per cent capacity was still capable of producing 17 per cent more beer than
it could sell.
Some companies, such as Boddington Group and Greenalls Group, have quit
brewing to concentrate on retailing.
'More capacity will have to come out and I suspect some will not survive the
bloodbath that's been going on,' said Sir Paul Nicholson, chairman of Vaux
Group, the Sunderland-based brewer. 'I remain cautious over any great
recovery.'
Eleven big brewing plants, capable of producing 7m barrels a year have
closed in the past three years.
Courage, which ironically has been the most aggressive in protecting its
market share at the cost of reduced margins, is now being mooted by industry
sources as the most likely candidate to call a halt to pricing hostilities
and reduce capacity.
The combined effect of the price war and falling sales has had dire
consequences in the pub trade. Some 7,000 pubs have shut in the past 10
years, and the closure rate of the remaining 65,000 is expected to
accelerate to as much as 2 per cent a year, according to the Brewers &amp;
Licenced Retailers Association.
However, there is growing optimism in the industry that the increasingly
vociferous campaign to have beer duty reduced in the November budget is at
last being listened to in Whitehall.
The BLRA says it is the high rate of excise tax on beer that has fuelled the
dramatic rise in imports - more than 1m pints a day, it claims - from the
Continent since regulations on allowances were relaxed.
Mr Thompson, at Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley, even suggested that without this
huge rise, UK beer sales would actually be on the increase. 'Without this
relentless pressure from across the Channel, we will not see the big uplift
in demand the industry needs.'
However, industry analysts think their chances are slim. 'The government is
hardly going to cut beer duty at the same time that it is increasing VAT on
fuel for pensioners,' said Mr Geoff Collyer at NatWest Securities. 'It would
be political suicide. The best the brewers can hope for is no duty increase
at all.'

FT  20 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Severn River up 27%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Severn River Crossing, which is building a privately financed bridge via a
UK/French consortium with John Laing-GTM Entrepose as main contractor,
yesterday announced pre-tax profits up 27 per cent from Pounds 6.14m to
Pounds 7.78m in the six months to June 30.
The cable-stayed bridge over the River Severn, one of the largest
construction projects in the UK, was started in April 1992 and the company
said recently that it was on schedule to be completed in spring 1996.
In June this year the company sacked 700 construction workers after a
24-hour strike over pay. Work on the Pounds 300m bridge between England and
Wales stopped for a week but the workers were later re-hired.
The company, which took over the running of the existing Severn Bridge, has
attracted criticism over the tolls being charged.
Turnover for the period was Pounds 18.72m (Pounds 16.41m) and the net profit
Pounds 6.81m (Pounds 4.71m) after a reduced tax charge.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Exceptional charges left Benson Group, the engineering group, with lower
pre-tax profits of Pounds 233,000 for the year to May 31, against Pounds
1.92m. However, before allowing for exceptionals of Pounds 2m profits showed
a 16 per cent rise.
The exceptional charges related to the cost of acquisition and integration
of two companies and the disposal of Wolverhampton Pressings.
Turnover increased by 10 per cent from Pounds 25.8m to Pounds 28.3m, of
which acquisitions contributed Pounds 1.27m. Operating profits rose 13 per
cent to Pounds 2.76m (Pounds 2.45m) with operating margins improving from
9.5 per cent to 9.8 per cent.
There was a cash inflow during the year of Pounds 2.34m (Pounds 655,000).
With Pounds 1m being spent on capital investment and Pounds 1.6m on
acquisitions total debt at the year end was higher at Pounds 5.57m against
Pounds 4.51m, however it was lower than at the half year.
Mr Richard Phillips, chairman, said that as the economic background
improved, growth could be expected in the group's markets.
The products division reported a strong improvement with the environmental
side showing significant growth in turnover and profits.
Higher automotive volumes assisted the results for the components division
where turnover, adjusted for the effect of the Wolverhampton Pressings
disposal, rose by 12 per cent.
Earnings per share fell from 1.45p to 0.18p and the dividend is 0.33p (0.3p)
with a recommended final of 0.23p.
The shares rose 1 1/2p to 16p.

FT  20 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Hozelock profit forecast increased after
hot summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Hozelock yesterday climbed 13p to a post-flotation high of 286p
after the garden equipment manufacturer forecast higher than expected
profits following Britain's hottest summer for more than 10 years.
The company, which came to the market last November at 250p, said the dry
weather had increased demand for products which include sprinklers and pond
pumps.
Although the shares dipped to 232p in March after heavy spring rainfall, the
group said it was set fair for the rest of the year.
'It's been a great summer. Productivity has improved and we've had to retain
temporary workers who would normally have been laid off in June', said Mr
David Codling, the chief executive.
His comments persuaded City analysts to upgrade their full year profit
forecasts from Pounds 6m to Pounds 6.75m.
The group also expects to exploit increased demand with the opening next
month of a new Pounds 8.5m factory at Sutton Coldfield, in the Midlands.
Mr Codling said the plant would increase production capacity by 50 per cent
and increase the peak season workforce to more than 700.
Trading in continental Europe, meanwhile, was starting to pick up following
a slow first half.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman of Bristol Scotts, the lossmaking property and leisure group,
has been replaced in the latest stage of a boardroom power struggle.
Mr Anthony Kerman was asked to resign when the board met after the company's
annual meeting on Thursday. He was then removed as chairman on a majority
vote, and Sir Ian Rankin, a shareholder who became a non-executive director
in December, was elected as his successor.
Mr Kerman had been re-elected by the annual meeting and remains a director,
as does his father Mr Isidore Kerman and brother Mr Nicholas Kerman. There
are four non-family directors.
Sir Ian was proposed as chairman by Mr Ian Stevens, a substantial
shareholder who also joined the board last December. In 1993 the company
incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 246,073.
The company also announced that it was holding talks with parties interested
in buying its Eastgate Retail Park property. A further announcement would be
made should contracts be exchanged.

FT  20 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Tiphook directors' pay rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The directors of Tiphook, the transport leasing company, fared better than
their employer last year, with total remuneration climbing from Pounds 3.96m
to Pounds 6.41m in the year that Tiphook lost Pounds 331m.
The annual report, released yesterday, reveals that Mr Robert Montague, the
founder and chief executive, was the highest paid of the directors, with a
bonus of Pounds 250,000 helping push his total pay from Pounds 1.17m to
Pounds 1.34m.
Mr Montague, who recently stepped down as chairman, has agreed to a
substantial cut in pay from an Pounds 816,000 package down to Pounds 200,000
as of March, but will receive a total minimum bonus of Pounds 250,000 over
the next five years.
Mr Montague also agreed, as part of Tiphook's sale of its container leasing
business to TransAmerica, that he would not compete with their container
operations for five years. The latest bonus was agreed in order to
recompense him for this agreement.

FT  20 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Somerfield at Pounds 33.5m following
restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Somerfield, the supermarket group formerly Gateway, said yesterday it hoped
for a stock exchange flotation within the next few years, as it reported
pro-forma pre-tax profits of Pounds 33.5m for the 53 weeks to April 30.
The results are the first since the financial restructuring of the
Isosceles/Gateway group last July. There are no comparative figures.
However, the profit, after interest charges of Pounds 32.8m, was the first
post-interest profit the group has made since running into financial
difficulties in the early 1990s, and suggested it was staging a recovery.
Before profits of Pounds 300,000 on the sale of fixed assets, the operating
profit was Pounds 66m, on turnover of Pounds 3.11bn.
Mr David Simons, chief executive, said the 'price check' programme of price
reductions the group launched in May last year had led to like-for-like
sales growth, which excludes new stores, of 13 per cent and which was the
highest in the industry.
He said like-for-like growth since the year-end was still running at 5 per
cent, in spite of moving into a period of stronger comparative figures from
last year, suggesting there was no need to cut prices further.
'This is the first time in five years we have seen an upturn in sales, and
represents a dramatic turnround,' Mr Simons said.
'We think a fragile equilibrium has returned to the grocery market, and we
have no plans to cut prices further ourselves. But we will definitely
respond to any moves by our competitors.'
Mr Simons added that the sales increase had lifted Somerfield's market share
from 8.6 per cent to 9.2 per cent.
Capital spending in the year was Pounds 76m, mostly spent on refurbishing
the stores and installing checkout scanning systems.
Some 47 stores had been refitted and converted to the Somerfield name by
April 30 - in addition to 60 stores already trading as Somerfield.
A further 40 stores had been converted since the year-end, taking the total
to 150. Refitted stores had experienced average sales increases of more than
10 per cent.
The group also opened five Food Giant discount superstores, taking the
number to 26. Mr Simons said the group was talking to a potential partner
from outside the UK about developing the chain further.
In last year's financial restructuring, Somerfield was ring fenced from all
but Pounds 500m of the Pounds 1.4bn debt of its parent, Isosceles. Average
borrowing for Somerfield this year was Pounds 438m.
No dividend is being paid by Somerfield to its parent, but Mr Simons said
this was not required under the restructuring agreement.
'The prime objective is to develop and strengthen the business, get the
profits moving upwards, so we can move to a flotation. We have Pounds 3bn
turnover; we should be a quoted company,' Mr Simons said.
Proceeds of the flotation would be used to reduce Isosceles' debt.
Mr Simons said he could not say when a flotation might take place, but was
hopeful it could be before 1998.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Barbarians at the Great Wall: Tony Walker and Shi Junbao on
attempts to protect the Chinese language from foreign words
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and SHI JUNBAO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China, which has striven in its long history to preserve the purity of its
culture from 'barbarian' influences, appears to be girding itself for
another battle against foreign invaders.
This time, the arbiters of good taste and correct thought are increasingly
concerned about what is seen as a foreign assault on the sanctity of the
Chinese language, both written and spoken.
Writing in the Guangming Daily newspaper this week, Mr Wang Tiekun, director
of the Language Usage Bureau of the State Language Commission - guardian of
the purity of written and spoken Chinese - warned that the adulteration of
language revealed 'people's blind faith in things foreign'.
'One or two exotic words in conversation these days seems immediately to
raise the speaker's status,' he said. 'Fix an exotic (foreign) name on a
home-made product and it becomes a quality item.'
Academic custodians of China's linguistic traditions appear no less
concerned. At Beijing's Normal University, Professor Zhu Jinshun, professor
of Chinese language, noted despairingly that the work of Cang Jie, regarded
as the inventor of China's ideograms or word pictures, was being
contaminated by those taking liberties with the written word.
'It seems there are many would-be Cang Jie's around today,' he observed.
At a deeper level, officials and educationalists worry that the eagerness
with which Chinese are grasping things foreign - from fashion to language -
reveals a crisis of confidence in local culture.
Like France, which has legislated to protect the French language, China is
proposing to do the same with a draft bill, known as the Language and
Characters Law, that would seek to prevent further adulteration of the
written and spoken word. Standards would be laid down for the national
spoken language of putonghua, literally standard Chinese, which is based on
the Beijing dialect. Putonghua was adopted officially as the national
language in 1956 in what China's communist rulers regard as one of their
main contributions to unifying the country.
Written Chinese would also be protected under the law by making it an
offence to use foreign words in official publications, and in the media,
which increasingly has been experimenting with exotic modes of expression.
'Foreign words,' said Mr Yuan Zhongrui of the State Language and Characters
Regulatory Commission, 'should be banned from government reports, text
books, government-sponsored newspapers and children's books.'
But the authorities face enormous difficulties purging written and spoken
language of foreign influence, not least because of the difficulties of
translating everyday technical terms used in the west into Chinese.
For example, Chinese publications have simply begun using the letter 'X'
combined with guang meaning light, to refer to x-rays instead of characters
giving a phonetic approximation of X. Likewise, ultrasound, which is
extremely complicated to represent in Chinese ideograms, is symbolised by
the letter 'B' combined with chao, meaning ultra. Compact disc, which would
require four characters translated as ji guang chang die, literally 'laser
singing disc', has become CD, quality control has become QC, and so on.
The dawning of the age of modern communications in China has also brought
with it words and sounds that defy easy translation. Thus a beeper, which
has become a standard item in telephone-starved China, is referred to as a
'BP' combined with ji, meaning machine. No attempt has been made to
transliterate Motorola, one the main purveyors of beepers which is
pronounced simply 'Motuo-luo-la'.
Among the more susceptible areas of Chinese language are those describing
the night culture that has permeated China's cities since the passing of the
gloomy Mao era. People now simply refer to a bar as a bar, instead of the
traditional jiuba or 'wine shop'. A nightclub is, well, a nightclub, not a
ye zhong hui. The pervasive karaoke bar is represented by Chinese characters
for kala with OK tacked on.
Language purists accuse the advertising industry of being one of the main
culprits in the perversion of written and spoken Chinese, including an
assault on basic grammar. Thus, advertising copywriters are turning
adjectives and nouns into verbs in their effort to get their message across.
For example, it has become fashionable in the advertising trade to employ
the word health as a verb as in 'to health'.
China's arbiters of language blame not only the west for the slide in
standards, but also their brothers and sisters from Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Cantonese soap operas have made a big impact across China, introducing words
like 'mummy' and 'daddy' in place of 'mama' and 'baba' which are
conventional putonghua.
Official attempts to stop the rot do not necessarily find favour with modern
Chinese writers. Wang Shuo, China's most popular modern writer whose earthy
idioms have made him something of a cult figure, is scornful of the
linguistic bureaucrats.
'It's inevitable that more and more foreign words should come into the
language which is ever-changing,' he said. 'Let me ask those who are trying
to safeguard the purity of the Chinese language: what and where is the
purest Chinese? Show me] Even the Beijing word hutong (alleyways that
criss-cross the old city) is borrowed from Mongolian.'
Geremie Barme, an expert in Chinese language and author of books on art,
literature and politics in China, is another who scoffs at the linguistic
puritans. 'The purity of modern Chinese language is a fiction,' he says.
Spoken and written Chinese during communist rule had been deadened by
political jargon from Marxism-Leninism and the accompanying mass propaganda
campaigns. Modern Chinese was 'immature' and tended to be devoid of subtlety
of expression. By contrast, Mr Barme says, the use of language in Hong Kong
and Taiwan is much richer.
In one respect spoken Chinese has resisted foreign influences and that is in
the use of profane language. 'We have many more swear words in Chinese so we
don't need to borrow any more,' said Mr Yuan of the State Language and
Characters Regulatory Commission.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Western funds key to plutonium
storage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER HAYES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Disarmament of nuclear weapons is a very good thing, but it also poses
its own dangers ('Russians deny arms plutonium was theirs', August 16). On
average a nuclear warhead contains 3kg of plutonium and 15kg of highly
enriched uranium (HEU). In total, disarmament is releasing an extra 12
tonnes of plutonium and 60 tonnes of HEU per year.
Regulations governing the civil nuclear industry are rightly very strict.
However, surprisingly, there is no international regulation governing the
disposal and storage of plutonium or HEU retrieved from nuclear bombs. Given
the almost insurmountable problem third world countries have in producing
their own weapons grade material, there must be a strong desire to lay their
hands on the ready made stuff.
In Russia there is no proper long-term storage facility for plutonium.
Stocks are being kept in interim storage facilities, many of which are
totally inadequate from a security and safety perspective. Russia is
designing a proper plutonium waste repository, but it has run into
difficulty in funding the design costs. It is also very doubtful whether the
Russian government will make available the many millions of dollars needed
to see the repository built.
International funding is, therefore, the key question. To their credit, the
Russians have offered the US or the International Atomic Energy Agency the
right to supervise and control how the plutonium is stored, in return for
financial assistance. The latest reports of plutonium smuggling suggest this
is worth pursuing.
The good news relates to the HEU. The Russians have signed a deal, worth
between Dollars 7bn and Dollars 9bn over 20 years, with the US to dilute
HEU. The US plans to use the diluted material as fuel in its reactors, a
real case of swords into ploughs.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Vodka on rocks with bitterness: When the Stolichnaya factory
is ailing, what does it say about Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are troubled times in Russia. Defence factories are at a stand-still,
cholera and anthrax are spreading across the country and gangland-style
executions have become commonplace. But if Russians have one special skill
it is survival, and in these difficult days many have turned to the nation's
traditional source of solace: one-shot glasses of chilled Stolichnaya vodka,
followed by salty fish on a piece of rye bread.
This week, even that sacred sanctum has been breached. Kristall, the factory
which produces Stolichnaya, has been declared bankrupt by the government.
'This is absurd,' says Mr Vladimir Iamnikov, director of Kristall, puffing
on a Marlboro cigarette and glancing at the bottles of Stolichnaya and 70
other hard liquors the plant produces, which decorate his office.
Mr Iamnikov is convening by telephone other anti-reformist factory
directors, and their supporters, to a war council to fight this latest piece
of government perfidy. 'We are Russia's flagship vodka factory and vodka is
the heart of everything which is Russian,' Mr Iamnikov rages. 'This
bankruptcy proceeding is incomprehensible to us and to everyone else as
well.'
In fact, the government's Federal Bankruptcy Agency has started proceedings
against Kristall because of the debts it has incurred. The agency, staffed
by many market reformers, is eager to clamp down on inefficient state
enterprises - Kristall is 51 per cent government-owned - and impose
private-sector financial discipline.
Bankruptcy proceedings act as an ultimatum: either the current management
shakes itself up, or the concern's assets will be sold to private investors.
With the announcement that Kristall is in the red, the bankruptcy agency's
guerrilla war against Russia's ailing enterprises has hit the headlines as
well as the heart (or liver) of Russia. One western banker says: 'Vodka
producers have traditionally been more precious to the country than even
huge, powerful companies like (energy company) Gasprom.'
This explains why 'the Kristall affair' is taking on a significance greater
than a single vodka factory with 1,000 employees would otherwise merit. It
has turned into a test of the government's resolve in taking on factory
directors who have become used to running their operations in old,
inefficient Soviet fashion.
Mr Iamnikov says his only problem is the febrile imaginations of the
government's market reformers. His factory's debts - put at 7bn roubles by
the bankruptcy agency - are reasonable, he argues. He admits that Kristall
is operating at only 30 per cent of its capacity but says government taxes,
which he claims amount to 92 per cent of his vodka's sale price, have hit
demand. Mr Iamnikov concedes Stolichnaya faces tough price competition from
cheaper foreign vodkas: costing 2,300 roubles in Moscow - a little more than
a dollar - per half litre bottle, Stolichnaya is expensive by Russian
standards.
But Mr Iamnikov hints at darker motives behind the government's decision.
'They tell me I must sell off the recreation club for my workers to pay off
part of the debt, but I know what they really want,' he says. 'They want to
get their hands on the club so they can transform it into a casino and a
place to meet pretty working girls. That's all these 'reforms' have brought
us.'
Government officials counter that Mr Iamnikov has to explain how a vodka
producer in Russia can possibly lose money. 'Something not quite right is
going on at that factory,' says Mr Dmitri Vasiliev, deputy director of the
state privatisation agency, parent organisation of the bankruptcy agency.
'It's one thing when a factory which produces widgets is declared bankrupt -
we have hundreds of them in Russia which should be shut down. But vodka is a
liquid asset in Russia. It's as good as money, because the market can never
get enough of it.'
State officials want to investigate why the factory has invested soheavily
in gleaming new Italian production equipment, and question its high
distribution and marketing costs. Mr Narad Sarkisian, the director at the
bankruptcy agency responsible for Kristall, admits that the action taken
against the plant is sensitive: 'For Russia, saying that Kristall is
bankrupt has the same effect that the announcement that Mercedes had gone
broke would have in Germany.'
A former professor of aviation engineering with a degree in higher
mathematics, Mr Sarkisian embodies the low-key, technocratic ethos of his
agency and is perturbed by the public passion the Kristall affair is
generating. He says that the state will first try to convince the factory's
managers to 'act like real executives'. But if re-education fails, Mr
Sarkisian says, 'we are the owners and we can do what we like: even fire the
director or sell some of our shares.'
Kristall, he is convinced, has potential to grow and become profitable. But
to realise its strengths, the factory will need to do more than just adopt a
hard-headed financial approach.
Notwithstanding its traditionally cherished place in Russian life, Kristall,
which sells 95 per cent of its output in Russia, is not only losing price
wars with importers: the row over its impending bankruptcy is adding to a
growing image problem.
When Moscow's nouveaux riches visit the city's restaurants and night clubs,
they are increasingly ordering Absolut, a Swedish vodka, rather than
Stolichnaya and the truly au courant avoid vodka altogether.
'Newly rich people who want to prove that they can afford anything, prefer
imported liquors,' Mr Iamnikov admits sadly. As western visitors leave his
office he enjoins them: 'Drink Stolichnaya - not those inferior foreign
whiskeys.'

FT  20 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Going rate' preferred to performance
pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RUPERT WILLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Martin Wolf's 'Productivity and pay' (Economic Eye, August 15) did an
excellent job of debunking the damaging conventional wisdom that increases
in a company's productivity should lead to increases in the wages that it
pays.
After 15 years of Conservative politicians telling us that the 'going rate
for the job' was in fact outmoded, it was about time that someone pointed
out that a 'going rate' is precisely what the theoretical ideal  - a
perfectly competitive labour market - would generate.
The evidence on pay differentials cited also suggests that deregulation and
decentralisation of pay bargaining have in fact been counter-productive,
reducing the degree to which observed labour market outcomes correspond to
this theoretical ideal.
This is unsurprising. Decentralisation of pay bargaining increases the scope
and need for firms to pay efficiency wages to retain high levels of effort
and to retain the trust and sense of legitimacy in the workplace that are
required to maintain high productivity levels.
If companies cannot point to industry wage norms to establish a legitimate
'going rate', then they are obliged to link pay more closely to the
company's performance, with deleterious effects on the wider economy.
Rather than trying to improve labour market performance by dogmatic
deregulation, we ought perhaps to be trying to develop an institutional
framework that generates efficient outcomes, which 'mimics' the ideal
market, without requiring us to assume that the market for labour operates
in practice in the same way as the market for fish.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: The fewer 'food miles' in the
consumer's basket the better
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL KEATING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his letter to you ('Many 'food miles' apart', August 16) Hugh Raven
introduces the intriguing concept of 'food miles' representing the distance
that agricultural products have travelled before they reach the consumer in
the supermarket.
He feels that anyone concerned about Britain's food trade gap and about the
quality of life in general should take 'food miles' into account before
buying a product.
Does he or any of your readers have a notion as to how, in practical terms,
these could be calculated? What would induce the retailer or supplier to
bother to do so? And would it be possible to devise a scheme, presumably a
variant on those promoted by many airlines, whereby consumers or retailers
benefit from collecting 'food miles', presumably the less the better?

FT  20 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Just abortion in disguise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICHOLAS COOTE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Your leader 'Controlling population' (August 18), emphasising the
empowerment of women and putting into context the effects of population
growth, was most welcome and would be gladly endorsed by the Catholic
church. However, your claim that the Vatican has been encouraging nations to
boycott the UN Cairo conference on population is surprising.
The Vatican itself will attend the conference in its UN observer status, and
indeed has been denounced by some for lobbying national governments to
improve the text of the draft programme of action.
A consensus was reached 10 years ago that abortion should not be admitted as
a way of population control. This does not bar attempts to reverse that
consensus, and the US government, for instance, has relaxed its previous
criteria for aid allocation. The Cairo draft programme has also introduced
the new concepts of reproductive rights and reproductive health, which
reintroduce abortion into family planning under the guise of health
programmes.
The Vatican, and others, have reason to stand by the previous consensus and
resist the new changes suggested.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Built from the bargain basement: Philip Coggan says
price-cutting is accompanying recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are a skirt-wearing, meat-eating shopper with a penchant for
electrical appliances, this has been a good year. Prices of women's clothes,
lamb chops and stereo systems have all fallen in the past 12 months.
Across the UK economy, companies are growing accustomed to the idea that
this recovery - unlike previous returns to prosperity - will not
automatically lead to higher prices. The habit learnt by consumers and
corporate customers during the recession - that it rarely hurts to ask for a
discount - is dying hard.
Last month, a survey by market research group Verdict estimated the average
family had saved Pounds 150 a year on food over the past year, thanks to
supermarket price battles.
Why are consumers able to get such good deals? The answer is twofold: the
state of the UK, and world, economy; and the retail sector's problems.
July's surprise 0.5 per cent fall in the retail prices index, announced this
week, means that underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest
payments, has fallen to an annual rate of 2.2 per cent, its lowest level for
27 years.
Even that measure of underlying inflation - which is affected by indirect
tax changes, such as the introduction of value-added tax on fuel - may
overstate the core figure. The British Retail Consortium of leading stores
says the annual increase in the price of retail goods was just 0.9 per cent
in July. Such a low level of inflation means some prices must be falling.
Some recent bouts of price-cutting have occurred in traditionally cut-throat
areas, such as travel, where operator Thomson and agents Lunn Poly and Going
Places announced reductions in package holiday prices for next summer. In
other areas, price reductions have resulted from new entrants trying to
break into competitive markets, such as supermarkets' introduction of
own-label cola.
Newspaper price cuts may indicate another trend: the end of the recession
and the lowering of interest rates have given companies the financial
strength to attack their competitors. 'Now that companies such as News
International (which publishes The Times and The Sun newspapers) have got
their balance sheets in order, they can invest to gain market share, which
is the strategy a price cut often represents,' says Mr Douglas McWilliams,
chief executive of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, the
independent research group.
In the high street, seasonal sales to attract cautious consumers are a
biannual event. The timing of this year's summer sales, concentrated in July
rather than spread over two months, may account for the apparent sharp fall
in prices. Nevertheless, annual price falls in goods from bread to furniture
indicate that pricing pressures are still intense, even though the recovery
is in its third year.
In part, these pressures are due to a change in consumers' attitude.
Continued fear of unemployment, now at a seasonally adjusted 2.6m; the shift
to part-time jobs, up by 183,000 in the year to spring; earnings increases,
running at about 3.75 per cent this year; and debt levels which remain high,
at about 110 per cent of disposable income, all contribute to a cautious
consumer outlook.
Mr Colin Evans, chief executive of clothing chain Austin Reed, says: 'In our
experience, consumers are very price conscious. But they're not just looking
for a bargain. They're much more aware of the price-quality ratio.' He
thinks the market is splitting in two: 'Consumers look to certain retailers,
which offer good value all the time and twice-yearly sales, while others are
offering virtually continuous discounts and promotions.'
Retailers in the latter category may find it difficult to escape the
downward pricing spiral. One Southampton department store manager says:
'Some retailers have created pricing problems for themselves, having got
through the recession by launching endless sales.'
Even those shops not making price cuts find it difficult to raise prices.
Large store groups such as Marks and Spencer, J. Sainsbury and Kingfisher
have run 'value for money' strategies under various titles. Ladies' wool
blazers and prawn sandwiches have stayed at Pounds 85 and 99p, respectively,
for the past two years at M&amp;S. 'Our underlying philosophy is we're not
trying to be the cheapest, but we are trying to provide the best quality at
the best price,' says Ms Sue Sadler, corporate press officer at M&amp;S.
One leading retailer says: 'This is the environment that we're going to have
to get used to. You win by efficiency, by your systems, by controlling
costs. You improve your margins by buying better.'
Small retailers have found this strategy hard to implement. They lack the
bulk-buying power to compete. Price wars are usually won by the strongest
players, because they can afford to sit out the initial loss of revenue
involved in the hope of higher volumes to come. Mr Richard Brown, deputy
director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, says that small
independent retailers (which account for about 11 per cent of total sales)
face 'continuing difficulties' and report little increase in year-on-year
turnover.
Profit margins across retailing as a whole are slimmer. The Bank of
England's quarterly inflation report, published this month, estimates that
retailers' margins declined by almost 10 per cent in the year to the second
quarter of 1994 - the seventh successive quarter to show a decline.
'Retailers' margins as a proportion of output prices are probably at
historically low levels,' says the report.
It is not all doom and gloom for retailers, however. Retail sales volumes
rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.4 cent in July and were 3.8 per cent higher
than in the same period a year ago. Personal sector lending grew by Pounds
51m in July for the fourth successive month - the first time such
consecutive increases have been achieved since 1991, indicating consumers
are becoming more confident.
In the past, when consumers have gone on a spending spree, the result has
been higher inflation as the supply of credit has outstripped the supply of
goods. Whether a sharp rise in inflation results from the current recovery
depends on the tricky question of how much spare capacity - the so-called
output gap - there is in the economy. Once the economy gets close to full
capacity, bottlenecks appear and prices are forced up.
Professor Tim Congdon of Lombard Street Research, an economic forecaster,
believes that UK output is still 3 per cent below the economy's long-term
growth trend, which makes it 'very difficult to see why inflation should
rise in the medium term'. But Mr John Marsland, UK economist at UBS, the
securities firm, thinks that capacity constraints will start to bite on
manufacturers towards the end of this year. This will knock on to retail
prices in six to nine months.
A bout of general inflation would be the outcome of this scenario, which
would probably be good news for most store groups. 'Retailers have never
been afraid of a modest bout of inflation,' says Mr David Simons, chief
executive of Somerfield, the supermarket group formerly know as Gateway. But
even pessimists think the upturn in inflation is still a year away. In the
meantime, shoppers hunting for cheap blouses and cuts of meat should not be
disappointed.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Man in the News: Gaffes that could disable a climber -
Michael Portillo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the UK Conservative party, it pays to look tough; Baroness Thatcher made
a successful career out of it. Michael Portillo, Mrs Thatcher's intellectual
heir, is no pushover either, as his frequent attacks on the European Union
illustrate. But bashing foreigners is one thing; kicking the crutches from
under the disabled is quite another, even for the standard bearer of the
Tory right.
Portillo, promoted from treasury chief secretary to employment secretary in
John Major's July reshuffle, seems to have had no idea that his clumsy
abolition of Britain's priority suppliers' scheme would cause a fuss. His
reasoning was simple. The scheme, which allows companies employing mainly
disabled people a second crack at government contracts to match lower
tenders, was rarely used. In any case, the government's lawyers advised that
it conflicted with an EU directive on public procurement that took effect in
June. What is more, employers of disabled workers will keep their more
important government subsidy of Pounds 10,000 per worker.
David Hunt, Portillo's predecessor as employment secretary, has said that he
took the decision to scrap the scheme before being replaced in the
reshuffle. Portillo merely made the announcement.
It all adds up to a pretty solid defence. But Portillo - dogged by
demonstrators in wheelchairs on a visit to Leeds this week - looks not so
much tough as heartless as he struggles to fend off the protests from
organisations for the disabled. Why did he fail to ask the European
Commission whether anything could be done to save the scheme before
announcing its demise? Why was no attempt made to prepare public opinion
before the announcement was made? And why did ministers fail to notice the
impact of the directive on the scheme during talks between EU members in
1992? Portillo, who led the UK negotiating team, claims the civil service
failed to alert him to the problem.
The row will blow over. But it leaves Portillo looking politically inept,
and adds to the question marks over his judgment that have been piling up
since he achieved his current political prominence. There has been a series
of gaffes this year. It was not a good idea to tell students at Southampton
University that academic qualifications in other countries were worthless.
The remark looked xenophobic, even to nationalistic Tories. It was an even
worse idea to plan a party at London's Alexandra Palace, complete with a
fireworks display, to celebrate 10 years in parliament. Portillo says the
party was his constituency association's idea, but the episode reeks of
self-aggrandisement, even to supporters. 'Maybe it wasn't Michael's fault,
but it looked as if he was getting too big for his boots. I don't think it
did him any good,' says a friendly right-wing Tory.
At a broader political level, Portillo has been fighting a running battle
against his party's grudging acceptance of Britain's place in Europe. In two
interventions, he first ridiculed the idea that the UK may 'miss the bus' if
it fails to take part in the next phase of EU integration, and then declared
his opposition to a single currency. His remarks have kept the Euro-sceptic
flag flying in the cabinet, and offered a rallying point for the third or so
of Tory MPs who harbour suspicions about the European adventure. They have
also angered the prime minister, who thought about sacking Portillo after
his single currency comments, but settled for a qualified clarification
instead.
There is no doubt that Portillo has been damaged by all this controversy.
Tory left-wingers whisper that he has been over-rated; that he has been
promoted too fast; that he lacks the quality of gravitas without which no
Tory can make it to the top. He is, they say, untested in a big spending
department. The moment he takes charge of one (employment), the government
is embroiled in an avoidable fiasco.
Dismay is not confined to the left. Only a few months ago, up to 100
right-wing Tory MPs were said to be ready to back Portillo in a leadership
battle against Major. Hard estimates are harder to come by now that the
prime minister has strengthened his position, but right-wingers admit that
his support has softened. Perhaps fortunately for Portillo, the prospect of
a contest this year has evaporated, thanks to the Tories' dire but not
disastrous performance in the local and European elections in the spring.
So has Portillo peaked too early in his career? Most Thatcherites think not.
They continue to believe that his time will come, mainly because he remains
the only credible candidate of the right in any future leadership contest.
Neither of the alternative candidates - home secretary Michael Howard and
social services secretary Peter Lilley - has Portillo's ability to mobilise
grassroots activists.
For those who believe that the Conservatives can only retain power by
recovering the radical, campaigning passion of the Thatcher years, there can
be no other choice. 'Michael looks like a winner, and that puts him streets
ahead of the rest of the right,' says a Tory centrist. Portillo has
something else going for him, too. In a pragmatic party historically shy of
ideas, he is one of the few leading members who is intellectually and
politically self-confident enough to engage Tony Blair's reinvigorated
Labour party in the battle of ideas.
Almost alone among cabinet ministers, he has set out a coherent conservative
philosophy, cleverly combining a passion for Thatcherite icons such as low
taxation, sound money and individual responsibility with traditional Tory
veneration for the Crown, parliament and the established church. He is not -
yet - a conference darling, like Michael Heseltine, the consummate public
performer. But he shares Lady Thatcher's dislike of fudge, and her
willingness to attack on a broad front. He told an audience in Barcelona
during an official visit: 'It has recently been argued that the free market
is a jungle to be tamed by governments. It is at least as plausible to argue
that governments are a jungle to be tamed by the free market.' That is the
sort of thing that Tory activists like to hear.
The greatest testimony to Portillo's continued importance as a symbol of the
right is the prime minister's decision to give him a major department to
run. But there is still hope in Downing Street that Portillo will overreach
himself. There are plenty of temptations. The department's training budget,
its involvement in the benefits system, and its responsibility for
industrial tribunals invite attention from a politician committed to rolling
back the frontiers of government.
But it would be wrong to believe that Portillo is fervidly anxious to wield
the knife. Friends say he has seen the elephant trap and is aware that any
further rash actions would be dangerous. With an early leadership election
off the immediate agenda, Portillo has a difficult hand to play if he is to
keep himself in the public eye, but avoid further damaging controversy. It
could be a long game, but if he had any doubts about the need to be more
judicious, the disabled workers debacle will have dismissed them.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Leading Article: A raise in time may save nine
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week it became still more obvious that short-term rates of interest are
passing their trough. This is excellent news, mostly because it means the
recovery is increasingly well-established. Since disinflationary forces are
strongly at work as well, there is a good chance that the forthcoming
interest rate increases will not be particularly sharp. This could, in fact,
prove to be the start of a sustained and unprecedentedly global economic
expansion.
The lead is being given, as usual, by the US. Wednesday's decision by the
Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates by half a percentage
point was a pre-emptive move. While the timing was widely expected, the size
of the increase was not. Presumably, Mr Alan Greenspan and his colleagues
have concluded from the bond market's reaction to the minuscule increase in
short-term rates announced at the beginning of February that they might as
well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb. This particular sheep could stay on
the Federal Reserve's table for some time, since policy cannot be far from
the 'neutrality' sought by Mr Greenspan.
Meanwhile, the only question in the UK, now well on the road of recovery, is
when short-term interest rates will rise. Some time this year remains
likely, despite this week's excellent news on inflation. Amongst major
industrial economies, Japan is furthest from recovery. Yet the Bank of Japan
has not held on to its 1.75 per cent discount rate for almost a year to
lower it now, particularly when it can spy green shoots, including faster
growth of the Japanese money supply.
If short-term rates of interest are to fall anywhere it will be in
continental Europe. But the increasing strength of the recovery there,
demonstrated in this week's release of the European Commission's business
and consumer survey for July, is making substantial reductions decreasingly
likely. The German discount rate has been 4.5 per cent since May. While
still above the new US rate of 4 per cent, the traditionally cautious
Bundesbank lacks any compelling reason for further cuts.
Fastest growth
Within the group of seven leading industrial countries, Germany, of all
countries, has suffered the fastest growth of broad money over the most
recent 12-month period, at around 10 per cent. The performance of the other
six has varied between monetary contraction in France, at one end, and
growth of 6.6 per cent in Italy, at the other. In between come stagnation in
Japan and the US, and a rise of 4.8 per cent in the case of the UK. The
relation between monetary growth and inflation is not close enough for
precise steerage, but such restrained growth of money and credit seems quite
incompatible with an inflationary take-off.
This performance is linked to why the recovery has proved voteless in many
countries. In the 1980s many people bet on yet another inflationary upsurge,
notably by investing in residential and commercial property. Fortunately,
they bet wrongly. As a result of this pardonable mistake - pardonable in
view of what happened in the 1970s - many still find themselves burdened by
debt. They are victims of mistaken inflationary expectations, as surely as
those who lent money in the 1970s were victims of their confidence in money.
Good news
The resultant moneyless recovery is good news. It means not just that
inflation should remain restrained, but that resources are more likely to go
into additional production than into more speculative assets.
An important economic question is what else might halt the recovery. The
commodity-price rise already looks like yesterday's story, marking a
correction rather than a trend. Equally, provided monetary growth remains
slow and the authorities act pre-emptively, the correction in bond markets
this year could reverse. In the biggest three economies, interest rates on
long-term bonds have, in fact, already stabilised over the last three
months.
If anything is likely to go wrong it is with fiscal policy. Some industrial
countries already suffer from very high public indebtedness. A world economy
that is enjoying high economic growth, particularly throughout much of the
developing world, will have high real rates of interest. When inflation is
lower than nervous investors fear, real rates of interest are pushed higher
still.
No industrial country can stabilise its ratio of public debt to gross
domestic product without running a significant primary budget surplus - that
is, surplus without interest payments. That is politically unpopular. It can
only be done with a combination of high taxes and tight control on spending
 -yet another reason for this recovery to be voteless.
However difficult it may be, a prize is there to be won. The global economy
has probably the best chance of a long and sustained expansion since the
1960s. This is also truly a global expansion, one that offers hope to an
unprecedentedly large proportion of the world's population.

FT  20 AUG 94 / From Russia with love: Nuclear smuggling has put the
security of weapons material back in the political spotlight. FT writers
assess the threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY, GEORGE GRAHAM, CHRISTOPHER PARKES and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the climax of the 1980s television thriller Edge of Darkness, a CIA agent
breaks into a British nuclear fuel store and carries off a haul of plutonium
in a Harrods bag. Life recently started to imitate art in a series of
nuclear smuggling incidents centred on Germany.
On August 10 two Spaniards and a Colombian were arrested following the
seizure of a suitcase containing 300 to 350 grammes of plutonium at Munich
airport on a Lufthansa flight from Moscow. It was the biggest find to date
in a series of German discoveries of nuclear materials since 1990. That
year, there were four finds: in 1993 there were 241.
The smuggling has provoked a public political storm which is being used for
electioneering purposes in Germany, has made Russia deny that there is a
problem and has put nuclear security back on the agenda in the US.
There have been claims and counter-claims about the importance of the finds.
Some scientists in the former Soviet Union say that they are the tip of a
plutonium iceberg, with impoverished Russian nuclear workers selling the raw
materials for atomic weapons on an international black market. The Russian
government initially claimed that the political row over the seizures was a
plot by western countries to gain control of Russian nuclear stockpiles. On
Wednesday, Mr Sergei Vasiliyev, spokesman for Russia's internal
Counter-Intelligence Service, said: 'Not a single gram of plutonium-239 has
gone missing from storage in Russia.' Official western statements have
see-sawed between expressing concern at the smuggling and playing down the
significance of the seizures so far.
But even potential plutonium trafficking is worrying for the west. Nato
foreign and defence ministers held an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss
the threat, following the funeral of Nato secretary-general Mr Manfred
Worner. Behind the scenes, officials in most countries agree that more must
be done to make Russian nuclear materials secure, before large amounts of
plutonium find their way into the hands of would-be nuclear weapons states
or international terrorist groups.
The security of Russian nuclear stocks is questionable. The country has over
130 tonnes of military-grade plutonium which could be used to make more than
16,000 atomic bombs larger than that which destroyed Hiroshima. As a result
of nuclear weapons reduction treaties, Russia is dismantling almost 10,000
nuclear warheads and returning the plutonium to store, where it is easier to
steal. It also has a much larger pile of highly enriched uranium and civil
reactor-grade plutonium - which are harder to detonate but are still
extremely hazardous.
Exactly how much civil nuclear material Russia has is unknown - even
government experts probably do not have an accurate measure. The difficulty
of accurate nuclear accounting is not restricted to Moscow - last year US
energy secretary Mrs Hazel O'Leary revealed for the first time the amount of
military plutonium the US had produced, but had to correct the figure
upwards by one and a half tonnes because of a series of accounting errors.
One and a half tonnes of plutonium is enough to make 190 nuclear bombs.
There is little doubt that Russia has similar, and probably worse,
accounting problems. That creates the loopholes which people with a motive
can exploit. For example, Russian nuclear scientists, used to high status
and a good standard of living in the old Soviet system, have seen their
income slide. The temptation to make a fortune by smuggling plutonium is
strong.
Stopping this flow of plutonium is the first priority for western officials.
Nuclear scientists say the three plants in Russia capable of manufacturing
weapons-grade plutonium are near Chelyabinsk, south of Moscow, and the
Siberian outposts of Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk, and much of the weapons material
is stored there. However, it is more likely that any pilfered plutonium
would have come from nuclear stockpiles or research laboratories, rather
than direct from the plants themselves. The German authorities believe one
stash of plutonium could have come from the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow,
which is primarily a research centre.
Keeping track of all this material requires modern western bar coding and
computerised stock systems. The Russian government has made some attempts to
tighten controls, but scientists have long recognised that nuclear
accounting was inadequate. In March 1992, Mr Gennadi Novikov, head of
nuclear safety at the Chelyabinsk-70 plant, warned of a drastic decline in
security standards: 'The technical safety of nuclear weapons has remained
the same. But safety in the broader sense, taking into account the political
and psychological situation, has plummeted.' Morale has slumped and
supervision of materials is lax.
Not only are there risks that bomb-making materials may be stolen, but
weapons scientists are being encouraged to work on nuclear programmes
abroad. Mr Vladimir Kruchenkov, deputy executive director of the
International Science and Technology Centre in Moscow, says he has heard of
approaches - not necessarily for military purposes - from China, Syria and
North Korea.
Efforts are being made to stem the flow of both experts and material. The US
has been working with Russia to try to ensure that the stockpile of nuclear
material remains in safe hands. A portion of US financial aid to the
republics of the former Soviet Union is set aside to help with dismantling
old nuclear weapons. The US has agreed to help construct a Russian storage
facility for surplus plutonium and enriched uranium.
In addition, the US Enrichment Corporation, a spin-off from the US
Department of Energy, has a contract with Russia's ministry of atomic energy
to take highly enriched uranium from warheads and degrade it so that it can
be used for civilian purposes but not bombs. The US has also offered Russia
Dollars 30m for immediate improvements in security and accounting of nuclear
materials in Russia.
Russia is co-operating with western governments to counter the threat of a
brain-drain of Russian nuclear scientists. This March, the European Union,
Japan, Russia and the US set up the International Science and Technology
Centre in Moscow to redirect Russian nuclear scientists into more peaceful
pursuits, such as medical research and nuclear waste management. The centre
has now approved 54 projects committing Dollars 30m to sponsor 3,000
scientists over the next three years.
But more needs to be done, according to western officials if the potential
black market in stolen plutonium is to be prevented. They think there is
still time to resolve the problem. So far, much of the smuggled material has
been of limited use, such as the fragment of a nuclear reactor fuel rod
seized in Munich, or the speck of plutonium found in Bremen, which probably
came from a smoke detector and was of no conceivable weapons use.
Nevertheless, some plutonium, deadly even in tiny quantities, is getting
through. A terrorist group could cause heavy casualties with only a few
grammes of the material.
As well as the direct nuclear threat, the smuggling has produced political
fall-out in Germany, Russia and the US. In Germany, the recent finds of
weapons-grade plutonium have caused alarm and embarrassed the Russian
authorities into denials of responsibility. In turn, the Russians' attempt
to deny the problem has caused concern among officials in Washington and
Bonn, who fear that little progress can be made while Russia is on the
defensive.
Much of the aggressive Russian rhetoric may be public posturing for a
domestic audience. Less obviously, Russia has offered co-operation with the
German authorities. President Boris Yeltsin, holidaying in southern Russia,
has written to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl assuring him of assistance.
Russia's foreign ministry has been at pains to reinforce that message.
Such reassurance has eased fears in Washington that Russia is ignoring its
nuclear responsibilities. This week's discoveries have put the security of
nuclear supplies back on the political agenda; the subject will be discussed
at the summit meeting between US President Bill Clinton and Mr Yeltsin next
month. Until then, the US seems happy to let Germany take the lead.
The German response has, understandably, been vigorous. Even before Mr
Yeltsin's letter arrived, Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, the chancellor's security
adviser, was packing his bags for Moscow. He had evidence intended to prove
that plutonium and other radioactive materials seized from smugglers and
illicit dealers on German soil bore chemical fingerprints identifying their
Russian origin. There has also been plenty of public comment. Regional
politicians and legal officials have been airing their opinions on the
dangers to the German population from the 'Russian atomic mafia'.
In part such exchanges are only political posturing ahead of the German
federal elections in October. The smuggling crisis gives the Social
Democratic opposition a chance to air its anti-nuclear views, while
Chancellor Kohl's governing Christian Democrats can prove they are tough on
Russian organised crime. Several claims made by the government seem to have
seriously overstated the danger of some of the material being found.
Nevertheless, Germany will press for more powers for European police agency
Europol at next month's informal meeting of foreign ministers.
The forthright response by German politicians and the media is upsetting the
Russians. 'They talk about things they don't understand, this is unpleasant
and upsets the Russians,' said a German diplomat.
Privately, German and US officials agree it is important to smooth ruffled
Russian feathers. Russia will accept help to build further safe stores and
more sophisticated inventory controls, provided the west is not seen to be
forcing Russia's co-operation. Ultimately, getting additional safeguards in
place will require bilateral negotiations between Washington and Moscow.
Most agree that the Clinton administration has made a good, if slow start to
tackling the long-term challenge of nuclear security. Even Senator Richard
Lugar, a senior Republican spokesman on defence, acknowledges as much. 'I
think the Clinton administration has accomplished a great deal . . . If we
had not come to a point of very substantial conversation, negotiation and
control, then the proliferation problem would be out of hand. As it is, it
is controllable.'
One question, however, remains. Can the bureaucrats in suits act fast enough
to thwart the mafia with its suitcases? If not, the threat of rogue nuclear
weapons appearing throughout the world will loom much larger.

FT  20 AUG 94 / 'On arrival 152 of the sheep are dead': Ferry company
pledges to curb the transport of livestock have raised suspicions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A consignment of 240 calves spend more than 45 hours locked in a Dutch truck
travelling from Limerick in Ireland, via Dover, to Barcelona in Spain. Their
journey is broken just once, when they are unloaded and loaded again in 90
minutes.
Another Dutch truck carrying 450 English sheep leaves Dover for the
Netherlands. Four days later the same consignment crosses by boat in soaring
temperatures from the Italian port of Brindisi to Igoumenitsa in Greece. On
arrival, 152 of the sheep are dead.
Cases like these, cited by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals, have spurred British ferry companies into pledging curbs on the
transport of livestock.
P&amp;O, which has about 60 per cent of the cross-Channel freight market, said
last month it would stop carrying animals for slaughter from October unless
European agriculture ministers agreed immediate improvements in journey
times and conditions and a 'viable' enforcement regime.
Brittany Ferries, which has about 10 per cent of the market, announced last
week that from next Monday it would not carry on its cross-Channel and
Spanish routes animals going straight to slaughter.
The moves were welcomed by the RSPCA, which wants the European Union maximum
journey time of 24 hours without food, water or rest to be cut to eight
hours. Mr Mark Ranson, the society's senior scientific officer, asked: 'Why
do you need to take an animal from the top of Scotland all the way to Spain
for slaughter?'
Public feeling runs high on the subject. An RSPCA survey last September
found that 65 per cent of Britons backed the eight-hour limit. Earlier this
summer Mr Alan Clark, the former trade minister and a campaigner against
cruelty to animals,joined calls by animal-rights groups for a boycott of
ferry companies carrying livestock for slaughter.
But EU member states cannot agree on a change in the rules. While Germany,
Denmark and the Netherlands support an eight-hour journey limit, southern EU
countries are not keen on any limits.
In June, agriculture ministers failed to reach agreement on a Greek
compromise that would have reduced the 24-hour limit to 22 hours. Britain,
which has an internal 15-hour limit, joined other northern EU states in
blocking the plan in the hope of a better deal at the next meeting in
September, which will be held under the German presidency.
British livestock farmers, already suffering from European restrictions on
beef exports because of BSE - 'mad cow disease' - feel the ferry companies
are unfairly penalising them. They are supported by Mr William Waldegrave,
agriculture minister, who said: 'Those urging precipitate action would do
nothing to protect travelling animals in the long term and would impose an
immediate damaging effect on a trade already going through a difficult
period.'
Britain exports 2m sheep worth Pounds 65m each year, mainly for slaughter in
France, according to the Meat and Livestock Commission. About 500,000 calves
worth Pounds 95m are sent for veal or breeding, mostly to Belgium and
Holland.
Mr Richard Beale, chairman of the Association of Livestock Exporters, said
the ferry companies were motivated by commercial considerations. 'They've
looked at losing the slaughter trade versus losing public opinion,' he said.
'They're in a desperate battle now with the Channel tunnel.'
The ferry companies are also at odds with each other.
P&amp;O described Brittany Ferries' announcement as 'a bit of a whitewash'
because it plans to ban only animals being transported direct to abattoirs,
not those that are first fattened for slaughter. According to P&amp;O:
'Ninety-five per cent of animals leaving the UK are not slaughtered
straightaway but fattened up first.'
Stena Sealink, P&amp;O's main competitor, hit out at both companies, accusing
them of 'making qualified statements for the PR value'. The company said it
would make a 'definitive statement' on its position by the end of August.
Sealink warned that exporters would charter ships if the ferry companies
barred them. 'You're going to have third class ships with third class crews
and conditions for animals will deteriorate.' It added that picking and
choosing customers, especially if they were not breaking any rules, was 'a
dangerous and slippery slope'.
If the ferry companies were to agree a joint ban, it would not be bad news
for every sector of the UK livestock trade.
The leather and tanning industry would benefit from more animals being
slaughtered in the UK. Abattoirs, suffering from overcapacity, would welcome
the extra work.
Mr Peter Scott, general secretary of the Federation of Fresh Meat
Wholesalers, said: 'We would rather animals went abroad in carcass form, not
only on economic grounds for ourselves but also on welfare grounds. Animals
that are stressed and frightened make rotten meat.'

FT  20 AUG 94 / Supply of workforce skills 'not deficient'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is not deficient in the supply of skills in its workforce, says a
study from the Centre for Economic Performance.
It argues that the country is 'not out of line' with other advanced western
economies which have 'similar standards of living in terms of the stock of
skills in the population'.
The comparative study was carried out by Mr Peter Robinson. He found that
only 35 per cent of the population lack recognised basic qualifications,
which is much better than the average of 45 per cent for industrialised
economies.
The study shows, however, that Britain has a below-average proportion of the
population who have been through higher education (16 per cent compared with
an average of 19 per cent).
But if non-university higher education is excluded, the proportion of the
British population with university higher education, at 10 per cent, is
similar to the average of member countries in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development.
The report's findings appear to conflict with the widely-held view at the
end of the 1980s that Britain had too few 16- and 17-year-olds in training
or full-time education.
But Mr Robinson argues that a 'transformation' has taken place since 1988.
In the current academic year, 73 per cent of 16-year-olds were still in
full-time education in the January after their exit from compulsory
schooling. This compares with only 45 per cent in 1986-87.
The report also points out that only an estimated 6 per cent to 8 per cent
of 16-year-olds and 18 per cent to 19 per cent of 17-year-olds were in
regular full-time jobs in 1993-94 with 12 per cent of both age groups in
government-funded Youth Training. A 'worrying residual' were however,
unemployed or inactive.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Trade position signals strengthening recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The underlying trends in Britain's trade position with non-European Union
countries continued to improve last month, providing further indications of
the increasingly solid nature of the economic recovery, official figures
yesterday indicated.
The trade deficit with non-EU countries was a seasonally adjusted Pounds
418m in July, barely changed from the Pounds 392m deficit seen in June, but
sharply down from deficits of about Pounds 600m seen earlier this year, the
Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
The figure was considerably better than City forecasts.
Exports to non-EU countries rose 3 per cent to Pounds 5.46bn last month, up
from Pounds 5.32bn in June, the CSO said. Imports also rose 3 per cent on
the month to Pounds 5.89bn in July.
However, measured on a three-monthly basis, the figures pointed to an even
healthier underlying trend.
Exports rose 2.5 per cent in the three months to July compared with the
three months to April, while imports rose 0.5 per cent in the same period.
Measured without oil and erratics - the figure regarded as the best guide to
the underlying trend - exports rose 3 per cent in the three months to April
compared with the previous three months, while imports fell 0.5 per cent.
The trend in the volume trade, however, was slightly divergent, with price
rises accounting for much of the growth in trade.
Export volumes, excluding oil and erratics, rose 0.5 per cent in the three
months to April compared with the previous three months.
As this is lower than the rise in export values, it indicates that exporters
have raised their prices in the past three months.
Import volumes excluding oil and erratics, however, fell 5 per cent in the
three months to April compared with the previous three months. Since this
was a larger drop than the fall in import values, this indicates that import
prices have remained relatively high.
The CSO estimated that export volumes will rise slightly in the coming
months, while export volumes will rise 0.5 per cent each month.
Import volumes are expected to fall 1 per cent each month, while import
values are expected to remain flat.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Companies House staff call for halt to sell-off proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Staff at Companies House have launched a national campaign to win support
from businesses against government plans to transfer its services to the
private sector.
The campaign, led by the Civil and Public Services Association, aims to kill
off proposals by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to
contract out most of the functions of Companies House, the official
repository for corporate financial information in England, Wales and
Scotland.
Mr James Normansell, campaign co-ordinator, said yesterday: 'The changes
mean that those who rely on quick, cheap and up-to-the-minute company
information will find Companies House unable to help.'
Last month Mr Heseltine asked consultants to report by the end of October on
the feasibility of the proposals, which envisage the appointment of
contractors to take over most activities.
Companies House, an executive agency of the Department of Trade and
Industry, is based in Cardiff and has five regional offices. Last year it
handled the incorporation of more than 100,000 new companies and it holds
details on nearly 1m companies.
Under Mr Heseltine's proposals, chosen contractors would within three years
sell all company search services to intermediary business information
organisations.
Staff unions, which intend to contact hundreds of Companies House corporate
customers, claim contracting out will mean an end to several free services
while fees will rise for remaining services. They say up to 500 jobs are at
risk.
Campaigners hope that the recent decision to halve from October existing
company registration charges and fees for annual returns could undermine the
attractiveness of Companies House operations to potential bidders.

'The debate of the late 1980s over the supply of skills in the UK seems
rather dated,' says Mr Robinson. 'Young people themselves have 'resolved'
the debate over choosing the full education or apprenticeship route for 16-
to 17-year-olds. The majority have chosen full-time education and it seems
only prudent to accept this and reinforce the trend.'

FT  20 AUG 94 / Insurers join outcry against large pay-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Association of British Insurers, whose members manage about Pounds 600bn
worth of investment funds, has written to several of the UK's largest
companies expressing concern over large payments to former directors.
Mr Richard Regan, head of investment affairs at the association, said
yesterday it had written to the non-executive chairmen of 'four or five'
companies where controversial pay-offs had been made.
The letters state that non-executive directors should check the service
contracts of executive directors annually to ensure that 'they still want
them'.
Mr Regan added: 'We are writing to companies where these payments have
occured saying major institutions are concerned and this is the way we would
like to see it addressed.'
He added: 'We are not necessarily against three-year rolling contracts, but
we want companies to apply the practical principle of review.'
Two months ago PosTel, an institution with Pounds 25bn under management,
said it would vote against the re-election of directors who have
rolling-service contracts longer than two years. It believed that shorter
contracts would curb directors' entitlement to pay-offs.
The move follows a number of controversial payments, including Pounds 2.02m
to Mr Peter Davis, former co-chairman of Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch
information and publishing group. The payment, announced last Tuesday, took
the total size of pay-offs disclosed in the last year by the largest 250
quoted companies to more than Pounds 20m.
The letters will put further pressure on companies to limit pay-offs to
directors who resign or are forced out. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, recently stated that institutional shareholders should
be doing more to limit payments to directors.
The association stressed that it saw pay-offs as the real issue and not the
length of directors' contracts. Consequently it wants companies to be
tougher in negotiations over pay-offs with former directors.
The association refused to confirm which companies it had written to. Some
recent payments include Pounds 3.13m to Mr John Cahill, former chairman of
British Aerospace; Pounds 2.2m to Mr Chris Greentree, former chief executive
of oil company Lasmo; and the Pounds 2.7m to be paid to Dr Ernest Mario, a
former director of Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals group.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Scots loan rates to be guaranteed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Enterprise, the official development body for Scotland, is to
assist small businesses by guaranteeing the rate of interest on loans from
banks.
Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Office had to defeat strong Treasury
opposition to secure approval for the scheme.
It is particularly aimed at smaller companies employing up to 250 people in
manufacturing and construction, but is also expected to apply to business
services.
It is expected that companies will receive a guarantee that the interest
rate on loans over two to seven years will not increase by more than 1
percentage point.
Scottish Enterprise, which has an annual budget of Pounds 450m, will make up
the difference to the banks if interest rates on the affected loans exceed
the cap. The scheme is expected to cover Pounds 100m worth of loans and the
cost to Scottish Enterprise could be Pounds 5m a year.
It has won the backing of the Scottish banks - Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank
of Scotland, TSB Bank Scotland and Clydesdale - and has support from
business leaders and providers of professional services.
Fears about the volatility of interest rates have proved a disincentive to
small businesses to undertake new investment and expand.
Scottish Enterprise is also acting to make good the shortage of equity
finance for small businesses.
It intends shortly to announce plans for the creation of venture-capital
funds to invest money subscribed by banks, financial institutions and large
Scottish companies.
The new funds would be administered by Scottish Development Finance, an arm
of Scottish Enterprise.
It is targeting its investments at businesses needing less than Pounds
500,000.

FT  20 AUG 94 / ICI to restructure explosives division
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's largest chemicals group, yesterday
announced it was restructuring its UK explosives operations. It blamed a
decline in demand for the division's products on the coal industry.
ICI said the restructuring would involve job losses but it did not give
details. The division employs about 750 people at Ardeer, Strathclyde; 125
at Wigan and north Wales, and about 20 technical staff.

FT  20 AUG 94 / League table of student debt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
University students from Scotland who graduated this year were the most
solvent, a survey by Barclays Bank has found.
The Scots owed an average Pounds 900, partly because Scottish parents were
the most likely to pay their formal contribution, with 77 per cent doing so
in full, and because a high proportion of Scottish students attend a local
university and live at home.
The survey found students from the Midlands and north-west and north England
accumulated the heaviest debts.
Midlands students who graduated this year accumulated average debt of Pounds
2,371.
Comparable figures for other regions are Pounds 1,907 in the north-west,
Pounds 1,837 in the north and Pounds 1,479 in London.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Price of Sun about to rise to 22p
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The price of The Sun will rise from 20p to 22p on Monday, News International
announced last night.
The price was last reduced almost a year ago, when a cut from 25p to 20p
sparked off a war in which the prices of several national daily newspapers
came down.
But the group said last night: 'There are no plans to raise the price of any
other News International papers.'
It will mean that next week The Times, at 20p, will be cheaper than The Sun
for the first time.
Mr Stuart Higgins, editor of The Sun, said last night that increases in the
costs of paper and printing had made the price rise necessary.
Last month's circulation for The Sun, the latest from the Audit Bureau of
Circulation, is 4,173,699 compared with 2,501,421 for the rival Daily
Mirror, which has held its price at 27p.

FT  20 AUG 94 / 100 colleges face disruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lecturers in at least 100 further education colleges in England and Wales
plan strikes during two weeks of action early next month.
The Natfhe lecturers' union said yesterday that more colleges would hold
ballots on industrial action during the first weeks of term in September, as
the union continued local action against the introduction of new contracts.
However it added that its hopes of reaching a negotiated settlement had
improved since the government had decided not to carry out its threat to
withhold funds from colleges which failed to implement new flexible
contracts.
The dispute started after colleges were removed from local education
authority control in April last year.
The Colleges Employers' Forum, which includes most college principals,
demanded new flexible contracts which halved holiday leave each year, and
added an hour to each working day. It said these changes were necessary to
allow flexibility.
Natfhe refused to accept the forum's conditions, and has held both national
and local strikes against the proposals.
Last year the government announced that 2 per cent of central funding for
each college would be held back if they did not introduce flexible
contracts. Mr Tim Boswell, the further education minister, recommended the
forum's model contract to principals.
However the government announced this month that it would hold back funds
from only three colleges. Ms Sue Berryman, Natfhe's negotiating secretary,
said this had 'removed the last impediment to a negotiated settlement'.
Funds have gone to two colleges that negotiated new contracts accepted by
Natfhe.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Insurance gripes ensure busy future for ombudsman: An old
watchdog's influence is set to be narrowed but its workload may not shrink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The manner of Mr Julian Farrand's departure from his post as insurance
ombudsman at the beginning of this month will not have made his successor's
task any easier.
His valedictory comments highlighted what he found unsatisfactory in the
reducing remit of the insurance ombudsman.
Mr Farrand said that he had resigned as insurance ombudsman after a long
period of 'disillusionment' over the office's future. He was particularly
critical of the new watchdog set up to protect the private investor, the
Personal Investment Authority, which he said was undermining the ombudsman's
position with its scheme.
He had spent some months searching for new appointments before being
confirmed as the new pensions ombudsman from the start of next month.
'I preferred the challenge of being in a developed and enlarged role to
remaining in something with a diminishing significance,' he said.
From the perspective of the existing insurance ombudsman scheme, there are
certain difficulties arising from the establishment of the PIA.
At the very least there will be a contrast with the apparently inexorable
growth in the ombudsman's workload since the scheme was set up in 1981 on
the initiative of only three insurance companies.
First, the existence of a new, compulsory PIA ombudsman scheme is bound to
mean a smaller area of responsibility for the insurance ombudsman, since the
PIA ombudsman will deal with cases relating to the marketing of regulated
financial services.
Second, there is uncertainty about how much more than the minimum will be
transferred to the PIA ombudsman. For example, an insurance company can
choose to leave problems relating to administration - as opposed to the sale
of a life policy - with the insurance ombudsman. Many may decide, however,
to take advantage of the further, optional element in the PIA ombudsman
scheme and transfer all cases on life business to the PIA scheme, leaving
the insurance ombudsman with cases relating only to general insurance.
Third, there is the question of the maximum award payable by an insurer. Mr
Farrand has made no secret of his concern that while the maximum payout the
insurance ombudsman can insist on is Pounds 100,000, the maximum compulsory
award in the PIA ombudsman scheme will be only half that amount.
The new arrangement stems from the report by Lord Ackner, a former law lord,
on the establishment of a PIA ombudsman.
He said the new scheme should be concerned with breaches of the rules rather
than to a more discretionary system of what was fair and reasonable. With
different ways of working, it makes some sense for the two types of
ombudsman scheme to be separate, despite the risk that some issues may fall
between the two schemes.
It is not yet clear whether the lower limit for a maximum award under the
new scheme will turn out to be a severe constraint in practice. Only one
financial services dispute settled so far this year has ended in an award of
more than Pounds 50,000, and none has exceeded Pounds 100,000.
While the PIA ombudsman can recommend a review of the maximum award, the
ceiling is unlikely to rise much, if at all, because of the extra difficulty
this would cause for independent financial advisers in obtaining
professional indemnity insurance.
More generally, Ms Barbara Saunders, chairman of the insurance ombudsman
council and a PIA board member, insists that the PIA scheme does not
undermine the work of the insurance ombudsman, even though financial
services work currently makes up more than one-third of the case load. Some
staff are transferring to the PIA scheme, and Ms Saunders says that the
recent confirmation that transfer of undertaking regulations will apply has
removed some doubts about what this might mean. 'Job insecurity is no longer
an issue,' she says.
She admits, however, that some months of uncertainty do lie ahead over what
matters go to the PIA on the voluntary basis.
With the process of admitting companies to the new regulator still under
way, Ms Saunders believes it is unlikely that the arrangements for financial
services administration cases will be finalised before the beginning of next
year.
Companies will have to tell their customers what arrangements have been
made, but the prospect of confusion looms large.
Even if - as seems most likely - the insurance ombudsman loses jurisdiction
for all new financial services disputes, the workload for the new ombudsman
 -who is expected to be announced next week - and supporting staff will not
be reduced drastically overnight.
The office will continue to be responsible for dealing with a wide range of
general insurance cases - from the one-week travel policy to household
building and contents cover.
'By the end of this year, the number of general insurance cases we will have
dealt with will be the equivalent of the total number of life and general
insurance cases in 1992,' says Ms Saunders.
If the future of the insurance ombudsman scheme is safe unless there is a
massive rise in customer satisfaction with insurance companies, it looks as
though it will remain securely in place for a long time to come.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Study finds no link between nuclear power stations and
leukaemia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No link has been found between nuclear power stations and childhood
leukaemia, according to a study published in this week's British Medical
Journal, David Lascelles writes.
In a research project, which was assisted by funding from Nuclear Electric,
Dr John Bithell and Dr Gerald Draper looked at the incidence of childhood
leukaemia within 25 kilometres of 23 nuclear sites in England and Wales. In
no case did they find an incidence greater than would be expected by chance.
They said the well-documented instance of six excess cases at Seascale near
the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant was an isolated finding. It might
be due to chance or to infection following an influx of people to the area
when the site was established.
Dr Dick Taylor, Nuclear Electric's operational and safety policy manager,
said the study added conclusively to the already overwhelming evidence that
there was no general increase in leukaemia in children living close to
nuclear power stations.

FT  20 AUG 94 / BR may draft staff to break strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail staff with signalling qualifications may be seconded to
Railtrack to help break the nine-week series of strikes by signal workers,
it emerged yesterday.
The dispute has become so damaging to the railway network, particularly to
the freight business, that BR is considering all available options to reduce
its impact, an official said.
The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association said some of its members had been
interviewed but it advised them against taking such a step because it would
involve working for a different company.
Details of BR's plans became known on a day when the dispute with the RMT
transport union showed renewed signs of spreading to other rail unions.
Aslef, the train drivers' union, repeated an earlier warning that its
members might take action over safety.
BR said it was contacting its staff to see if they would volunteer to be
seconded to signalling duties after refresher training. This is likely to
involve few of BR's 110,000 staff because most people with signalling
expertise are already with Railtrack 'but it may get into three figures', BR
said.
This move follows a warning from BR chairman Sir Bob Reid earlier this month
that staff might be used to help Railtrack.
'The business is being very badly damaged,' the BR official said yesterday.
'Hitherto there has been the prospect of a settlement but we can no longer
stand by and watch the industry bleed to death.' People who would be likely
to have signalling qualifications included train planners and operations
staff.
Railtrack said that even a small number of extra staff in its signal boxes
could make a big difference to the scale of the train service operated.
The train operating companies promised to provide the most comprehensive
strike service yet during the 24-hour stoppage planned from midday Monday to
midday Tuesday.
Overnight sleeper and Motorail services between Scotland and London could
face closure because of damage caused by the rail strike.
The service from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness, Fort William and Aberdeen to
London Euston has lost 21 nights of business since the strike began.
'It is under review but no decisions have been taken,' InterCity West Coast
said. The service runs 10 trains a night.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Hambros chief in list of new peers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Charles Hambro, chairman of Hambros and Guardian Royal Exchange
Assurance, is to become a 'working' Conservative peer, Downing Street
announced yesterday.
Mr Hambro, a Conservative party treasurer since April last year, is one of
five Tories in a list of 10 peers nominated by the three main parties.
The others are Sir Christopher Prout, who led the party's delegation to the
European parliament until he lost his seat in the June elections, Ms
Patricia Rawlings, the former Euro-MP for Essex South West, Sir Peter
Blaker, a former foreign and defence minister, and Sir Michael Shaw, a
Yorkshire MP for 32 years until 1992.
Labour nominated three peers: Mrs Josephine Farrington, chairman of the
Association of County Councils, Mr Alf Dubs, a former home affairs
spokesman, and Mr Derek Gladwin, a former official of the GMB general union
and TUC general council member.
The Liberal Democrat presence in the Lords will be boosted by two peers: Ms
Susan Thomas, vice-chairman of Surrey county council, and Mr Graham Tope,
leader of Sutton council and a Liberal by-election winner at Sutton and
Cheam in 1972. Mr Tope lost his Commons seat in 1974.
The government has suffered a series of embarrassing defeats in the Lords -
most noticeably on the police and magistrates courts bill and the criminal
justice bill - and the five Conservatives will help boost Tory morale.
Working peers are expected to play a full part in the chamber's main role of
reviewing legislation. Labour does not recommend party members for peerages
in the annual Queen's birthday and New Year honours lists, but participates
in the working peers list to maintain the effectiveness of the Lords as a
debating chamber.

FT  20 AUG 94 / 'Ill-advised' import fraudster avoids jail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A businessman who evaded Pounds 194,000 of Customs duties escaped with a
suspended prison sentence yesterday because accountants from KPMG Peat
Marwick gave him 'grossly misconceived' advice.
Mr Peter Grimble, a construction plant importer from Guildford, Surrey,
admitted pretending hydraulic excavators came from America rather than Japan
so he could evade European Union anti-dumping duties.
The judge at Knightsbridge Crown Court told him: 'I regard you as having
been involved in a systematic and a grossly dishonest defrauding of the
Customs &amp; Excise.' He said he would have jailed Mr Grimble but for wholly
exceptional circumstances.
Customs &amp; Excise had offered not to prosecute the businessman but impose a
financial penalty instead.
'You were given advice in the strongest possible terms, which I can only
describe as of a grossly misconceived nature, to reject that offer more than
once,' said the judge.
To do justice to Mr Grimble, it was necessary to suspend the sentence, he
said.

FT  20 AUG 94 / BNF aims at big rise in overseas business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Nuclear Fuels, the state-owned fuels reprocessing company, yesterday
announced plans to increase significantly its overseas business as it
published financial results which suggest it can double profits to more than
Pounds 160m this year.
Mr John Guinness, chairman, said he expected overseas contracts to rise from
20 per cent of the Pounds 1.13bn turnover in 1993-94 to about 30 per cent of
this financial year's increased sales. The proportion will rise further as
the recently opened Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (Thorp) gets into full
swing. By the end of the century the company expects it to be nearer 40 per
cent.
'By 2010 the worldwide nuclear services market is likely to be worth over
Dollars 35bn a year,' Mr Guinness said. Contracts won recently, including
one for Dollars 45m (Pounds 29m) to help reprocess spent plutonium in the
US, suggested BNF could win a sizeable market slice.
In the year to March 31 BNF lifted pre-tax profits by Pounds 5m to Pounds
81m on turnover up 8 per cent at Pounds 1.13bn. It said profits would have
been Pounds 78m higher had it not been for regulatory delays in starting
Thorp. The dividend to the government, BNF's shareholder, was Pounds 26m.
As in the previous annual report, Ernst &amp; Young, BNF's auditors, said the
figures were subject to a fundamental uncertainty because of continuing
negotiations by the company on contracts with Nuclear Electric and Scottish
Nuclear.
The negotiations result from the government's refusal to underwrite earlier
agreed contracts. Mr Guinness said revised contracts were with the
government. He hoped the matter would be resolved in the government's
present review of the nuclear industry.
BNF has cut staff from 17,000 eight years ago to about 14,000. It expects to
employ about 12,000 at the end of the decade. By April the company expects
to have achieved the target set in 1988 of improving productivity by 40 per
cent.
BNF is raising the basic pay of its directors by 2 per cent this year after
a freeze last year. However performance-related bonuses meant there were
substantial rises last year, with the total emoluments of Mr Neville
Chamberlain, chief executive and the highest-paid director, rising to Pounds
216,000 from Pounds 169,000. He received no bonus in 1992-93 but Pounds
39,000 last year.
BNF's drive abroad has worried environmentalists who argue it could increase
the amount of plutonium in transit.
BNF yesterday argued that it and other reprocessing companies could help to
reduce the terrorism threat from plutonium. Mr Guinness suggested western
countries should buy Russian plutonium to turn into mixed oxide fuel which
can then be used in reactors.
BNF last year completed commissioning a mixed oxide demonstration facility
at Sellafield, Cumbria. The first fuel from the facility was deliv-ered to a
Swiss customer in June.
Work on a full-scale mixed oxide plant should be completed by the end of the
decade and the company hopes to win orders for it from countries including
Japan.
Environmentalists see BNF's arguments as self-serving, and point out that
its other reprocessing facilities increase plutonium stockpiles.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Private finance agreed for Tube
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Underground has signed its first deal under the government's private
finance initiative involving the supply of computing services to its
engineering department in London.
It has reached a Pounds 10m agreement for Electronic Data Systems to provide
and maintain computing services - including hardware, software, maintenance
and support - over five years. The agreement covers the seven floors of the
engineering directorate's new offices at Canary Wharf in Docklands.
The contract sets performance standards with penalties for any failure to
meet set targets. EDS, based in Uxbridge, west London, will decide how to
meet these requirements and accept the risk that its choices of hardware and
software are correct and that its staff can provide the agreed level of
support.
The contract meets the Treasury's guidelines on bringing private finance
into the public sector because EDS takes a share in the risk.
Mr David Bailey, London Underground's development director, said: 'This is a
way to increase the level of investment in public-sector organisations.'
The underground is attempting to involve private finance in other investment
projects, notably plans to modernise rolling stock on the Northern Line and
to install automatic access barriers at more stations. These schemes have
yet to win the approval of the Treasury.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Scots loan rates to be guaranteed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Enterprise, the official development body for Scotland, is to
launch a scheme to assist small businesses by guaranteeing the rate of
interest on loans taken from banks.
Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Office had to defeat strong Treasury
opposition to secure approval for the scheme, which is thought to be
unprecedented in the UK.
It is particularly aimed at companies employing up to 250 people in
manufacturing and construction, but is also expected to apply to business
services. Scottish Enterprise will be able to rule on the eligibility of
companies.
Although details of how the scheme will operate have yet to be finalised, it
is expected that companies will receive a guarantee that the interest rate
on loans over two to seven years will not increase by more than one
percentage point.
Scottish Enterprise will make up the difference to the banks if interest
rates on the affected loans exceed the cap. The scheme is expected to cover
Pounds 100m worth of loans and the cost to Scottish Enterprise could be
Pounds 5m a year - from its annual budget of Pounds 450m.
The initiative is one of a number of projects launched by Scottish
Enterprise to increase Scotland's low rate of new business formation. The
development body has won the backing of the Scottish banks - Royal Bank of
Scotland, Bank of Scotland, TSB Bank Scotland and Clydesdale - and has
support from Scottish business leaders and providers of professional
services.
The scheme had the backing of the prime minister and the Department of Trade
and Industry in spite of resistance from the Treasury.
Professor Donald MacKay, chairman of Scottish Enterprise, finally persuaded
Mr Kenneth Clarke to approve it at a meeting in Inverness last May when the
chancellor was attending the Scottish Conservative party confer-ence.
Fears about the volatility of interest rates have proved a strong
disincentive to small businesses to undertake new investment and to expand
their operations.
Scottish Enterprise is also acting to make good the shortage of equity
finance for small businesses, which they require for expansion alongside
loan finance.
It intends shortly to announce plans for the creation of venture capital
funds to invest money subscribed by banks, financial institutions and large
Scottish companies.
The new funds would be administered by Scottish Development Finance, an arm
of Scottish Enterprise which has been restructured.
It is targeting its investments at businesses needing less than Pounds
500,000, an area often shunned by private investment capital providers
because of the disproportionate cost of making investments of this size.

<TEXT>
University students from Scotland who graduated this year were the most
solvent, a survey by Barclays Bank has found, John Authers writes.
The Scots owed only an average Pounds 900, partly because Scottish parents
were the most likely to pay their formal contribution, with 77 per cent
doing so in full, and because a higher proportion of Scottish students
attended a local university and lived at home.
The survey found students from the Midlands and north-west and north England
accumulated the heaviest debts. Midlands students who graduated this year
accumulated average debt of Pounds 2,371.

FT  20 AUG 94 / UN in Vatican's firing line: Andrew Hill examines the furore
over a population conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pope John Paul II has just begun 10 days' holiday in Italy's Valle d'Aosta.
He probably needs it.
Not only is he recovering from an operation on his leg and planning a visit
to the former Yugoslavia, he is also in the front line of one of the
fiercest diplomatic and ideological battles fought by the Vatican in recent
years, a battle which concerns, according to the pontiff himself, 'the very
future of humanity'.
The occasion for this struggle is the United Nations' international
conference on population and development, in Cairo next month. The Pope's
principal concerns are what his envoys have described as an assault on the
family, and an attempt by certain UN members to give new legitimacy to
abortion and artificial contraception.
The Roman Catholic church's position on abortion is well known and fixed.
The Pope described abortion as 'a heinous evil' when he met Ms Nafis Sadik,
the conference secretary, in March.
But rather than relying on church hierarchy to pass on its message, the
Vatican is using its own diplomatic network, and privileged position as an
independent state and UN member, to influence the outcome at Cairo.
The offensive started in March when ambassadors accredited to the Holy See
were invited to a meeting to hear the Vatican's tough line on the
conference. The day after Ms Sadik's visit to Rome, the Pope also drafted a
letter to leaders of all UN countries, outlining his fears that if certain
'innovations' in the draft conclusions prepared for the Cairo conference
were adopted, they 'could cause a moral decline resulting in a serious
setback for humanity, one in which man himself would be the first victim'.
The Vatican's main fear is that UN members will try to undermine the
conclusions of the last world population conference, in Mexico 10 years ago,
that abortion should never be promoted as a means of birth control. The US
is a particular target for Vatican pressure, as President Bill Clinton,
although opposed to abortion as a method of family planning, has come out in
favour of women's right to choose - a position underlined at a tense meeting
with the Pope in June.
That was the highest-profile diplomatic summit organised by the Vatican, but
envoys have also been hard at work attempting to enlist support from smaller
UN members, including some outside the Catholic and even Christian faiths.
The Holy See will only admit to having received the backing of President
Carlos Menem of Argentina, who has publicly declared his willingness to push
the Vatican line with pro-choice Latin American countries such as Brazil.
According to Italian reports, however, the Vatican can count on the support
of a core of African countries such as the Ivory Coast and Senegal, and has
also been courting Islamic nations in Africa and the Middle East.
In addition, the Vatican is applying pressure closer to home, in Italy
itself. Abortion is legal in Italy in certain circumstances, but the issue
bubbled to the surface last week - creating further tension within Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's fractious ruling coalition - when Mr Altero Matteoli, the
environment minister who will be part of the Italian conference delegation,
equated abortion with murder in an interview with Vatican radio. In the
weekly news magazine Panorama Mr Antonio Martino, Italy's foreign minister,
said the Italian conference position 'would take account of all the
orientations and sensitivities which exist in Italian society'.
Only at the conference itself will the effect of the Vatican's diplomacy be
obvious. The Holy See refused to comment this week on Italian newspaper
claims that the UN excised most references to abortion from its annual
population report, released on Wednesday, to avoid offending the Vatican and
its allies. The Vatican delegation's most potent weapon at the conference is
likely to be a threat to torpedo consensus on the final conclusions, risking
an acrimonious end to proceedings.
As Mr Joaquin Navarro-Valls, the Vatican spokesman, told a news conference
last week: 'There are not many points on which we disagree but the point is
that on some occasions the disagreement is very profound. . . If a consensus
is reached in Cairo, which will be what almost everyone is expecting,
certain positions have to change regarding the consideration of abortion as
a means of family planning. The other possibility is to approve the (final)
document without consensus, without unanimity. Nobody will be pleased with
that.'

Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga, sworn in as prime minister of Sri Lanka yesterday
after winning this week's general election, pledged to try to end the civil
war in the north of the island, where government troops are fighting
separatist Tamil Tiger guerrillas.
She plans to approach the Tigers and other groups to discuss a settlement of
the fighting, which has claimed over 30,000 lives in the last 17 years. 'We
have to tread very carefully, but we intend to start on a solution soon,'
she said.
Mrs Kumaratunga also pledged to follow free market policies with 'the
private sector as the main motor' of the economy. She wished to assuage
fears that her People's Alliance, a centre-left coalition which has ended 17
years of conservative rule, might favour greater intervention in the
economy.
Her other listed priorities were constitutional reform, including curbing
the powers of the executive president, a drive against corruption, and an
investigation into the deaths of thousands of people who disappeared during
the civil war in the north and during a nationalist insurgency in 1988-90 in
the south.
Mrs Kumaratunga is to keep the finance portfolio for herself. Her foreign
minister is Mr Lakshman Kadirgamar, a UK-trained lawyer. Mrs Kumaratunga has
no cabinet post for her 78-year-old mother, Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the
former prime minister.

<TEXT>
Leaders in South Africa and Zimbabwe yesterday rejected military
intervention in Lesotho, where the king has claimed control over the elected
government, Reuter reports from Cape Town.
Presidents Nelson Mandela of South Africa and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe said
they would first pursue diplomatic efforts to end the crisis in the small
mountain state of 1.8m people, which is entirely surrounded by South Africa.
The military option 'was discussed, but we decided we should concentrate on
peaceful methods to try to resolve the situation,' Mr Mandela said.
His remarks were echoed by Mr Mugabe, who wanted 'the people of that country
being brought to a conference table to discuss their differences'.
An appointed provisional government was yesterday sworn in to rule Lesotho
in place of the democratically elected parliament dissolved by the king, and
one man was reported killed when police fired on demonstrators.
Mr Mandela said he was particularly concerned that the conflict in the
former British colony might spill over into South Africa, where many Lesotho
residents have relatives.
King Letsie III issued a proclamation on Wednesday dissolving parliament and
the cabinet of Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle, whose election in 1993 ended
seven years of military rule. The monarch apparently plans to hand the
country back to his father, deposed in a military coup in 1990.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Africa's delinquent debtors fall in line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The African Development Bank is forecasting a big reduction in its loan
arrears following this year's introduction of tougher sanctions against
delinquent borrowers, said Mr Babacar Ndiaye, the bank's president, in
London this week.
The bank has been under pressure from its first world shareholders to tackle
mounting arrears following a report by external consultants, which called
for a shake-up to address deficient lending procedures and chaotic
management. Arrears at the end of August were expected to be down by about a
quarter from the 6.6 per cent of outstanding loans recorded at the end of
1993, said Mr Ndiaye, despite having risen sharply in the first half of the
year.
Cameroon, one of five bank debtors in chronic arrears, had already cleared
its backlog, he said, and another, Congo, would have done so by the end of
August. The bank's other delinquent debtors are Zaire, Liberia and Somalia.
The bank's OECD members have held up replenishment of the bank's soft loan
arm, the African Development Fund, pending evidence that these problems are
being tackled.
Earlier this year Mr Ruud Treffers, the Dutch co-ordinator for the soft-loan
replenishment, warned that the arrears could threaten the bank's financial
viability. Such warnings prompted concern in South Africa - which the bank
is anxious to bring in as a large shareholder and borrower. Mr Ndiaye has
sought to allay such fears in a trip to South Africa. He has been helped by
leading rating agencies, which have renewed the bank's Triple A rating for
its senior debt.
The bank has also introduced tougher loan loss provision policies, a new
organisational structure has been planned and steps have been taken to
bolster reserves.
The bank's president said he was optimistic the deadlock over replenishment,
which has disrupted the work of the African Development Fund, could be
resolved. He believed the bank had gone a long way towards meeting demands
tabled by the fund's donors in May.
African member countries nonetheless remain unhappy about the proposed level
of replenishment, which reflects budgetary constraints in the donor
countries more than any assessment of Africa's needs. Mr Ndiaye called for
an increase in the level of replenishment in the light of the measures taken
by the bank.
A consequence of the tougher policy on provisions is likely to be a
reduction in the current year's income. Like other financial institutions
the bank has also suffered losses on its bond portfolio in the first quarter
of the year.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Hong Kong tycoons face property probe: Louise Lucas on
claims of collusion at a sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In coming weeks, many of Hong Kong's rich and powerful will be paying a
visit to the dingy offices of the Independent Commission Against Corruption
(ICAC), the government body charged with stamping out corruption in the
colony.
The subject matter, privately described as 'cheating the government out of
HKDollars 2bn' (Pounds 167m) falls under the prevention of bribery
ordinance.
The investigation, sparked by public complaints, follows a land auction on
May 26 at which developers are alleged to have colluded to secure two
properties at bargain prices.
The probe will seek to establish whether the auction was rigged: that is, to
discover if any developers may have offered rival companies an option to
share a stake in a particular property at a 'controlled' price rather than
letting true competition take its course and allow the highest bid to win
ownership.
Investigators have spent several weeks talking to observers at the auction,
including analysts and reporters, with the result that one Hong Kong
newspaper, Ming Pao, is also now being investigated. The newspaper is
alleged to have breached section 30 of the prevention of bribery ordinance,
which makes it an offence to disclose the identity and details of persons
being investigated. Ming Pao says the public had a right to know.
A video tape played to millions of television viewers that evening shows
clearly the movement of developers during the auction, which one analyst
said was blatantly rigged. Another described the developers as 'buzzing
around like besuited flies'.
The two plots of land were subsequently snapped up at prices sharply below
market expectations. The main site, a 233,000 sq ft plot in Fanling
earmarked for luxury low-rise homes, went for HKDollars 2.04bn to a
consortium including Sun Hung Kai Properties, Nan Fung Development, Sino
Land, DBS Land, Cheung Kong, Paliburg Development, Hang Lung Development,
Swire Properties, Henderson Land, Kerry Properties and New World
Development. The price compared with expectations in the range of HKDollars
3bn to HKDollars 4bn.
The second plot, 63,000 sq ft in Yuen Long, also in the New Territories,
went for HKDollars 510m to a consortium of 14 developers, as against an
expected HKDollars 700m to HKDollars 1bn.
Earlier in the day, representatives of many of the same companies met at the
City Hall coffee shop. All were Hang Seng Index constituent stocks and
boasted a combined value of more than HKDollars 400bn.
Auctions in Hong Kong are generally considered too important to leave in the
hands of underlings, and those at the table were mostly tycoons such as Mr
Thomas Kwok, managing director of Sun Hung Kai Properties and, with his
family, the group's senior shareholder; Mr Albert Chow, deputy managing
director of Mr Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong; and Mr Ronnie Chan, chairman of
Hang Lung Development.
Technically, those found guilty of the Section 7 bribery in relation to
auctions offences can face a maximum fine of HKDollars 500,000, a seven-year
prison sentence, and an order to pay an amount, the equal or part of, the
advantage received - which in this case could as high as HKDollars 2bn.
In practice, this is a case with scant precedent. Of the handful of auction
bribery cases that have come before the commission only one has resulted in
a prosecution. That case, more than five years ago, involved hawkers who
colluded at a government auction of market stalls and were fined a few
hundred HK dollars.
But property prices are a political minefield in Hong Kong at the moment.
The developers' immediate reason for the jumbo consortium was that it was a
means of spreading risk - the uncertain property environment, generated by
the government's pledge to cool prices, prevented any one of them making
such a sizeable investment on their own.
Mr Chris Patten, the governor, signalled his intention to tackle property
prices in March. In June, the government announced an increase in the supply
of land for residential development and changes to the way builders bring
properties to market. These measures slashed the proportion of flats
allocated to insiders, such as staff and associates. Analysts doubt whether
the measures will take much more than 10 to 20 per cent off property prices
this year: a small cut given the 200 per cent leap that has driven the
market in the past three years. However, at the time of the May auction the
measures had not been announced, and the developers claimed caution was
necessary.
The probe also calls into question the government's own handling of the May
26 auction. While some believe the auction ought to have been nullified on
the spot, given the mass of activity on the auction floor, the government's
immediate response was to express satisfaction: the properties had, after
all, gone for prices above the opening bids.
Later came a promise to look into the auction, which resulted in some mild
restrictions, mainly hampering movement around auction halls.
When Mr Tony Eason, secretary for planning, environment and lands, briefed a
select group of stock analysts and property agents on the measures, before
presenting them to the Legislative Council, relief at their lack of severity
sent the futures index soaring 200 points in the final 45 minutes of
trading.
This caused the government further embarrassment, as brokers not invited to
the briefing complained that their more privileged peers had a chance to act
on the news while the market was open. Mr Eason claimed the briefing had
contained nothing which could be regarded as market sensitive.
However, with the June property measures now announced, the May 26 auction
has left the government having to address a whole new furore in the property
market.

The Pope will go ahead with plans to visit Sarajevo on September 8 even
though Bosnian Serb leaders warned that his security could not be
guaranteed, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. The visit is intended to show
solidarity with the inhabitants of the Bosnian city, whose population of
525,000 was about 7 per cent Catholic before the outbreak of war.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, said the papal visit would not get
consent because of security concerns. 'The Moslems can shoot him down and
accuse the Serbs. That would be terrible for the Catholic world. That would
be disastrous.'
The Vatican has already abandoned plans to visit Belgrade, the Serbian
capital, after the Serbian Orthodox Church refused to receive the pontiff.
The Pope will visit Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, on September 10.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A group of centrist Republican and Democratic senators met yesterday morning
to try to hammer out a bundle of amendments to the US healthcare reform bill
proposed by the Democratic leadership in Congress and backed by President
Bill Clinton.
The senators, who like to call themselves the 'mainstream coalition', have
presented their work as the last serious chance to get a sensible,
bipartisan healthcare reform bill this year.
But their deliberations have merely underlined the deep divisions over the
health issue.
Senator John Breaux, a right-wing Democrat from Louisiana who is one of the
group's leaders, acknowledged he and his colleagues had been unable to agree
on a 'full-fledged health reform bill', and had had to limit themselves to a
bundle of amendments to the bill proposed by Senate majority leader George
Mitchell. But even that scaled-down effort had to be revised at the last
minute when the independent Congressional Budget Office warned that their
cost estimates were as much as Dollars 300bn (Pounds 193.5bn) off the mark.
The frustrations that the senators have experienced in finding common ground
may strengthen the hand of right-wing Republicans fighting against any
healthcare reform. Some Democrats have concluded the exercise is so bogged
down that there is now no realistic chance of achieving responsible reform
this year.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Court signals turning point in asbestos saga: Agreement
could provide model for broader settlement of litigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asbestos-related legal action will not end with the approval this week in a
US federal court of a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 844m) settlement for future
victims - but the deal could be a turning point in a saga that has already
cost more than Dollars 10bn.
It is the biggest success yet enjoyed by the Centre for Claims Resolution,
an asbestos industry body formed in 1988 to rationalise litigation and curb
rising legal costs.
The agreement provides compensation over the next 10 years for an estimated
100,000 future victims of mesothelioma - a cancer of the lining of the lung
 -and other asbestos-related diseases. Any victim who had not filed a claim
before January last year, when negotiations on the deal began, and who
contracts an asbestos-related disease can claim, with individual payouts
ranging from a maximum of Dollars 200,000 for victims of mesothelioma to as
little as Dollars 2,500 for victims of non-malignant asbestos-related
diseases.
But the deal could provide a model for a broader settlement of asbestos
litigation. The 20 former asbestos companies backing the centre account for
only 20-25 per cent of the US asbestos industry, which is now largely
defunct. Nor does the deal affect any of the 200,000 legal claims filed
before January 1993.
Mr Lawrence Fitzpatrick, chief executive of the centre, says that other
former asbestos producers not currently party to the agreement have already
shown interest in joining an expanded 'second wave' scheme.
The willingness of some of the lawyers representing potential victims to
agree the deal also signals the possibility of broader agreement.
However, other lawyers have indicated their intention to appeal against the
judge's decision to approve the scheme. They say it in effect denies legal
rights to some victims and the level of awards is smaller than would be
possible through court proceedings.
Critics also say that if the number of claimants rises above the centre's
estimates over the next 10 years, more money will be needed. 'The agreement
doesn't provide legal finality. Asbestos could still rear its ugly head in
2005,' said Mr Randolph Fields, a US insurance lawyer.
At the same time the settlement cases will have no direct effect on claims
against asbestos companies over their liability for the cost of removing
asbestos from buildings, so-called 'asbestos property damage'.
T&amp;N, once the UK's largest asbestos producer and now a leading maker of
motor components, faces a Dollars 185m legal suit from Chase Manhattan Bank
in one of the biggest of these cases. Chase is seeking Dollars 85m in
damages in relation to removal of asbestos from its headquarters in downtown
New York and a further Dollars 100m in punitive damages.
T&amp;N also faces the prospect of legal action by New York's Port Authority
over asbestos used at the World Trade Center and La Guardia airport.
Moreover there is also the prospect of continuing legal action by victims of
asbestos-related diseases outside the US. Solicitors specialising in
personal injury litigation in the UK, for example, say that the number of
their asbestos-related cases has doubled over the last four years. Producers
and manufacturers also face legal action elsewhere, notably in Australia.
According to the National Safety Council of Australia (NSCA), Australian
state governments, companies and insurers could already face ADollars 1bn
(Pounds 480m) in liabilities.
The attitude of insurers, who will fund about two thirds of its cost, to the
settlement could also complicate matters.
Insurers might be expected to welcome the deal, which will bring a greater
degree of certainty about the size of claims which they face. Because claims
emerge many years - sometimes decades - after the inception of an insurance
policy, it can be difficult for companies to calculate the size of the
reserves needed. 'You are always better off dealing with a finite number.
This had the potential to be very costly for the industry,' said Mr Steve
Goldstein, vice-president of the Insurance Information Institute of New
York.
However, Mr Fields believes a global settlement involving all asbestos
producers could actually damage the position of insurance companies, since
it would in effect crystallise claims which would otherwise only emerge over
many years. 'The impact is difficult to predict. It could bring forth even
more claims,' he says.
In some cases, insurers are resisting claims by asbestos producers and
manufacturers in the courts.
Finally, the relief offered to the hard-pressed Names of Lloyd's will be
limited. Lloyd's said yesterday that its exposure to companies involved in
the settlement was minimal and that any real benefit would depend on the
extension of the scheme. Many of the same syndicates are also exposed to
multi-billion-dollar pollution claims which, observers believe, could have a
bigger impact on the market than the asbestos claims.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The 20 companies which have formed the Centre for Claims Resolution,
based in Princeton, which is pursuing the class action are:
Amchem Products
AP Green Industries
Armstrong World Industries
CE Thurston
CertainTeed
Dana
Ferodo America
Flexitallic
GAF
IU North America
Maremont
Asbestos Claims Management (for merly National Gypsum)
National Services Industries
Norsoc
Pfizer
Quigley
Shook and Fletcher Insulation
T&amp;N
Union Carbide Plastics
United States Gypsum.
 Under the class action currently being heard, the 20 companies would
together pay about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 650m) over 10 years to settle
asbestos cases awaiting adjudication in state and federal courts.
 Under the proposed settlement the companies would pay sufferers of
asbestos-linked diseases Dollars 5,800 for non-cancerous disorders to
Dollars 60,000 for lung cancer. Only those with symptoms would qualify.
 Victims of asbestos-linked diseases who opted out of the settlement
procedure may still pursue legal action. There are, however, understood
to be some 100,000 outstanding cases awaiting a hearing, with courts in
most states only now dealing with claims filed in the 1980s.
 All federal lawsuits are understood to have been on hold since 1992
because of the legal logjam.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Clinton orders ban on Cuban refugees: White House drops
30-year-old policy of preferential treatment to try to 'demagnetise' US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday ordered that illegal refugees from Cuba
should not be allowed to enter the US, and that US citizens who tried to
help them at sea would be prosecuted.
At a news conference to explain his administration's about-turn in policy
towards Cuban refugees, Mr Clinton said Cubans picked up in international
waters would be taken to Guantanamo Bay, the US military enclave on the
island of Cuba, just as refugees from Haiti are.
Abruptly reversing 30 years of preferential treatment for Cuban refugees,
administration officials said they wanted to 'demagnetise' the US and deter
people from attempting the dangerous sea crossing to escape from the regime
of President Fidel Castro. Mr Clinton harshly criticised Mr Castro for
attempting 'to export to the US the political and economic crisis he has
created in Cuba'.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said the move was
intended to 'keep people from taking to the seas in unseaworthy vessels in
dangerous circumstances'.
'Cubans should know that as of now no Cubans picked up by the Coast Guard
will be brought to the US,' she said.
Cubans have always been afforded special immigration treatment because of
the US's long ideological feud with their communist government.
But the policy has exposed successive administrations to charges of double
standards and racism, since poorer and blacker Haitians faced much harsher
treatment. Mr Clinton criticised his predecessor, President George Bush, for
his policy of returning Haitian boat people to their country, but then
adopted it himself when he took office. He has wrestled with the problem
ever since, and has yet to find a satisfactory solution.
While a law passed in 1966 forbids the administration to return Cubans to
their island, it does not prohibit their detention in camps such as
Guantanamo.
'Certainly Cuban refugees will be treated humanely, and those who have
legitimate fears of political persecution can apply for refugee status
through the in-country system in Havana,' Ms Myers said.
Ms Myers said yesterday that Mr Clinton had made clear that 'one, Fidel
Castro will not dictate immigration policy here in the United States, and
two, the president will not permit a repeat of the 1980 Mariel boatlift',
when more than 100,000 Cubans fled the island in a matter of months.
After Attorney General Janet Reno, who oversees the immigration services,
announced the change of policy on Thursday night, Governor Lawton Chiles of
Florida welcomed the new policy.
'It allows us to make sure these people get the proper health screening,
that other screening is done . . . right now, we don't know who is coming
in,' he said.
Mr Chiles says his state has been overwhelmed with the influx of refugees,
and had asked the president to declare a state of emergency.

FT  20 AUG 94 / US healthcare 'coalition' underscores rift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of centrist Republican and Democratic senators met yesterday morning
to try to hammer out a bundle of amendments to the US healthcare reform bill
proposed by the Democratic leadership in Congress and backed by President
Bill Clinton.
The senators, who like to call themselves the 'mainstream coalition', have
presented their work as the last serious chance to get a sensible,
bipartisan healthcare reform bill this year.
But their deliberations have merely underlined the deep divisions over the
health issue, and highlighted the possibility that apparently modest,
incremental reforms may end up costing more than the more thorough
reorganisation backed by Mr Clinton.
Senator John Breaux, a right-wing Democrat from Louisiana who is one of the
group's leaders, acknowledged he and his colleagues had been unable to agree
on a 'full-fledged health reform bill', and had had to limit themselves to a
bundle of amendments to the bill proposed by Senate majority leader George
Mitchell. But even that scaled-down effort had to be revised drastically at
the last minute when the Congressional Budget Office, the independent agency
that has the task of analysing the costs and effects of the various
competing healthcare reform plans, warned that their cost estimates were as
much as Dollars 300bn (Pounds 193.5bn) off the mark.
The 'mainstream coalition' plan takes as its starting point a proposal
agreed by the Senate finance committee, which also served as the basis of
Senator Mitchell's bill. That is the aim of achieving health insurance for
95 per cent of the US population by the year 2001.
But where the Mitchell plan includes a fallback mechanism, in case that goal
is not met, under which employers would be compelled to pay half of the cost
of their workers' insurance, the 'mainstream coalition' proposes a softer
fallback: a commission that would suggest improvements if the plan fell
short of 95 per cent coverage.
The group, whose membership has fluctuated between seven and 15 senators,
was due to discuss its amendments yesterday morning with Senator Mitchell
and then with Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, before making the
plan public.
But the frustrations that the senators have experienced in finding common
ground may strengthen the hand of the right-wing Republicans who are
fighting against any healthcare reform. Some centrist Democrats have
concluded that the exercise is so bogged down that there is now no realistic
chance of achieving responsible reform this year.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Mexican poll officials voice concern
</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's independent election magistrates have sharply criticised the
government for dragging its feet in implementing key aspects of the
country's new electoral law, underscoring concerns over the fairness of
tomorrow's presidential poll.
The election magistrates, who were approved by all the political parties and
have a controlling vote on the board of the Federal Electoral Institute,
publicly attacked the Attorney-General's Office for not giving more support
to the special prosecutor for electoral crimes.
The prosecutor has received 237 complaints of electoral violations, but has
examined only 67 of them and fully resolved only one case, finding a school
director and congressional candidate not guilty.
'It is unthinkable that the prosecutor does not have his budget,' said Mr
Santiago Creel, one of the six magistrates. 'This is undermining confidence
in the system.'
The Interior Ministry responded to the criticisms by promising that all
allegations would continue to be dealt with after the election and by
increasing resources available to the prosecutor's office.
While tomorrow's poll is expected to be the cleanest in Mexico's history,
observer groups and the election magistrates have complained the government
has not fully complied with a democratic accord reached between the main
political parties earlier this year. Apart from limited efforts by the
special prosecutor, they point to the highly favourable coverage the ruling
party continues to receive on television and seemingly unlimited financial
resources at its disposal.
The ruling Institutional Revolutionary party goes into the election strong
favourite to win. However, Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist opposition
warned yesterday that there would be 'confrontation' if the elections were
not clean. Government officials are concerned Mr Cardenas will declare the
election fraudulent in the course of tomorrow's polling.
The electoral magistrates are concerned that the proliferation of exit polls
and quick counts of representative votes may contribute to confusion in the
hours after the polls close. The magistrates have urged that such results
not be released until the electoral institute's own figures are published.
Mr Creel sharply criticised television and radio for not covering the
campaign in a more balanced way in recent weeks. 'We have seen a clear
reversal of the advances we had in the media,' Mr Creel said.

FT  20 AUG 94 / FIS would review 'illegal' Algerian deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Algeria's Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), outlawed after the cancellation of
elections it was poised to win in January 1992, considers all international
agreements signed since then by the country's leaders to be illegal. If the
FIS did come to power all such agreements, with governments and foreign
companies, would, at the very least, be reviewed.
The FIS position was spelled out by Mr Rabah Khebir, the spokesman of the
FIS leadership in exile in Europe, during an interview with the Financial
Times. Mr Khebir, a 38-year-old professor of physics, polled 45 per cent of
the vote in the eastern Algerian port of Collo in the first round of the
elections in December 1991. He was subsequently jailed, and later put under
house arrest from which he escaped two years ago.
'The Algerian people will not endorse agreements signed by an illegal
government. That is a position of principle', he said. Contracts up for
review might be suspended, if it was found that 'corruption has been
practised, or if the interests of the Algerian people had not been well
served'.
Mr Khebir insisted, however, that it was in Algeria's interest to 'open its
doors economically' and that the FIS wanted 'to have good relations with the
west'. But, he added, leading western countries bore 'a heavy responsibility
with regard to the future course of events in Algeria'.
He noted with regret that the recent Group of Seven summit in Naples had
called on the military-backed regime to open a 'dialogue with all components
of Algerian society who reject violence and terrorism', and noted that the
violence began only after the regime halted the electoral process.
At the insistence of France, last month's G7 communique omitted any mention
of the FIS as a partner for political dialogue. A number of western
companies and international banks are known to be have recently renewed
contact with the FIS, something which happened regularly when it was still
legal in Algeria. Mr Khebir said at least one big French company could be
included in the list.
Among the more important international agreements which would be affected by
a review are:
All those contracts covering imports worth an estimated Dollars 23bn (Pounds
15bn) from January 1992 to December 1994.
A Dollars 1bn standby credit from the IMF, agreed in April this year.
A Paris Club agreement to reschedule this year Dollars 3.4bn of the Dollars
14.5bn Algeria owes to foreign governments. Commercial banks are expected to
reschedule this autumn at least Dollars 600m of debt to them due this year.
An estimated 20 exploration contracts signed with international oil
companies. Foreign investment in new drilling is expected to grow from
Dollars 199m to Dollars 234m this year, while a Dollars 1.3bn production
sharing deal in an existing oil field, Rhourde El Baguel, was also signed
last month between Atlantic Richfield and Sonatrach, the Algerian oil and
gas state monopoly. However the new law, which liberalised the rules
governing joint ventures between Sonatrach and its foreign partners, was
passed by the national assembly in December 1991.
Some of the components of the Dollars 1bn-plus project to build a gas
pipeline from Algeria to Spain. Half of the value of this work, involving
the laying of the pipeline under the aegis of the US contractor Bechtel, is
due to start before the end of the summer.
Mr Khebir acknowledged that the US, Italy and Spain, had called on Algerian
leaders to begin a dialogue with FIS, but said the French position had made
matters more difficult. 'I am not anti-French,' he stressed. When asked if a
third party could help promote a dialogue, Mr Khebir said he saw no reason
why countries such as the US, Italy and Spain could not do so. France
however 'could not usefully play that role. Its current attitude has ruled
it out.'
There are three conditions made by the FIS for resuming dialogue with Gen
Lamine Zeroual, the head of state. First, the release of Mr Abassi Madani
and Mr Ali Benhadj, the two paramount FIS leaders, who have been held in
Blida military prison since June 1991, plus guarantees of safety for all
members of the FIS supreme council, 70 of whose 80 members are in Algeria.
There should also be guarantees that the council could meet freely in
Algeria. Any discussions with the military leaders would also include other
parties in Algeria, and would lead to a resumption of the electoral process,
at which foreign observers would be welcome.
Mr Khebir said Gen Zeroual's professed wish for a dialogue was at odds with
the violent repression practised by the army and state security forces in
recent months. He estimated the number of Algerian lives lost since January
1992 at 15,000, with a further 27,000 people held in prisons or in camps.
Other opposition leaders, such as Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, the respected leader
of the Socialist Forces Front. recently put the figure of those killed at
over 10,000.
The FIS spokesman warned that without a serious political dialogue, violence
was bound to escalate. 'The regime would be well advised to talk to us,' he
said. Mr Khebir noted the Islamic Armed Group (GIA) had over the past year
claimed responsibility for the murder of most of the 59 foreigners who have
been killed and had rejected elections. 'We have always denounced the
killing of foreigners,' said Mr Khebir, adding that the escalation of
violence made the question of who was in control of the armed groups ever
more difficult.
The first unequivocal condemnation by the FIS of the killing of foreigners
came in fact a month ago, and is believed by observers to be the result of
the growing showdown between the GIA and the Islamic Liberation Army, which
owes allegiance to the FIS. Over the past few months a number of senior FIS
members switched to the GIA.

French industry suffered a slight setback in June, when production fell 0.8
per cent from May, according to Insee, the state statistics institute,
writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. But economists were confident this was just
a seasonal glitch which would not impede continuing recovery of French
industry and the rest of the economy. The overall decline in industrial
production disguised a sharper 1.3 per cent fall in manufacturing output.
One of the weaker areas was motor vehicles, reflecting the end of government
initiatives to encourage consumers to trade in old vehicles for new models.

Finland's three-party centre-right government yesterday set a tight budget
for 1995, alleviating fears that surging economic growth and a looming
election might lead to relaxation of its tough fiscal strategy, writes
Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. Spending is to be held at FM180bn
(Pounds 22.5bn), excluding FM15bn in outlays linked to possible membership
of the European Union. But it will mean a further round of heavy cuts and
restructuring of the Finnish public sector. The budget forecasts a general
government deficit of FM25bn, or 4.5 per cent of GDP, and a net borrowing
requirement of FM60bn, or 11 per cent of GDP.

imposed a 50 pfennig (20 pence) tax on each disposable item made from
synthetic material. McDonalds and other fast-food outlets in Kassel had
challenged the decision on the grounds that the federal government, not
local councils, had sole right to raise taxation. The Kassel authorities,

FT  20 AUG 94 / Bundesbank to abandon short-dated paper sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank is to stop issuing short-dated paper, so-called Bulis,
because of a conflict between its conservative policies and the government's
desire to liberalise Germany's under-developed financial markets.
The last auction of the six-month maturity Bulis will take place in
September, the bank said yesterday, adding it did not want to foster
'short-termism' in financial markets. The surprise move followed the loss of
its long struggle to prevent the launch of money market funds in Germany.
By scrapping Bulis the Bundesbank has made sure the funds, which normally
invest in short-term government and corporate bonds, have at least one less
investment opportunity.
Money market funds are short-term investment accounts which offer ordinary
savers a chance to 'play' money markets by buying or selling units in large
managed funds at will. They became legal on August 1 with the introduction
of laws bringing local financial markets more into line with international
competitors.
Commerzbank, Germany's third biggest commercial bank, has from the outset
run an aggressive mass advertising campaign explaining to Germany's
traditionally conservative savers: 'In comparison with your deposit account,
it means top interest rates and maximum liquidity.'
The Bundesbank had blocked the funds' introduction for years because of the
volatile effects they can have on money supply data, and concerns that its
grip on monetary policy might be weakened.
Long-term lending and saving policies are the cornerstones of the
Bundesbank's statutory mission to preserve the stability of the D-Mark.
Money supply is its main inflation indicator.
The government, however, has pressed on with updating legislation blamed for
hampering Frankfurt's efforts to compete on a global basis. The latest move
stemmed from a Bonn initiative in 1991 to bring 'Finanzplatz Deutschland' in
line with international standards.
The Bundesbank's pointed statement made plain that the withdrawal of its
objections to money market funds in May, after parliamentary approval became
inevitable, had been merely a formality. Its reservations 'basically
continue to apply', it said.
'The Bundesbank therefore prefers not to offer investment facilities itself
(Bulis) for money market funds nor to encourage a trend towards short-term
maturities in the financial markets.'
In a sharp reminder to government and other public-sector borrowers, the
bank said it 'assumed' they would support its long-term policy and continue
financing their budgets with long-term securities.
'The bank might not be enthusiastic, but I think they can live with it,'
said Mr Peter Pietsch, a senior economist at Commerzbank.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Capture of Carlos makes Pasqua's summer: France's bluff
interior minister is emerging as a force to be reckoned with
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Charles Pasqua, France's bluff, gruff, interior minister, is on a roll.
The arrest of Carlos 'The Jackal', the terrorist who had eluded the world's
security forces for two decades, represents a coup in a political career
which has earned Mr Pasqua the reputation of a populist enemy of crime and
terrorism.
The snaring of the Jackal followed hard on the heels of a high-profile
clampdown on Islamic militants after the killing of five French citizens in
Algeria earlier this month. This brought a sweeping stop-and-search
operation and the internment of 26 suspected militants in a disused army
barracks in north-eastern France.
The combined effect of the clampdown and the arrest has been to thrust the
interior minister to a decisive position in French politics, nine months
ahead of presidential elections. With Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime
minister, and most other cabinet members on vacation, Mr Pasqua has been de
facto leader of the centre-right administration, trampling on the territory
of colleagues such as Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister. Referring to his
rise, the French press have dubbed the past few weeks 'the summer of
Pasqua'.
Mr Pasqua's influence is set, however, to last well beyond the summer to
next spring's presidential poll. His exploits have prompted speculation that
he himself could run for the presidency. 'It is very possible that Pasqua
could be interested in the election,' says one member of the UDF, the junior
partner in France's centre-right coalition.
Mr Pasqua, who would be trusted as president by 30 per cent of voters,
according to a poll this week by the CSA institute, has been untypically
guarded about his ambitions. 'With political ideals based on those of
Charles de Gaulle, one doesn't act on the basis of personal interests but on
the basis of the national interest,' he told Agence France-Presse, the
French news agency, at the beginning of the month.
For most observers, however, Mr Pasqua is much more likely to be a kingmaker
than a candidate in the elections to succeed Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand. Both Mr Balladur and Mr Chirac, who are currently shadow-boxing
in their quest to represent the Gaullist RPR party, will need to court the
support of Mr Pasqua in their bids for the Elysee. As a reward, Mr Pasqua
may be hoping to be selected as prime minister.
The importance of Mr Pasqua's support lies in his populist appeal to
traditional Gaullist voters. His tough stance on crime and his opposition to
the creation of a federal Europe, means he can deliver the votes of many who
might be tempted to back the National Front party of Jean-Marie Le Pen, or
of those attracted to Mr Philippe de Villiers, the Eurosceptic who shocked
the French political establishment by winning 12 per cent of the vote in
this year's European elections.
For Mr Balladur and Mr Chirac, however, harnessing Mr Pasqua is a tricky
task. Although he was an ally of Mr Chirac, under whom he served as interior
minister between 1986 and 1988, relations between the two have become
strained. In particular, Mr Pasqua felt snubbed by Mr Chirac's failure to
back him in opposing the Maastricht treaty on European union.
In the case of Mr Balladur, there is a clash of style as well as substance.
The smooth, cautious Mr Balladur is a graduate of the elite Ecole Nationale
d'Administration. By contrast, the coarse and straight-talking Mr Pasqua
based his political ascent on the creation and leadership of Gaullist
organisations such as the Service d'Action Civique.
Opposites can, however, attract. Mr Balladur, mindful of Mr Pasqua's
grass-roots popularity in a country increasingly anxious about law and order
and immigration and suspicious of the process of European integration, has
expressed his 'full support' for his minister's security operations.
As ever, with Mr Pasqua, there are risks involved. Allegations of a tradeoff
between France and Sudan to secure the Jackal's extradition could yet prove
an embarrassment to the prime minister and his hardline colleague. The
clampdown on Moslem militants could prompt reprisals from extremist groups.
In expressing his support for Mr Pasqua, however, Mr Balladur is aware that
he may be an abrasive ally, but he is certainly a dangerous opponent.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Swedish opposition in pledge to stabilise debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Sweden's opposition Social Democratic party last night pledged to stabilise
the country's mounting state debt during the next four-year government term,
outlining for the first time a detailed programme of tax increases and
spending cuts to reduce the budget deficit.
'The goal is unambiguous,' said Mr Ingvar Carlsson, party leader. 'The
budget deficit will be reduced and the state debt stabilised during the
mandate period. We will not accept cutting the deficit or the debt through
increased inflation.'
The Social Democrats hold a clear lead in the opinion polls ahead of next
month's general election and had been under strong pressure from the
financial markets to publish a credible fiscal plan. Earlier this week, the
Swedish krona fell to record lows against the D-Mark and long-term interest
rates surged over 12 per cent when the party suggested it would not produce
a detailed programme before the poll.
Mr Goran Persson, shadow finance minister, responded by presenting proposals
to strengthen the budget by SKr61bn (Pounds 5.06bn) during the new
government's term. The election manifesto had been delayed until after the
markets closed yesterday for fear of sparking further turbulence.
The plan is more detailed but less ambitious than the programme of SKr101bn
savings by 1999 proposed by Prime Minister Carl Bildt's centre-right
coalition to tackle a deficit which in the last budget year reached more
than SKr200bn, 13 per cent of gross national product. It also emphasises tax
increases more than the government.
Mr Persson said the Social Democrats would take tougher measures if a fall
in unemployment, currently around 14 per cent, and higher growth did not
materialise to help slim the deficit. The Social Democratic plan includes an
increase in revenues of SKr27.4bn from higher taxes. Most would come from
higher health insurance contributions by ordinary taxpayers, producing extra
revenues of SKr15bn. The rest is made up of higher marginal taxes for high
earners, increased wealth and capital taxes and the restoration of taxes on
dividends, a measure which was scrapped by Mr Bildt's government.
The party plans savings in public spending - which at present accounts for
70 per cent of GNP - of SKr33.6bn through trimming welfare provisions such
as some childcare benefits. SKr19bn of these savings is projected to come
through lower indexation and interest costs.
The Social Democrats, trying to balance the demands of their big
constituency in the public sector and the urgent need to stem a public debt
soon to account for more than 100 per cent of GNP, will be hoping their
proposals will calm the markets on Monday. But last night both Mr Bildt and
the Federation of Swedish Industries said the plan contained too many tax
increases and too few spending cuts.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Ultra-nationalists win seats in Romanian government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Romania's left-wing minority government has given cabinet posts to two
members of the country's leading ultra-nationalist party, in an attempt to
boost its position in the country's hung parliament.
It has appointed Mr Valeriu Tabara to the Agriculture Ministry and Mr Adrian
Turicu to Communications. Both men are members of the Romanian National
Unity Party, an anti-Hungarian and nationalist organisation based in
Transylvania, Romania's ethnically mixed western province.
The formal inclusion of the RNUP in the cabinet had long been expected. The
party holds a pivotal 10 per cent of seats in the parliament.
The ruling Party of Social Democracy, which includes many senior former
Communists, has relied on the RNUP's support in parliament to stay in power
since narrowly winning general elections in September 1992.
Until now, the PSD had offered the RNUP junior ministerial and local
government posts in return for its support. The latest move comes as the
government is completing plans for a controversial mass privatisation
programme which it hopes to present to parliament as soon as it reconvenes
after the summer recess in two weeks.
The RNUP had indicated it would oppose the programme and withdraw its
support for the government unless given ministerial posts, diplomatic
sources said.
Pro-reform opposition parties said yesterday the move was a setback for
democracy and risked increased inter-ethnic tension in the country, which
has large ethnic Hungarian and gypsy minorities.
Western diplomats and businessmen in Bucharest said the appointments were
likely to damage further Romania's already poor image in the west.
'They have brought members of a neo-Nazi party into the government. This is
terrible for us - it will only deter foreign investors and lenders even
more,' one local businessman said.
The two new ministers come from the RNUP's more technocratic wing. Mr Turicu
comes from the state telecommunications company, while Mr Tabara is an MP
and a university lecturer in agriculture. He replaces Mr Ioan Oancea, who
has been attacked in the local press for alleged inefficiency and
corruption.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Contracts with Algiers at risk, warns Islamic Front
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The main Islamic party battling to take power in Algeria warned foreign
governments and companies yesterday that contracts signed since the January
1992 general election may be at risk.
The Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which was denied certain victory in the
election when the government cancelled the poll, warned violence would
worsen if the Algiers government did not open a dialogue.
Mr Rabah Khebir, spokesman for the FIS, said in an interview with the
Financial Times that all contracts signed since the election could be
considered illegal if FIS came to power. Agreements amounting to billions of
dollars would be reviewed. Mr Khebir added, however, that it was in
Algeria's economic interest to remain open to the west.
But western governments also carried a heavy responsibility for the future
course of events in his country, where Islamic militants have recently
stepped up attacks on foreign nationals.
The FIS spokesman, who fled Algeria two years ago, said western governments
could help establish a dialogue with the Algiers government, but ruled out
the participation of France 'because of its attitude'. France has recently
clamped down on members of FIS and other Islamic activists.
He claimed that FIS had always denounced the killing of foreigners (59 have
died), and said the leadership had done all it could to dissuade its
supporters from carrying out acts of sabotage against oil and gas
installations.
Exports of hydrocarbons should be worth about Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.8bn)
this year and provide Algeria with 97 per cent of its foreign income. But as
the overall level of violence increased, the risks of such acts occurring
could only get greater, Mr Khebir said.
'The regime would be well advised to talk to us,' he added.
At least 10,000 Algerians are estimated to have died in political violence
since the beginning of 1992 and diplomats estimated that the death toll is
running at about 300 a week.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Tide turns against Cubans: James Harding in Key West on the
plight of those who flee Castro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Adrift in the middle of the Straits of Florida on a polystyrene raft, oars
washed overboard by the 10-foot waves, you pray. First you pray to Our Lady
of Regla, the patron saint of the sea. Then you pray to Our Lady of Caridad,
patron saint of Cuba. And then you paddle.
It worked for Miriam Villegas, 42, a hospital statistician from eastern Cuba
who was picked up by the US Coastguard after two days at sea - along with
her husband and two other refugees. But Mrs Villegas, who has since been
processed by immigration, washed and clothed by the Transit Centre for Cuban
Refugees in new sneakers, slacks and a T-shirt reading 'Love you for loving
the blues', was one of the last Cuban refugees to get a warm welcome from
the US.
President Bill Clinton yesterday confirmed a reversal in US policy, which
since the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 has almost automatically admitted
Cuban refugees and made them eligible to apply for permanent resident status
after living in the US for a year.
Mr Clinton said all Cuban refugees picked up at sea would be prevented from
entering and instead would be taken to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, where Haitian refugees have been processed by US immigration. He
accused the Cuban government of Fidel Castro of attempting to 'export' its
'political and economic problems'.
The last bus load of 65 Cubans to sneak in under the old regulations reached
the transit centre from the immigration services at the Key West coastguard
base at 2.30 yesterday morning. Oblivious to the change in policy, oblivious
to almost everything, men wrapped in blankets filed through a corridor of
clapping, and cheering compatriots.
Callow faces and tired eyes affirm the writer Ernest Hemingway's observation
on the journey across the Straits of Florida. 'Brother, don't let anybody
tell you there isn't plenty of water between Havana and Key West,' Hemingway
wrote. The centre estimates that only four out of 10 make the crossing
successfully.
Luis, who left his whole family behind, knows he was lucky. He and two
friends came across on a couple of inner tubes lashed together with rope.
They told of an escape with paddles made of corrugated-iron nailed to broom
handles.
The Florida coastguard picked up another 538 people on Thursday, bringing
the total this week to 2,077 - not far short of the 3,565 in the whole of
last year. Most of the refugees are brought to the coastguard base at Trumbo
Point in Key West. Until yesterday they were handed over to immigration, who
having checked they were Cuban and not Haitian, passed them on to the
transit centre.
Florida's state officials were struggling yesterday to come to terms with
the practical consequences of the new policy. Mr Tom Herndon, chief of staff
to the Florida governor, said federal officials had yet to instruct state
officers on changes in operations. He understood the White House was 'trying
to refine a specific policy'.
The change in policy will not be welcomed by many Cuban Americans in
Florida, least of all Mr Arturo Cobo, who presides over the transit centre.
Mr Cobo, who left Cuba in 1960 and was part of the 1961 ill-fated Bay of
Pigs expedition, sits in his office surrounded by commendations and
certificates of thanks from Cuban American organisations. In a corner hang
the army uniforms of Cuban military officials, 'Castro's men', who rafted
across the strait and ended up in Mr Cobo's centre. Above the uniforms, a
glass case houses three border patrol bullets dug out of Cuban refugees, who
eventually landed safely in Florida.
Mr Cobo does not want to see those who flee 'a Communist dictator' sent to
detention camp. 'Freedom. People looking for freedom are dying all along
this stretch of Florida,' he says. 'We don't make immigration policy, but we
don't want to see Cubans treated like Haitians.'
At the centre, news of the policy reversal was greeted angrily. One Cuban
American who left in the great Mariel exodus in 1980 says they are 'fleeing
their native country to be free, instead of making their lives worse'.
By six o'clock yesterday morning, the centre was empty. The last of the
refugees had been taken up to Miami on chartered tourist buses advertising
pleasure cruises to the Bahamas. Miriam Villegas is today free in Miami. She
said the address and telephone number of her brother, Joel Alvarez Bello,
was washed away during the crossing.
What is the best thing about America? She looks towards her husband. He says
nothing. A transit centre volunteer prompts them: 'Libertad' (Freedom).
'Yes, Libertad,' they say.

FT  20 AUG 94 / CyberCouple to tie the knot virtually
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The bride will be distinctively dressed in a futuristic silver gown, studded
with metal and gems. Her groom will cut a dashing figure in Star Trek-style
vest and leggings. And, as Monika Liston and Hugh Jo exchange vows today at
the world's first 'CyberWedding', both will be wearing matching virtual
reality headsets.
In reality, the ceremony will take place in San Francisco. In virtual
reality, the happy couple will tie the knot in a romantic dream world,
brought to life by heavy duty computer equipment.
Floating through Atlantis in a chariot drawn by carousel horses, they are to
arrive at the gates of a mythical palace. Entering, they will find the
minister awaiting them at the altar. When they kiss in virtual reality,
hearts, flowers and white doves will circle above their heads.
Each will view this fantasy from his or her own perspective, through their
'vision immersion module' headsets. Their guests will watch the same images
and a panorama of the enchantment on carefully positioned video screens and
a video wall.
This is a real wedding, and would have been a really expensive wedding were
it not being sponsored by Cybermind - where Ms Liston is an executive
assistant - and several high-tech companies whose products were used to
create the 'virtual experience'.
'It's going to be a blast,' Ms Liston said as she put the final touches on
the wedding arrangements. 'We had planned to elope, but this is the ultimate
elopement. Virtual reality lets us get married wherever we want.'
Atlantis might not be the choice of every couple, and perhaps the floating
hearts and flowers are a bit too Hollywood for some.
But if you happen to be in San Francisco and want to get married in St
Paul's cathedral or on a tropical island, there are alternatives to hopping
on a plane. And if yours is a marriage that must be made in heaven, that too
can be arranged. Virtual reality weddings could become all the rage, says Ms
Aimee Rosewall, Cybermind's director of sales and marketing and wedding
co-ordinator. 'We will be open on Monday and ready to create your
fantasies.'
Be warned, however, that the technology does impose a few restrictions. The
bride and groom, for example, must stay 12 feet apart throughout the
'virtual experience' so that signals do not interfere. It is safe to predict
that virtual honeymoons are not going to be a big seller.
There is also the little matter of cost. A replay of today's ceremony could
be arranged for a moderate fee, Ms Rosewall said. But producing an original
virtual wedding in your own fantasy setting would require several weeks of
software development work - and might cost Dollars 50,000-Dollars 100,000
(Pounds 32,250-Pounds 64,500). Digital Equipment provided high-performance
workstations for the CyberWedding and San Francisco software designers at
Visions of Reality, built the virtual reality environment of Atlantis.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Scotland poised to win Dollars 1bn microchip factory

Scotland is poised to win a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) Japanese investment
which will make it the site for one of the world's most advanced
semiconductor plants.
NEC, the biggest chip maker after Intel of the US, is expected to build a
factory next to its plant at Livingston near Edinburgh, creating 1,000 jobs
on top of the 900 it already has there.
Although the Tokyo company would not confirm the decision last night, NEC is
understood to favour a European expansion rather than an addition to its
operations in Roseville, California, the other front-runner.
'We have an enormous facility in the US and so are looking at ways of
spreading production around,' an NEC official said. 'Livingston has a
workforce skilled in high-density semiconductors and is strategically
well-placed in Europe.'
British and US authorities have both been keen to secure the investment.
Although California has been hampered by its tougher regulations on air and
water pollution, the decision also depended on the incentives on offer.
California is likely to fight a rearguard action, with incentives to rival
those offered by the Scottish Office.
However, the availability of utilities as well as environmental permits are
believed to be the most important issue for NEC in its decision on where to
locate the new plant, with economic incentives playing very much a secondary
role.
The outlet will be modelled on NEC's latest plant in Kyushu, Japan, and will
produce memory chips. Initial output will be 16-megabit and 64-megabit
chips, honed from eight-inch silicon wafers, the largest the world
electronics industry has been able to employ on a commercial basis.
NEC expects world chip demand to grow by as much as 15 per cent this year.
It is anxious to expand foreign production not only because of the high
value of the yen but also to reduce exposure to Japanese suppliers of chip
components.

FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Mannesmann criticises ministry
over deregulation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The German postal ministry was yesterday accused of blocking private
telecommunications operators' efforts to prepare for deregulation of the
federal network.
'If private companies cannot prepare for the end of the telephone
monopolies, then giants like AT&amp;T will come and roll over the German market
when the day comes,' said Mr Peter Mihatsch, head of Mannesmann's
telecommunications division.
Calling for a time schedule for the introduction of competition, he attacked
the 'lack of objectivity' demonstrated by Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the minister
responsible.
Mannesmann and UK-based Mercury recently won temporary injunctions
preventing the ministry from awarding Germany's first in-flight mobile phone
service to DeTeMobil, a subsidiary of the state-controlled Deutsche Telekom.
A Cologne court found that bids from the three operators had been
effectively equally competitive. The issue now seems likely to be resolved
by a lottery.
Meanwhile, Mannesmann, lead operator of Germany's D-2 mobile phone network,
would press on with the search for new international partners, Mr Mihatsch
said in an interview with Handelsblatt, the business daily.
He was negotiating with several potential partners with the aim of providing
global corporate communications services based on Corporate Network
International, a newly-formed business.
CNI was recently approved by the European Commission as being good for
competition in the sector which had been the sole preserve of Deutsche
Telekom.
It is a joint venture between senior partner Mannesmann, Deutsche Bank and
RWE, the energy-based conglomerate.
Mannesmann was also looking for more partners in conventional mobile
telephone services, Mr Mihatsch said.

FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Volvo finds key to merger
failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The terms of a French government 'golden share' and uncertainty over the
privatisation of Renault were key issues which led to the collapse last year
of Volvo's plan to merge its car and truck operations with Renault, an
internal inquiry by the Swedish manufacturer has concluded.
The inquiry's author, Mr Arne Wittlov, head of Volvo Aerospace, also
indirectly criticised Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the former Volvo chairman who
resigned when the merger was blocked by a shareholder and management revolt,
for not tackling the deep concerns raised by the merger plan.
Although Volvo has not published the report, Mr Wittlov outlined his
conclusions in an interview in the company's internal magazine Volvo Now. He
said he had interviewed some 50 shareholders, executives, board members and
trade union members in the course of preparing his report.
He said the terms of the golden share the French government intended to keep
in the new Renault-Volvo after privatisation meant there was a risk that
Volvo's 35 per cent share in the merged company could ultimately be driven
down to 20 per cent.
'So there were many who reacted. The deal no longer appeared to be a merger
but more of a takeover. Furthermore, the deal was influenced by the lengthy
uncertainty surrounding the privatisation of Renault,' Mr Wittlov said. The
French government said it intended to sell off Renault by the end of 1994,
but could give no cast-iron pledges because of uncertainty over market
conditions.
Meanwhile, Mr Wittlov said, criticism and doubts grew within Volvo about the
industrial logic of the merger. 'People quite simply did not believe in the
benefits of co-operation . . . One can ask oneself if the mission was too
big. It was a terrific task to throw together two national treasures.'
Without mentioning Mr Gyllenhammar, Mr Wittlov added that a lesson of the
'traumatic' affair was the importance of analysing and communicating
strategy. 'A company undergoing change must have a visible leadership.
'The process of change must be well-organised,' he said. 'One must also show
respect for the worries and uncertainties. The difficulties of co-operation
must be admitted and confronted. One must also see the process of change
from a shareholder's perspective.'

FT  19 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Uphill fight for Taiwan grand plan - A
Dollars 300bn, six-year infrastructure programme suffers from cuts,
corruption and crime / The problems besetting a scheme to raise the
islanders' quality of life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After years of delays, the Mucha line of Taipei's Mass Rapid Transit system
is scheduled to start running by the end of the month. But no one is putting
money on that deadline being met either.
The Dollars 16.6bn Taipei MRT was to have been the centrepiece of Taiwan's
Dollars 300bn, six-year national infrastructure development plan, announced
in 1990 with great fanfare. Instead it has become a symbol of the troubles
of the ambitious scheme, which has been plagued by massive cuts, delays,
corruption and interference from organised crime.
Lured by glossy government brochures and the promise of substantial
business, international contractors flocked to Taiwan after the plan was
announced. Most have been disillusioned.
'The way things are structured right now, this is a terrible market - one of
the worst markets in Asia,' said an American working at an international
construction company. Like others interviewed he asked not to be identified.
'In this respect Taiwan is quite similar to Japan, although Japan has gotten
better in recent years. It's extremely difficult for outsiders to come in.
You can get jobs if you play the game, but to get jobs and make money -
that's a completely different story.'
Historically the ruling Nationalist party has been loath to invest in
infrastructure, preferring instead to bank funds for an illusory reconquest
of mainland China. After martial law was lifted in 1987 there was a public
outcry against the 'carpetbagger' regime. The development plan was in part
an attempt to address demands for services and improvements in the quality
of life for the highly industrialised island's 21m residents.
But the scheme was also used as a bargaining tool to wrest diplomatic
concessions from western governments. The US, the UK, France and Germany
risked Beijing's wrath subtly to upgrade relations with Taiwan.
Hence the plan's original eye-catching price tag, hugely inflated by the
inclusion of projects already under way. In fact only a third of the 700-odd
projects were new. In mid-1993 the plan was officially scaled back to some
300 projects costing more than Dollars 200bn. But two-thirds of them have
fallen well behind schedule and many others are being quietly dropped.
Projects on the drawing board include a proposed 345km high-speed rail from
Taipei to Kaohsiung at a cost of Dollars 16.7bn; a planned Dollars 10.8bn
mass transit system for the city of Kaohsiung; 22 power projects totalling
some Dollars 22bn, including the Dollars 6.7bn fourth nuclear power station,
now out to tender; a range of smaller environmental projects; and
telecommunications projects.
In late July the government said it planned to relax restrictions on foreign
companies' participation in the domestic construction industry to comply
with entry rules for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Taiwan
wants to join by the end of the year. The Gatt's government procurement
agreement stipulates that foreign companies must not be discriminated
against in the awarding of government contracts above Dollars 5m.
Before November 1993, bidding on public construction contracts in Taiwan was
open only to non-Japanese companies. This was part of an effort to counter
Taiwan's growing trade deficit with Japan. But many Japanese have been able
to circumnavigate these restrictions.
Citing obstacles ranging from labyrinthine bureaucracy to rigged bidding
practices, industry insiders expect strong resistance to implementing the
Gatt provisions.
Simply gaining access to information is the first difficulty. Five
ministries are in charge of developing and administering their own
individual projects, and there is little co-ordination.
Infrastructure projects tend to be dominated by state-run contractors,
especially the Bureau of Engineering Services and the Retired Servicemen's
Engineering Agency. Politicians are often shareholders in Taiwanese
contracting companies and have access to privileged information on tenders,
such as secret price ceilings. Politicians are also alleged to exert
influence on the bidding process. . Foreign companies complain of archaic
regulations out of line with international practices, complex bidding
criteria and tendering conditions, difficulties in procuring imported
labour, elaborate licensing systems and problems enforcing contractual
agreements.
Price ceilings are often set at unrealistically low levels, so foreign
companies may not bid directly. Instead they subcontract parts of the
project from the local company that wins the bid. This is however fraught
with hazards as the foreign company is used as a handy scapegoat if
something goes wrong.
The ubiquitous problem of underworld influence in the construction industry
has been made worse by the large sums of money involved in the six-year
plan.
'The gangsters are realising this is good business,' said a Taiwanese
working for a foreign engineering company.
Part of the problem is that the government gives out exceptionally high
advance payments - often 25 per cent - for contracts. Companies associated
with organised crime win the contract, take the advance payment offshore and
invest it. The actual work is then subcontracted out. This often results in
shoddy workmanship.

propaganda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr G. Venkataswamy, Indian textile minister, yesterday said US textile
producers had whipped up a propaganda campaign against imported Indian rayon
skirts because they were becoming a hot fashion item.
The US Consumer Products Safety Commission said last week that the
rayon-blended skirts could go up in flames in as little as four seconds and
asked importers to recall a quarter of a million of them from the market.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Cost cuts and higher sales drive VW back to profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen, Germany's biggest motor vehicle group, returned to profit in the
second quarter, attributing the improvement to restructuring and higher
sales.
It made a DM133m (Dollars 84.7m) net profit in the quarter after a DM342m
deficit in the first three months. As a result, the first-half loss was
reduced to DM209m compared with DM1.6bn in the first six months of 1993,
when the results were held back by huge rationalisation expenses.
Forecasting a slow revival in demand and more benefits to come from
cost-cutting, VW said yesterday it expected to break even for the full year.
In 1993 as a whole, VW lost DM1.9bn.
Analysts said the results were better than expected, and showed clear signs
that savings on labour and material costs were now coming through. Mr
Stephen Reitman at UBS in London said gross margins of 9.8 per cent in the
first half were VW's best for three years.
While production rose 3.9 per cent to 1.56m vehicles, operating expenses
which include materials and labour costs increased only 2.7 per cent, he
added.
On performance so far, he expected a modest group profit for the full year,
noting that official group forecasts had become much more cautious since
last year's predicted advances failed to materialise.
According to yesterday's report, the number of vehicles shipped to dealers
rose 8.5 per cent to 1.6m in the first half, and deliveries to customers
increased 7.8 per cent to 1.73m.
Customer sales for the group in Germany fell 3.9 per cent, slightly reducing
market share to 29 per cent. However, this was offset by a 7.5 per cent rise
elsewhere in western Europe. This resulted in a 2 per cent overall increase
in the region and a decline in market share from 16.9 to 16.5 per cent.
According to latest industry estimates, western European new car
registrations rose 6.6 per cent in the first seven months of the year.
Group turnover for the first half was up 6.4 per cent at DM40.8bn while
sales for Volkswagen AG, the German parent, slipped 4 per cent to DM21bn.
German production fell 1 per cent to 698,000 units, but output from foreign
factories jumped 8.2 per cent to 862,000.
This surge included a 19 per cent rise at Seat, the recently rescued Spanish
subsidiary which was blamed for most of last year's huge losses. Customer
sales of Seat marque vehicles increased 23 per cent in the review period.
Sales in China, the group's key developing market, rose 14 per cent to
73,500, while south America and South Africa together recorded a 32 per cent
advance to 272,000.

FT  19 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Royals firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Composite insurer Royal Insurance climbed 12 to 290p, in hefty trading of
11m shares, on reports that US Federal authorities had reached agreement
with insurers on a proposed new tax on insurers.
The action is part of the reform of superfund, a device to make money
available for pollution clean-ups, and the current suggestion is that the
tax be imposed in two stages, with a first stage running for four years. In
this period, it would be based 70 per cent on policies written over the last
20 years, and 30 per cent on policies written in the future. In later years,
65 per cent of the tax will be on future policies and 35 per cent on past
policies.
Robert Fleming Securities, the stockbroker, issued a robust buy circular on
the stock and said: 'If this 70/30 methodology is adopted, then we calculate
that the premium 'tax' or levy that Royal will have to pay will be under
Dollars 20m per annum - hardly an onerous or worrying prospect given that
Royal has set aside reserves of Dollars 248m . . . to cover US industrial
pollution losses.' SG Warburg was also said to be positive on the stock.
Among banking issues, a Smith New Court profits upgrade lifted Bank of
Scotland by 4 to 196p. Mr Simon Samuels at Smith raised his current-year
forecast by Pounds 18m to Pounds 444m, but said: 'Our profits forecast still
remains conservative given falls in bad debt seen elsewhere in the sector.'
News that a US district judge had decided that a big asbestos class action
settlement involving 20 companies that included T&amp;N was fair cheered the
market, leaving the stock 8 ahead at 247p. Mr Robert Speed at Henderson
Crosthwaite, a bull of the shares, commented: 'I believe this settlement
will put a cap on the potential liability under personal injury claim in the
US.'
It was the turn of Vodafone to star in the telecoms sector, with traders
reporting strong US interest. The shares climbed 11 to 206p in heavy trade
of 19m. Cable and Wireless also continued its firm performance of this week,
adding 8 at 456p. The stock has been buoyed by Hoare Govett and a warrant
from BZW.
The regional electricity companies (recs) were again a firm market as
investors continued to respond to the overwhelmingly solid support from
brokers on the sector post the Offer document. South West climbed 14 to
741p, East Midlands 13 to 713p and London 13 to 688p.
Scottish Power appreciated 9 to 407p, with Panmure Gordon recommending the
stock ahead of its Offer review next month. The broker forecasts a 10 per
cent upside for the shares. National Power edged forward a half-penny to
502p in brisk turnover of 7.8m on talk of a buy note from one of the big
US-owned houses.
There was renewed strong demand for shares in the Telegraph, the
London-based newspaper group, with turnover of 630,000 again topping usual
levels of activity. The hints in the market on Wednesday, suggesting that Mr
Conrad Black, who owns a near 57 per cent stake in the Telegraph group, may
have been buying Telegraph shares, were discounted by some dealers. They
said that as a director, Mr Black would be prohibited from buying shares in
the closed period ahead of the Telegraph's interim results, which are
scheduled for next Wednesday. The stock added 12 at 373p.
The ebb and flow of the oil workers' strike in Nigeria produced a firmer
trend in crude oil prices, but the oil majors were restrained by selling
said to have emanated from the US. BP settled 3 off at 408p and Shell
Transport the same amount lower at 721p.
British Gas moved up 3 to 295p on relatively heavy turnover of 11m shares,
boosted by talk of aggressive buying by US institutions.
Building materials group Rugby shed 4 to 146p in its highest recorded day's
volume of 12m shares, which included a 5.6m share block deal. The deal,
which some analysts linked to investment house BZW, is ahead of Rugby's
interim results at the end of the month. Andrews Sykes advanced 6 to 53p
after European Fire Protection announced the acquisition of 8.2 per cent of
the construction group's equity to bring its total holding to 42 per cent.
News International strengthened 10 ahead of results expected next week, to
254p. United Newspapers forged ahead 17 to 535p, with analysts suggesting
that an announcement by investment houses PDFM and UBS confirming that they
hold 10 per cent of the stock was the driving factor. Profit-takers
undermined the recent good run by Unilever, the shares retreating 10 to
1120p. Smith New Court also reiterated its sell stance. Northern Foods was
the subject of a profits downgrade and the shares slid 7 to 220p. Albert
Fisher, 2 softer at 47p, was also said to be receiving cuts to its forecasts
as brokers met with the company.

FT  19 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Rank hit as Thorn rides high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contrasting fortunes were visited on two of the leisure sector's largest
stocks yesterday as dealers reported big switching out of Rank Organisation
and into Thorn EMI.
Rank shares underwent a weak session, coming off particularly sharply after
lunchtime and ending a busy day 14 1/2 off at 402p. Turnover was 3.3m
shares. It was announced after the market closed that Mr J. Garret, a
director of the company, had sold more than 140,000 shares. Coincidentally,
there was also talk in the market of a badly executed sell order.
Meanwhile, investors were turning their attention to Thorn, spurred on by
positive comments from Goldman Sachs, NatWest Securities, James Capel and
Smith New Court. The shares rode high all day, finally coming to rest 23
ahead at 1058p after reasonable volume of 4m.
Analysts cited reports of higher video and cassette tape prices in the
European Union, the shares' recent underperformance - close on 10 per cent
against the market in the past three months - and the first-quarter results
due next week as some of the reasons for the strength in the shares.
Thorn is also taking analysts on a trip to see its US operations at the end
of the month, and there was some speculative buying ahead of what is
expected to be an upbeat presentation from the music and rental group.
Finally, the demerger story - suggesting that Thorn will float off its music
business from the rental division - was again doing the rounds, a move long
speculated on in the market and which, should it happen, would put a premium
on Thorn shares.

FT  19 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie retreats after piercing the
3,200 mark - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT-SE 100 Index successfully launched its expected attack on the 3,200
level, but it was hard won and quickly lost as the UK equity market
succumbed to repeated bouts of selling pressure in international bond
markets after disappointing economic news from the US.
The US news - in the form of a higher than forecast US international trade
deficit and worrying news from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, which
published its August inflation index - caused a sharp downturn on Wall
Street shortly after the US market had opened.
The American data came hard on the heels of news that the Bundesbank council
had signalled no change in German interest rates.
At the close the FT-SE 100 was 7.7 down at 3,182.6, around two points off
the day's low. The FT-SE Mid 250, however, gave a more resolute performance,
closing only 1.3 easier at 3,740.4, thanks to some sustained institutional
support for the second-line stocks, which tended to get left behind the
leaders' upsurge on Wednesday.
Earlier, the equity market had shrugged off a poor start and pierced the
3,200 mark on the Footsie following yet more encouraging pointers on the
domestic economy.
This included a lower than expected rise in the broad money supply - up 4.8
per cent year-on-year against most forecasts of around 5.5 per cent - and a
marginally higher than forecast increase in retail sales in July. A 0.4 per
cent rise in sales came against market expectations of around 0.3 per cent.
Dealers said the latest data put the seal on a week of all-round excellent
news on the domestic economy and had headed off any lingering fears of an
early rise in UK interest rates.
On Wednesday the market raced ahead in the wake of a much better than
expected decline in the July inflation rate.
The market opened modestly easier, with most instititutions holding off
ahead of the Bundesbank meeting. The FT-SE 100 was some three points adrift
of its overnight level, but was never under real selling pressure and was
back in positive territory within an hour of the opening.
Early pressure was exerted by a big seller of the Footsie future, but a
measure of the market's resilience was that a brief decline to around the
3,189 level on the future triggered a powerful burst of support which kept
the contract above the so-called resistance level of 3,194 for the rest of
the session.
At its best, shortly after midday, the Footsie was up more than 11 points
and seemingly set fair, with market optimists still hopeful of a cut in
German interest rates. These hopes were fuelled throughout the morning by
news that German money supply in July had risen by 9.9 per cent fromn the
previous year, well down from the 11.4 per cent figure for June.
The absence of a German rate cut was the signal for a sharp decline in bonds
across the world, with UK gilts, around  1/4 higher shortly after the
opening, subsequently retreating to close with losses of around 3/4 at the
long end.
Equities moved down along with gilts, with the weak opening on Wall Street
producing more downside pressure on the market.
Marketmakers were by no means disheartened by the London market's
performance. 'We still feel okay, but all eyes are still firmly fixed on
bonds,' said one senior trader.
He emphasised that most marketmakers were trying to avoid taking big book
positions in such volatile markets. 'You only have to look at the big movers
to see where the marketmakers have been caught out.'
Turnover of 674m shares was regarded as slightly disappointing and well down
from Wednesday's 771.9m, which represented customer business worth Pounds
1.63bn.

FT  19 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lower than expected US trade figures combined with general profit-taking to
bring a retreat in stock index futures, pulling the near month Footsie
contract back below the 3,200 level, writes Joel Kibazo.
The opening trade in the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 was
recorded at 3,205 and early profit-taking following Wednesday's strong run
saw it drift lower shortly after the opening.
The decision by the Bundesbank to leave its key interest rate figures
unchanged was quickly followed by a retreat in bond markets, triggering
active selling in September.
After briefly steadying ahead of lunchtime, the contract once again came
under pressure after the release of US economic data.
Dealers talked of a 'tired market after Wednesday's run', but there were
also reports of a big bear position in the market, with one dealer said to
have tried and failed to push the market lower.
September finished at 3,199, down 8 from its previous close and some 7
points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of around 10 points. Volume
was 12,828 lots.
The traded options remained buoyant ahead of today's expiry of the index
options. Total turnover was 47,883 contracts, of which 20,817 were dealt in
the FT-SE 100 option and 6,206 in the Euro FT-SE option.

FT  19 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): New inflation threat takes
Dow lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks suffered a sharp setback yesterday as bonds retreated on fresh
signs of inflation, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 21.05 lower at 3,755.43 after
takeover speculation and Wall Street reratings had buffeted many individual
stocks. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 2.00 to 463.17.
Volume on the Big Board came to 293.7m shares, with declining issues
outpacing rises by 1,287 to 346. In the secondary markets, the American SE
composite was off 1.39 at 443.55 and the Nasdaq composite 0.49 easier at
742.17.
From the opening, the optimism inspired by the Federal Reserve earlier in
the week showed further signs of erosion. Equities receded for a second day
as investors focused on the latest turn taken by the volatile bond market.
Although the Fed's decision to lift short-term interest rates was supposed
to have cleared the way for a sustained upturn, Treasury bonds tumbled again
on the news of mounting inflationary pressures.
The catalyst was the monthly survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia, which offered evidence that manufacturers were passing along
the higher cost of raw materials to customers. During the morning equities
suffered only modest losses. But bonds ploughed deeper into negative ground
and stocks were pulled down to near their session's lows in the late
afternoon.
Among the Dow industrials, International Business Machines and Coca-Cola
were two bright spots. IBM gained Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 66 1/4 after
Merrill Lynch raised its 1994 earnings and revenue projections. Coca-Cola
climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 47 5/8 a day after it emerged that Mr
Warren Buffett had increased his stake in the company.
Offsetting those gains, Caterpillar was down Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 108
and General Motors shed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 49 7/8 . Ford lost Dollars
1 1/8 at Dollars 29 1/2 and Chrysler fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 47 1/4 .
Deere gave back Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 66 7/8 after rising Dollars 2 1/2
in the previous session. But Navistar put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 14 7/8
as the truck and engine manufacturer posted improved third-quarter profits
and raised its projections of North American demand for heavy-duty trucks
this year.
Joy Technologies, which makes coal mining machinery, advanced Dollars 1 5/8
to Dollars 11 7/8 after agreeing to be acquired by Harnischfeger, a rival
supplier. News of the deal sent Harnischfeger's share price Dollars 1 1/4
lower to Dollars 22 1/8 .
Quaker Oats achieved a 52-week high of Dollars 82 1/8 after jumping Dollars
6, or 8 per cent. Investors were betting that a takeover was imminent. Two
other cereal makers also rang up big gains. Kellogg was Dollars 2 1/8 ahead
at Dollars 56 5/8 and General Mills added Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 55 3/8 .
In pharmaceuticals, Schering-Plough gave back Dollars 1 3/8 to finish at
Dollars 69 1/2 . Salomon Brothers said takeover speculation this month had
made the issue too expensive. Instead, excitement over the industry's
consolidation shifted to Mylan Laboratories, a generic drugs maker, boosting
its share price Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 26 1/8 .
The Nasdaq was held back by a Dollars 4 3/8 decline in Lotus Development's
share price to Dollars 41 3/8 . The selling followed cautious comments by at
least two Wall Street analysts.
Canada
Toronto shares lost ground as the US dollar weakened following Tuesday's
interest rate increases. Traders said market participants had expected the
US currency to rally after the rate rises, and were disappointed by its
performance.
The TSE 300 composite index declined 20.83 to 4,184.44, while falling issues
outnumbered advances by 407 to 311 after volume of 57.0m shares valued at
CDollars 681.9m.
All but one of the 14 stock groups declined, led by transportation and real
estate, which lost 1.83 and 1.63 per cent respectively. Consumer products
fell 1.30 per cent.
Mexico
Equities fluctuated before finishing marginally easier in mixed, volatile
trading ahead of the presidential election at the weekend.
The IPC index of 37 leading shares closed 1.41 points off at 2,698.24 after
moving within a 27-point range.
Brazil
Sao Paulo stocks were up 1.16 per cent at the close, but off the morning's
highs, as a rally founded on positive political and economic expectations
continued for the third straight session. The Bovespa index gained 576 at
50,266 in turnover of RDollars 486.5m (Dollars 543.6m).

FT  19 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Bullion rise lifts gold issues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A late rise in the bullion price to Dollars 380 an ounce encouraged gold and
related shares, and the sector index saw the day's best performance,
climbing 29, or 1.4 per cent, to 2,181.
The overall index shed 11 to 5,813 and industrials gained 5 at 6,610.
De Beers fell throughout the session after the previous day's advance,
shedding R3.75 to R109.50. Anglos rose 50 cents to R257.50 and Minorco
receded 75 cents to R111.75.
Randgold finished 25 cents off at R8.50 after a session's low of R8, in
reaction to shareholder approval of a management takeover.
In golds, Freegold moved forward R1.50 to R68, Loraine added 50 cents at R20
and Joel gained 15 cents at R6.80.
Elsewhere, Sasol hardened 50 cents to R31.25.

FT  19 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): BASF first-half results
disappoint the optimists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the Bundesbank unwilling to move, bourses lacked the additional impetus
on key rates that some analysts expected, but there was a stream of major
corporate results to keep interest alive,
FRANKFURT weakened from a Dax high of 2,161.37 before the Buba announcement
to close 8.73 lower at 2,153.56, easing a fraction more after hours to close
the afternoon at an Ibis-indicated 2,151.44.
Turnover fell from DM7.8bn to DM5.9bn. Progress reports came from
Volkswagen, in the automotive sector, and from BASF, Henkel and Gehe, the
last three all broadly in or around the German chemical industry.
A 41 per cent rise to DM683m in BASF's half-year pre-tax profits came in
below most analysts' forecasts, which ranged from DM700m to well above
DM1bn. This left the shares DM3.20 lower at DM326.50, with a further fall to
DM324.10 after hours.
The other members of the 'big three' chemicals trio, Bayer and Hoechst, are
due to report next week. Bayer, the least cyclical of the three and less
favoured in the pre-results excitement of recent weeks, fell only DM1.70 to
DM368.20 at the end of the day; but Hoechst, burdened with short- term gains
after the recent tale that it could turn ozone into oxygen, fell DM6 to
DM351.
Mr Martin Glen at Lehman Brothers said BASF had restructuring and its own
particular attribute, a line for 'other expenses', before it came to the
pre-tax level. Given the unpredictability of this effect the BASF figures,
he added, would not alter his forecasts of bumper results from Bayer and
Hoechst next week.
Volkswagen slipped in spite of forecasting a break-even for the full year,
dropping DM4.50 to DM508.50; Henkel reported an increase of more than 10 per
cent in first-half profits and fell DM9 to DM585 late in the day; but Gehe,
in the recently embattled pharmaceuticals sector, forecast a rise in pre-tax
profits this year from DM193m to DM250m, and left its shares DM7 stronger at
DM595.
PARIS finished 1.2 per cent down under pressure from the bond market and the
weaker dollar. The CAC-40 index declined 24.44 to 2,010.54 in turnover of
FFr2.5bn.
Pinault-Printemps dipped FFr9 to FFr920 on news that it was acquiring a 66.6
per cent stake in the FNAC retail chain, following an agreement with the
minority shareholder Generale des Eaux, down FFr7 at FFr536.
Euro-Disney slipped 25 centimes to FFr10.35 after announcing that the
finance director was to leave the group following the completion of its
restructuring programme.
AMSTERDAM moved lower as a further batch of corporate results disappointed
investors, while scant attention was given to the formation of the new
government, which was expected to be sworn in formally on Monday.
The AEX index slipped 3.63 to 414.17.
Van Ommeren, the Rotterdam-based transport and storage group, fell back
after announcing lower than expected first-half results, closing off Fl 2.40
at Fl 53.30. The company announced a first-half net profit of Fl 24.1m,
against analysts' expectations of between Fl 23m and Fl 30m.
Fokker closed unchanged at Fl 16.80 ahead of its first-half results, showing
a drop of 54 per cent over the same year-ago period, which came in after the
close. The aircraft manufacturer commented that in spite of the first-half
figures, it expected results for the full year to show an improvement on an
annual basis.
Among second-tier stocks, Getronics, the computer services company, moved Fl
2.20 higher to Fl 51.90 after pleas-ing the market with a 19 per cent
increase in first-half profits.
MILAN greeted the first day of the new account with a slight loss, and
brokers remarked that trading activity continued to be downbeat in light of
the political problems overhanging the market.
The Comit index receded 4.39 to 644.83.
At the start of its capital increase, BCI fell an effective 1.2 per cent to
L3,550 as its L2,300bn rights issue, priced at L3,000, came on stream. The
capital increase programme, which aims to raise some L2,360bn, is due to run
for the length of the September account.
Telecom Italia made its debut on the market yesterday - it replaced the
quotation for Sip - and the shares closed at L4,190, up L75.
ZURICH had an unhappy day, depressed by a fall in German bund futures, the
weak dollar and a continued hammering, said Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Bank
Sal Oppenheim, for domestic bank shares after the shock of the SBC results.
The SMI index fell 15.8 to 2,583.5. In the banking sector, SBC lost another
SFr7 at SFr371 and UBS fell SFr8 to SFr1,114. In industrials, Brown Boveri
tumbled SFr30 to SFr1,215 on further profit-taking after good first-half
results from its Swedish/Swiss parent group ABB.
STOCKHOLM rallied, supported by good half-year results from Ericsson and a
sharp decline in Swedish bond yields. The Affarsvarlden General index moved
forward 7.90 to 1,413.90.
Ericsson's 78 per cent jump in half-year pre-tax profits was but a
prediction of continued strong growth in new orders and left the 'B' shares
SKr16 higher at SKr418; the big telecoms group's performance in the New York
market later suggested that there might be scope for a further rise today.
In this, more elevated, atmosphere Brown Boveri's Swedish partner, Asea,
declined only SKr2 to SKr614.
COPENHAGEN had its own banking shock as Den Danske Bank, Denmark's largest
banking group, reported an 85 per cent drop in pre-tax profits due to large
losses on securities trading.
DDB fell DKr7 to DKr336, its rival Unidanmark, due to report next week, by
DKr4 to DKr228, and the KFX index by 1.12 to 110.56.
MADRID featured some individual gains, including a Pta150 rise to Pta11,950
in Bankinter, but most banks and the market were unhappy under pressure from
weakness in the bond futures market, and the Madrid General index closed
2.59 lower at 307.08 in thin turnover of Pta21.74bn.
ATHENS fell 2.25 per cent to close below the support level of 880 as
investors took profits, especially in the construction sector. The general
index lost 20.19 at 876.18.
Turnover was Dr4.58bn in volume of 1.7m shares.
Losers led gainers by 142 to 19, with 20 issues unchanged.

FT  19 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region mixed, analysts
look at earnings prospects

<TEXT>
Share prices remained depressed for most of the day as the yen's rise above
the Y100 level against the dollar hurt investor confidence, but afternoon
buying led by dealers finally supported the Nikkei index, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average closed 38.21 up at the day's high of 20,862.77 after
a low of 20,772.15. The yen's appreciation hit export-oriented electricals,
and the index declined in spite of buying by overseas investors. Late
index-linked demand from brokers eventually lifted shares.
Volume amounted to 266m shares, down from Wednesday's 356m. The Topix index
of all first section stocks lost a marginal 0.66 at 1,663.09 and the Nikkei
300 was off just 0.03 at 302.76. Declines led rises by 505 to 435, with 215
issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index slipped 4.54 to
1,349.14.
Overseas investors continued to buy steels and chemicals, but the gains were
eroded by profit-taking. Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, eased Y1
to Y374 and Sumitomo Chemical dipped Y3 to Y575.
In spite of the low trading volumes, Nomura Securities advanced Y30 to
Y2,330, while other leading brokerages held steady. With average turnover
slowing to Y340bn per day, Baring Securities in Tokyo believed that earnings
at the Big Four houses - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi - and 10 second
tier brokers could be weaker than previous estimates based on a forecast of
daily turnover averaging Y450bn.
Meanwhile, Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo, which believed that turnover had
bottomed out, was advising investors to include in their portfolios
medium-sized brokerages with larger sensitivity to equity commissions.
Multimedia and telecommunications related stocks, which had been firmer on
Wednesday, lost ground as profits were taken. Victor dropped Y40 to Y1,350
and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y1,000 to Y879,000. DDI, the
long distance telecom operator listed on the second section, fell Y30,000 to
Y1m.
High-technology stocks were lower on the yen's rise: Toshiba receded Y5 to
Y764 and NEC Y10 to Y1,230.
Japan Airlines moved ahead Y13 to Y773 on buying led by foreign investors,
who expected the company to benefit from a restructuring plan, as well as
the sharp rise in overseas travel during the summer holidays.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 17.40 down at 23,189.90 in volume of 44.1m
shares. Export-related shares declined, with Shima Seiki, a machinery maker,
losing Y100 at Y8,700.
Roundup
Following this week's increase in US interest rates - a move broadly
welcomed by the world's financial markets - analysts yesterday were
expecting investors in the south and south-east Asian region to concentrate
on earnings growth.
With the exception of Hong Kong, earnings in the region had generally
exceeded expectations, they said, assisted by relatively low inflation and
interest rates. No slowdown in growth was seen in Malaysia and Singapore in
1995, while Thailand and Indonesia were expected to see an acceleration in
earnings momentum.
The one exception to the positive picture was China: most brokers continued
to underweight the market in light of the economic and political
uncertainties overhanging equities.
SINGAPORE closed higher, boosted by buying of blue chips. The Straits Times
Industrial index gained 13.57 at 2,357.97. Analysts expected the market to
ease slightly soon, having strengthened 10 per cent since early July.
SEOUL was pushed up by selective interest in blue chips. Both Samsung
Electronics and Korea Mobile Telecom set record highs again, Samsung
advancing Won3,000 to Won104,400 and Korea Mobile rising the day's limit to
end Won10,000 up at Won420,000.
The composite index put on 3.52 at 946.48 and volume rose from 21.1m shares
to 30.5m.
TAIPEI fell sharply on heavy profit-taking by institutions. The weighted
index ended 59.74 lower at 6,586.16 and turnover was active at TDollars
107bn.
MANILA eased on a technical correction. The composite index shed 25.63 to
3,004.07, having peaked at 3,054 during the day. Bank of Philippine Islands,
one of the country's top five commercial banks, was the most heavily traded,
its shares falling 3.6 per cent to 1,060 pesos.
SYDNEY finished mildly firmer, overseas investors having encouraged a
recovery from a morning low. The All Ordinaries index was finally 7.3 up at
2,066.8 in volume of 153.7m shares as the market warmed to Wednesday's key
interest rate rise to 5.5 per cent. CRA jumped 22 cents to a record closing
high of ADollars 19.48.
WELLINGTON's NZSE-40 index softened 4.08 to 2,097.38 in thin turnover of
NZDollars 34m. INL slipped 9 cents to NZDollars 5.20 ahead of its annual
profits announcement today, which promises to be busy with half a dozen
companies due to report.
HONG KONG digested Wednesday's sharp gains and the US rate rise, while
investors took a close look at the prospects of an increase in domestic key
rates and how this would affect equities. Property shares were weak as the
Hang Seng index retreated 19.09 to 9,518.89 in turnover down from HKDollars
5.66bn to a preliminary total of HKDollars 3.50bn.
BOMBAY finished at a record closing high as buying by foreign investors and
speculators forced local mutual funds to stop their selling and keep to the
sidelines. The BSE index was ahead 27.83 at 4,534.33. Gujarat Ambuja Cement
rose Rs30 to Rs770 after the company announced a board meeting for today to
declare a scrip issue, its annual results and a dividend.
JAKARTA was led higher by a range of blue chips, closing 9.28, or 1.9 per
cent, better at 492.88. Analysts suggested that firm foreign sentiment and
local bullish interest were the market's main driving factors.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Buba keeps rates steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank council's decision yesterday to keep rates on hold unnerved
interest rate markets and put renewed pressure on the dollar, writes Philip
Gawith.
At its first meeting after the summer recess, the central bank left the
discount rate at 4.5 per cent and the Lombard rate at 6 per cent. It also
fixed the repo rate for a further two weeks at 4.85 per cent.
Markets were disappointed, since the earlier news that German M3 had grown
at an annualised rate of 9.9 per cent in July, below expectations, had
boosted hopes of a rate cut.
The US currency later came under further pressure when Commerce Department
figures showed that the June trade gap with Japan had widened by 25.8 per
cent to Dollars 5.52bn, reminding the market that the trade dispute with
Japan remains a potent, unresolved issue.
For the first time in a number of weeks, the dollar closed in London below
Y100, finishing at Y99.025 from Y100.26. Against the D-Mark it ended at
DM1.5456 from DM1.5603. In New York it finished lower at Y98.595 and
DM1.5436.
The D-Mark was again the beneficiary of generalised strength, closing higher
against most European currencies. The lira slipped back to L1,025 from
L1,018 and the French franc closed at FFr3.436 from FFr3.430.
Sterling was also a victim of D-Mark strength, finishing at DM2.3889 from
DM2.4009. It was firmer against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5457 from
Dollars 1.5388.
The dollar fell prey to a combination of concerns about inflation and the
trade dispute with Japan. Whatever the cause, there was little doubt at the
end of the day that the 50 basis-point rise in US rates earlier this week
has had little, if any, lasting impact.
The dollar's problems started with the Bundesbank's decision to keep rates
on hold, which simply added momentum to recent D-Mark strength. Matters were
aggravated in the afternoon by the release of June trade figures, and the
Philadelphia Fed index.
The jump in the trade deficit with Japan, coupled with US commerce secretary
Mr Ron Brown's comments that it remained unacceptable, reminded the market
that this problem area remains an ongoing source of conflict, and prompted
further dollar sales.
To aggravate matters further, the prices component of the Philadelphia Fed
index rose sharply. This unnerved US bonds, and the dollar weakened in
sympathy.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said: 'The
currency market clearly feels that the Fed is still a bit behind the game in
terms of controlling inflation pressures.'
He said the market appeared unhappy with the current wisdom that the Fed
will not act again before November, when the mid-term congressional
elections are out of the way.
With US asset prices under pressure, Mr Hannah said it was also a fine
decision whether higher interest rates outweighed the problem of potential
capital losses.
Although the trade weighted sterling index finished only slightly lower at
78.7, from 78.8, analysts said the pound's fall below DM2.40 was beginning
to unnerve the market.
'More and more people are worrying that the pound is drifting in rather an
ominous way against the D-Mark,' said Mr Hannah. Recent good news, he added,
in the form of firm growth and low inflation, had ironically been bad news.
'There have been too many excuses for politicians to avoid doing the evil
deed of raising interest rates.'
Mr Peter Luxton, economist at Barclays in London, echoed the point,
commenting: 'The market almost wants bad news to see whether the Bank (of
England) will raise rates.'
Sterling appears to have been caught in the backwash from last week's rise
in Swedish and Italian rates. Until recently the general assumption was that
the UK would be the first European country to raise rates. Now that it has
been beaten to it, the fear has again arisen of doing too little, too late
in combatting inflation.
'The UK is running the risk of getting a little too far behind the game,'
said Mr Hannah. 'The longer you delay, the more likely the market is to
conclude: if you are not prepared to give way on interest rates, we will
give way on the currency.'
He noted that the Fed had lifted interest rates five times this year, in
spite of good headline inflation figures. Australia also raised rates this
week, by 75 basis points, against the background of better than expected
inflation numbers.
The Bundesbank's decision unnerved interest rate markets, reflected in the
poor performance of short sterling and Euromark futures. The December short
sterling contract fell five basis points to 93.31, while the equivalent
Euromark contract closed at 94.83 from 94.86.
Traders said that the short sterling market remained very nervous, with any
good news almost immediately discounted.
The Bank of England provided Pounds 624m assistance, at established rates,
to UK money markets after forecasting a Pounds 600m shortage.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Revised figures show stronger
demand for zinc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demand for zinc, a metal used mainly by galvanised steel producers and in
castings for the automotive and building industries, has been much more
buoyant so far this year than it was previously believed.
According to the London-based International Lead and Zinc Study Group, an
intergovernmental organisation, zinc consumption in the first half of 1994
was 2.2 per cent ahead of that for the same months last year at 2.798m
tonnes. A month ago the ILZSG reported that consumption in the first five
months was down by 1.3 per cent from the 1994 level at 2.245m tonnes.
The study group said yesterday that it had made the hefty revision because
it now had more reliable statistics from the US where zinc consumption
growth was much stronger than expected in the first half. Also, demand in
Europe had remained stable rather than making the anticipated slip
downwards.
The latest statistics suggest that output of refined zinc outside for former
communist bloc in the first half was below demand - but still rising. It was
1 per cent above the 1993 first-half at 2.752m tonnes.
However, eastern bloc exports, particularly from China, were causing the
zinc market real damage, suggested Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, an
affiliate of Jardine Fleming,pointed out that last year Chinese zinc exports
rose to a record 148,000 tonnes, an 85 per cent jump from the 80,000 tonnes
exported in 1992. 'This (Chinese) zinc has been homeless and has bloated
London Metal Exchange stocks to all-time record levels of 1.223m tonnes,' he
said. 'A dramatic supply side development,' such as a smelter closure, was
essential for any sustained recovery in the zinc price.
Mr Jim Lennon, analyst at Macquarie, the Australian bank, said, however,
that, the zinc price seemed unlikely to go much lower as good European
buying emerged any time it dipped to Dollars 950 a tonne. Last night zinc
for delivery in three months closed on the LME at Dollars 969.50, up Dollars
5 a tonne.
Legislation is to be passed to prevent the US Defence Logistic Agency
disposing of any more zinc from its stockpile - except to other governments
 -between October and April. Producers have voiced concern about DLA sales
of up to 50,000 tonnes a year.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: China's cotton supply crisis
deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's cotton production will fall well short of demand this year,
according to a recent survey conducted by the country's State Statistical
Bureau. The shortfall seems likely to exacerbate chronic supply problems at
Chinese mills.
The bureau, which surveyed China's nine main cotton producing areas,
concluded that the area planted this year was between 5.26m and 5.55m
hectares.
A western agricultural attache said 5.3m ha would yield about between 4.6m
ant 4.7m tonnes, 10 per cent less than the country's domestic requirement.
But he also said it was difficult to forecast China's imports, which might
be as high as 400,000 tonnes, without details of the extent and condition of
its stockpile.
China's cotton sector was plunged into crisis earlier in the year with
textile mills throughout the country starved of supplies. An increase in the
international price, stockpiling by local authorities and corruption in the
state supply system worsened the problem. Dozens of mills were forced to
reduce output or stop production altogether, causing lay-offs of thousands
of employees.
Chinese media this week reported a fall of 34 per cent in state purchases of
cotton in the first quarter, indicating continuing supply problems.
Chinese farmers in the northern regions, which account for the bulk of
production, are also facing a threat from the boll worm infestation that has
wrecked crops in the past few years. China's cotton harvest slumped from
5.6m tonnes in 1991 to 3.7m tonnes last year, partly because the boll worm
has developed resistance to pesticides.
Cotton mills have been facing dual problems of lack of supply and poor
quality cotton, some of which has been adulterated deliberately to increase
its weight, according to Chinese media. Newspapers reported recently that to
secure a higher price suppliers, including state companies, had added to
cotton bails bricks, stones, oil, rice waste, sand, husks, glass and iron
chips. The Economic Daily said that a nation-wide inspection programme in
March found that only 55.26 per cent of cotton was usable, down from 78.46
per cent a year earlier.
Mr Huang Jin, head of the agriculture service department in the Ministry of
Internal Trade said the cotton market had become extremely disorderly,
characterised by panic buying, hoarding and rampant speculation, according
to a Reuters despatch.
Cotton is the one commodity whose supply and price is still controlled, but
the chaos in the market indicates that state control is unravelling.
Customs figures for the first six months this year showed that imports
reached 100,000 tonnes, a 14.8 per cent rise over the same period last year.

failure of the three months delivery COPPER price to maintain an early
afternoon break through resistance around Dollars 2,420 a tonne injected
some caution into late trading at the London Metal Exchange.
'Most metals looked strong in the first rings (organised trading sessions)
but when copper fell back it brought out profit-taking and buyers backed
off,' a trader said.
NICKEL was again a busy market as it continued its upward correction after
the past month's heavy losses.

<TEXT>
London coffee futures followed New York prices down and then up again
yesterday as speculators continued to call the tune in thin markets.
Follow-through selling after an overnight plunge at New York's Coffee, Sugar
and Cocoa Exchange wiped out what remained of this week's rally in early
trading at the London Commodity Exchange.
The November delivery position, which had fallen Dollars 75 the previous
day, opened at Dollars 3,265 a tonne, Dollars 101 below Wednesday's close,
and slipped another Dollars 15 before the selling dried up.
By the close it was back up to Dollars 3,340 a tonne, but that was still
Dollars 26 down on the day.
Traders said it was the withdrawal of sellers rather the appearance of
buyers that turned the market round.
Colombia exported 5.6m bags (60kg each) of coffee in the first six months of
1994, according to figures from Quintero Hermanos, the company used by the
National Coffee Growers Federation to collect statistics, reports Reuters
from Bogota.
The figure was sharply down from the 7.133m bags exported in the
corresponding period of 1993.

FT  19 AUG 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wool prices have continued to advanced on a broad front, and as auctions
have been resumed in the new selling season the pace has tended to
accelerate. There are variations between sectors. Finer merinos are in short
supply, and remaining stocks held in the official Australian stockpile are
low. Demand meanwhile is building up with fashion one factor, and
anticipation of shortages to come another. The world crossbred wool
situation is also obviously firmer with supplies and stocks seen as liable
to fall short of demand. Only with middle micron merinos is the Australian
stockpile seen as a holding factor, and this is not enough to prevent price
rises here also. Wool international's Eastern states market indicator closed
706 cents yesterday, compared with 693 a week ago.

India's mineral production rose by 21 per cent to Rs26.04bn in the year
ending March, 1994, ending a long downward trend, according to figures
released by the Indian Bureau of Mines, a government organisation under the
Ministry of Mines.
Coal accounted for Rs12.78bn, or 49 per cent, of the country's total mineral
production, excluding atomic and minor minerals. Crude oil accounted for
Rs7.61bn, utilised natural gas Rs2.27bn, iron ore Rs880m, lignite Rs700m,
and limestone Rs470m.
Most important minerals showed gains in March from the previous month.
Output of coal was up 21 per cent to 30.2m tonnes, crude oil 28 per cent to
2.6m tonnes, natural gas 14 per cent to 1227m cubic metres, limestone 14 per
cent to 7.7m tonnes, iron ore 15 per cent to 6m tonnes, lignite 19 per cent
to 2.2m tonnes, manganese ore 4 per cent to 140,000 tonnes, chromite 12 per
cent to 105,000 tonnes, bauxite 5 per cent to 582,000 tonnes, copper ore 9
per cent to 435,000 tonnes, gold 34 per cent to 234kg, and magnesite 11 per
cent to 30,000 tonnes.
Production of lead concentrates, however, fell 13 per cent to 4,160 tonnes,
zinc concentrates 5 per cent to 22,317 tonnes and apatite and phosphorite 4
per cent to 130,000 tonnes each.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price rises brighten outlook
for NZ wool - Auction returns yesterday reached the highest level for 27
months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand wool growers are looking forward to the future with increased
confidence following a rise in prices to 27-month highs yesterday. With
demand forecast to outstrip supply the market uptrend is expected to be
maintained over the next two years.
Declining sheep numbers in the country, the world's biggest producer of
carpet wools, are expected to lead to production this season falling to its
lowest level for nearly 20 years, while supplies will be further reduced as
the Wool Board, now called Wools of New Zealand, sells the last of its
stockpile.
Wool brokers say that a growing appreciation of reducing availability of New
Zealand's coarser type wools has been a major factor in the market strength
of recent weeks.
The indicator at yesterday's North and South Island auctions reached
NZDollars 5.18 (Pounds 2) a kilogram, up six cents from last week. When the
season began three weeks ago it stood at Dollars 4.87.
Mr Patrick Conway an analyst with Wools of New Zealand said yesterday that
there would be disappointment if New Zealand did not achieve an average
price for this season in the Dollars 4.75 to Dollars 5 a kilogram range,
compared with only Dollars 4.14 in the year to June.
Mr Charles Hall of JS Brooksbanks and Company, a German-owned export house,
thought , however, that while the outlook was for rising prices in the
immediate future, there were grounds for caution on whether they would keep
on rising at recent rates. He pointed out that many of the major buyers over
the last two years, including India, Nepal, Iran and Turkey, now faced
serious financial and economic problems, while there were question marks
over the buying power of China, which takes the bulk of the clip.
Nevertheless, Mr Hall noted that a lot of business was being done with
buyers from Europe, the US, Japan and China, much of it for delivery some
way in the future. He saw that as an indication of overseas confidence that
recent higher prices would be sustained over the next five to six months.
Mr Conway said an analysis by Wools of New Zealand showed that the amount of
wool available for sale in the current season would be the lowest since the
1976 season.
New Zealand's production in the 1994-95 season is forecast to fall 2 per
cent to 205,000 tonnes. And the board has cut its stockpile from 87,000
tonnes when it was forced to stop supporting the market in 1991 to 21,000
tonnes this week.
Total availability this season is thus indicated at 230,000 tonnes, compared
with recent annual consumption of New Zealand wool of 245,000 tonnes -
226,000 tonnes for the export market plus domestic sales of 19,000 tonnes.
'Clearly this level of demand is unable to met from supply this season, let
alone in the 1995-96 season when all the former board stocks are sold and
production is 205,000 tonnes,' Mr Conway said.
'If demand remains at the current level, price increases must occur.'
He noted that while some customers such as Turkey were having major economic
problems, there were indications that demand at retail level in Germany
remained very strong for hand knitted carpets from Asia. Retail sales
remained high in China, and there were reports that its supplies of wool
were low.
'Looking ahead over the rest of the season we expect other markets, such as
Europe and Japan to show greater demand, offsetting the difficulties in
Turkey and other weak economies,' he said. 'Overall we see aggregate demand
to be at the same level as last season, or perhaps slightly stronger as the
major economies move out of recession.'
Releasing figures for the 1993-94 season, Mr Roger Buchanan, Wools of New
Zealand's group manager, fibre technology, said that there was an
encouraging 12 per cent, or NZDollars 140m increase in sales to NZDollars
1.285bn. Fibre export sales were up by 25 per cent to 226,000 tonnes.
Mr Buchanan said the volume increase was mainly due to sales of wool from
the board's stockpile, and a 9 per cent increase in production.
China increased its purchases by 65 per cent to 60,260 tonnes, while the
combined China/Hong market accounted for nearly one third of New Zealand 's
fibre exports. Total shipments this year were more than 72,000 tonnes, a
rise of 59 per cent.
Another encouraging feature of the year was the increase in shipments to
western Europe - mainly reflecting recovery in the British economy. British
mills increased their wool imports by 41 per cent from June 1993 to 23,000
tonnes. There was also keener interest from Germany, Belgium and Italy.
India and Nepal remained important markets, accounting for 29,100 tonnes, up
200 tonnes from last year. Exports to India increased from 11,200 tonnes to
17,200 tonnes, a rise of 54 per cent; but exports to Nepal fell from 17,700
tonnes to 11,900 tonnes. The continuing recession in Japan was reflected in
sales remaining significantly below those of earlier years.

FT  19 AUG 94 / People: Crockfords bets on Woodcock
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of Britain's top casinos has recruited one of Britain's top bobbies to
keep an eye on things.
Sir John Woodcock, 62, a former chief inspector of constabulary, is joining
the board of Crockfords, owner of one of London's most profitable casinos.
Crockfords, which came to the stock market last year through a reverse
takeover of TV-am, is keen to be regarded as the blue chip company in the
gambling sector. Sir John's appointment as a non-executive director is
designed to help fulfil this ambition.
He is a former chief constable of both North Yorkshire and South Wales and
was a principal adviser on policing matters to the Home Secretary between
1990 and 1993.
The Home Office has always taken a close interest in Britain's gaming
industry because of concerns that the huge sums of cash passing over casino
tables would attract criminal elements.
Gary Nesbitt, 51, Crockfords' chairman, said that Sir John will bring the
number ofnon-executives to five and thus mean that the non-executives are in
a majority on his board.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Property: Window shopping - Rising investment interest in
European retail centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RUSSELL SCHILLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cross-border property investment grew rapidly in the late 1980s in the UK,
but the focus was mainly on city-centre offices rather than shopping
centres. Two recent deals suggest that this trend may be changing.
First, the Australian Lend Lease company stepped in as lead investor and
developer of the proposed Bluewater Park regional shopping centre near
Dartford in south-east England. Although the source of much of the money
invested is British, Lend Lease, with a large portfolio of shopping centres
in Australia and America, will be driving the devel-opment.
Second, was the announcement that Pillar Properties, now successfully
floated, had set up a Pounds 250m joint venture with SITQ, the largest
public pension fund in Canada, to invest in UK shopping centres.
The two deals, both concluded in June, are remarkable for their scale, and
are just the latest in an accelerating number of investments in UK shopping
centres by overseas funds.
According to Hillier Parker, surveyors, between 1991 and the first half of
this year, 138 deals were concluded involving interests in Britain's 763
shopping centres; in effect, this means that since 1991 there have been
ownership changes in 18 per cent of UK shopping centres.
Many of these deals involved joint ventures or transfers of less than 100
per cent of the equity. Nevertheless it is a remarkable level of activity
during a period when the property market was in the trough of its worst
recession in 60 years.
The number and scale of the deals also reflects a degree of liquidity which
exceeds continental Europe's and is fast approaching that of the US.
This investment activity in shopping centres has gathered pace over the past
12 months and has opened up a previously unexplored property investment area
to overseas groups, which have responded enthusiastically.
Eleven deals since 1991 have involved overseas buyers, with four exceeding
Pounds 50m in value. The Netherlands-based fund Waxy, a subsidiary of the
Swedish LF Insurance Group, heads the list with four deals valued at between
Pounds 5m and Pounds 25m. Another active player has been the US fund Dusco,
which is a vehicle for American, British and other institutional investment.
Nearly half of the deals involving overseas institutional investors were
conducted with British joint venture partners.
This unprecedented opportunity for continental European and US investors to
snap up shopping centres in the UK has arisen because UK institutions have,
for the first time, been prepared to sell. Last year, overseas groups
emerged as significant buyers of UK shopping centres; insurance companies
and pension funds were net sellers. Some 70 per cent of overseas purchases
by value in 1993 were from institutional sellers.
In the first six months of this year, UK institutions returned to the market
as net buyers and it was scarcely surprising that foreign purchases fell.
Investors, particularly insurance and pension funds, are nervous when buying
property abroad. Institutions prefer to deal with a similar body in the host
country, and particularly welcome a joint venture where ownership and risk
are shared and where the host group oversees property management.
The combination of a greater willingness to sell on the part of UK
investors, and greater interest on the part of overseas funds, means that
cross-border investment activity in shopping centres is set to grow, both in
Britain and the cont-inent.
Funds from France and the Netherlands head the continental European
interest, while US funds specialising in shopping centres, such as O'Connor
and La Salle, have also been notable investors. La Salle recently set up a
joint venture with the UK's Grosvenor Estate.
The next step in the development of an international investment sector for
shopping centres could be the emergence of a robust market in continental
Europe, which has consistently lagged the UK. Many in the industry believed
the introduction of the European single market in 1992, which lifted
investment barriers between the 12 members of the European Union, would
speed up the development of such a market.
But no sooner had the process started than the recession took hold, pushing
many European property markets into a downturn. Values now appear to be
bottoming on the continent and this could trigger investment interest, just
as it did in Britain a year ago when the market emerged from recession.
With most European property markets showing signs of recovery, the
likelihood is that continental investors will spread their investments in
several national shopping centre markets. This already happens where the
home market is small such as in the Netherlands and Sweden.
For a truly liquid cross-border market to emerge, three stages must be
successfully negotiated.
The first two stages - the construction of a shopping centre either by a
developer or a hypermarket operator, and then the sale of the centre to an
institution in the host country, usually an insurance company - are at an
advanced stage.
The third stage is when home institutions are prepared to trade their
investments, which is where the market is currently poised.
In continental Europe, only France equals Britain in terms of the number of
shopping centres. Britain and France also have three times more shopping
centre floor space than Spain and Germany, respectively third and fourth in
Europe's shopping centre market by size.
As a result, market activity is likely to continue to focus on Britain and
France. In southern Europe the emphasis is on new development. A growing
number of schemes in Italy, Spain and Portugal are looking to attract
foreign capital, both debt and equity.
In the short-term, it will probably be easier for a cross-border investor to
find an outlet by funding a development in southern Europe, rather than
buying existing centres, say, in Britain or France. By 2000, the European
shopping centre market should be both liquid and international.

FT  19 AUG 94 / People: Drury resurfaces in the shipping business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles Drury, 53, a veteran of London's boom and bust shipping finance
cycles, has resurfaced at Den norske Bank (DnB) as head of a new
London-based marine corporate finance unit which will raise equity for
over-indebted shipowners.
Norway, unlike Britain, has always had more than its fair share of
entrepreneurial shipping figures, and Drury, who has worked at Greig
Middleton and NatWest Securities, knows most of them.
DnB is Norway's largest bank and has always been a leading lender to
shipping companies around the world.
However, competition for business has reduced the margins on traditional
shipping lending and increased the risks, and, in common with the rest of
Norway's banks, DnB is recovering from five years of heavy credit losses.
Hence, DnB is anxious to expand the corporate finance side of its shipping
business where the risks are less and the returns considerably higher.
UK merchant banks such as SG Warburg have been raising increasing amounts of
equity for Norwegian shipowners, many of whom are traditional clients of
DnB. Drury's new operation will raise primary equity in both the public and
private markets, advise on mergers and acquisitions and corporate

Drury is one of the more well-rounded figures in London's close-knit
shipping world. He started out at Hambros, has been a director of a
successful shipping company, Bulk Transport, and even co-authored a book
Ship finance - the credit crisis.
He retired from NatWest Securities two years ago in order to set up his own
database publishing company.
However, he says that he soon found that his plan to 'create a super-highway
of transport statistics was beyond his slender management skills' and after
toying with another publishing venture he decided to return to his first
love, doing deals in the shipping business.

FT  19 AUG 94 / People: Item: new chief economist
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It may be a bad sign for the UK economy. The chief economist of the Ernst &amp;
Young Item Club, the only independent UK forecasting group which uses the
Treasury model, is heading off to Japan.
Brian Pearce, who will take up a job as an economist at Swiss Bank
Corporation in Tokyo, says 'the Asian region is where all the exciting
growth opportunities are appearing.'
Pearce's replacement will be Paul Droop, above, an Australian who came to
England four years ago to join the Item Club as an economist, having worked
at County NatWest Australia.
Droop describes himself as 'a product of a neo-classical/neo-Keynesian
synthesis' - an appropriate compromise for someone who suffered the divided
loyalties of having been born in Melbourne and brought up in Sydney.
The Item Club's new chief economist says the UK economy 'is at a distinct
crossroads. The correct policy choices could bring a sustained period of
prosperity for the country, the wrong one a rapid return to a damaging
stop-go cycle.'
Droop feels it is too early for the Bank of England to be
raising interest rates, though if the economy continues to grow at its
current pace, it should consider a rise to 6 per cent or so around the end
of the year.
The Item Club is owned by a number of its members; Baring Brothers, Crown
Agents, JP Morgan, OEF and Schroders.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Inflation fears hit Treasuries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Treasury market was rocked yesterday by fresh signs of inflation.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 5/32 lower
at 100 1/32 , with the yield rising to 7.491 per cent and the two-year note
was down  1/8 at 99 13/16 , to yield 6.209 per cent.
After a late slump in the previous session in the face of surging oil
prices, the market stumbled again soon after trading began yesterday
morning.
The latest bit of troubling news was contained in the monthly survey of
economic conditions conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
Its August report revealed an acceleration of the regional economy, with the
overall index of business activity climbing to 13.9, from 11.3 a month ago.
Even more unsettling to fixed-rate investors, indices designed to gauge the
prices paid and received by manufacturers were up sharply.
The data sent the 30-year issue tumbling. Its fresh losses, combined with
Wednesday's decline, wiped out the big gains rung up in the hours before and
after Tuesday's announcement of a sharp tightening of monetary policy.
The inflation data immediately raised suspicions that the Fed might bring
forward its next rate increase.
Early on, bonds slipped in response to the dollar's renewed weakness against
the yen after news that the US trade deficit with Japan had widened during
June.
European government bond markets remained in a skittish mood yesterday
following the Bundesbank's decision to keep leading interest rates
unchanged. A fall in US Treasuries and weakness in sterling also undermined
bond prices.
The central bank also left the repo rate fixed at 4.85 per cent for another
two weeks. Analysts said the Bundesbank was clearly postponing any decisions
on interest rates until the market's nerves were less frayed.
Mr Richard Reid, chief economist at the Union Bank of Switzerland in
Frankfurt, said that in view of the uncertainty about interest rates and the
forthcoming federal elections, it was possible that the Bundesbank would
stick with a fixed-rate repo for another six to eight weeks.
He noted that the Bundesbank had no compelling reason to move on interest
rates, given the stronger than expected economic data recently and the
chances of a disappointing cost of living number next week. Even yesterday's
superficially pleasing M3 money supply data for July did not justify a rate
cut since they showed bank lending growth at its highest level for eight
months.
'The Bundesbank's stance allows it to review the situation in two weeks,'
said Mr Reid, but the markets would be left wondering whether this was a
pause before another rate cut or the end of the current downward trend.
On Liffe, the September bund future traded at 91.65 in the late afternoon,
up 0.11 point on the day and off the day's low of 91.08.
UK gilts failed to build on the previous day's gains as weakness in sterling
worried some dealers. Although recent economic data has given the government
ample excuses to leave interest rates alone, they fear that further pressure
on the pound, and a poor M0 number for August, could force the government to
raise rates as early as September. On Liffe, the September long gilt future
fell  25/32 points to 100 1/2.

<TEXT>
A membership of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's International Monetary
Market has traded for a record Dollars 925,000, a near-50 per cent increase
since the start of the year.
The transaction puts seat values at the CME above those at the New York
Stock Exchange, and demonstrates rising global interest in financial
derivatives markets.
Seat prices at the futures exchange have climbed steadily this year, largely
because world interest rate volatility has more than doubled turnover in the
CME's Eurodollar futures and options pits.
As the exchange's importance as a hedging centre for interest rate risks
rises, international banks which were slow in obtaining memberships are now
competing for seats.
Lloyds Bank, Deutsche Bank, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce have
all bought CME seats recently. Exchange rules require a bank to own six
memberships before it can 'clear' or process trades for itself or its
customers.
Rising seat prices are also the result of an internal push to redistribute
ownership at the exchange.
The highly controversial plan would consolidate the exchange's two largest
divisions and shift governing power from a traditional base of agricultural
futures traders to the banks and financial institutions that now generate
most of the CME's business.

FT  19 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Study criticises Bank
approach to repos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England's approach to a domestic securities repurchase market is
misconceived, argues a study on the role of derivatives in Europe's
securities markets, commissioned by the International Securities Market
Association (ISMA), the Zurich-based trade association.
The Bank's 'policy of restricting access to repos in order to subsidise the
gilt market-makers' restricts the ability of other derivatives operators to
hedge positions. 'Their ability to hedge in the cash market is greatly
reduced and they are forced to operate in the gilt futures markets when, on
occasion, it might be more appropriate to use an underlying gilt-edged bond
as a hedging instrument.'
In a repo operation, holders of securities sell them for an agreed period of
time, at the end of which they buy them back at an agreed price. The report
emphasises that cash securities markets, derivatives on securities and
securities lending markets form an 'indissoluble triangle'.
Where minimum reserve requirements prohibit a repo market, as in Germany,
the volume of derivatives business means the repo market must exist
elsewhere, the report states. Bundesbank restrictions have driven the repo
market for bunds, which has seen 'explosive' growth largely attributable to
derivatives activity, offshore to London.
Authorities' neglect of securities lending may pose systemic risk to the
financial system, argue the authors of the report, Professor Brian
Scott-Quinn and Mr Julian Walmsley of the University of Reading.
'It could be argued that the biggest systemic risk in connection with
derivatives is from irresponsible action from governments which fail to
understand the complex linkages between cash, securities lending/repo and
derivatives markets,' the report states.
The study also identifies a regulatory problem emerging in connection with
over-the-counter equity derivatives.
Because the majority of OTC derivatives trades are conducted by banks rather
than securities houses, stock exchange authorities in most European
countries are unaware of the trades, which are reported to the banking
authorities, the study states.
As a result, there is a danger that trades which would normally be conducted
in the cash equity market might be deliberately channelled through the OTC
market to avoid being caught by the reporting requirements of the usual
regulatory bodies.
Restrictions on foreign shareholdings and insider dealing could thus be
circumvented by means of derivatives.

Moody's has raised the long-term senior debt rating of Westpac, one the 'big
four' Australian banks, to A-1 from A-2, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. The
subordinated debt rating was also improved from to A-2 from A-3. About
ADollars 3.2bn of securities are affected.
Moody's said the upgrade reflected Westpac's improving asset quality,
earnings and capital levels. It said these positive trends should continue
in the medium term, reinforced by Australia's favourable economic
conditions.
Although the banking sector generally suffered badly during the recent
recession, Westpac - with heavy exposures to the property market - was among
the worst affected.

FT  19 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Structured FFr1bn deal for Societe
Generale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lull in the Eurobond market persisted yesterday, though many syndicate
managers are expecting a surge in volume in September, as borrowers with
large parts of their 1994 funding programmes to complete try to beat the
expected fourth-quarter rush.
The only substantial offering yesterday was a FFr1bn three-year structured
deal for Societe Generale Acceptance, guaranteed by the French bank.
The deal was the first in the French market for almost two months, but does
not reflect a return to favour for the French franc sector, since it is a
highly structured transaction. However, dealers said that the underlying
tone of the market has improved, and some straight bonds in French francs
could follow.
The Societe Generale deal is aimed at investors who expect interest rates to
rise, but to a limited extent. The notes are structured to pay a margin of
50 basis points over the three-month Paris interbank offered rate, with a
cap of 9 1/2 per cent (interest does not accumulate when Pibor rises above
that level).
With three-month Pibor currently at 5 5/8 per cent, and the forward rate for
September 1997, the maturity date, currently at around 8 per cent, there is
a comfortable cushion for investors, according to lead manager Societe
Generale.
However, there is no floor, as most investors are not expecting French rates
to fall substantially.

FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Group of investors takes control
of Randgold board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A group of international investors led by SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank,
yesterday effectively gained management control of Randgold &amp; Exploration,
in spite of vigorous opposition from the existing directors.
Warburg's sister company, Mercury Asset Management, holds about 25 per cent
of Randgold, once one of South Africa's premier mining finance houses but
now among the most troubled of the country's gold producers.
Three weeks ago Warburg launched the management takeover bid in conjunction
with Fraser Alexander and Rand, a local mining company.
The Warburg-Fraser consortium proposed that the board be expanded in order
to change the overall strategy of the company.
It also proposed that Rand-gold should issue cash and shares to acquire
First Westgold, a company controlled by Fraser Alexander and which operates
the West Rand Consolidated Mine, for R68.95m (Dollars 19m). First Westgold's
management team would join Randgold to help turn it round.
Randgold's chief executive, Mr John Turner, accused the consortium of
under-valuing Randgold and over-valuing First Westgold but at an
extraordinary meeting yesterday shareholders elected 11 new directors to the
Randgold board by a three-to-one margin and approved the First Westgold
purchase. In doing so shareholders signalled the demise of Randgold in its
present form.
Randgold was formerly the mining arm of the Barlow Rand conglomerate before
the latter 'unbundled' its operations in 1992. Since then, Randgold has
produced consistently weak results from its four marginal mines, all of
which are highly sensitive to movements in the gold price.
The management takeover bid, which is very unusual in the normally staid
South African corporate world, was brought about by widespread shareholder
frustration with the company's continuing poor performance.
In April Randgold admitted that its ERPM mine, which launched a R550m rights
issue last year, would not meet the forecasts in its prospectus. Then in
June the group announced that it would cease underground operations at its
Durban Roodepoort Deep mine with a loss of nearly 6,000 jobs.

FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Sony blames strong yen for 49%
profits fall
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sony, the Japanese electronics group which also owns US recording labels and
Hollywood studios, yesterday announced a 49.2 per cent fall in worldwide net
profits to Y3.91bn (Dollars 39m) in the first quarter to June.
The drop, which came in spite of a 4.3 per cent rise in sales to Y864.5bn
and a 25.7 per cent jump in operating profits to Y31.8bn, was blamed on the
rise in the yen.
Sony said the increase in the currency cost it Y43bn in revenues when
translated into yen. Through forward contracts it still achieved a net
foreign exchange gain of Y7.5bn in the three months, but this was 63.2 per
cent below the 1993 first quarter.
Mr Sumio Sano, a Sony director, said its forex arrangements for the year as
a whole were more favourable. This would be the main factor in allowing the
group to meet its earlier forecast that full-year net profits would rebound
161 per cent to Y40bn, on a 7 per cent rise in sales to Y3,990bn.
To counter the effect of the high yen on exports, Sony continues to move
production of electronics hardware overseas. By next March, according to Mr
Sano, sites abroad would produce 45 per cent of all output, up from 41 per
cent now and 35 per cent at the start of the latest three months.
The quarter was the first since the group was streamlined into largely
independent business units each responsible for its own marketing.
Sales of video equipment fell 1.3 per cent but audio products rose 5.2 per
cent, supported by sales of MiniDisc players. Demand for television sets
rose 10.1 per cent and other electronic products 3.4 per cent.
On the entertainment side, which accounts for nearly a fifth of all sales,
music business revenues rose 12 per cent on the back of hit albums by
artists ranging from Pink Floyd to the Spin Doctors. Takings from the
Columbia and TriStar film studios were down 4.3 per cent, mainly due to the
effect of the stronger yen. On a local currency basis, revenues were up 1
per cent in pictures and 27 per cent in music.
In Japan and Europe, which were its two weakest markets last time, Sony
increased total sales by 3.9 per cent and 4.5 per cent respectively. US
revenues were up 1.6 per cent. The results reflect the performance of its
818 subsidiaries and 24 equity-accounted affiliates.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tsingtao Brewery, the China beer company that last year became the first
mainland enterprise to secure a listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange, has
reported first-half net profits of Yn101.96m (Dollars 11.86m) as increased
exports helped offset the rising cost of raw materials.
As Tsingtao was only listed in Hong Kong 13 months ago, there is no
comparison under Hong Kong accounting standards for the first half of 1993.
Under mainland accounting, the net attributable profit rose 63 per cent to
Yn112m from Yn68.9m in the same period last year.
The reconciliation when reporting the Hong Kong accounts includes Yn2.4m of
depreciation on fixed assets and Yn7.71m provisions for bad debts. There
were no transfers to reserves or welfare funds from shareholders' profits
during the period, as these are taken at the year end.
Under Hong Kong accounting, earnings per share came in at Yn0.11. Dividends
are only paid at the year-end.
Tsingtao produced 170,716 tonnes of beer in the first six months, a
year-on-year volume increase of 27 per cent. Foreigners accounted for
Dollars 7.2m worth of exports, an 8 per cent rise on last year.
Marketing efforts in Europe were spurred by the setting up of the Tsingtao
Brewery European Trading Company in France in June. This office will also
look at opportunities for producing the beer in French factories.
Inflation sent the cost of raw materials up 15 per cent to 20 per cent; the
cost of rice over the six months doubled.
Exchange rate fluctuations brought good and bad news.
Imports of raw materials exceeded exports, so production costs rose and
profits were squeezed. To compensate, Tsingtao has increased efforts to
expand overseas markets and raise exports and landed a record Dollars 9.65m
order at an international trade fair in Guangzhou.

FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: South Korea regains past glories
 -The return to the rapid expansion of the mid-1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Net profits of South Korea's listed companies for the first half of 1994
have increased at their fastest rate since 1987, when the economy was
achieving almost unprecedented double-digit growth.
Average net profits of 518 listed companies jumped by 75 per cent during the
first half, which surpassed the 71.4 per cent gain registered during the
first half of 1987, according to Dongsuh Economic Research Institute.
Sales increased by 16.6 per cent, almost matching the growth in turnover
during the boom years of 1986-87.
The sharp earnings rise reflects an economic recovery based on increased
spending for production expansion, which benefited steel, construction and
machinery companies, and higher private consumption.
Exports have also surged due to the depreciation of the Korean currency
against the strong Japanese yen and increased demand in advanced industrial
countries.
Growing exports helped boost net earnings for Hyundai Motor, the nation's
largest car producer, by 343 per cent to Won68.2bn (Dollars 84m), while
foreign demand for memory semiconductor chips was largely responsible for
the 408 per cent rise in profits to Won285bn for Samsung Electronics.
Even the troubled petrochemical industry, which has suffered a production
glut that depressed earnings since 1990, is witnessing a recovery because of
increased exports to China and south-east Asia. Lucky, one of Korea's
leading petrochemical companies, reported a 61 per cent profit increase to
Won41.9bn.
Analysts believe the strong earnings performance reflects the economies of
scale and improved production efficiency achieved by Korea's big industrial
groups.
This has produced growing profit margins, which have also been improved by
stable raw material costs.
The fact that operating profits, which Barings Securities estimates rose by
51.5 per cent, accounted for most of the net earnings growth underscores the
industrial strength of Korean business. In contrast, the higher net profits
reported in 1987 were largely the result of foreign exchange gains,
according to Dongsuh.
Moreover, the manufacturing sector recorded the highest net profit increase
this year at 107.9 per cent, while service companies had an 82.9 per cent
jump in earnings.
The overall average for listed companies was pulled down by the relatively
poor profit performance of the financial sector, which grew by only 23.5 per
cent due to higher bad-loan provisions in the banking industry.
Other factors contributed to the impressive corporate earnings. 'Corporate
results were relatively poor last year, so this year's results look better
because they started from a low base,' said Mr Lee Kuen-mo, an analyst at
Barings Securities in Seoul.
The absence of labour conflict in most industries also contributed to higher
earnings. One reason for the sizeable jump in this year's profits for
Hyundai Motor was that a two-month strike depressed earnings a year ago.
The few listed companies that suffered labour strife this year reported poor
results. Kumho, the country's largest tyre maker, recorded a loss of
Won12.6bn against a profit of Won4.1bn a year ago because of a strike in
June.
Favourable financial factors also boosted net earnings growth above the rise
in operating profits. Interest rates remained stable at 12 per cent during
the period, which cut financial costs.
A change in accounting rules also reduced special depreciation charges that
had lowered earnings last year. 'This has proved to be of significant
benefit to some companies, such as Korea Electric Power,' said Mr Keith Nam,
head of HG Asia Securities in Seoul. The state-owned electricity monopoly
had a 62.8 per cent increase in net earnings to Won391.5bn, the highest

FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Northam posts loss of R129.7m
for first year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Northam Platinum, the South African platinum mine in the Gold Fields stable,
has reported a loss of R129.7m (Dollars 35.2m) for the year to June, its
first full year of operations.
Production, at 1.15m tonnes milled, was well below expected levels and sales
revenue amounted to R238.4m against costs of R364.2m. The company, which
launched a R350m rights issue in 1992, has also used up its cash resources
as well as most of its R220m loan facility and has had to arrange a further
R25m loan to finance its losses.
The poor results were attributed to the mining area being far more
geologically unstable than expected. The situation had been aggravated by
the presence of high yield water fissures and fracturing to the east of the
complex.
Northam is currently carrying out a technical assessment to determine the
operation's future viability.

South African life assurer Liberty Life, which recently successfully floated
a Dollars 300m international bond issue, has boosted attributable earnings
27.1 per cent to R225m (Dollars 61.1m) for the six months to June, up from
R177m a year ago.
The good results were due largely to record levels of new business from life
operations, as total new business written by Liberty and its wholly owned
subsidiary, Charter Life, reached R1.69bn, up from R1.04bn a year ago.
Single premiums rose 81 per cent to R1.25bn from R692m while net annualised
recurring premiums increased by 28 per cent to R441m from R344m. The interim
cash dividend was increased 20 per cent to 96 cents from 80 cents.
Management reported that the Liberty group had raised around R5bn in capital
over the past year through the bond issue, the flotation of UK-based Capital
Shopping Centres and 80 per cent of subsidiary Libsil and through
TransAtlantic Holdings. However, the company said it no immediate plans for
an American acquisition.
Liberty's parent company, Liberty Holdings, reported a 21.3 per cent
increase in attributable profits for the six-month period to R137.9m, up
from R113.7m. After-tax profit rose 21.6 per cent to R370.1m from R304.3m
while the dividend was raised to 264 cents, 20 per cent up from last year's
220 cents.

FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Woolworth losses widen to
Dollars 42m
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at Woolworth, the beleaguered US retailer, widened still further in
the second quarter to July in spite of the company's decision last year to
close 970 underperforming general merchandise stores in the US and Canada.
Net losses rose to Dollars 42m from Dollars 10m on revenues down to Dollars
1.9bn from Dollars 2.3bn. Losses per share rose to 32 cents from 8 cents
and, as announced last month, the dividend has been slashed to 15 cents from
29 cents.
Last year, Woolworth embarked on a restructuring to improve its poor
financial performance. In addition to closing 970 variety stores, it sold
its loss-making Woolco discount store chain in Canada to Wal-Mart Stores.
Yesterday's figures showed that these moves had slightly improved the
performance of its North American operations: operating profits in the US
rose to Dollars 40m from Dollars 24m, and in Canada, the comparable
quarter's operating loss of Dollars 19m turned into an operating profit of
Dollars 1m.
However, Woolworth's operations in the rest of the world, mainly comprising
its specialty retailing chains such as Foot Locker and its general
merchandise stores in Germany, increased their operating losses to Dollars
47m from Dollars 10m. Woolworth blamed weak economic conditions,
particularly in Germany.
The net losses also included a supplementary charge of Dollars 30m relating
to the disposal of the Woolco chain. Last year Woolworth took a pre-tax
charge of Dollars 168m for losses on the sale.
Woolworth said if the discontinued operations were excluded from the
comparable period's figures, revenues would have shown an increase of 4.1
per cent.
However, the market, disappointed at the company's lack of progress towards
profitability, marked the shares down Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 15 1/4 in
early trade. The shares closed the day at 15 3/8 .
For the six months to July, net losses rose to Dollars 80m from Dollars 34m
in the comparable period, including the Dollars 30m charge.
Leaving aside the two quarters last year in which Woolworth falsified its
figures to create the illusion of profitability, the company has not made a
profit since 1992.

<TEXT>
Varity, the Buffalo-based maker of Kelsey-Hayes automotive parts and Perkins
brand diesel engines, lifted second-quarter earnings from continuing
operations to Dollars 22.8m, or 50 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 517m.
This was up from Dollars 13.1m, or 25 cents, on sales of Dollars 422m in
last year's second quarter.
Varity sold the remaining portions of Massey Ferguson's farm equipment
division to Agco during the quarter, realising a gain of Dollars 23.2m, or
52 cents a share.
Including that gain, it earned Dollars 46m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, in the
second quarter. Shareholders' equity rose by Dollars 93m after the sale.
Varity said yesterday it would use the proceeds of the sale to buy back up
to 4.5m of its own shares, or about 10 per cent of those outstanding.
The repurchase programme would be valued at close to Dollars 157m at current
share prices.
Wall Street responded favourably to the announcement, pushing Varity shares
up Dollars  1/2 to close at 35 1/4 .
For the first half of the year, the company reported income from continuing
operations of Dollars 47.8m, or Dollars 1.05 a share, on sales of Dollars
1.02bn. This is up sharply from last year's first-half profits of Dollars
27.1m before extraordinary charges, on sales of Dollars 878m.
Clark Refining &amp; Marketing, a unit of Canada's Horsham Corporation, is
buying the Port Arthur, Texas oil refinery and terminal facilities of
Chevron of the US for CDollars 74m plus inventory of about CDollars 140m
(USDollars 102.2m), Reuter reports from Toronto.
The deal has a potential for additional payments of up to CDollars 125m over
five years if refining industry margins exceed certain levels, Clark said.
The Part Arthur refinery has an operating capacity of about 200,000 barrels
per day.

Northern Telecom, the Can-adian telecommunications equipment maker, has
joined NBTel, the province of New Brunswick's telephone company, in a
pioneering venture to provide advertising and other consumer information to
screen-display telephones.
The service, known as CallMall, enables phone-users to receive only the
information they request. It can also be used for home banking, electronic
shopping and community messages.
The joint venture will be 51 per cent-owned by Bruncor, NBTel's parent, and
49 per cent by Northern. The partners will invest CDollars 40m (USDollars
29.2m) over the next two years, and expect to create about 100 jobs.
The service will be launched in Moncton, New Brunswick, in October and will
extended to the rest of the province in 1995. NBTel has signed up about 50
advertisers, including the Canadian subsidiaries of the Body Shop and
several leading North American mail order companies. Some government
services are likely to be added.
The telephones, made by Northern, are equipped with screens displaying up to
eight lines of text.

increases

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Navistar International, the Chicago-based manufacturer of International
brand trucks, diesel engines and school bus chassis, has benefited from a
sharp increase in demand for heavy trucks and engines.
It yesterday unveiled third-quarter income of Dollars 20m, or 17 cents a
share, a turnround from last year's third-quarter loss of Dollars 312m, or
Dollars 9.99 a share.
Excluding the special accounting charge that led to last year's quarterly
loss, Navistar recorded 1993 third-quarter earnings of Dollars 6m.
Sales rose 11 per cent to Dollars 1.25bn, up from last year's Dollars
1.13bn.
The company delivered 23,800 heavy and medium trucks and school bus chassis
in the quarter, up 15 per cent from last year. Sales of mid-range diesel
engines to other truck assemblers rose 23 per cent to Dollars 157m, on
shipments of 35,100m units.
Sales of service parts grew 11 per cent over last year's third quarter, to
Dollars 178m.
Robust demand has prompted Navistar to boost its annual projections for
industry-wide sales of heavy trucks in North America to 204,000 units, up 23
per cent from 1993's 166,400 units, and 5 per cent higher than the company's
previous forecast of 195,000.
To meet growing demand for its engines, the company took on 650 production
workers during the quarter, and added extra shifts to its mid-western diesel
engine factories.
For the first nine months, Navistar had net income of Dollars 59m, or 50
cents a share, on sales of Dollars 3.78bn.

FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: AHP defends delicate chemistry
of Dollars 9.7bn acquisition - The merger with American Cyanamid has left
some industry experts puzzled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American Home Product's successful Dollars 9.7bn acquisition of American
Cyanamid this week is only the latest, but certainly largest, convulsion to
shake the troubled pharmaceuticals industry.
The merger of the two groups will create the world's fourth-largest drug
company, behind Merck, Glaxo, and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Combined turnover
will be about Dollars 12.5bn, of which drug and health care products will
account for almost 75 per cent.
The industrial logic of the deal, unlike with SmithKline Beecham's
asset-swap with Cyanamid proposed earlier this month, is not immediately
clear.
Admittedly, there is little product overlap. AHP produces top-selling food
and consumer products such as Chef Boyardee pasta and Chap Stick, but is
best-known for its drug brands. These include the headache tablets Advil and
Anacin, the estrogen drug Premarin, and the contraceptive Norplant.
Cyanamid's drug unit Lederle is known for its vaccines, cancer agents,
antibiotics and Centrum vitamins.
However, this impressive list of products does not tell the full story.
Industry analysts say AHP's range of drugs is ageing rapidly, and facing
intensifying competition from newer drugs on an increasingly price-sensitive
market.
There is nothing to suggest that the acquisition of Cyanamid will help
rectify the situation. Lederle has not produced a new drug in years, and
both Cyanamid and AHP have been consistently criticised for the poor quality
of their research and development.
'Lumping two stones together doesn't make them float any better,' says one
analyst. 'What is key is that the combined group starts producing some
innovative products that can generate volume growth.'
One potential route for greater innovation is the combination of the two
groups' biotechnology businesses. AHP is a majority owner of Genetics
Institute, and Cyanamid a majority owner of Immunex.
Between the two, AHP will control a formidable biotech operation, says Mr
Arvind Desai, an analyst with the independent US research firm Metha and
Isaly. 'In terms of dollars spent on biotech research, it will be comparable
to Roche's Genentech.'
AHP, however, says there are no plans for merging Genetics Institute and
Cyanamid's Immunex in the near term. There are the interests of the minority
shareholders to consider, and Mr John Stafford, AHP's chairman, believes
early benefits can be achieved from closer co-operation between the two
biotech companies.
While AHP sets about integrating the companies' drug businesses, the big
question is what will it do with Cyanamid's agricultural-chemicals
operation? Many Wall Street analysts believe it will be sold, if only
because AHP will need to reduce its heavy debt load soon, and because there
should be no shortage of buyers, at least for the non-animal health parts of
it.
Says Mr Desai: 'The agrochemicals business of Cyanamid is very attractive
because it's in a fairly consistent growth pattern with high operating
margins. By the end of next year, it could be worth Dollars 4.5bn or even
Dollars 5bn.'
However, specialists in agrochemicals are more doubtful about such large
figures. They argue that with sales of about Dollars 1.7bn a year, it might
command one to one and half times sales, but no more. The animal health
business, with annual sales of about Dollars 305m, would command a lower
premium.
As for who might buy the agrochemicals business, Mr Desai names Zeneca of
the UK; AgrEvo, the joint-venture between Hoechst and Schering of Germany;
Rhone-Poulenc of France; and Ciba of Switzerland. Monsanto, Dow Chemical and
Du Pont in the US are also mentioned. There would be few takers for the
animal health operations.
This speculation, however, is off the mark, says Mr Stafford, who insists
that the agrochemicals unit is a good fit for AHP. 'It's growing. It's
technology-based, which is consistent with our approach to the business.
It's really an outstanding business, and will become part of our diversified
portfolio.'
Although the only obvious synergy between Cyanamid's agricultural unit and
AHP is in the area of veterinary pharmaceuticals, Mr Stafford says there is
unrealised potential in the business. 'It has a chemical library of some
300,000 compounds; by using today's technology, it can be screened for
pharmaceutical uses - that can be an extra plus.'
The immediate task for AHP is to start squeezing all the possible cost
savings out of the merger. Considerable savings should be realised from
eliminating the duplication of administrative, research and development, and
marketing operations in the drugs businesses. Given AHP's renowned ability
to control costs, analysts estimate that such savings could total as much as
Dollars 300m a year.
Saving money, however, was not the chief force behind the acquisition of
Cyanamid, says Mr Stafford. 'The basic reasoning for doing this is not
cost-reduction. The primary motivation is to build the business for the long
term. It makes us a world player in vaccines. It dramatically increases our
size in the pharmaceutical business worldwide. It gives us a position in
Asian markets, where previously we were somewhat weak.'
Yet, the company will have to move quickly on costs in order to start
cutting into the Dollars 9bn in debt AHP took on to finance the purchase of
Cyanamid. Mr Stafford is confident AHP can bear the debt burden for now. 'We
can service and reduce the debt out of the cashflow of the combined
companies. We may take other actions to help reduce debt, but we have no
specific plans yet. And we'll still pay the dividend.'
The deal may trigger even more cost-cutting in a sector that has already
lost tens of thousands of jobs. One analyst comments: 'Either Mr Stafford
has done his sums wrong, or there are huge cost savings in pharmaceuticals
companies that we haven't even started to contemplate.'
Meanwhile, the pressures of worldwide healthcare reform show no sign of
letting up, and the fax machines of finance directors are known to be
humming with proposals from investment bankers. This latest acquisition is
unlikely to be the last.

<TEXT>
Dominion Textile, the Canadian-based international integrated textile group,
saw fourth-quarter net profit rise sharply, boosted by strong demand for
denim and yarn from apparel makers.
Domtex, one of the world's biggest denim cloth producers, said fiscal 1995
had begun with a strong order book, and demand for commodity yarns was good.
Net profit for the three months ended June 30 was CDollars 22.4m (USDollars
16.4m), or 52 cents a share, up from CDollars 11.3m, or 25 cents, a year
earlier. Revenues were CDollars 394m, up 9 per cent. For the full year, net
profit was CDollars 33.5m, or 70 cents a share, up 11 per cent, on sales
which were little changed at CDollars 1.3bn.
Mr John Boland, head of the US subsidiary Swift Textiles, has been appointed
president of Domtex. He succeeds Mr Charles Hantho, who remains chairman and
chief executive.

Varig, Latin America's largest airline, has proposed offering board seats to
McDonnell Douglas and General Electric in return for their help with its
financial restructuring.
The Brazilian carrier said it had signed letters of intent with the two US
companies to restructure its payments to Eximbank of the US for aircraft.
Varig owes Eximbank more than Dollars 600m.
A board seat will be given to Varig's Brazilian creditor banks and one more
will be decided by Varig, McDonnell Douglas and General Electric. The other
five board seats will remain under Varig's control.
Varig said the proposals did not involve changes in the shareholding of the
airline, which is controlled by an employees' foundation.
General Electric has agreed to buy Varig's six Boeing 767 aircraft, which
had been purchased with Eximbank funding, for Dollars 204m. Varig will
continue to use the aircraft.
McDonnell Douglas, which sold Varig four MD-11 aircraft, will pay the
principal on the debt for the next 18 months, totalling Dollars 72m, while
Varig will continue to pay the interest.

of Fnac, the music and books chain, by getting the go-ahead to buy a
majority stake from the Credit Lyonnais banking group.
Artemis, the holding company that controls the Pinault family's interests,
last month agreed a deal with the Altus Finances subsidiary of Credit
Lyonnais to buy its 66.4 per cent holding in Fnac, one of the most famous
names in French retailing, for around FFr2bn (Dollars 374m).
However, the deal was subject to the approval of Generale des Eaux, the
utility and media company which owns another 33.4 per cent of Fnac and has
pre-emptive rights over the Altus stake. Generale des Eaux last week fuelled
speculation that it might exercise its pre-emptive rights by announcing that
it was delaying taking a final decision for an extra week after the original
deadline.
The new deadline expired on Wednesday. Generale des Eaux yesterday confirmed
that it had decided not to buy the Altus holding. However, it will play a
significant role in the management of Fnac as it is empowered to appoint the
chairman of a strategic committee, which will scrutinise all the main
strategic issues facing the company.
Fnac, which has for decades dominated the market for music and books, or
cultural retailing, as the French call it, is a high profile addition to Mr
Pinault's existing retail interests that include the Au Printemps department
store group, La Redoute mail order business and Conforama furniture chain.
The deal comes at a time when French retailers are preparing to emerge from
recession after a tough two years of virtually static consumer spending.
However, Fnac's dominant position in the 'cultural' sector is under attack
from the dynamic Virgin Megastores chain owned by Mr Richard Branson, the
British entrepreneur.

<TEXT>
The terms of a French government 'golden share' and uncertainty over the
privatisation of Renault were key issues which led to the collapse last year
of Volvo's plan to merge its car and truck operations with Renault, an
internal inquiry by the Swedish manufacturer has concluded.
The inquiry's author, Mr Arne Wittlov, head of Volvo Aerospace, also
indirectly criticised Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the former Volvo chairman who
resigned when the merger was blocked by a shareholder and management revolt,
for not tackling the deep concerns raised by the merger plan.
Although Volvo has not published the report, Mr Wittlov outlined his
conclusions in an interview in the company's internal magazine Volvo Now. He
said he had interviewed some 50 shareholders, executives, board members and
trade union members in the course of preparing his report.
He said the terms of the golden share the French government intended to keep
in the new Renault-Volvo after privatisation meant there was a risk that
Volvo's 35 per cent share in the merged company could ultimately be driven
down to 20 per cent.

FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Losses widen to Fl 196m as
Fokker takes charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer which is majority-owned by Deutsche
Aerospace (DASA) of Germany, said losses widened to Fl 195.8m (Dollars 110m)
in the first half from Fl 127.0m in the same period of 1993.
It blamed the deterioration on sizeable charges taken to finance
reorganisations and buy back sales contracts as well as charges needed to
take account of 'disappointing sales proceeds'.
The company, which released the figures after the close of bourse trading,
said it expects full-year losses to be lower than the Fl 460m posted in
1993.
Fokker described the prospect of narrower full-year losses as a 'turnround
point' and repeated earlier forecasts of a return to profitability in 1996.
It gave no single figure for first-half charges, which are scattered over
various parts of its profit and loss account, but a spokesman described them
as 'hefty'.
Fokker delivered one Fokker 50 and 14 Fokker 100s in the first six months,
and it also delivered other aircraft through lease agreements. At the same
time, it signed contracts for the delivery of 35 aircraft at future dates.
'The problem is not so much the number of aeroplanes sold or those that
remain unsold but the fact that the difficult conditions on the
international aviation market mean that the price we get for our aeroplanes
is under pressure,' the spokesman said.
Total revenue, including both actual turnover and changes in the valuation
of work in progress, fell to Fl 1.41bn from Fl 2.10bn in the first half of
1993. Total costs also fell, but at a slower rate, to Fl 1.72bn from Fl
2.0bn.
The results would have been worse if it had not been for the recent Fl 420m
sale-and-lease-back of Fokker's technology to Rabobank of the Netherlands.
The proceeds, booked as extraordinary gains, were partly offset by
extraordinary charges of Fl 225m earmarked for restructuring.
The transaction was part of a wider Fl 2bn financial restructuring being
carried out with the support of DASA, which belongs to the Daimler-Benz
group and which has already extended a Fl 600m convertible loan.
The rest of the restructuring involves a Fl 1bn reduction in working capital
through the creation of a separate leasing company. Fokker will take a
minority stake in the new company.

FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: BASF ahead 41.4% in first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASF, the first of the big German chemical groups to report half-year
results, yesterday posted pre-tax profits up 41.4 per cent to DM683m
(Dollars 435m).
Mr Max Kley, board director, said the company was in the middle of a
turnround which had begun at the end of last year. Volumes were up 9 per
cent year-on-year, but prices, on average, remained 2 per cent down on the
same period last year. Sales in Germany fell 2.3 per cent as the country
continued to struggle with recession.
The results were at the lower end of analysts' expectations because of heavy
restructuring charges in North America, and a decline in earnings from
interest and currency transactions, which together amounted to DM1.44bn
compared with DM745m last year.
Group turnover was up 4.7 per cent at DM23.1bn. Post-tax profits more than
doubled to DM425m, partly due to a rise in minority interests and a fall in
the tax charge.
Restructuring, initiated in 1990, was beginning to bear fruit, said Mr Kley.
It had reduced fixed costs by more than DM1bn. The cost of personnel fell
4.8 per cent to DM4.68bn. Numbers employed should fall from 115,000 last
year to 107,800 by the end of this year, he added. Reduced capital
expenditure also helped, down 28.7 per cent to DM1.28bn from DM1.8bn.
BASF was aiming for a rate of return on assets of at least 10 per cent. This
would correspond to pre-tax profits of DM3.5bn from a balance sheet of
DM40bn, a target which should be achieveable in 1996 or 1997.
Mr Kley said BASF intended to make acquisitions in the pharmaceuticals
industry. Its drugs division is only the 40th largest in the world. It
intended to acquire operations in the UK, France and the US, primarily in
prescription medicines, but also generic non-patented drugs, said Mr Kley.
The results were particularly boosted by the chemicals division, whose sales
rose 14.3 per cent to DM3.12bn. Plastics and fibres turnover increased 12
per cent to DM5.4bn.
Dr Albrecht Eckell, board member, said selling prices for the majority of
plastics were still at an unacceptably low level and improvements were
urgently required.
Polyethylene prices were particularly inadequate. High density polyethylene
prices had actually fallen in some cases during the second quarter. But he
hoped to achieve higher polypropylene prices later this year because raw
material costs were rising.

<TEXT>
A sharp decline in loan losses enabled Stadshypotek, Sweden's largest
mortgage credit institute, to swing back into profit in the first half ahead
of a SKr3bn share issue planned for this autumn.
The institute said operating profits of SKr651m (Dollars 82m) followed a
SKr350m loss in the corresponding 1993 period.
Mr Lars Wohlin, managing director, called the result 'very satisfactory' and
put the group on track for full-year profits of SKr1.3bn after last year's
SKr866m deficit.
Profit before problem loans climbed 27 per cent to SKr1.66bn due mainly to
higher net interest income of SKr2.04bn.
The real force behind the revival was a 39 per cent drop in loan losses to
SKr1.01bn. Problem loans have fallen to SKr6.1bn from SKr7.1bn at the
year-end.
The share issue will widen the ownership base of the institute, currently
100 per cent owned by Stadshypotekassan, a trustee fund.
Two thirds of the shares will be offered to the institute's borrowers, who
can waive subscription rights in favour of domestic and international
institutions. Book value of distributed equity will be SKr9bn.
The process bears similarities to Abbey National's conversion from
mutually-owned building society to a bank, although unlike Abbey,
Stadshypotek does not have savers and relies on wholesale bond markets for
its funding.
The institute will be listed on the stock market during the autumn. Joint
global co-ordinators of the issue are Kleinwort Benson and Alfred Berg.
Den Danske Bank, Denmark's largest bank, yesterday reported a decline to
DKr366m (Dollars 59m) in first half profits from DKr2.37bn a year ago,
writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. Core banking profits improved to
DKr1.08bn from DKr919 following a drop in bad loss provisions by DKr200m.

FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Sales surge in mobiles is
Ericsson powerhouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A surge in sales of mobile telephone equipment powered a 78 per cent rise in
first-half pre-tax profits at Ericsson and led the Swedish
telecommunications group to strike a confident note about prospects for 1994
as a whole.
The increase in profits to SKr2.29bn (Dollars 290m) was better than expected
and stemmed from a 33 per cent rise in sales to SKr36.5bn and tight cost
control. Higher volumes rather than currency movements lay behind the strong
sales figures, Ericsson stressed.
Both the performance and a forecast from Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief executive,
that full-year profits would be 'significantly better' than last year's
SKr3.1bn heartened the stock market. The group's B shares rose 3.7 per cent
to SKr418.
The group's powerhouse is its radio communications division which has
achieved spectacular growth in sales and orders thanks to Ericsson's
world-leading position in mobile telephone equipment. Radio communications
sales were up 60 per cent to SKr17.1bn in the first half, well ahead of the
public communications division where sales advanced a more modest 15 per
cent to SKr11.5bn. Sales of mobile telephone systems and terminals were up
80 per cent.
The group, which has traditionally had higher research and development costs
than many of its rivals, stressed that costs relative to sales had declined
'despite continued heavy investments in technical development'.
A 19 per cent rise in the group's order book to SKr40.3bn showed it
continuing to make inroads into many of its most important markets,
including China, Sweden, the US, the UK and Italy. Although there was a
slight slowing in the pace of new orders between the first and second
quarters, the decline was less than some analysts had feared.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Citicorp, the US bank, and other US creditors of Olympia &amp; York
Development's US subsidiary, have drawn up joint plans to increase their
share of the troubled company's debt.
The creditors' move to consolidate holdings of the unsecured debt of O&amp;Y's
US subsidiary is seen as an attempt to strengthen their claim to the
subsidiary's assets at the expense of unsecured creditors of the Canadian
parent, including leading Canadian banks.
Creditors of the Toronto-based parent company, which restructured under
Canadian bankruptcy law last year, have looked to the US subsidiary as their
best chance of recouping losses.
In the latest move, Citicorp and Apollo Real Estate Investments, the New
York-based property group run by Mr Leon Black, have agreed in principle to
buy together some Dollars 65m of the US subsidiary's unsecured debt from
Salomon Brothers, the investment bank.
Salomon is understood to have acquired the debt when O&amp;Y USA defaulted on an
interest rate swap contract struck in 1989.
Before the latest move, Citicorp is believed to have held some Dollars 250m
of the US subsidiary's unsecured debt. Apollo has steadily been buying other
slices of the debt.
O&amp;Y (USA) has been struggling for two years to renegotiate some Dollars 5bn
of debt without resorting to the bankruptcy courts. It has made progress
with plans for a settlement with creditors whose loans are secured on New
York properties, but the restructuring has pitted unsecured creditors
against each other.

FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: HunterPrint raises Pounds 1.9m from MBO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HunterPrint, the lossmaking printing group, is selling its only active
subsidiary in a bid to reduce its debt burden.
The Corby-based group said that a management buy-out team had agreed to pay
Pounds 1.85m cash for Hardy Printers, the specialist forms manufacturer
which it acquired for Pounds 5.8m seven years ago.
Mr Geoff Eades, HunterPrint's finance director, said funds from the disposal
would be used to cut the group's net borrowings of Pounds 19.4m.
'We are determined to reduce our debts and this offer was the best we had,'
he said.
The disposal follows the sale this year of a surplus printing site to
Associated Newspapers for Pounds 1.5m and the group's success in winning a
release from future lease payments of Pounds 1.5m on a new press.
Mr Eades admitted that the group's borrowings - incurred largely by
over-ambitious expansion in the late 1980s - remained unmanageable and ahead
of shareholders' funds of Pounds 11.8m. Banking facilities have been fully
utilised, and he warned that the full-year results would be 'very poor'.
However, Mr Eades said capacity had been improved and the group would soon
start to generate the cash necessary to reduce its borrowings.
The shares, which have fallen steadily from a high of almost 70p a year ago,
closed down 2p at 16p.

The market value of Kode International halved yesterday following a fall
into pre-tax losses of Pounds 515,000 in the 26 weeks to July 1, against
profits of Pounds 710,000.
The computer services and printed circuit boards maker was also cautious
over short-term prospects. The shares fell 37p to 38p.
Turnover was unchanged at Pounds 12.3m and there was an exceptional charge
of Pounds 350,000 relating to the computer services division. Losses per
share were 5.5p (earnings 4.3p) and the interim dividend is passed (2p).
DCM Services, the services activity, was severely affected by the sudden
fall in prices in the third party maintenance market in the second half of
1993.
Kamtronics, which markets pcbs, suffered depressed margins following
disruption at its principal supplier which had a serious impact on
profitability in the first four months. Margins were now beginning to
improve.
Kam Circuits, the pcb maker, saw export sales continue to grow and profits
were slightly ahead.

FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: City Centre 22% ahead despite recent
slowdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buoyant trading at City Centre Restaurants' main subsidiaries - Deep Pan
Pizza and Garfunkels - helped the London-based catering group lift pre-tax
profits by 22 per cent from Pounds 4.76m to Pounds 5.81m in first half to
end-June.
Although the improvement was flattered by a Pounds 561,000 gain on property
activities, operating profits at the group's 173 restaurants rose from
Pounds 4.45m to Pounds 4.84m on turnover ahead 7.5 per cent at Pounds 48.7m
(Pounds 45.3m).
Shares in the group, however, fell 2 1/2 p to 76p after it said trading had
tailed off in the weeks running up to the period end.
Mr James Naylor, chief executive, said diners had been deterred from eating
out by the hot summer weather, the rail strikes and television coverage of
the World Cup finals.
'Forty per cent of our outlets are in Greater London and they've been hit
hard by the rail strikes,' he added.
Some outlets had also been blighted by new traffic schemes which prevented
customers parking nearby, and the group had decided to put eight sites on
the market.
Write-downs of Pounds 2.89m on those outlets were offset by a Pounds 3.45m
gain on the sale and leaseback of its Leicester Square property, which
should minimise the cash impact of the disposals on the company.
Mr Naylor, meanwhile, said the group had opened six new restaurants in the
first half and would have 14 new outlets by the year end.
'Our cash flow is strong enough to open 25 outlets a year and we could soon
have more than 250,' he said.
Such acquisitions are likely to be financed out of cashflow and bank
reserves, which stood at Pounds 23.7m at the half year.
Earnings per share rose by 7.7 per cent to 2.1p (1.68p), and the interim
dividend is unchanged at 0.45p.
COMMENT
City Centre Restaurants is simmering gently. Its combination of Garfunkels,
pizzerias and up-market Mexican outlets has proved an ideal recipe for
growth, despite the recent slowdown in customer demand. There may not,
however, be enough new sites available to satisfy the group's hunger for
expansion - particularly at shopping malls, airports and cinema complexes.
Nevertheless, the existing business is expected to report full-year profits
of Pounds 14.2m, excluding the first half property gain. The shares - on a
forward multiple of 15.8 - are at a 10 per cent premium to the market, but
they probably represent fair value given the group's past performance.

FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: High technology, high ambitions - Ionica
has plans to challenge BT and Mercury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most high technology start-ups suffer their teething pains in decent
obscurity. No such luck for Ionica, which next year will challenge British
Telecom and a host of new telecommunications operators for a share of the UK
residential telephone market.
Ever since the Cambridge-based company was awarded a licence to provide
fixed telephone services in the UK two years ago, it has been subject to
minute scrutiny - and a large dollop of scepticism.
Would it be able to raise the necessary funding? Will its radio-based
technology prove a match for the more conventional copper wire? Can enough
telephone users - Ionica says it is looking for one in five of the UK's 20m
residential lines - be persuaded to ditch BT and Mercury for a company
without track record or international presence?
Mr Nigel Playford, managing director, exudes an air of somewhat puzzled
optimism when he reviews the company's progress since 1992. It is unlike any
other company in this series, in that it had no option other than to have a
grand strategy. 'You cannot be a small telco,' Mr Playford says, implying
that Ionica either reaches its goal of national coverage or goes out of
business.
He is puzzled that no competitor came up with a similar approach. It was the
first company to apply for a public telecommunications operator's licence
after the government decided in 1991 to end the duopoly of BT and Mercury,
and was rewarded with 30 megahertz of radio spectrum yielded, it seems, by
the Ministry of Defence.
Its business case looks increasingly sound. In a freely competitive
environment, Ionica argues, the bulk transport of telephone traffic over
long distances is a commodity to be bought at the lowest price from
competing carriers.
The commercial advantage then lies with whoever controls the 'local loop',
the local exchange and the link to the home or office. What about the threat
from cable television and mobile phone operators? Mr Playford argues that
the cost of cable per home passed is some hundreds of pounds, compared with
only Pounds 2 to Pounds 3 for radio. Cable telephony, furthermore, has to be
piggybacked on to television services for the economics to make sense.
Mobile telephony has limitations in service quality, cost, coverage and in
penetration of buildings and so on.
But Ionica will only be successful if it can offer a service at least as
good as BT's and at a better price. It has developed a radio telephony
system for the local loop. The prototype is working now, field trials will
start towards the end of the year and the service will be launched next
year.
Given the intention to concentrate on residential customers and to some
extent small businesses, marketing will clearly be critical. Mr Playford
intends to offer some interesting variations on conventional services. The
details remain confidential, but they are likely to involve several lines
into the home - 'features that will help resolve family tensions over the
use of the telephone,' he says, guardedly.
The intention, however, is to avoid the bells and whistles promised by
proponents of the 'information superhighway'. So videoconferencing will be a
possibility, but there is no intention of offering video-on-demand. There is
no intention, either, of expanding into forms of telephony outside the scope
of the licence, although Mr Playford is in discussions with an unnamed
mobile phone operator over a deal for reciprocal sale of services.
The technology used is straightforward and has one advantage: that it
exists. After initial scepticism, Mercury and BT are now showing interest in
radio for the local loop but they will have to do their own development or
buy in a solution from another supplier.
Ionica's switches, the heart of the system, are System X bought from GPT.
Its subscriber equipment - receiving antennae, electronics to decode the
signals and handset - is being manufactured by Northern Telecom, the
Canadian telecommunications company, through a partnership agreement. There
is interest in the system from some 50 markets overseas, which see radio
telephony as an answer to the building of a conventional telecommunications
infrastructure. Mexican and Finnish companies have already licensed the
technology. The potential world wide is for hundred of millions of lines -
which would have a huge effect on NT's unit manufacturing costs.
Ionica will shortly move into a purpose-built, environmentally sound
building on the Cambridge technology park, but it is still tiny, with only
70 full-time employees.
It has, however, raised some Pounds 50m of initial funding - a spectacular
sum for a start-up - from large shareholders including Yorkshire
Electricity, Telecom Finland and Robert Fleming Investment Trust, and a host
of small investors. Mr Playford believes another Pounds 50m will be needed;
then the operation should begin to finance itself from revenues.
Extra funds may be raised from existing shareholders, and talks are in
progress with two large foreign telecommunications operators which could
also result in further equity investment.
Mr Playford says the group is thinking of going public in about 18 months;
by that time it will be clear whether Ionica is going to be successful. A
public offering would give its smaller investors the opportunity of a
satisfactory exit.
Sometimes seen as self-assured to the point of arrogance, Mr Playford
confesses his confidence was shaken last year by worries that funding would
not be forthcoming. 'But you have to believe you can do it,' he says.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Syndicate Capital Trust, the Lloyd's investment vehicle, reported a net
asset value of 88.5p per share as at June 30.
The trust, incorporated on October 8 to take advantage of changes in rules
at Lloyd's to admit corporate capital, had a net asset value of 98.9p at
December 31.
The John Govett-managed trust has a total premium income capacity of Pounds
60m. At present Pounds 30m is committed to supporting 19 syndicates.
Under current Lloyd's accounting regulations, results of the trust's first
underwriting year - 1994 - will not be known until 1997. Until then, the
trust's revenue derives solely from investment income in capital funds.
For the period from incorporation to June 30, total revenue amounted to
Pounds 851,805, comprising Pounds 676,676 investment income and Pounds
175,129 deposit interest. After administration charges and tax, attributable
revenue emerged at Pounds 423,542, equivalent to earnings of 1.31p per
share. A maiden dividend of 1.25p is proposed.

Moorfield Estates returned to the black in the six months to June 30.
The USM-quoted property investment group announced pre-tax profits of Pounds
459,000, compared with losses of Pounds 244,000, on turnover up from Pounds
1.62m to Pounds 2.39m.
The improvement was mainly due to net rental income more than doubled at
Pounds 1.83m, against Pounds 746,000, while net interest charges rose 43 per
cent from Pounds 751,000 to Pounds 1.07m.
In April Moorfield raised Pounds 12.2m net of expenses, via a placing and
open offer, to help finance the Pounds 24m purchase of six properties. A
further Pounds 10m was borrowed which, with existing resources, completed
the acquisition.
Earnings per share were 1.01p (losses 2.23p). A dividend of 0.5p is
declared; the board said it intends to pay a similar amount for the full
year.

FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Stanelco Pounds 160,000 in loss but
optimistic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax losses of Pounds 160,000 were incurred by Stanelco, the USM-quoted
maker and supplier of high frequency thermal processing equipment, in the
year to February 28.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 1.15m, against Pounds 1.43m last time when
profits were Pounds 39,000.
The pre-tax result was after exceptional costs of Pounds 44,000 relating to
Stanelco Products' move to larger premises and redundancy costs.
Directors said the group had been through a difficult trading period caused
by problems with one large contract which had now been resolved. Since the
year-end the group had returned to profitability and was benefiting from
increased orders.
The group continued to look for acquisition targets, they said.
The shares rose by  1/4 p to 1p.

profits of Pounds 423,679 for the six months to June 30 - a year-on-year
increase of 54 per cent.
The jump from last time's Pounds 274,464 was achieved despite turnover
reduced to Pounds 21.6m (Pounds 32.2m) and a disappointing showing from the

Directors said that competition in its traditional markets remained fierce

Guinness Peat Group, Sir Ron Brierley's UK-based company, may soon own a
Picasso and an extensive collection of French impressionist, and modern
Belgian and Dutch art, if it succeeds in its bid for Dunbar Sloane and
European Art, the New Zealand concern which invests in art on a long-term
basis.
GPG has steadily increased its shareholding in the company to 31 per cent
over the past 18 months. Apart from its art collection, valued at about
NZDollars 12m (Pounds 4.66m), Dunbar Sloane has NZDollars 4m cash.
Mr Dunbar Sloane said he would be accepting the offer, a mix of shares and
cash, which values the company at NZDollars 13.5m. He expects GPG to sell
the collection over the next four years as the European art market improves.

Waterglade International's board of directors yesterday overcame attempts to
oust them, by cancelling an extraordinary general meeting on a technicality.
The EGM had been called by rebel shareholders to bring in a new board, but
the existing directors claimed that due notice had not been given for the
proposals.
The opposing shareholders, led by Mr Winston Ng, claimed to have proxy votes
covering more than 41 per cent of Waterglade shares.
Donnington, one of Mr Ng's backers, said: 'We have requested assurance from
Waterglade's board that, pending the holding of any necessary further EGM,
they should maintain the status quo as far as possible.' It has already
called for another meeting.
The existing management is still negotiating a refinancing package with its
bankers, while the new shareholders are proposing an immediate Pounds 6m
rights issue.

FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Murray lifts stake in Andrews Sykes to 42%
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Murray, who made a 50p per share buy-out bid for Andrews Sykes
earlier this week, yesterday acquired a further 590,264 shares in the
specialist industrial services group. The purchase, at 50p each, lifts his
holding to a little less than 6m shares, or 42.01 per cent.
Mr Murray was forced to launch a full bid under the City takeover code on
Wednesday after European Fire Protection Holding, the private
Netherlands-based company which he owns, lifted its stake from 29.67 per
cent to 37.87 per cent by acquiring 1.17m shares at 50p.
European Fire also acquired 760,000 convertible preference shares,
representing 8.26 per cent of the capital.
It is understood that Mr Murray, who became chairman of Sykes last month,
was invited to buy the shares by two institutional investors.
European Fire is offering 50p cash for the outstanding ordinary shares and
12p each for the preference shares. The bid values Sykes at about Pounds
8.2m.
The group's ordinary shares closed 6p up at 53p yesterday, while the
preference shares, were 9p lower at 38p.

FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Kermans retain hold on Bristol Scotts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attempts to loosen the Kerman family's grip on Bristol Scotts, the property
and leisure group, were unsuccessful at its annual meeting yesterday.
Three of the seven directors are family members, but Mr Anthony Kerman,
whose re-election as chairman was not opposed, disputed claims by two
shareholders that there were too many Kermans on the board.
Bristol Scotts has had what its chairman acknowledged was 'a miserable time'
in recent years, although it was now in a much better position. It made
heavy losses on Scotts restaurants, acquired four years ago, suffered from
the property recession, and in February there was a fire at its Bristol
greyhound stadium. . There is also a dispute over ownership of a share
stake.
The group incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 246,073 in 1993, reduced from
the previous year's Pounds 2.58m. It has now closed its restaurants
division, which lost Pounds 637,890 last year.
'We've got rid of all our lossmaking businesses, reduced debt and hope to
look forward to better times ahead,' Mr Kerman said.
Mr Colin Forsyth, a shareholder, said Scotts had been acquired despite
opposition and, now it had closed, it would be better 'if certain Kerman
members were to retire.' Mr Nicholas Kerman is deputy chairman and Mr
Isidore Kerman, who is in his late 80s, a non-executive director. The
chairman himself was not a board member at the time of the Scotts
acquisition.
The family owns about a third of the shares. Sir Ian Rankin, who became a
non-executive director in December, described it as 'a private company to
all intents and purposes' and said he wanted the shareholdings expanded.
'The company has got to change from its minute size to something
substantial.'
It was agreed to change the company's name to BS Group.

FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Wills plans ADollars 99m asset pay-out to
shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WD&amp;HO Wills, the Australian tobacco group in which BAT Industries holds a
67.3 per cent stake, is to pay out a substantial portion of its assets to
its shareholders, by way of special cash hand-out.
Assuming the plan is approved at an extraordinary general meeting next
month, Wills said it would return ADollars 99m (Pounds 48m) to its
stockholders, equivalent to 75 cents per ordinary share. At the end of June,
Wills' net assets stood at ADollars 364m, so the payment equates to more
than a quarter of the company's net worth.
The move continues the debate over whether companies which generate large
amounts of cash but operate in mature, or declining industries, like
tobacco, should use these funds to pursue new business opportunities, or
should simply return the money to their investors.
On the one hand, it is argued that returning capital to shareholders shows
lack of management imagination. On the other, proponents of such a strategy
suggest that shareholders should be allowed make investment choices for
themselves. Having invested in a tobacco company, they should not find
themselves owning a company which has moved into food or banking.
Ironically, this argument surfaced during the abortive bid battle for BAT
during 1989-90, when the UK company was forced to defend its strategy of
diversifying into financial services. However, Mr David Leach, Wills'
finance director, said that he did not see any incompatibility between
Wills' latest decision, which follows the approach taken recently by
Rothmans, and its parent's stance.
Wills, he said, had no intention of diversifying and hence had no use for
the surplus funds. At end-June, the Australian group had net cash of
ADollars 76.9m, so the ADollars 99m capital reduction will mean that it
takes on modest borrowings. He added that it was 'extremely premature' to
say whether there would be further pay-outs in the future.
The payback will be effected through a capital reduction. Some ADollars 99m
of Will's ADollars 167.6m share premium reserve will be used to restore the
fully-paid status of the issued shares. The cash payment will not attract
any income tax liability for Australian shareholders, and no immediate
capital gains tax liability. However, when investors eventually sell their
shares, the base price will be reduced for capital gains tax calculation
purposes.

Harmony Property yesterday completed its transformation from a pubs and
restaurant company into an investment property group by joining the Official
List, writes Tim Burt.
Shares in the group, which has acquired a Pounds 7.5m portfolio giving
income of Pounds 750,000 in the past year, closed up  1/4 p at 9 1/4 p.
Although the company still retains the leasehold on seven pubs and hotels,
Mr John Main, chairman, said they did not form part of its long-term
strategy. He predicted further property acquisitions, but ruled out
investment in 'speculative' developments. 'We've spent a year turning this
company round,' he added. 'Now we're ready to develop a high-yield
portfolio.'
Mr Main initiated the transformation last year, after joining from Southend
Property Holdings.

BBB Design Group, the USM-quoted marketing and computer services group,
announced yesterday that it was suing International Computers and the
Automobile Association for damages over the cancellation of a contract to
supply the AA with a telemarketing support system at its offices in Cheadle
Hulme, Greater Manchester.
A provision of Pounds 100,000 has been provided in the 1993-94 accounts
against litigation and related costs which are expected to be incurred in
the short-term.
The announcement came as the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
138,000 for the year to April 30, compared with a loss of Pounds 154,000.
Last year the group announced that with the approval of the AA it had
supplied and installed its Telemation system jointly with ICL.
Mr Philip O'Donnell, chairman and chief executive, said yesterday 'to our
astonishment the contract was cancelled in February 1994 by International
Computers'.
He said the issues were complicated but the group was suing for damages in
respect of 'breach of contract, loss of future business and harm caused to
the reputation of our product and business'.
Mr O'Donnell said he had been told by ICL in February this year that the AA
had cancelled the contract because of a 'different commercial and technical
strategy to meet future business needs'.
ICL and the AA confirmed yesterday that legal action had been initiated but
were unable to comment further.
Turnover was Pounds 1.95m (Pounds 1.89m). Earnings per share were 1.94p
(1.84p loss).

FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Recovery boosts Dawsongroup
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dawsongroup, the truck and trailer rental company, yesterday revealed a 41
per cent increase in interim profits, as economic recovery was translated
into significantly higher utilisation rates for its fleet.
Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 5.02m for the six months to June 30, up
from Pounds 3.55m, on turnover ahead 14 per cent to Pounds 28.2m (Pounds
24.8m), reflecting the high proportion of fixed costs which means that
additional sales feed more directly into profits.
Profits from rentals increased by 46 per cent to Pounds 4.9m (Pounds 3.36m),
as utilisation of the truck fleet rose from 72 per cent to 87 per cent, and
average rates were pushed up by 4 per cent.
Trailer utilisation rose from 81 per cent to 84 per cent, and rates
increased by 6 per cent. There was also an Pounds 825,000 profit from the
sale of used vehicles, although management said such sales would slow in the
second half.
The company's performance was skewed towards short-term leasing contracts,
but it is increasing emphasis on contract hire (of one year or longer) to
improve earnings stability.
Commercial sales, primarily from the Volvo truck dealership, contributed a
reduced profit of Pounds 124,000 (Pounds 191,000), but the comparable figure
included used vehicle proceeds. On a like-for-like basis, profits were up 19
per cent.
Gearing at the interim stage stood at 118 per cent. However, capital
spending will more than double to Pounds 26m in the second half.
The group has just completed its first acquisition, in the form of the
Pounds 5.26m (including debt repayment) purchase of Morgan Varylease, a
vehicle and trailer rental company. Gearing is expected to rise to about 170
per cent by the year end.
Further investment may come in Europe, where expansion opportunities are
being sought.
Earnings per share were 10.8p (7.7p). An interim dividend of 1.8p (1.5p) is
declared.
COMMENT
Vehicle leasing is a business where success depends upon the management and
its control structures, and Dawsongroup has demonstrated a solid formula. It
has a substantial fleet with an average truck age of only 20 months, and has
successfully expanded product lines. It also boasts the rarity of never
suffering overall losses from asset disposals. High operational gearing and
solid management justify a premium p/e of 17.5, based on a 1994 profits
forecast of Pounds 10m; but there appears to be little more to go for in the
short-term.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Changing mood among big treasury players: Banks' faltering
enthusiasm for trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When asked this week what effect HSBC Holdings' Pounds 92m first-half loss
on proprietary bond trading would have, Sir William Purves, chairman, cited
the mood of traders: 'Dealers who are relatively young have learnt that
markets are not always going to be like 1993.'
HSBC's Pounds 449m fall in overall trading income placed it among European
banks which suffered most from falls in bond prices and volatility this
year. Swiss banks have disclosed falls of up to 63 per cent in trading
income this week, and German banks' operating profits have also suffered.
Falls in trading income were expected after 1993's record year in which most
banks and securities houses placed one-way bets on currencies and bond
prices. But the effect on some banks has unsettled some investors and
analysts.
'It calls into question the level of sustainable profits of banks. We are
re-examining our forecasts with a more jaundiced eye,' says Ms Susan
Sternglass, analyst at the investment bank Goldman Sachs. For some, banks'
dependence on trading - both proprietary and on behalf of clients - may be a
shock.
'Investors may not have realised that some banks are very big treasury
players,' says Mr David Band, chief executive of BZW, Barclays' investment
bank. He says this could lead to a de-rating of some bank shares towards the
lower earnings multiples on which investment banks usually trade.
That has been seen in the 4.5 per cent fall in HBSC shares this week. This
is a worry for banks like the Swiss which have expanded trading to
complement income from retail banking.
Mr Rudi Bogni, head of Swiss Bank Corporation in London, says his bank will
take in its stride a 63 per cent fall in trading income because it is within
a band of acceptable volatility. 'We are a big institution, and we know what
we are doing. We are still in the business of taking risk,' he says.
Other European banks have suffered setbacks this year in the middle of
building up their treasury and capital markets arms. One is Commerzbank, one
of the big three German banks, whose trading income fell to DM87m (Pounds
36m) from DM273m after it made losses in June while trading on its own
account.
Mr Juergen Karcher, Commerzbank's head of fixed income, says the fall will
not put the bank off its plans to expand European bond trading and treasury
activities. 'I do not think this will have an impact on long-term strategy.
You cannot just take the result from one day to another.'
But even if long-term strategies are unaffected, European banks are likely
to reduce their emphasis on trading in the short-term for several reasons.
First, some of them built up proprietary trading too late to match the gains
of US securities brokers. 'The problem for a lot of non-US firms was that
they came to it too late in the cycle. They were vulnerable when the market
turned around,' said one head of trading at a bank in London.
'I don't think anybody is saying 'OK, proprietary traders, stop trading',
but because markets are difficult and there is not a strong trend, everyone
has cut back as a matter of course,' said Mr Peter Bass, joint head of fixed
interest and treasury at SG Warburg, the investment bank.
Second, a lack of liquidity in some European markets has forced banks to cut
positions. Mr Band says BZW 'clamped down' earlier in the year for this
reason. 'Markets do not have to be stable, but they must be liquid. We have
to be sure that we are able to get out of what get into,' he says.
Large trades are more nerve-racking in markets where customer flows have
shrunk, and it is hard to sell a position that has gone wrong. 'The low
level of liquidity in the market will calm the speculation down,' said Mr
Daniel Napoli, head of risk management at the US firm Merrill Lynch.
Third, European banks discovered the shortcomings of their technology and
risk management systems in volatile markets.
Mr Band cites June, when Italian 10-year gilts rose in price by 10 per cent.
'Most of the things people regarded as being sure-fire went wrong, and
violently wrong.' He says many European banks do not have the US firms'
'Formula 1' systems to allocate capital on a risk-adjusted basis. One reason
for BZW's caution in trading this year was that 'we've passed our advanced
driving test, and are on to rallying and Le Mans, but we're not yet Formula
1'.
Fourth, banks have had difficulty controlling costs in line with falls in
income. SBC's personnel costs rose 19 per cent last year - driven by
investment bank bonuses - but fell only 6 per cent in the first half. Unless
there are big falls in the second half, cost to income ratios will inflate.
'Costs seem to be more geared on the upside than coming down, and the
first-half results raise questions about the appropriate cost base going
forward,' says Ms Sternglass. Unless trading income revives, last year's
record bonuses could be followed briskly by a shake-out of jobs.
Bankers insist that such short-term factors are unlikely to last. Mr Bogni
of SBC says banks will reduce trading in the second half, but will 'start
1995 with a clean sheet'. Sir William talked this week of HSBC starting to
take significant trading positions again when markets stabilise.
Yet a full recovery of confidence is not certain. The US bank JP Morgan's
AAA rating was placed on negative outlook by the agency Standard &amp; Poor's in
June because of increased exposure to trading. Banks with lesser reputations
for risk management may find it hard to ignore such signals.

FT  19 AUG 94 / US ethical fund turns against Body Shop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US ethical investment fund has advised its clients to sell shares in Body
Shop International, partly because of concerns about forthcoming press
criticism of some of the company's social and environmental activities.
Franklin Research &amp; Development has over the past few weeks sold about
50,000 Body Shop shares which it manages for clients, and has advised others
to withdraw their investments. It is planning to provide a more detailed
article on the company in a newsletter to subscribers within the next few
weeks.
Mr Patrick McVeigh, a senior vice president at Franklin, said yesterday the
action partly reflected concerns about Body Shop's commitment to its 'trade
not aid' programme, the use of oil-based ingredients in its products, and
emissions from its former New Jersey factory.
He said there was also some concern that there was insufficient publicly
available information to verify some of the company's claims.
Franklin's decision was partly triggered by information it saw in draft
articles due to be published shortly in the US press, which are expected to
be critical of Body Shop. Mr McVeigh said there was a commercial element to
its 'sell' recommendation: the negative publicity could reduce the value of
the stock in the near-term.
He stressed that Franklin believed Body Shop's share price was likely to
fall in the short-term because it had risen well above the market this year,
and because of increased competition from Bath &amp; Body Works, its leading US
rival.
Mr Gavin Grant, general manager for corporate communications at Body Shop,
said he was 'bewildered' by Franklin's decision. 'I'm not aware of major
companies who do more or who are heading more in our direction.' Body Shop
was currently discussing - and challenging - some of the facts in Franklin's
forthcoming article.
He said it was difficult to quantify the extent of the company's 'trade not
aid' purchases from Third World groups, but that it was between 1 and 10 per
cent of UK turnover. 'It is a small part of what we do but we are committed
to its rapid development.'
He said he did not believe Body Shop had any 'major environmental skeletons
in the closet', and that it was seeking to move away as quickly as possible
from non-renewable ingredients in its products wherever practicable.
'I don't think the company claims perfection,' he said. 'We are not an
environmentally friendly company. No company can be. But we are
environmentally responsible.'
The company said there had been only two, non-toxic, emissions from its New
Jersey plant, and these had been reported to the authorities.
Mr McVeigh said Franklin manages more than Dollars 350m in funds on behalf
of 300 clients interested in ethical investment, including a Fortune 500
company and a number of charitable foundations.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Euro Disney finance chief leaves the group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the leisure group which recently completed a FFr13bn (Pounds
1.56bn) refinancing, yesterday announced that Mr Michael Montgomery was
resigning as chief financial officer after less than 18 months in the post.
Mr Montgomery, who moved to the group in April 1993 from Walt Disney, its US
parent company, is the latest senior executive to leave Euro Disney.
The company said Mr Montgomery, who joined the group to orchestrate the
restructuring, now wanted to pursue other opportunities. He will be
succeeded by Mr Xavier de Mezerac, previously head of financial planning and
analysis.
Mr Philippe Bourguignon, chairman, thanked Mr Montgomery for his
'outstanding commitment and contribution'.
However, analysts speculated that Mr Montgomery had left because of strains
in his relationship with Mr Bourguignon. 'So many senior people have left
Euro Disney that it looks more and more like Hotel California,' commented
one observer.
The shares, which recovered slightly early this month on news that the
rights issue had been 80 per cent subscribed, ended yesterday 25 centimes
lower at FFr10.35.
Mr Mezerac now faces the challenge of further reducing Euro Disney's debt.
The company confirmed that it had used FFr5.8bn, almost all the issue
proceeds, to prune its net debt to FFr16bn.
Euro Disney envisages cutting interest payments by FFr400m this financial
year and by FFr600m next year.

FT  19 AUG 94 / VW back to black in quarter

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen, Germany's biggest vehicle group, returned to profit in the
second quarter, attributing the improvement to restructuring and higher
sales.
Net profit reached DM133m (Pounds 55m) after a DM342m loss in the first
three months. As a result, the first-half deficit was reduced to DM209m from
DM1.6bn - which included huge rationalisation costs.
Forecasting a slow revival in demand and more benefits to come from
cost-cutting, VW said yesterday it expected to break even for the full year.
In 1993 it lost DM1.9bn.
According to yesterday's report, the number of vehicles shipped to dealers
rose 8.5 per cent to 1.6m in the first half, and deliveries to customers
increased 7.8 per cent to 1.73m.
Customer sales in Germany fell 3.9 per cent, slightly reducing the group's
market share to 29 per cent, however this was offset by a 7.5 per cent rise
elsewhere in western Europe - where new car registrations rose 6.6 per cent
in the first seven months of the year, according to industry estimates. VW
showed a 2 per cent overall increase in the region and a decline in market
share from 16.9 to 16.5 per cent.
Group turnover for the first half was up 6.4 per cent at DM40.8bn while the
German parent's sales slipped 4 per cent to DM21bn. German production fell 1
per cent to 698,000 units, but output from foreign factories jumped 8.2 per
cent to 862,000.
This surge included a 19 per cent rise at Seat, the recently rescued Spanish
subsidiary which was blamed for most of last year's losses. Customer sales
of Seat vehicles increased 23 per cent.
Sales in China, the group's main developing market, rose 14 per cent to
73,500, while south America and South Africa together recorded a 32 per cent
advance to 272,000.
The group's workforce of 241,000 at the end of June had fallen 4 per cent in
12 months.
Analysts said the results were better than expected and showed that savings
on labour and material costs were coming through. Mr Stephen Reitman, at UBS
in London, said gross margins of 9.8 per cent in the first half were VW's
best for three years. He forecast a modest profit for the full year.

FT  19 AUG 94 / T&amp;N set to gain from US asbestos settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;N, the British engineering and motor components group, has moved closer to
burying its past as Britain's leading supplier of asbestos following a
landmark court settlement in the US.
The settlement, announced in a Philadelphia federal court, establishes a
framework for personal injury claims and should enable T&amp;N to cut its
liability provisions for asbestos-linked legal action.
Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive, said yesterday those provisions
 -Pounds 21.1m last year - could be halved by the turn of the century and
wiped out altogether within 10 years. 'We're delighted at this decision, and
I expect to see a favourable impact on our profit and loss account within
two years.'
T&amp;N, forecast to report first-half profits of Pounds 50m next month, has
been pursuing the US settlement for more than a year through the Center for
Claims Resolution, representing 20 companies including National Services
Industries, Pfizer and Union Carbide Plastics.
It claimed victory after US district Judge Lowell A. Reed supported a class
action brought by the companies, under which they will together pay some
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) over 10 years to settle asbestos cases awaiting
adjudication in state and federal courts.
The decision was welcomed yesterday by City analysts, who said it could mark
the end of T&amp;N's exposure to asbestos cases. 'This should lead to
considerable savings on legal costs, especially as more than half the
provisions relate to US cases,' said Mr Colin Fell, at Kleinwort Benson. Mr
Charles Burrows, at James Capel, predicted a gradual decline in claims.
They warned, however, that T&amp;N would put the asbestos issue behind it only
if it won its legal battle with Chase Manhattan, the US bank, which is
claiming Dollars 185m damages over contamination of its New York
headquarters. Although Mr Hope said T&amp;N was likely to win the case, lawyers
for Chase Manhattan predicted that the New York courts would deal more
robustly with the company than in previous hearings.
Mr Michael O'Connor, senior associate counsel and vice-president of Chase
Manhattan, said: 'We have spent millions bringing this lawsuit. We would not
be spending those resources if we were not confident of a favourable
outcome.'
The company also faces the prospect of legal action by New York's Port
Authority over asbestos used at the World Trade Center and LaGuardia
airport.
T&amp;N's shares closed up 8p at 247p.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Employers round on A-level system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A-level examinations in England and Wales came under strong attack from
employers yesterday as it emerged that the numbers taking mathematics and
physics had both dropped by more than 5 per cent for the second year
running.
Although more students passed A-levels than ever before, the reaction to the
results increased pressure on the government to reform the examination
system and invest in science teaching.
The Confederation of British Industry said the economy's development would
suffer as a result of the drop in school scientists. It said the overall
failure rate in the exams, although only 17.1 per cent, still represented
'an avoidable waste of resources, time and money'.
Almost 124,000 A-level entries resulted in failure, it added.
The Institute of Directors said the 'flight from A-level science and maths'
reflected 'a deep deficiency in Britain's basic education system' and was 'a
competitiveness crisis waiting to happen'.
The numbers only taking science and mathematics A-levels had already dropped
40 per cent over the previous decade.
Dr John Williams, education executive of the Engineering Council, said
companies were finding it increasingly difficult to recruit high quality
maths and science graduates.
The Engineering Employers' Federation complained of a 'culture bias' against
industry which had been fostered by teachers.
Miss Ann Parkin, chief executive of the Standing Conference on Schools'
Science and Technology, which promotes science in schools, said that reform
of A-levels was vital.
'By allowing children to take three subjects only after 16, we are
effectively self-selecting people out from sciences from a very early age.
The trends we are seeing now are the results of inaction in previous years,'
she said.
Earlier this week, Ofsted, the independent government inspectorate,
recommended extra investment in school science facilities and in in-service
teacher training. 'Not all science and mathematics teachers have the skills
and talents required to do their job,' it said.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Albania invites overseas investment in sell-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TIRANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Albania, the former hardline communist country, will begin privatising its
main state-owned utilities this autumn and wants the participation of
foreign investors, the country's president, Doctor Sali Berisha, said
yesterday.
Dr Berisha suggested that the sell-offs would include the water,
hydroelectric power generation, power distribution and telecommunication
services. He said Albania was studying the privatisation experience of other
countries - particularly the UK - to decide the best way of handling the
sale.
The main purpose of the exercise, Dr Berisha said, was not to maximise
proceeds for the state but to achieve a rapid shift of ownership to the
private sector. Albania has no stock exchange but the president said he was
keen to set one up as soon as possible.
His Democrat-led government, which came to power in the 1992 elections a
year after the overthrow of communism, is pursuing wide-ranging reforms to
introduce a market economy. These include new laws liberalising the
ownership of land and natural assets.
Although Albania has traditionally been hostile to foreign ownership of its
assets, Dr Berisha said: 'The psychology of the people has changed' and
foreign investment was now strongly welcomed, particularly in businesses
which boosted export capability.
Methods being considered for privatisation are auctions, sale of shares to
private investors and sale of operating concessions.
Dr Berisha said foreign investors would be encouraged to take part in the
privatisation because Albania needed outside technology and capital. They
would be treated on an equal footing with Albanian investors.
He was speaking as Albania signed one of its most important foreign
investment deals so far with Premier Consolidated Oilfields, the independent
UK oil company. Under the agreement, which extends up to 25 years, Premier
will work with Albpetrol, the state oil company, to develop Albania's
southern oil region, which includes one of Europe's largest onshore oil
fields at Patos Marinza.
The initial investment by Premier will be Dollars 5m but this could rise as
high as Dollars 70m, depending on the prospects.
The work will be carried out by a new joint company, Anglo-Albanian
Petroleum, which will receive 5 per cent of current oil production as a
management fee. Any enhanced production will go to the company. AAP will
also complete a 6,000 metre exploration well at Dumre to make one of
Europe's deepest wells.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Modest retail sales rise points to patchy upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail sales grew only modestly last month in spite of heavy summer
discounting, according to official figures, underlining the competitive
pressures operating in the stores sector.
The patchy recovery in consumer confidence suggested by the figures was
reinforced by data on broad money supply, which pointed to mixed levels of
credit demand in the economy.
The Central Statistical Office said retail sales' volumes grew by a
seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent between June and July, and by 3.8 per cent
in the year to July.
This was higher than the previous month, when sales volumes grew at an
annual rate of 3.3 per cent. But with most of July's growth coming from food
retailers, analysts said the figures painted a picture of steady, rather
than sharp, growth.
In spite of the record price fall in the household goods sector in July,
shown in inflation data earlier this week, the volume of household goods
sold last month dropped slightly, the CSO said.
Clothing and footwear sales, however, rose slightly amid similar
discounting.
The Treasury yesterday welcomed the figures as an indication of 'the steady
upwards trend in retail sales'.
However, the British Retail Consortium, which represents 90 per cent of
retailers, warned that small shops were facing 'very difficult conditions'
in spite of the growth. It called on the government to hold base rates
steady at 5.25 per cent.
But this week's figures indicate that there is little basis for fears that
the recovery might create an inflationary consumer binge, and analysts said
speculation about an early rise in interest rates rise was fading.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at broker Salomon Brothers, said: 'I think
that the chance of an interest rate move in September is less likely now.'
This sentiment was supported by Bank of England figures showing that M4, the
broad measure of money supply, fell to a seasonally adjusted 4.8 per cent in
July from 5.6 per cent in June, towards the bottom of the government's 3 per
cent to 9 per cent monitoring range.
M4 growth is one of the leading inflationary signs monitored by the Bank.
However, sterling lending to the private sector, excluding banks, building
societies and the public sector, was well above the monthly average for the
year.
Mortgage lending was also patchy in July. While building societies reported
a small rise in net lending, banks recorded a fall.

FT  19 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal has accumulated a host of non-core activities during its
half-century of state ownership. Now with the company's privatisation
imminent, the non-core businesses are coming into their own. One can
question how necessary it was for the old British Coal to branch out into
areas like computer services and fund management. But many of these are now
fairly attractive businesses, whose sale should boost the modest sums the
government can expect to receive from selling the mines. Collectively, the
non-mining businesses have turnover of Pounds 700m and made operating
profits of Pounds 40m last year.
Coal Products, which went on the block yesterday, is the largest non-core
business so far to come up for sale. Its leading position in smokeless fuels
may appeal among others to Anglo United, which owns the rival Coalite brand.
The other large businesses due for sale are CIN Management, whose Pounds
17bn of assets under management could be attractive to many fund managers,
and British Fuels, the solid fuel distributor.
But the British Coal asset with the greatest potential is its vast property
portfolio. Its 150,000 acres cover everything from agricultural land to
sports fields, former colliery buildings and city-centre office blocks. If
it can overcome the perception that it is selling disused pits and ugly
open-cast collieries, the property arm could turn out to be the real gold
mine.

FT  19 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: BASF
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery at BASF is even better than yesterday's 41 per cent increase in
half year pre-tax profits suggests. The result includes DM1.4bn of
rationalisation and other expenses, twice the amount charged in the first
half of last year. Sales increases of 14 per cent in chemicals and 12 per
cent in plastics give a better flavour of the extent of the upswing. While
selling prices are little changed from this time last year, the group is
rightly confident that increases can be made to stick before the year end.
With profits rising and capital expenditure falling - as its DM4bn
investment in the Russian-German gas pipeline comes to an end - BASF is
starting to enjoy formidable cash flow. The balance sheet will also be
strengthened if bondholders exercise their options to buy shares later this
year. The question is how management intends to use this financial freedom.
BASF's drugs business certainly looks too small to flourish alone. Vague
talk yesterday of expanding pharmaceuticals in the US, UK and France is the
sort of thing that fuels bid speculation in the sector.
Yet it is not clear that BASF adds much value in pharmaceuticals. Its
strengths lie in technology-based heavy industry such as bulk chemicals
rather than pure science or marketing. Besides, BASF estimates that its
weighted average cost of capital is around 10 per cent, perhaps three or
four percentage points lower than ICI's. By concentrating its efforts on
capital-intensive industries, BASF could make the most of this competitive
advantage.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The July retail sales figures help to explain why food retailing shares have
outperformed the stock market by almost 20 per cent over the past six
months. Food retailers' volumes in July were up 6.9 per cent on the same
month last year, the strongest growth for more than a decade. Despite, or
perhaps because of, all the price war headlines, sales by value were up 7.8
per cent. Admittedly, the sweltering weather probably helped in July,
boosting sales of added-value salads at the expense of baked beans. But the
trend in food sales goes back longer, as the good figures for the past three
months show.
Quite why the food retailers are gaining more than their fair share of
shoppers' spending is less obvious. It may be, as Argos argued this week,
that the impact of April's tax increases has made consumers more cautious
when it comes to spending on durables, although they still have plenty of
money for food and smaller discretionary purchases. Alternatively, it may
reflect the efforts of the big supermarket chains to sharpen up pricing,
promotion, merchandising and service.
In addition to strong sales growth, the superstores are regaining some gross
margin, defying pessimists who predicted a spiral of decline and prompting
analysts to upgrade their forecasts. The discounters are not yet causing the
damage many had predicted and there are increasing signs that market leaders
are fighting back effectively. It is no coincidence that shares in Kwik Save
have been largely left behind in the sector's rally.

FT  19 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: VW back on the road
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having forecast break-even in 1993, only to lose DM1.9bn (Pounds 800m),
Volkswagen is understandably cautious about its predictions this year.
Yesterday's first-half figures suggest it will cruise past the official
break-even target after recording a net profit of DM133m (Pounds 55m) in the
second quarter. Although its important German and Italian markets are still
sluggish, the efforts of Messrs Piech and Lopez to cut VW's costs are coming
through strongly. The group's domestic workforce was cut by 9 per cent last
year and it aims to save over Pounds 1bn this year by introducing a four-day
working week.
The pain was rewarded by a mere 2.7 per cent increase in operating expenses
in the first half against a 6.4 per cent increase in turnover. Deliveries
were only slightly higher at 7.8 per cent, indicating that pressure on
prices may be easing. VW did not break out the loss from Seat in Spain but
the marque's deliveries jumped 23 per cent and, following the recent award
of Pta40bn in state subsidies, it would be no surprise if the annual loss
came in well below the DM900m the market has been led to expect.
Although July's German car figures were poor, VW is getting increasing help
from its markets. With new model launches coming up, it should be able to
maintain good sales growth through next year. It is also going against the
industry trend by taking contracted out activities back in house.
Nevertheless, it is hard to see it generating enough work for many of its
30,000 surplus staff in Germany and it may find it more difficult to sell
further job cuts as its finances improve.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's Social Democratic party is riding high in the opinion polls, ahead
of next month's general election. Pity it's running scared of the financial
markets.
The SD is procrastinating on its election manifesto, leaving publication
until after the markets close for the weekend. Can its leadership be worried
about the effect the manifesto might have on the already flaccid Swedish
krona?
Creator of Sweden's gigantic welfare state, the party has been rumbling
about tax increases if it returns to power. Pure chance that such noises
have coincided with a slump in the krona and a surge in long-term interest
rates, to their highest levels since the currency was floated in November
1992.
The manifesto sounds pretty dull anyway. Goran Persson, shadow finance
minister, said on Tuesday it would not detail public spending cuts. 'Persson
sinks the krona,' shouted Wednesday's local business press headlines.
Not that the krona's nosedive following Persson's words garnered many votes
for conservative prime minister Carl Bildt. Sweden's tabloids preferred a
thwarted armed break-in at the house of Curt Nicolin, formerly a senior aide
of the Wallenberg family.
Perhaps the manifesto will hint at big increases in spending on the police
force - and free lunches for tabloid editors?

Elias Canetti, the Bulgarian-born philosopher, novelist, critic and Nobel
prize winner, who was buried yesterday in Zurich aged 89, recalled in 1973
the troubled publication of his major work, the novel Auto-da-Fe, published
in 1935.
When completed, Canetti sent 'the three heavy tomes in an enormous package
to Thomas Mann . . . It is hard to believe, but I was of the opinion that my
sending the book was an honour to him'. But within three days the tomes
returned, unread. Mann 'apologised, saying he didn't have the strength'.
For four years the manuscript languished, unable to find a publisher. When
it finally appeared, said Canetti, 'Thomas Mann now read the book
immediately. He wrote that of all the books of that year, this novel . . .
occupied him the most.' Of course, four years is an awful long time in the
high-minded world of letters.

<TEXT>
Oh no, not the APR malarkey yet again. For those in ignorance - and
according to a 1993 Office of Fair Trading survey, half of us are in that
joyful state - APR stands for annual percentage rate, supposedly a useful
benchmark for assessing the cost of borrowing.
There are benchmarks, and then there are medieval banqueting tables fit for
Henry VIII. One FT reader is astonished to learn that Lloyds Bank calculates
an APR of 178.1 per cent for agreed overdrafts and one of 213.8 per cent for
unauthorised overdrafts on the bank's gold service payment card.
Lloyds explains that APRs for this type of card have been calculated on the
assumption of a customer being Pounds 100 overdrawn, for a full year, paying
no principal or interest, and incurring the monthly Pounds 8 charge. The
reader has written back to his Lloyds branch inquiring about rates on
deposits . . .

award appropriate damages, but also to deliver a message to the fast food
industry. Said the foreman: 'The coffee's too hot out there . . .'

FT  19 AUG 94 / Observer: Teflon Tim's table talk
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rumpus over J Paul Getty II's reasons for wanting to save Canova's 'The
Three Graces' for Britain seems to be petering out. Unlike the brouhaha over
Timothy Clifford, the director of the National Galleries of Scotland, whose
slip of the tongue nearly cost Pounds 1m.
Clifford seems to have a knack of upsetting wealthy sponsors. Earlier this
year Air UK cut short a sponsorship deal with the Scottish National
Galleries after Clifford had rearranged the seating plan at a special dinner
in the gallery's Impressionist Room.
The airline had wanted husbands and wives to sit next to each other.
Clifford was horrified. Such a table plan was all very well for a 'mayoral
dinner or a Co-Op bean feast', he claimed, but not for his gallery. Air UK
overruled the bossy man and thereupon cancelled its free flights around
Europe for Clifford and his chums.
But on that occasion Clifford seems to have been in the right. Mary Killen,
the Spectator's agony aunt, says it is 'very down market' to have husbands
sitting next to their wives, the whole point of social life being to meet
new people.
The only possible reason for placing couples together is anxiety that some
guests are having affairs. Indeed, the row over Clifford's seating
arrangements would have helped make the occasion a success by breaking the
ice and getting people talking, says Killen. Sadly, no one knew about the
tiff until after dinner.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Moscow still holds strings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The authorities in Moscow may be struggling to exert control over Russia's
oil industry. But they seem to be doing better at influencing events in the
energy-rich former Soviet republics bordering the Caspian Sea.
Two years ago western oilmen began offering 'sweeteners' to officials in
Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan to allow western companies into the oil industry.
The thinking at the time of the break-up of the Soviet Union, according to
one western oil consultant in Alma-Ata, capital of Kazakhstan, was that
because the region was just opening up, western companies 'could define the
rules'.
It now appears that Moscow - not the other republics' governments - will
make the rules on the development of the region's vast energy reserves.
Over the past year, Russia has stressed it not only wants to retain control
of the region's main export pipelines, which pass over Russian soil. It also
wants a say in the development of big oil and gas fields discovered during
the Soviet era in the region. Some observers believe its goal is to re-exert
control over the energy resources of the former Soviet Union.
The clearest expression of this intention was in a letter sent this year by
the Russian foreign ministry to the British embassy in Moscow. It said that,
because there had been no allocation of rights to resources under the
Caspian Sea, 'all issues of activities, including resource development, have
to be resolved with the participation of all Caspian countries'. That
included Russia.
Russian attempts to control the region's oil development began with a demand
that Lukoil, one of Russia's new integrated oil companies, should be given a
10 per cent share in the British Petroleum-led project to develop the Azeri
and Chirag fields in Azerbaijan. Western oil executives in Alma-Ata report
that Moscow also wants equity stakes in Kazakh projects, including the
proposed multi-billion-pound development of the Karachaganak gas fields by
British Gas and Agip of Italy.
Many western companies say that Russian demands to take part in the projects
have not come as a surprise. As one senior executive involved in the Azeri
deal says: 'We always knew Russians would have to be involved, as we need
them to get the oil out.'
Mr Thane Gustaffson, who monitors the former Soviet Union for the
consultancy Cambridge Energy Research Associates, believes Russia's demands
are not 'sinister'. Instead, they are a sign that the old relationships
which governed the integrated structure of the former Soviet oil industry
are beginning to reassert themselves.
But western oil companies wonder how far Russia's demands will go. One
executive notes that the obstacle holding up development on oil fields in
the region 'is not between the oil companies and the countries (of the
Caspian). It is between Russia and the southern republics and their status
as truly independent states'.
The fear of western companies is that Russia's attempts to exert its
political authority will jeopardise the deals they have struck with the
individual republics. 'The issue then is whether Russia will still want
foreigners involved. They may simply say 'we still want your money and
technology', or they may want that kind of deal torn up as well,' one
western oil company executive says.
For now, such fears seem exaggerated. BP recently expressed confidence that
the negotiations over the Azerbaijan deal will soon be completed
satisfactorily. But for western oil companies, making in-roads in the region
is proving as difficult as in Russia.

FT  19 AUG 94 / When oil and politics don't mix: Problems western companies
face in exploiting Russia's vast fuel reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mood swings are becoming occupational hazards among western oil industry
executives in Moscow.
All too often this year optimistic announcements of progress in assembling
multi-billion-dollar deals to exploit Russia's oil reserves have been
followed by bouts of anxiety as executives await the outcome of the latest
twist in the political power struggle for control of Russia's oil, the
country's economic lifeline.
Last month, after three years of negotiation, a final draft of a
long-awaited oil and gas law was shelved when President Boris Yeltsin and
Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin rejected key proposals by parliament on
ownership and creating a legal framework for foreign investment. The
government has also in the past few months delayed two other important
reforms: the lifting of oil export quotas and the granting of preferential
tax treatment to foreign joint ventures.
Passage of the oil and gas bill, however, is seen by international oil
companies as the key to unlocking some of the biggest western-backed
projects proposed so far. These include a Dollars 10bn deal announced in
June by a consortium led by Marathon, the US oil group, to develop oil and
gas reserves off the Pacific island of Sakhalin, and a project headed by
Texaco, one of the biggest US oil companies, to extract as much as 2bn
barrels of oil from an area of the Russian Arctic.
Publicly, both groups are still optimistic that the projects will eventually
go ahead. But 'you no longer find the gung-ho enthusiasm of a couple years
ago', according to Mr Daniel Yergin, author of the book Russia to 2010 and
president of the consultancy Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Boston.
Mr Yergin believes that not being in Russia is the biggest risk for many big
international oil companies - because the country has almost 5 per cent of
the world's proven oil reserves and many attractive exploration
opportunities. But he says those companies which have taken the plunge find
themselves in the midst of 'an incredible struggle over who will control the
biggest prize: Russia's oil'. All of the west's biggest oil companies have
considered doing business in Russia, although few have projects up and
running.
The struggle to gain a foothold comes at a time when the Russian oil
industry is in the midst of a radical restructuring. Output has halved since
1988, when it peaked at 12.6m barrels a day. Recent figures from Rosneft,
the state oil holding company, show the trend continuing, with output in the
first five months of this year down 15 per cent on the same period in 1993.
Signs of the collapse in production are evident in the country's main oil
regions. At the petroleum processing plant in Fyodorovskoye, near Surgut in
the heart of the Tyumen oil region, western Siberia, the machinery is
processing a fifth of its output of eight years ago.
But reduced production has not eased problems of pollution. A few kilometres
down a bad road, pools of crude oil surround many wells - graphic evidence
of poor practices in much of the industry.
The names on the equipment at both the processing plant and at the wells are
often French, German or American, a legacy of the heady days in the 1970s
and 1980s when investment and foreign technology were funded by high-priced
oil exports. But now world oil prices are relatively low and government
finance for investment has dried up, making it harder to replace worn-out
machinery. 'Each year we lose (the use of) about 2,000 wells,' says Mr
Victor Deshura, chief engineer of Surgutneftegas, the area's main producer.
'And we don't replace most of them.'
A report by the European Commission's energy centre in Tyumen says the
sector's financial problems have been exacerbated by low domestic oil prices
set by the Russian government, and delays in payments from refineries to
producers. 'The present situation is such that the world's (former) number
one producer of crude oil cannot draw the resources in currency from its oil
production which would contribute to an overall improvement in the economy.'
Many Russian producers are also deep in debt and all are creditors of
companies or countries (former Soviet republics) which cannot pay them.
Russian oil exports, however, have been maintained by redirecting abroad the
surplus resulting from last year's 19 per cent collapse in domestic demand -
an unprecedented contraction in peacetime. A sharp reduction in sales to
former Soviet republics which lack the hard currency for Russian oil has
also freed supplies for exports to the west.
But although exports have been maintained at previous levels, the revenues
raised have not been sufficient to offset the income lost from domestic
sales. Moreover, in spite of being Russia's largest source of hard currency,
the country's oil producers often cannot pay wages or fund essential social
services in the oil regions.
As if the financial problems were not enough, the industry is also at the
centre of political battles between the weakened central government in
Moscow and regional authorities.
Those Russian republics most radical in their declarations of autonomy -
even of independence - are the oil-producing areas of Chechnya, Tatarstan
and Bashkorostan. Tyumen and the other oil regions have less political clout
than the republics. Nonetheless they, too, are lobbying hard for the right
to retain more of the hard currency earned by oil exports. At present the
government, which still controls the transportation of all Russian oil, pays
producers just a third of world prices.
The problems of the industry have not deterred western companies from trying
to carve out niches for themselves. But, in most cases, their plans have
been beset by uncertainties, especially over political, legal and tax
issues.
None has been affected more than Elf Aquitaine, the French company. Its
project in the Volgograd and Saratov regions has been stalled for three
years by protracted negotiations with politicians; rivalries between local,
regional and federal governments which are vying for control over the area's
resources; and, at the federal level, by differences between the
legislature, the government and the presidency.
Big companies have also encountered strong resistance from government and
oil company officials who resent foreign involvement in such a strategic
industry. Mr Yergin notes that 'oil is different from, say, telecoms . . .
it fuels nationalist passions'.
The desire to avoid such conflicts and to bypass chronic bottlenecks in
Russian export pipelines was an important reason for a string of deals
earlier this year to develop virgin reserves on Russia's periphery. The
logic was simple: western companies would undertake large,
technically-demanding and capital-intensive projects which no Russian
company could contemplate. The projects would be self-contained, with their
own export terminals, and, in the case of the Sakhalin project, would be
undertaken without a Russian partner.
In return for boosting Russian production and government revenues, the
companies hoped they would be left alone. But the backers of these projects
still await the passage of the oil and gas law before committing significant
investment.
Optimists among Moscow's western oil community say the law could still be
finalised by the end of this year. But others say it 'could as easily be 12
months after that'.
Western oil companies may be able to take some comfort from the
opportunities for foreigners opened up by the radical restructuring taking
place in Russian oil companies, in spite of the political stalemate over a
legislative framework. A number of production associations and refiners,
which were previously kept apart by competing ministries, have merged to
form three new companies comparable in size with some of the medium-sized
western majors. Other similarly integrated companies are likely to follow.
Their attitude towards foreign involvement and co-operation varies. One of
the new companies, Surgutneftegaz, based in western Siberia, is most
hostile. Lukoil, on the other hand, is expanding its foreign links.
Investment bank CS First Boston has a 3 per cent stake in the company, and
up to 10 per cent of Lukoil's shares are expected to be offered to
international investors. It has also forged an alliance with Agip, the
Italian oil company, to explore for oil outside Russia.
It was the chance to gain control of large new reserves which attracted many
western oil companies to Russia, however. Most of those active in the
country are likely to remain, given the scale of the eventual prize. But
until at least the oil and gas bill is passed, they will have to make do
with offers of 'closer co-operation' or the chance to be a preferred foreign
partner.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Mexico's poll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The elections in Mexico this Sunday could prove a watershed on its journey
towards democracy. They certainly need to be. Fortunately, the Mexican
government has put in place conditions that should allow the presidential,
congressional and gubernatorial elections to be the fairest in the country's
history. This is faint praise. Yet if the new electoral rules are followed,
the chances of a reasonably fair election are high. The next government's
international credibility hangs on that achievement; so does its ability
effectively to govern the country.
It took a severe political crisis - the peasant uprising in the southern
state of Chiapas and the assassination of the ruling party's first
presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio - for President Carlos Salinas
to agree to the electoral reforms. But reluctant reform is better than the
alternative of repression. Mr Salinas chose wisely.
The rules for the election day include, for the first time, an independent
electoral commission. Scrutiny of the election will be unprecedented:
thousands of domestic and international observers will be in place, as will
a more independent press. Credible measures have also been taken to ensure a
secret ballot, and to prevent double voting and ballot stuffing - though,
particularly in the countryside, ruling party chiefs still wield
considerable power. It remains to be seen whether the rural vote will be
free and fair.
The rapid publication of several quick counts by independent agencies and
the release of an official preliminary count after 15 per cent of the votes
has been counted should sharply reduce the possibilities for systematic
fraud. For all that, the playing field has not been levelled completely
between the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the opposition.
The most egregious inequality is in campaign finances. The limit on spending
by any one party on the presidential election is Dollars 40m. Even that is a
lot of money for the opposition, but the limit on spending for the
presidential and congressional elections together is Dollars 275m. There is
also evidence that businessmen are contributing to the campaign without the
finance going through the PRI's balance sheet.
Nor has election coverage of the campaign by the press and television been
impartial. Certainly, the media have been more even-handed than in the past,
but they had a lot of ground to make up. The PRI still gets more and better
publicity than its opponents.
These flaws should not fatally undermine the credibility of the election,
provided everyone plays by the rules on Sunday. Sham elections in the past
have inevitably created huge cynicism about the electoral process; another
dose of cynicism is the last thing Mexico needs at this time.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Plutonium parity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The FBI apparently believes that the smuggling of plutonium represents the
greatest long-term threat to US security. It is hard to disagree. Plutonium
is the basic building block of nuclear weapons, and the hardest part of a
bomb for a would-be weapons state to produce in secret. It is also a highly
toxic metal which, if inhaled in even the smallest quantity, causes cancer.
There are thus very good reasons to prevent the theft of plutonium stocks.
Yet both superpowers are currently adding to the risks through their
laudable nuclear weapons reduction treaties. Almost 20,000 nuclear warheads
are being dismantled and their plutonium returned to store. In Russia, the
problem is compounded by economic collapse. Poverty encourages smuggling -
even the smuggling of plutonium.
Whatever the current level of trafficking, there is ample reason to act now
before matters deteriorate further. The difficulty, however, is that all
nuclear weapons states have been notoriously precious about their bomb
programmes and determined to keep weapons stocks under full sovereign
control. Russia is also a proud country, and does not take kindly to
allegations of nuclear laxity, whether justified or not.
In assisting Russia to come to terms with the issue, there is a need for
multilateral action which produces the highest standards of plutonium
control worldwide, yet does not blame one country for failing to meet its
obligations. Since both superpowers agreed to dismantle these warheads, they
should both now be prepared to put the surplus plutonium into
internationally controlled safe storage, where it can be properly monitored.
It would be even better if they were prepared to allow the plutonium to be
degraded with civil plutonium so that it would be hard to detonate, and
remixed with highly radioactive fission products making it deadly for
smugglers to handle.
Both Russia and the US should also offer a more open audit of their total
plutonium stocks to make theft harder. If the US were to agree to equal
oversight, it might ease Russian sensitivities. More should be done to keep
redundant Russian nuclear scientists off the streets - a programme which
would cost far less than the Dollars 2bn reactor recently promised to North
Korea.
Washington may balk at such suggestions, arguing that it is not to blame for
the current leaks. Yet what better example could it offer to those
non-weapons states going to next year's conference on the nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty? Weapons states often choose to forget that in the
original NPT they agreed to work towards nuclear disarmament. International
action to secure and reduce plutonium stocks now would show that they are
finally taking those responsibilities seriously.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Leading Article: View from the Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve decided to increase its short-term interest
rates by half a percentage point. In a revealing response, the Bundesbank
decided yesterday to do nothing. The performance of the German economy is
likely to persuade the Bundesbank to continue to do nothing for some time
ahead. This does not mean that a justification for lower German interest
rates could not be found. It means rather that the Bundesbank would have to
look quite hard for one, something it is not inclined to do.
One reason for doing little now is that so much has already been done. On
Wednesday, interest rates on three-month, Euro-currency, D-Mark securities,
at 4.875 per cent, were identical to those on comparable US dollar
securities. Less than two years ago, however, that gap was as much as 6.6
percentage points in favour of the D-Mark.
The Bundesbank may well feel chary about acting to bring German short-term
interest rates much below US levels, even though the German recovery is far
weaker and at a much earlier stage than that of the US. One reason is that
it tends to be more concerned about currency weakness than its US
counterparts, a concern enhanced by the role of foreign investors in
financing the public sector.
Still more important is domestic economic performance. Mr Gunter Rexrodt,
the German economics minister, recently said that economic growth could
reach 2.5 per cent this year. This would be well above the 1.5 per cent he
forecast for the German economy at the beginning of this year. Since that
forecast was widely derided at the time, Mr Rexrodt must feel entitled to
gloat, particularly since many German economists agree that growth could
exceed 2 per cent this year.
Though not as outspokenly enthusiastic as Mr Rexrodt, the Bundesbank has
noted in its latest monthly report that west German industrial production
rose 3 per cent in the second quarter, while manufacturing capacity
utilisation was at levels last seen in the autumn of 1992. What need is
there for a further boost, the Bundesbank will ask itself, particularly when
the effects of the past two years of monetary easing cannot yet have worked
their way through the economy? Furthermore, while annual consumer price
inflation has fallen below 3 per cent, for the first time for more than
three years, this is hardly good enough for the Bundesbank, particularly
when many of its European partners are doing better still.
All that can be said of the monetary data is that they are beginning to look
less of a constraint. The gamble that lower short-term interest rates would
shift bank deposits out of the more liquid ones, included in the
Bundesbank's target M3, is paying off. Not only is the estimate for the
annualised rate of M3 growth between the last quarter of last year and July
1994 9.9 per cent (down from 11.4 per cent in June), but its level has
stagnated since April. Yet private sector borrowing is also growing apace.
Nothing in these data demands early monetary easing.
The Bundesbank's natural conclusion is that this is a time for masterly
inactivity. That is probably the right conclusion, too.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Quarrel in the family: Europe and the US must refine Nato
roles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once today's funeral service of Nato secretary-general Manfred Worner is
over, senior ministers of the 16-member western alliance will return to the
task of forging a more mature defence relationship. Improving transatlantic
understanding was a loudly proclaimed goal of the Nato summit eight months
ago, when the US, like a weary parent, acknowledged that its European
'children' had come of age.
In cold war days, European dreams of self-sufficiency in defence were
dismissed in Washington as the foolish and irresponsible fantasy of
adolescence; but in January, US President Bill Clinton finally told his
European counterparts that he wanted them to do much more for themselves.
The Franco-German Eurocorps, a budding European land army which also
involves Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg, received Washington's blessing; so
did the idea of upgrading the nine-nation Western European Union into a
properly functioning military club that could act alone.
Under America's benign gaze, new and adaptable taskforces were to be
designed, ready to sally forth and deal with any medium-sized military
challenge that came along. These taskforces would consist of carefully
selected bits and pieces from the arsenals of, say, three or four European
countries, not all of which would need to be members of the Atlantic
alliance.
But Nato, like a decent old soul, would still provide these forces with all
the military assets they lacked: long-range transport, intelligence, mobile
headquarters and so on. In practice, most of the assets would have to be
furnished by Uncle Sam, because he is the only member of the Nato family who
possesses them in sufficient quantity.
All this talk of high-minded, disinterested generosity sounded too good to
be true, and so it was. Progress towards redefining the relationship between
Nato and the WEU has been painfully slow, and the much-vaunted taskforces
have hardly got on to the drawing board, much less off it.
The reasons for this are clear. France, as the driving force in the WEU and
the strongest advocate of European self-suffiency in defence, wants anything
the continent does in the military sphere to be as free as possible from US
influence. The US, predictably, is not willing to put its military assets at
its allies' disposal unless it can retain some say over how long, when and
for what purpose they will be used.
In a sense, both sides are trying to have things both ways. The French want
maximum access to US facilities and the minimum US influence, while the
Americans want to scale down their commitment of hardware and soldiers to
Europe without losing their political prestige.
For politicians on both sides of the Atlantic, there is something tempting
about the idea of a military force made up of highly visible European
servicemen and armour, discreetly backed up by US command systems and
technology.
For the Europeans this model could provide the continent with a measure of
self-sufficiency, or the appearance of self-sufficiency, much sooner than
they could otherwise afford. For the Americans, the taskforces could be a
crafty way of retaining a discreet veto over European operations while
reducing the number of men and weapons that it deploys abroad.
But it seems doubtful whether both these cards can be played at once.
By trying to be too clever, the Europeans could find themselves losing out
every way: as dependent as ever on US technology and strategic military
assets, but more vulnerable than before to the dangers posed by instability
to their east and south.
For now, this transatlantic misunderstanding over defence may be nothing
worse than a bad-tempered family quarrel, which does not call into question
the family's existence. But the consequences could be more serious in a few
years.
US irritation with Europe could translate into mounting congressional
pressure for a faster and more total disengagement from the continent than
currently planned; and that would leave Russia - despite its current
upheavals - by far the strongest military power in the European security
equation.
It may be argued that some development along roughly those lines - US
disengagement from Europe, greater European vulnerability to Russia - is
virtually certain to unfold anyway. Indeed, there are some voices in Europe,
particularly on the German left, who would see nothing wrong with that turn
of events, so long as there is a balance of economic and military dependence
between the European Union and Russia, without one side putting unbearable
pressure on the other.
But nobody would gain from a US disengagement from Europe so abrupt and
ill-tempered that the Europeans did not even have time to consider how to
respond: whether to develop real (as opposed to phoney) self-sufficiency, or
simply learn to live with a large, unpredictable Russian neighbour.
To avoid that danger, there is a need for some straight talking from both
sides of the Atlantic, with neither pretending it can get something for
nothing.
As a first step, both sides could acknowledge, more clearly than they
currently do, the existing reality: the European members of Nato are a long
way from possessing the capacity to fight even a miniature version of the
Gulf conflict on their own. Even if they took a firm decision tomorrow to
acquire that capacity as rapidly as possible, they would be hard pressed to
do so before the end of the century.
So there is no magic formula to transport western Europe instantly to the
happy state of real self-sufficiency in defence, and it is naive to imagine
that the Americans will provide such a blueprint and seek nothing in return.
On the other hand, unless the Europeans sit down and ask themselves what
sort of military operations they could reasonably conduct and finance
themselves, then US weariness of its European burden could reach breaking
point.
Nato's new secretary-general will have to grasp these realities and bring a
note of reason to the current transatlantic dialogue of the deaf, before
both sides walk off in a huff.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Cheques that may bounce back: The travel finance business is
heading for an unknown destination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People in the traveller's cheque business love telling stories of how their
products get lost. One traveller had her cheques eaten by baboons in an east
African safari park. Another stored hers in the oven of her Spanish holiday
apartment. She cooked them.
Best of all was the Royal Marine who lost his Thomas Cook traveller's
cheques while fighting in the Falklands war. Despite being taken prisoner,
he managed to telephone Thomas Cook in New York. A clerk there demanded to
know why he had not reported his loss to the police. But he got his refund.
The promise to return lost traveller's cheques has been central to the
success of the business ever since it was started 103 years ago by American
Express. After impressive growth until the beginning of the 1990s, however,
traveller's cheque sales have begun to slow in the face of competition from
plastic cards and cashpoint machines.
In response to the slowdown, the travel and financial services group Thomas
Cook last week acquired Interpayment Services, Barclays Bank's traveller's
cheque subsidiary, for an undisclosed consideration. Mr Graham Rider, Thomas
Cook's managing director of financial services, says the way to improve
profits in a sluggish market is through better distribution and more
efficient processing.
The key to making money in this business, he says, is how much time elapses
between a traveller buying a cheque and cashing it, allowing the issuer to
invest the payment in the meantime. Some people hold on to the cheques for a
long time. Thomas Cook this month cashed some traveller's cheques from the
1930s.
Mr Rider says this is not typical, however. Most cheques are cashed within
30 days, although US and Scandinavian travellers cash their cheques more
quickly. If money is held for short periods, only the largest issuers can
make the business pay, relying on their large volume of sales to generate
profits.
Acquiring the Barclays business raised Thomas Cook's share of the worldwide
traveller's cheque market from 17 to 30 per cent. American Express is still
the market leader with 44 per cent. Citicorp, the only other issuer of any
size, has 12 per cent.
Barclays, which had been issuing traveller's cheques for 60 years, was
losing money on the business, although it is not clear how much. Neither
American Express nor Thomas Cook will disclose the profit performance of its
traveller's cheque business. Mr Rider says, however, that the Thomas Cook
business is profitable. He hopes to make money from the Barclays subsidiary
once it has been integrated into the Thomas Cook network.
Neither of the two large issuers expects an easy return to growth over the
next few years. The problems facing them are easily formulated. A more
financially sophisticated generation of travellers pays its hotel and
restaurant bills and buys its gifts using plastic cards.
Mr Rider says the banks which process traveller's cheques do not like doing
so. Paper-based products are expensive to handle and banks demand commission
from Thomas Cook as well as from customers to do so.
The proliferation of cashpoint machines has led to a fall of sales in the
US. In the past, a large proportion of the traveller's cheques sold in the
US were for trips within the country. Sales in western Europe have been
static over the past few years as recession dissuaded people from
travelling.
The extent of the slowdown in international growth in the traveller's cheque
market is difficult to evaluate because of an absence of authoritative
figures. Thomas Cook puts worldwide 1993 sales at Dollars 54bn; American
Express says Dollars 60bn.
Thomas Cook says it has constructed estimates of international sales from a
variety of sources. It believes worldwide sales doubled in the 1980s, rising
from Dollars 25bn in 1980 to Dollars 51.5bn in 1989. They rose further to
Dollars 58bn in 1992, before falling to Dollars 54bn last year, Thomas Cook
estimates. The company says it expects worldwide growth this year to be 2
per cent, although American Express says its own sales in the first six
months of 1994 were up 5 per cent over the same period last year.
Nevertheless, the large issuers insist the business still has a future. Mr
John Petersen, head of external affairs at American Express, says: 'The
traveller's cheque has been written off more times than most products, but
it keeps bouncing back.'
The advantages of the traveller's cheque are its familiarity, acceptability
and security. The product has been around since before even the oldest
travellers were born.
American Express set itself the task in 1891 of devising a substitute for
letters of credit, which travellers found useless when they were a long way
from a large bank. Marcellus Fleming Berry, a senior American Express
employee, came up with the idea of a cheque which travellers would sign on
purchase and then counter-sign when they cashed it. Having devised the
traveller's cheque, American Express had to persuade banks, hotels, railway
companies and shipping concerns around the world to accept it.
A key to acceptability was successfully persuading Thomas Cook to take the
cheques at its 150 offices around the world. Thomas Cook began to develop
its own cheques too, experimenting with several variations of the American
Express product before accepting the merit of the signature and
counter-signature in 1928.
Champions of the traveller's cheque argue that it is still more widely
accepted around the world than the alternatives. Some travellers still
experience problems having their credit cards accepted outside their own
countries. There is still no universal network of cashpoint machines which
would enable travellers to be sure they could with-draw money wherever they
were.
Above all, there is the issuers' guarantee that they will replace any
cheques that are lost. Mr Petersen says American Express settled 50,000
refund claims in Europe last year.
The traveller's cheque companies comfort themselves that demand is still
growing in Latin America and Asia, where the number of travellers is
increasing. In some countries, he says, people buy traveller's cheques in
strong currencies to protect themselves against the depreciation of their
domestic currency.
Even in western Europe, holidaymakers still carry traveller's cheques, even
if business travellers do not, Mr Petersen says. He argues that
holidaymakers use traveller's cheques as a way of controlling their
spending. They regard their wad of traveller's cheques as their holiday
budget. They can see how much they have spent and how many unused cheques
they still have.
There are threats to the two large issuers, but they are not an immediate
worry. The first would be greater compatibility between cashpoint systems in
different parts of the world, providing travellers with the confidence that
they can count on drawing money anywhere. Mr Rider believes this is at least
10 years away.
A second potential threat is the possible development of a single European
currency. While this would not reduce purchases by people travelling into or
out of Europe, it would reduce demand from the many northern Europeans who
take their holidays on the Mediterranean.
Neither large traveller's cheque supplier expects to have to worry about
this for some time. Both have tried selling Ecu cheques, without success.
Few travellers seem to want them. American Express has found one use for Ecu
traveller's cheques - Mr Petersen keeps a framed one on his office wall.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Questions raised by employment
statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JOHN WELLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The failure of recent reductions in UK claimant unemployment to be
matched by even remotely compatible changes in employment - thereby implying
a reduction in labour force participation which is entirely unexpected
during cyclical recovery - is now a grave source of disquiet.
Thus, UK claimant unemployment which peaked in December 1992, has since
fallen by 340,000. The workforce in employment (which, in addition to
employees, includes the self-employed and those on training schemes)
increased by just 49,000 comparing March 1993 with March 1994. During the
most recent quarter for which data are available (December 1993 to March
1994), claimant unemployment fell by 52,000, while employment also fell by
73,000.
This development is quite distinct from the pattern observed during previous
cyclical recoveries, when any increase in employment to which output
recovery eventually gave rise tended to dwarf the reduction in claimant
unemployment, since jobs were partly filled by the non-registered unemployed
(including new entrants.)
No doubt various explanations will be preferred to account for the apparent
reduction in labour force participation. School and university enrolment has
undoubtedly increased; the Employment Service may have improved its capacity
to place people from the register into jobs at the expense of the
unregistered unemployed; claimants are being switched into more appropriate
benefits (eg invalidity), etc.
However, there are so many unanswered parts of this jig-saw that nothing
less than some form of special inquiry is required to provide a satisfactory
explanation if public credibility in our official statistical services,
already damaged by frequent revisions to the headline unemployment total, is
to be preserved.

Sir, I note that the Post Office is planning to show full programmes to
queueing customers ('Post Office queues to get piped TV shows', August 16).
A queue is the classical method used by an inefficient monopoly to ration
supply. Any other business would see a liability rather than a marketing
asset. This is evidence to support depriving the Post Office of its
monopolies, with or without privatisation.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Forecasters make mistakes by ignoring
money supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof TIM CONGDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am sorry that Peter Norman ('Wise-eyed and legless', August 15)
should have thought that I 'triggered an unseemly squabble' last year when I
asked which member of the Treasury panel had produced the most accurate
forecasts. Perhaps I am naive, but surely policymakers and others are
interested in forecasts only if they are accurate, at least to some degree.
The most serious forecasting error in recent years occurred in early 1988,
when the Treasury and other prominent forecasting groups said the economy
was about to slow down. This set the scene for large tax cuts in the March
1988 Budget and for inappropriately low interest rates through the spring
and summer. The Treasury arrived at its forecast and policy judgments
despite extraordinarily rapid growth in the quantity of money. In early
1989, the Treasury and semi-official forecasting groups exonerated
themselves from the disaster in 1988 on the grounds they had all been wrong
and so no one was to blame.
In fact, it was not true that everyone had had the same equally wrong
forecast. With my team at the broking firm where I worked, I produced a
forecast which was largely right about 1988 and warned about the medium-term
inflationary consequences of excessive monetary expansion.
Since 1988, my forecasts have on average been better than those of the other
members of the Treasury panel, although they have not been the most accurate
of the six in every year and I would make no claims to 'accuracy' in some
absolute sense. My better record is simply a matter of fact, since the
numbers and commentary are all available.
But I am not interested in 'forecasting prowess' for its own sake. Indeed, I
would ditch the paraphernalia of econometric forecasting if my fellow
panellists would accept my central point. This is that the behaviour of the
money supply is fundamental to the determination of national income.
Forecasting models without a role for the money supply are therefore likely
to make serious mistakes, as they did in 1988 and also, much earlier, in the
catastrophic Heath/Barber boom of 1972 and 1973.
I apologise if I am repetitive with these themes, but - if I am right -
there are vital implications for the conduct of economic policy. The key to
good economic management is not to base decisions on computerised
forecasting models, but to maintain a low and stable rate of monetary
growth.
Pace Mr Norman, the Treasury panel is a good forum for discussion. Happily,
the Financial Times has more than one voice on the matter. In an article
('Monetarism reborn', January 13 1989), Martin Wolf criticised 'the present
conspiracy of silence' about my forecasting performance in 1988 and
commended its 'moral courage' in 'standing outside the consensus'.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Road privatisation is best way
forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr AXEL SINDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest your recent report about motorway toll plans in
Great Britain ('Tories attack motorway toll plans', August 13), because the
questions raised have global relevance. Let me add a few observations about
the long-term trends as we can observe them over the world.
First, the total level of road user charging (taxes plus tolls) will go on
rising for decades to come, whatever we do, because all financial
administrations are increasingly resorting to road user charges as an easy
way to boost resources and help plug the yawning gap in public accounts. For
instance, in 1992 total income from road traffic in the 18 most developed
countries in Europe was approximately Pounds 150bn, whereas total road
expenditure (construction, maintenance, operation) was about Pounds 50bn.
Thus Pounds 100bn was diverted to other purposes: the rate of diversion has
been continuously rising for the past 12 years.
Second, the only question open now is what proportion of the total charge
may flow back to road users in terms of road improvement (network extension,
causeway widening, elimination of safety black spots, environmental
protection, high-tech services).
Third, the best way to make sure that road users' money goes back to road
users is to privatise road operations, ie concede toll, traffic and
maintenance management to autonomous, competing enterprises.
Fourth, this 'privatisation', thanks to the generalisation of automatic
tolling devices, can and probably must progressively apply to existing road
and street facilities as well as to new ones. Thus the 'traffic flight'
issue - which by the way rarely goes beyond a 10-15 per cent shift of
traffic, at most, during the first four or six months after commissioning a
toll motorway - would disappear in due time.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Arts: Elias Canetti - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The death of the 1981 Nobel Prize-winning author Elias Canetti at the age of
89 at the weekend removes one of the most enigmatic figures of the literary
world.
The enigma begins in trying to define his nationality. He was born in
Bulgaria of Spanish-Jewish parents who moved to Manchester running a family
business where he learned English.
After the death of his father in 1913 they went to Vienna where he reverted
to the family's usual language of German. At the Nazi takeover in 1938 he
moved to England and for many years lived in a flat in Hampstead with his
first wife Veza, who died in 1963.
Canetti's circle of English friends included Iris Murdoch and Andre Deutsch
who published his books here. But while seemingly settled in London he also
maintained an apartment in Zurich and latterly went there to live. Now he is
buried in a grave next to that of James
Joyce.
It was in German that he wrote his books. The best known is his novel Auto
da Fe (in German Die Blenduing) which was translated into English in 1946 by
the historian Veronica
Wedgwood 'under the personal supervision of the author'.
Its Austrian hero Peter Kien is an authority on ancient China who lives only
for learning. He immures himself in a vast library and dreams of leading a
life of uncompromising scholarship. The destruction of his dream by
malignant human forces male and female and the ultimate loss of the library
in a vast conflagration is the theme of the novel originally published in
1935. It stood as a prophetic, poetic warning of the fate that was about to
befall Europe.
Then Canetti produced what is his most accessible and masterly work Masse
und Macht (in English Crowds and Power) in 1960. It is a sociological and
anthropological study of mob behaviour based on personal experience in
Vienna ranging widely across many cultures from that of the Navajo Indians
and ancient Islam to modern Europe.
Its appearance brought Canetti international recognition as a major writer.
Canetti continued to develop in a series of autobiographical volumes
beginning in 1977 with The Tongue Set Free, followed by The Torch in My Ear
in 1980 and The Play of the Eyes in 1986.
The latter contains portraits of his eminent Viennese contemporaries, Herman
Broch, Robert Musil, Alban Berg and Alma Mahler.
There were several other volumes of essays including a charming record of a
visit,
The Voices of Marrakesh in which Canetti observed the Arabs, Jews and
Europeans who make up the city's population.
Canetti's profundity is
a corrective to insularity and is likely to gain in stature and importance
in the years ahead.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Arts: Tormented poet - Goethe's view of Torquato Tasso / As
the Edinburgh Festival gets into its stride, our critics review mainstream
opera, theatre and ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The poet Tasso's last years were clouded by his delusion that the sister of
the Duke of Ferrara, an unimpeachably respectable lady who recoiled at the
very idea, returned his passion. Confinement as a lunatic resulted. A regret
for lost innocence and nostalgia for some distant golden age can be
discerned in his greatest works, the pastoral play Aminta and the epic
Gerusalemme Liberata - crassly characterised in the Royal Lyceum programme
notes to Goethe's Torquato Tasso as 'old-fashioned and unattractive', words
perhaps more suitable to Robert David MacDonald's translation of Goethe's
play.
A more modestly-resourced production some four years ago by a fringe touring
company was rather a lively affair. Now a sumptuous-looking performance
directed by MacDonald himself continues the Edinburgh Festival's official
theatre programme; but the Lyceum's offering is no jollier than the turgid
Seven Streams at Meadowbank.
Despite a combination of talent and an unhappy life, Tasso is not really
romantic hero material. Inward-looking, self-destructive, chronically unable
to deal with relationships, he seems to have given Goethe cause for
reflection during the writing of the play: the author identifies with the
pragmatic statesman whom Tasso sees as an enemy as much as with the fraught
artist. The old joke, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean people
aren't against you, rang true in Renaissance Italy, heaven knows, but Tasso
is too confused - dare one say silly? - for a tragic protagonist. His genius
for alienating his most loyal supporters irresistibly recalls the famous
description of the destitute Mrs Patrick Campbell as a sinking ship firing
on her rescuers.
The image lingers, thanks to this version's updating to the 1920s. The girls
bounce in looking like Erte fashion plates. The Duke is dapper in spats. And
here one feels the same reservations as in Jonathan Miller's modernisation
of a neighbouring ducal court in the ENO Rigoletto: the power of life and
death, political absolutism, the authority of the state - none of them ring
true when the boss is simply a 20th-century playboy. The modernisation
belittles the tragedy.
Julian McGowan's set is handsome: black railings, white columns, a high
gallery overlooking the stage. If you expect the company to burst into
Coward you are soon undeceived. The piece is static, much of the opening a
discussion on the nature of poetry. It might work better as a radio
conversation piece. The translation's unremitting pentameters and
unremarkable vocabulary, with no sense of character to distinguish most of
the dramatis personae, cast a somnolent spell. The production boasts a
sizeable input from the Glasgow Citizens Theatre, so its emergence as
worthy, well-acted and dull is surprising given the Citz' speciality in the
louche, the coarsely-acted and the entertaining.
The play's emotional and philosophical opposites, perhaps also those of
Goethe's own character, are finely embodied. As the bureaucrat perceived by
Tasso to be maliciously engineering his downfall, the morning-suited Mark
Lewis combines visual elements of Neville Chamberlain, Anthony Eden and
Oswald Moseley. The aloofness and chill superiority easily explain Tasso's
fears, while hinting at the practicalities of power in the hands of the
well-meaning - the archetypal politician wearily fending off fanatics and
idealists; Creon in Antigone, say.
As Tasso, Henry Ian Cusick paints a marvellous picture of hysterical
insecurity combined with real charm and presumed talent. One can understand
why the court put up with its troublesome pet poet. I suppose the Duke's
contemporaries considered artistic status symbols important; and the uppity
ones were cut down to size by the contempt (a nice touch in this production)
of the silent footmen whose disdain one has seen in countless
commissionaires, doormen and head waiters.

It is a good day for sports fans to be trapped at home resting, say, a
slightly sprained ankle. At 10.30 this morning BBC1 shows highlights of the
opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games. Then, at 10.50, BBC2 goes to the
Oval for the second day's play in the Third Test between England and South
Africa. England really need this one. Coverage stops for lunch, but resumes
for five hours on BBC2 at 1.35, and of course Radio 4 long wave provides
ball-by-ball commentary in Test Match Special. At 2.30 C4 begins two hours
of Racing from Sandown Park, and at 9.00 this evening ITV offers an hour of
Athletics from the Van Damme meeting in Brussels. BBC1 gives highlights of
the cricket at 11.05 and then two hours of Commonwealth Games Grandstand
starting at 11.35. Today's concert in BBC Proms 1994 (7.30 Radio 3 and BBC2)
is in memory of the founder of the series, Henry Wood, and all the music has
special associations with him. ITV's comedy pilot, Which Way To The War,
written by David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd who created 'Allo Allo', is set in
the Libyan desert during the second world war (8.30).

FT  19 AUG 94 / Arts: 'Fidelio day' - As the Edinburgh Festival gets into
its stride, our critics review mainstream opera, theatre and ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN

<TEXT>
Wednesday was declared 'Fidelio day' at the Edinburgh Festival. A programme
of lectures and concerts illustrating Beethoven's long struggle to write the
opera led in the evening to a performance of Fidelio in Scottish Opera's new
production at the Festival Theatre. Attendance grew as the day went on.
At least those who only turned up in the evening should have plenty to think
about. The issues tackled by Beethoven are clear-cut and the best way of
learning about the opera is simply to see it. This year I had already come
across two very different productions. One created an unholy mess by trying
to equate Fidelio as redeemer with Christ (he offered bread and wine to
twelve prisoners, who sat at a long table). The other was an exciting
thriller in which oppression and suffering were depicted with ferocious
impact.
The realism of the latter is not necessary to put across Beethoven's
all-powerful message: that Right triumphs over Wrong. As in much of his
previous work Tim Albery, Scottish Opera's producer, has turned to
expressionism for his theatrical language. This is no gloomy Fidelio in
shades of grey. The brightness and colour controls are turned up to maximum.
Stewart Laing's striking sets, brilliantly lit by Peter Mumford, divide the
stage into brightly-coloured compartments, each like a television screen
playing a different scene.
When the curtain goes up, they form the tiny, box-like living quarters of
the prison staff. Albery is good at capturing the claustrophobic atmosphere
of these scenes. In the famous quartet the characters face each other across
the kitchen table, a potentially discordant ensemble of family tensions.
Ai-Lan Zhu's brightly-sung Marzelline survives through hopes of marriage to
the resentful, tattooed young Jaquino of Richard Coxon. Stafford Dean's firm
bass Rocco looks prematurely aged by the drudgery of prison life.
They make vivid minor characters in the larger scheme of things, but Albery
himself is less at ease at this higher level. He sets Fidelio in the
present-day, which is fair enough. (Who believes Beethoven's submission to
the censors that the opera takes place in the 16th century?) But doubts
arise when a panorama of a forest is unravelled to provide a backdrop to
Leonore's aria and coloured lights pick out the singers in the Act 2 quartet
 -Pizarro, red for vengeance; Leonore and Florestan, yellow for hope; and
Rocco, lilac for . . . well, for what?
These are fussy contrivances in a production which is strong and stylish
with a good grip on the characters. The most fascinating is Matthew Best's
frighteningly repressed Pizarro, outwardly a neatly-manicured civil servant,
but being eaten away inside by worms of evil. Elizabeth Whitehouse manages
to make Leonore convincing as a pasty-faced, adolescent boy. Her lyric
soprano is more fluid than usual and the music benefits from the ease of her
singing. Michael Pabst's Florestan was pinched, not always in tune. Carsten
Stabell made a grave Don Fernando.
By the time he arrives as deus ex machina, the performance had reached a
high level of tension. The conductor Richard Armstrong likes his Beethoven
red-blooded and led a strong and decisive performance, crowned by the
Scottish Opera chorus on its best form. The open pit at the new Edinburgh
Festival Theatre made the orchestra sound too loud, but that is a minor
problem to sort out. For its first festival appearance in the new theatre
the company has a success to its credit.
Earlier in the day Charles Mackerras had given us a contrasting view of
Beethoven: lean, lithe, rhythmically keen, finely played by the Scottish
Chamber Orchestra. This was a concert performance of Leonore, the first
version of the opera from which Fidelio was eventually to emerge. There was
some good singing, despite Janice Watson's overparted Leonore; Franz Hawlata
was an imposing Rocco and Donald Maxwell a fierce Pizarro. Rebecca Evans and
Paul Charles Clarke made a touching Marzelline and Jaquino.
Nobody hearing the two versions of the opera could feel any regrets over the
changes. Indeed, it is remarkable that the garrulous and awkwardly-written
Leonore could be transformed into the dynamic Fidelio we know today.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Arts: Miami 'Jewels' - Clement Crisp reviews Balanchine's
Rubies, Diamonds and Emeralds / As the Edinburgh Festival gets into its
stride, our critics review mainstream opera, theatre and ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
For the first time in too many years, the Edinburgh Festival is providing a
strong, varied run of dance events. Gone, and I hope for good, those dim
troupes, all title and no substance, that used to give the festival more the
air of a torture chamber than a celebration. In what is the best of omens,
Balanchine's works open the dance programme - not, alas, with New York City
Ballet, but with a nonetheless happy substitute.
Miami City Ballet is not quite ten years old. It was brought into being by
Edward Villella, most dazzling, most ardent of NYCB's men, whose portrait is
still the roles Balanchine made for him: the darting hero of Tarantella, the
electric-muscled fire-cracker in Rubies, a mysterious Oberon, the powerful
lover in Bugaku's duet.
Villella's decision to root the Miami troupe in his own Balanchinian
education has proved wise. As we saw a couple of years ago, when the company
made its British debut in Northampton, Miami's dancers have already learned
to speak Mr B's classic language as their own. There is an inevitable
regional accent - we are in a province of the Roman Empire rather than Rome
itself - but Balanchine's truths about musical responsiveness and dynamic
clarity are respected. Indeed, one of the fascinations and rewards in
watching MCB is to see how fresh Balanchine's ideas remain in performance,
and how vivid are the Miami interpretations.
The first of two Balanchine programmes this week was devoted to Jewels. It
comprises three contrasted episodes, linked by no more than the thinnest of
excuses: Claude Arpels, of van Cleef and Arpels, showed Balanchine some
stunning gems, those emeralds, rubies, diamonds, which gave titles to
otherwise unrelated plotless scenes. It is a marvel - Miami is the only
company other than NYCB to dance it - whose message is no more (and no less)
than the scores Balanchine chose. Emeralds uses Faure's Pelleas and
Melisande and Shylock suites; Rubies is Stravinsky's Capriccio for piano and
orchestra; Diamonds is set to the last four movements of Tchaikovsky's third
symphony.
Rubies' punchy, street-wise neo-classicism originally centred on Villella
and Patricia MacBride. Diabolically fast, aggressive, it is very well done
by the Miami cast, led by Maribel Modrono (beautifully clear and adorably
sassy at every moment) and Marin Boieru (not quite rivalling Villella, but
giving the dance the right pugnacious air), and Myrna Kamara, with an almost
strident physicality that makes huge sense of the second woman's role.
Neither Diamonds nor Emeralds received such authentic readings. Diamonds is
Balanchine's homage to the Mariinsky of his youth, and more especially to
the ballets of Ivanov (it has subliminal links with Swan Lake). It demands
grandeur, which MCB does not yet possess, and is in no wayhelped by costumes
that have a trumpery and ill-fitting air, and a set that rushes in at the
last minute as if it had been hijacked from a down-town hairdresser's
(gimcrack chandeliers and vulgar looking-glass). I admired very much Iliana
Lopez in the exquisite adagio: she has a natural dignity, as well as a brave
technique, that make entire sense of this homage to the ballerinas of
Balanchine's youth. You believe in her as you do in the dances she shows
you.
Emeralds is the most subtle of these jewels (as the stones themselves are),
and it is to MCB's credit that it has such gentle lustre. Its central role
is by turns witty and elegiac - it was created for that most musical dancer,
Violette Verdy - and Sally Ann Isaacks was very delightful in it. (Verdy's
solo, to the Spinning song from Pelleas, is a tiny marvel which Miss Isaacks
did enchantingly).
The ballet ends with one of Balanchine's daring, simple conceits: as the
music for Melisande's death comes to its close, three male dancers are left
on stage, kneeling, one arm outstretched. That is all. That is everything.
(And a pox on whoever brought the curtain down five seconds too soon on
Wednesday night. The exquisite image was diminished). But Jewels made a fine
start to the Festival for dance-lovers, and Miami City Ballet merits all our
gratitude. The programme-notes to repertory, however, do not: they are
altogether too garrulous and inexact.
Miami City Ballet's appearance is sponsored by Hertz.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attempts to recycle waste plastic usually run into difficulties because
chloride-based plastics emit hydrogen chloride and other harmful
by-products. Toshiba, the Japanese corporation, has started a pilot plant
which overcomes this problem by adding a high-density alkaline solution
during the heating process. This transforms hydrogen chloride into a
harmless salt, allowing the fuel oil to be reclaimed without contamination.
The pilot plant can handle a maximum of 250kg of waste plastics from
Toshiba's factories in an 11-hour reclamation process. The company expects
to start up full-scale commercial plants at the end of next year.

A Californian pharmaceutical company has developed a controlled-release
formulation of acyclovir, the herpes drug, which would make it easier to
administer to patients. Acyclovir is the generic name for Zovirax, the
top-selling drug developed by Wellcome.
Currently, the drug is taken five times daily to treat herpes outbreaks.
However, Genta, a US pharmaceutical company and Jagotec, its joint venture
partner, have conducted a pilot study, which suggests the dosage could be
cut to twice daily.
The trial used the joint venture's Geomatrix controlled-release formulation
which is designed to maintain nearly uniform blood levels of a drug through
the steady release of the active substance from a tablet that swells as it
passes through the digestive tract. Genta Incorporated: US, tel 619 455

FT  19 AUG 94 / Management: An equal balance - Richard Donkin asks whether
the First Direct telephone banking service can maintain the high standards
it has set itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kevin Newman, looking far too young to be the head of one of Britain's most
unusual banking operations, lets his composure drop slightly as he reflects
on the hierarchical structure of British business.
'The challenge for UK industry is to tear down the boardrooms. We have to
ask fundamental questions about why we need offices,' he says. Shedding the
trappings of office is part of the management philosophy at First Direct,
Midland's telephone banking business.
Newman, the 36-year-old chief executive, sits among the telephone sales
staff in First Direct's single-storey headquarters on the outskirts of
Leeds. He believes the egalitarian approach which characterises the
operation is the stuff of business future.
His style of people management, encapsulated perhaps in the New Testament
idea of doing as you would be done by, relies heavily on leadership by
example. It is a sobering ethos for managers who wallow in the trappings of
status.
Newman recalls disapprovingly a rival building society preparing to move
into new purpose-built offices. The architect's plans had a space earmarked
for a workplace creche but this was soon turned into an executive dining
room.
First Direct has a creche for 70 children at its headquarters, and will
increase its intake when the bank expands. Currently it employs 1,700 staff
but this figure may have moved closer to 2,000 by the end of the year.
While Barclays, NatWest, Lloyds and Midland have all been busy shedding
administrative jobs in a bid to become more competitive, First Direct has
been recruiting staff. Later this year it is to expand into additional
offices on the other side of Leeds that will run in tandem with the existing
offices.
The bank's employment policies are linked unusually closely with its
business strategy. This is a result of customer requirements identified by
early market research which asked people what they wanted from their bank.
The thing customers craved most of all, says Newman, was an equal
relationship with their bank manager. 'The only people who can deliver this
kind of relationship is our staff, and we can't ask people to deliver
something that does not reflect the way they are treated themselves as
employees in the workplace,' he says.
First Direct is among the new remote businesses that most closely resemble
what has been called the 'virtual organisation'. The true virtual
organisation is one that appears, serves a purpose and disappears, such as a
unit that gathers together for the making of a film and then dissipates
after it is made.
First Direct presents itself to staff as a gateway through which customers
pass to access their money, obtain advice and control their financial
affairs. Conventional banks, staff are told, are a brick wall  - resolute
but restrictive, secure but unresponsive.
The freshness of its staff is in line with this thinking. Only 5 per cent
have worked previously in banks. First Direct does not look for former bank
training in candidates for its posts of banking representative, equivalent
to bank clerk. The onus is on personality.
'We recruit from behavioural skills rather than banking skills because you
can acquire banking skills through training,' says Newman. His own
background was in information technology. He was head of management
information systems at Woolworths, the retail chain, before he joined
Midland in 1988 to work on the First Direct project as its IT director. He
was promoted to chief executive in 1991.
Staff who did transfer from banks in the company's early days often found
the new expectations about the approach to their job difficult to handle.
They were not used to either dealing with problems themselves or examining
how they could do their jobs better.
One of the roots of First Direct's employment philosophy appears to be an
underlying fairness about how work is shared. Newman is almost fanatical
about single status. The only perk provided exclusively for higher
management is company cars, and he has mixed feelings about that. Other
benefits are spread across the staff.
The 24-hour banking service is run on flexible shift patterns. In theory
staff choose their own working hours, although in practice these tend to be
moulded around the peaks and troughs of demand. A quarter of the staff work
fewer than 30 hours a week and two-thirds do not work the typical Monday to
Friday nine-to-five week.
Janet Chaplin, who joined the bank two and a half years ago, works a 32-hour
week consisting of four shifts of 8.30 am to 4pm with Wednesdays off. People
can choose anything between 16 and 32 hours a week in order to vary their
shifts.
Outlining an example of workplace democracy, Chaplin says: 'We decided
ourselves how we should dress at work. We opted for quite smart dress: ties
for men and blouses and skirts for women because we thought that how we
dressed influenced the way we carried out our jobs. Personally I would like
a uniform, but others think that's going a bit too far.'
Basic pay is related to an employee's skills. While these can be heavily
behavioural (communicating, decision making, judgment, influencing, using
information and handling stress), some are technical. Employees are required
to match certain standards, covering call duration and time 'signed on' at
the workstation.
Voice quality is monitored by a team that tracks 5 to 10 per cent of all the
calls the bank receives. Monitors are trained to listen to the pitch and
tone of the voice, and continuous appraisal is passed on in team feedback
sessions.
Appraisal ratings determine levels of performance bonus awarded on top of
base pay. The rating reflects measures of hard and soft criteria. While hard
measures such as average call duration and income targets are listed,
rapport building and the ability to spot opportunities are also rewarded.
How effectively First Direct's management approach translates to the bottom
line is perhaps too early to judge. Much of the industry has by now adopted
some form of telephone banking, but competitors seem hesitant about
imitating the management strategies at the core of the First Direct
operation, or unclear about how they work. The real challenge for the
organisation will be maintaining the high standards it has set itself.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Technology: Electronic minds over matter - Neural networks
will soon extend into almost every area of industry and science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since science fiction writers began describing their visions of the
future, the idea of machines that can think has fascinated and disturbed
people. Today's computers, however impressive their calculating and
processing power, are far from being electronic brains. But systems designed
to mimic the brain and recognise patterns in vast amounts of data are
penetrating deeply into the practical world.
Called neural networks, they derive from research work first carried out in
the 1940s. It was only around the mid-1980s, however, that the technology
came within reach of commercial users. Applications now range from the
monitoring and control of industrial processes, such as steelmaking, brewing
or the manufacture of chemicals, to predicting the behaviour of financial
markets and trends in consumer demand.
Because of their complexity and the very term neural networks - which tends
to conjure up the image of a mysterious 'black box' to many businessmen -
such systems have met with scepticism as well as approval. Some specialists
prefer not to use the words when talking to customers.
'We find it generates a lot of initial interest if we say 'neural network','
says Richard Hoptroff, managing director of London-based Right Information
Systems, which produces software for commercial use at prices ranging from
Pounds 7,900. 'But then people believe it's a black box. Yet it's a bundle
of equations like any other method.'
These equations are the building blocks for non-linear systems based on
neurons in the human brain. Since the brain contains about 100bn neurons
(nerve cells) linked in a network of myriad connections, it can absorb and
memorise information and images from all the senses in a way computers
cannot possibly match. Neural networks have only a few hundred or thousand
neurons (or processing units).
These are put together in layers, usually three, although more can be used
in highly advanced systems, and the computers 'learn' by being provided with
examples. Information is then passed through the layers to provide answers
to problems which would defy conventional computers - built for high-speed
calculating rather than selecting patterns from a confusing mass of data -
and require far more speed in comprehension and analysis than the human
brain can supply.
Neural networks do not, however, provide all-purpose solutions to tricky
problems. Their value depends on the data with which they are fed and how
effectively the results are used. 'It's not a technology that sweeps
everything out of the way,' says Ray Browne, head of the neural computing
programme at the UK's Department of Trade and Industry. 'It's another tool
in the toolbox.'
The use of this tool is growing rapidly, according to Frost &amp; Sullivan, the
US market research company. Up to 1998, the world neural network market is
expected to expand at a compound rate of 46 per cent a year. Over this
decade, it said in a report, 'neural networks will permeate almost every
area of business, industry and science'. Mostly, they will be integrated
with other applications or systems. 'Neural networks will enable
breakthroughs in such areas as continuous speech recognition, handwritten
character recognition, and autonomous vehicles or robots.'
As well as big names in the electronics industry such as IBM, Fujitsu, NEC,
Hitachi and Intel, a host of smaller, specialised companies are working on
neural computers and applications. In many cases, neural networks are
combined with other types of computer technology such as genetic algorithms
(copying biological mechanisms to produce evolving solutions) and rule
induction systems (generating rules for specific tasks).
In Japan, Fujitsu has developed hybrid systems using fuzzy logic to help
deal with imprecise data. One such neural fuzzy system has been used to
build up a bond rating programme for Nikko Securities. Fujitsu also produced
a neural network system for Nikko to predict the best times to buy and sell
Tokyo-quoted stocks.
Both systems yielded a high degree of accuracy. Because of the extra
analytical dimension provided by neural networks, many banks and financial
institutions use them as aids to bond, foreign exchange and equity trading
as well as for more basic tasks such as credit-checking, fraud detection and
mortgage evaluation.
Thus much of the recent emphasis has been on applications in finance,
although many bankers are hesitant about entrusting large sums of money to
the judgments of a computer. Since it is very hard to work out why a neural
network comes up with a particular answer or recommendation, this wariness
is not easily dispelled. Also, new factors can come into play which have not
been put into the system.
Even so, financial applications will continue to play an important role in
this market. Frost &amp; Sullivan expects them to account for 23 per cent of the
worldwide neural network business in 1998 (against 20 per cent in 1990), by
which time the total market should exceed Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn).
Industrial uses should make up 24 per cent (also 20 per cent in 1990), with
the defence share falling from 39 per cent to 21 per cent. Among other
applications, the medical sector is likely to be in the forefront with 7 per
cent.
Among the most promising fields for neural network technology are retailing
and market research. As in banking, those with successful systems tend not
to want to talk about them. But Paul Freeman, UK-based manager of market
modelling for Kraft General Foods of the US, says neural networks can be of
tremendous use in helping decide on the timing of commodity purchases and
the pricing and marketing of products. 'We build models of things like the
way in which weather in Germany affects chocolate sales there or the impact
of coffee prices on consumption.'
The results of these modelling exercises, combined with other types of
statistical analysis, are used widely in the group. The latest world coffee
price increases have clearly changed the outlook for Kraft's brands. 'In
coffee pricing,' adds Freeman, 'a very very small percentage error can be
very expensive.' Using historical data, Kraft can work out how past price
gyrations affected demand and feed this into its neural network models.
On a narrower front, Radio Rentals uses a neural system devised by Central
Research Laboratories - both are owned by Thorn EMI of the UK - to ensure
greater accuracy in targeting customers for special campaigns. By analysing
customer records, lifestyle and the age of the equipment, it detects which
people are likely to end their hire contracts for televisions and other
goods and which are likely to respond to promotions.
This has led to considerable savings on mailing costs. 'If you're going to
look at market data analysis and see how to earn money, you have to
recognise that some improvements can result in a heck of a lot of money,'
says Jeremy Severwright, business development manager at CRL's advanced
computing solutions group. 'Sometimes this shows through very quickly.'
Banks, book clubs and mail order companies are among users who can extract
more profit from customers by using neural network techniques.
But these can also be put to more heavyweight uses. One of Fujitsu's
earliest systems was developed for Nippon Steel to prevent failures in the
continuous casting process. Kazuo Asakawa, manager of Fujitsu's intelligent
systems laboratory, foresees the day, some years hence, when neural networks
will combine with arrays of sensors to control a new generation of
self-learning robots for the office and home.
Currently, however, neural network experts are preoccupied with the more
basic concern that industry should adopt the technology more widely.
'Industry is not as aware as it should be,' says Suran Goonatilake, a
research fellow at University College London. In Britain, the DTI has been
spreading the message through its awareness programme which has spawned a
number of applications clubs. So although the US and Japan still have the
lead in this area, European countries are catching up quickly.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Management: The need for a survival strategy - The
challenges facing Japan's computer industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western consultants and business academics are forever advising European and
US companies to learn from the likes of Komatsu and Honda, NEC and Futijsu.
They argue that Japanese companies are masters of the art of visionary
leadership and creative strategy.
Not so, according to an article* by Mochio Umeda, a senior consultant with
Arthur D Little in Japan. At least in the computer industry, Japanese
management is incapable of articulating a clear vision or providing
leadership in the style of a US chief executive, he claims. As a result, the
Japanese computer industry is facing its most serious challenge in three
decades.
Leaders capable of visualising new markets and products are a company's most
important competitive asset, he argues. 'For Japanese companies to succeed
in the computer industry, they will have to achieve this type of profound
vision. This will require significant changes in the style of management
practised in Japan.'
Japanese management, he says, will have to give up 'its parochialism, its
perverse egalitarianism, its in-group orientation and its tendency to
suppress individuality and creativity'.
Umeda warns that Japanese manufacturers can no longer avoid the
technological trends and commercial pressures which have wrought havoc among
the large western computer companies. He says that unless Fujitsu, Hitachi,
NEC and others are prepared to change their corporate culture, their
survival could be in question.
The industry is today still suffering the effects of Japan's recession. Less
than four years ago, however, it was in vibrant good health. This was partly
the result of a delicate blend of financial support and market protection
orchestrated by the government, Umeda argues. Fujitsu, NEC and Hitachi were
able to build a strong and profitable home market for their mainframes,
while NEC secured half the market for PCs through proprietary designs that
ran special Japanese software.
A consequence, however, has been that Japan lags behind the west by some
years in data processing technology. It has still to come to terms with
'downsizing', where expensive mainframes are replaced by networks of
smaller, cheaper machines of equivalent power. It has to decide whether to
adopt industry standard operating software and it has to decide a strategy
for personal computing.
Umeda lists several factors which he says will result in the Japanese
electronics industry sliding into crisis in the mid 1990s. First, he says
the changes in data processing witnessed in the west are irreversible and
that Japanese companies will inevitably follow their western equivalents in
downsizing, in moving to client-server computing and to industry standard
systems.
'What will happen when Japan shifts to the new culture?' Umeda queries.
'Sales of centralised processing systems will stop growing and the old-line
manufacturers will see their profitability erode dramatically.'
US manufacturers have reacted by restructuring on a grand scale. Umeda says
Japanese companies cannot make the necessary decisions fast enough. 'They
are ill-suited to the computer business which is a place of rapid change in
technology, customer identity and industry structure.'
He complains that Japan lacks the culture to nurture US-style venture
capital businesses and has failed to create any of the important computer
technologies.
Umeda fails to mention, however, the alliances many have formed with western
companies: Fujitsu with ICL of the UK and Amdahl of the US, NEC with Groupe
Bull of France, Hitachi with Comparex. Provided they take the threat
seriously, these alliances provide them with working models of ways of
surviving in the new computer industry.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Management: Esops benefit seniors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About one in three of the UK's 100 largest quoted companies have introduced
some form of employee share ownership plan in the last five years. But the
majority use them to benefit senior executives, rather than the workforce,
according to a new report*.
'Those who had hoped Esops would help to widen and deepen employee share
ownership in the UK have so far been disappointed,' says the report by New
Bridge Street Consultants, which specialises in share schemes.
The report predicts that Esops will continue to grow in popularity, as
executive pay becomes more closely linked to companies' long-term
performance.
New Bridge Street Consultants says that one advantage of using Esops to
reward executives is that institutional shareholders do not regulate them
closely. Although institutional shareholders often oppose the grant of
executive options over new shares issued at a discount, they appear to have
few objections to executives receiving free shares from an Esop.
Public companies have mainly been reluctant to introduce Esops across their
workforce because the tax breaks associated with Esops may be compromised if
they are operated in tandem with sharesave schemes, in which employees save
as they earn.
The companies which have set up an Esop to benefit the entire workforce have
usually done so because they have exhausted their ability to issue new
shares under a sharesave scheme. Companies may only issue 10 per cent of
their shares to employees in any 10-year period.
Esops were originally given fiscal incentives in the 1978 Budget under the
Lib-Lab Pact and received further tax breaks in the 1989 budget. The
prevalence of Esops among FT-SE 100 companies has since increased five-fold.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Labour names share option 'millionaires'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday claimed that four directors of PowerGen and National Power,
the electricity generators, have made notional profits of more than Pounds
1m each from executive share option schemes.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said figures extracted from annual
reports showed salary increases were 'the tip of the iceberg' in the
creation of utility millionaires.
Mr Brown said the beneficiaries of executive share option schemes included
Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, with a notional profit of
Pounds 1.2m; Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen (Pounds 1.7m); Mr
John Rennocks, PowerGen finance director (Pounds 1m); and Dr Alf Roberts,
PowerGen commercial director (Pounds 1.1m).
Mr Brown also claimed that Lord Young of Graffham, chairman of Cable and
Wireless and a former trade and industry secretary, had made a notional
profit of Pounds 1.8m.
He called for 'an end to the lax tax rules which mean that privatised
utility bosses in electricity, water and telecom are becoming millionaires
at our expense, subsidised by the British taxpayer'.
Mr Brown said executive share options issued to senior managers of
privatised utilities were worth a total of Pounds 350m, and would raise
Pounds 105m in notional profit if redeemed by the holders at existing
prices.
He said the options were costing the taxpayer Pounds 200m a year in lost tax
revenue, equal to the cost of exempting pensioners from the government's
plan to increase value added tax on domestic fuel from 8 per cent to 17.5
per cent.
The Labour party is committed to ending tax relief for such options and
treating them as income, exposing holders to taxation at their full marginal
rate of income tax.
The discretionary options scheme used for executives, which differs from
that used for other employees, is popular because the options are free of
income tax, provided they are exercised between three and 10 years after
they are issued.
It allows for grants of options worth up to Pounds 100,000, or four times
the recipient's salary, and the price can be as low as 85 per cent of the
market value. The only tax payable is capital gains tax when the shares are
sold.
The Inland Revenue estimates the impact on taxation revenue at between
Pounds 30m and Pounds 55m a year - about a quarter of Labour's estimate.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Drugs sector lifts its trade surplus by 26%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pharmaceuticals industry increased its trade surplus by 26 per cent from
Pounds 1.33bn in 1992 to Pounds 1.67bn last year, the biggest percentage
rise since 1980.
Exports were up from Pounds 3bn to a record Pounds 3.69bn, while imports
rose from Pounds 1.66bn to Pounds 2.01bn. Nearly half of the exports were to
the European Union, with North America accounting for about 15 per cent. The
trade surplus with Japan was more than Pounds 200m, an increase of more than
50 per cent.
Dr Trevor Jones, the recently appointed director-general of the Association
of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said the industry's success was
based on its research and development spending.
'Only through such investment can the momentum of advances in healthcare be
maintained and new medicines be developed,' he said.
Dr Till Medinger, association president, said: 'The industry has to renew
itself every 15 years by developing new medicines. Any company without
innovative drugs in the pipeline would have difficulties surviving.'
The sector had increased its annual R&amp;D spending to nearly Pounds 1.4bn,
compared with less than Pounds 400m a decade ago.
However, for the UK industry to succeed it needed a stable environment,
'neither sheltered by government and subsidy, nor shackled by unnecessary
controls on the availability of medicines,' Dr Jones said.
The recent government-imposed 2.5 per cent cut in drugs prices had been
particularly harsh, he said. The industry provided the nation with its
medicines at a daily cost to the National Health Service of only 18p per
person.
NHS pharmaceutical costs were Pounds 4.09bn last year, equivalent to 10.9
per cent of total expenditure. That compared with 10.1 per cent last year.
Dr Medinger played down the fact that UK drugs spending was the fastest
growing in Europe. He said the growth was from a low base, with the UK
spending less per person on prescription medicines than any other European
country.
The association plans to make a big push with the Department of Trade and
Industry to attract US biotechnology groups and Japanese pharmaceuticals
companies.
Dr Jones said: 'Japanese companies need to internationalise, but those
(investing) in Europe have tended to choose Germany. With London recently
chosen as the location for the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, the UK
would prove an ideal base for Japanese groups.'

FT  19 AUG 94 / Smokeless bullets give British Coal a shot in the arm: The
turnaround at one of the corporation's subsidiaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the early years they were called Bronowski's bullets: small lumps of
smokeless fuel named after Jacob Bronowski, the National Coal Board research
director who later went on to write and present the Ascent of Man television
series for the BBC.
But although the bullets are popular, the British Coal subsidiary which
sells them - Coal Products - has struggled for most of its life to make a
profit, and usually made losses. It has turned itself around just in time
for privatisation.
As the corporation yesterday sent potential bidders confidential details of
Coal Products, it was able to boast of a company that last year made
operating profits of Pounds 16m.
The subsidiary's turnover of Pounds 131m is larger than three of the
corporation's five core mining regions which are being sold off this year.
Mr Ray Proctor, British Coal finance director, said the recent turnaround,
which began in 1992-93 with Pounds 5m of profits, had generated a keen
interest in the sale.
Coal Products was given its strongest impetus in the 1950s after a series of
smogs alarmed London and increased pressure for a ban on burning coal in
cities. The 1956 Clean Air Act established a series of smokeless zones.
Although other smokeless fuels were on sale, notably Anglo-United's Coalite,
the NCB, later renamed British Coal, developed several of its own including
Homefire, which attracted the 'bullets' nickname.
These have helped the company to capture 30 per cent of the UK solid
smokeless fuel market and 60 per cent of the foundry coke market.
Among British Coal's non-mining companies, only British Fuels Group has a
larger turnover. Making money out of sales has proved problematic, however.
Mr Proctor said the profits turnaround of the last two years was due in part
to a decision to concentrate on marketing just Homefire and one other brand,
Phurnacite.
The company had also benefited from the closure of a lossmaking plant in
Chesterfield, Derbyshire, and a 50 per cent reduction in headquarters
overheads in the last 18 months.
British Coal was unable to say who the likely bidders would be but it is
thought that several of the companies which are considering bids for the
five mining regions will also be looking at Coal Products.
RJB Mining and Ryan Group, which both have interests in smokeless fuel, are
among possible contenders. Coal Products buys about 1m tonnes of coal a year
and this would provide mining companies with scope for vertical integration.
Several foreign companies are thought to be considering bids and Mr David
Foster, the subsidiary's operations director, is considering launching a
management buy-out.
British Coal is asking for initial bids by September 30 with the hope of
completing the sale by the end of the year.
The corporation's widespread property interests and its British Fuel Groups
are among other subsidiary activities being prepared for disposal.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Lloyd's agents optimistic on capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Agents at Lloyd's of London expect the insurance market's capital base to
fall in 1995 but forecasts issued yesterday are more optimistic than had
been expected in some quarters.
The Lloyd's Market Board, which directs the market's business, said members'
agents and licensed Lloyd's advisers expected to be able to provide capacity
 -the amount of premiums syndicates can underwrite - up to a maximum of
Pounds 10.3bn in 1995.
Agents handle the affairs of individual Names, whose assets have
traditionally supported the market, while the advisers look after corporate
investors.
This year Lloyd's syndicates have an estimated Pounds 11bn in capacity. Some
agents have predicted that the amount of capacity provided by the Names -
about Pounds 9.3bn - would fall as much as 30 per cent after another year of
heavy losses.
Lloyd's reported losses of about Pounds 2bn for the 1991 year of account in
May, in line with its three-year accounting system. Several hundred of the
17,624 trading Names are expected to be unable to pay their losses, forcing
many to resign.
Corporate investors, who raised more than Pounds 800m last year, are
expected to raise more this year, partially compensating for the decline in
support from individuals.
It is still likely, however, that some syndicates could find themselves
short of capacity. The market board said agents were seeking about Pounds
11.5bn in capacity.
It said the market was 'not experiencing significant overcapacity although
premium rates have softened in an increasing number of areas'.
Separately, Lloyd's said that legal claims by hundreds of its Names from
North America were 'unfounded'. More than 400 Names allege that they are
victims of systematic fraud.
They will ask a federal judge in San Diego, California, to rescind their
Lloyd's contracts and discharge their multi-million dollar liabilities.
Previous cases against Lloyd's in the US failed when the courts there agreed
with Lloyd's that all grievances should be settled in a British court.
In the biggest action to date in the US, the Supreme Court ruled last
November that American investors could not sue Lloyd's for securities fraud.
A federal judge in New York had dismissed their action without ruling on the
merits of the case. More than 100 US Names were involved.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Grassroot Tories urge move to right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tory party members want more rightwing policies, according to the first
returns from a questionnaire sent out to the grassroots by the party's
voluntary wing.
In response to questions from the Conservative Policy Centre, members said
they supported the introduction of identity cards, an overhaul of social
security spending, and an end to defence cuts.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's acting campaign co-ordinator, said the
questionnaire revealed more about the Conservative party by the questions it
left out than by the ones it included.
'There is no question about why thousands of members are deserting the Tory
party, leaving it dependent on its bankers for survival,' he said.
Sir George Young, financial secretary to the Treasury, said there was
nothing unusual in the canvassing exercise. The Conservative Policy Centre
regularly conducted discussions throughout the whole country with party
members.
He told BBC radio that people felt 'bruised' by the recession, but said:
'All the statistics are pointing in the right direction - output, inflation,
unemployment, business confidence. I think in due course that will feed
through to people for more confidence.'

FT  19 AUG 94 / Heatwave mixed blessing for shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sizzling summer weather last month boosted sales of soft drinks, ice cream,
summer clothing and garden furniture, but depressed business in indoor
furniture, carpets and electrical goods, the British Retail Consortium said
yesterday.
The data came as the Central Statistical Office announced that retail sales
volumes grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent in July, compared with
June, and 3.8 per cent during the year.
Although these figures were slightly higher than in June, when the annual
volume growth was 3.3 per cent, City analysts said they painted a picture of
steady, rather than sharp growth.
Almost all the growth in last month's figures came from the food sector,
they said. Non-food retailers saw a small monthly fall in their sales
volumes, in spite of aggressive discounting, suggesting that consumer
confidence remained relatively patchy in the aftermath of April's tax
increases.
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist with Warburgs, said: 'The overall picture is
one of lower prices keeping volumes up, rather than strong spending growth
threatening higher prices.'
In the household goods sector, for example, sales volumes fell by 0.7 per
cent in July, compared with June, in spite of heavy discounting in this
sector. Measured on a three-monthly basis, sales values and volumes each
rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.9 per cent in the three months to July,
compared with the three months to April, indicating that prices in this
period had been flat.
The consortium said furniture and carpet sales were depressed in July by the
hot weather and a static housing market. Electrical and electronic goods
also performed badly, with sales marginally down on the previous year.
Although fridges and freezers sold well, demand fell for camcorders and
video games.
One household goods sector that benefited was the DIY market, which saw
strong demand for barbecues and garden equipment, the consortium said.
Sales at clothing and footwear retailers rose slightly, with volumes growing
by 0.2 per cent in July, compared with June, and 1.2 per cent in the three
months to July compared with the three months to April.
Seasonally adjusted values, however, were flat between June and July, and
grew by only 0.9 per cent in the three months to July, compared with the
previous three months.

FT  19 AUG 94 / M4 weakness may help delay base rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mixed figures on bank lending yesterday gave a confused picture of the
strength of credit demand.
The annual growth rate of M4, the broad measure of the money supply, fell to
a seasonally adjusted 4.8 per cent in July from 5.6 per cent in June,
according to the Bank of England. This is well towards the bottom of the
government's 3 per cent to 9 per cent monitoring range for M4. Between June
and July M4 grew a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent.
M4 growth is one of the leading inflationary signs monitored by the Bank and
its weakness may further tilt the argument against an imminent increase in
the base rate.
However, sterling lending to the M4 private sector, which consists of all UK
residents apart from banks, building societies and the public sector, was a
seasonally adjusted Pounds 2.4bn in July. That is higher than the Pounds
1.6bn average recorded during the first six months of the year, although
down from Pounds 2.9bn in June.
British Bankers Association figures, which are compiled on a different basis
from the Bank of England statistics, showed that UK banks had increased
their lending in July to Pounds 1.4bn from Pounds 982m in June.
The association said consumer credit grew a modest Pounds 51m in July. The
increase meant, however, that consumer credit had risen for four consecutive
months for the first time since 1991.
Lending continued to be strong to the financial sector, which borrowed
Pounds 687m in July. Securities dealers, which borrowed heavily late last
year but which have been repaying debt since the collapse of the bond market
in February, borrowed Pounds 392m last month.
Non-financial companies, however, continue to be reluctant to take on debt.
The manufacturing sector repaid Pounds 255m of debt in July after borrowing
Pounds 148m in June.
Mr Don Smith, economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'Lending appears to
be recovering at last but the progress looks very tentative. These figures
do not yet exude the confidence they should for this stage of the economic
cycle.'
Sales of machine tools rose in the second quarter but were below their
pre-recession peak, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
The volume of machine tools sales in the three months to June was 11 per
cent higher, on a seasonally adjusted basis, than in the first three months
of the year. Compared with the second quarter of 1993, however, sales were
only 2.8 per cent ahead, and about one-third below their 1990 levels.
Export sales rose 13.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter in volume terms, while
home sales increased 9.6 per cent. Total orders on hand for machine tools
showed a 2.4 per cent increase over the quarter but were 20.2 per cent down
on June 1993.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Why food figures are getting fatter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A casual observer of the retail sales data published yesterday might deduce
the British were becoming very fat.
As the figures show, food shops have been performing strongly in recent
months and account for most of July's retail sales growth.
Between June and July food retailers' sales volumes rose by a seasonally
adjusted 1.4 per cent. Volumes were 5.2 per cent higher in the three months
to July, compared to the same period last year.
One reason for this growth, according to analysts, has been growing demand
for soft drinks and fruit and vegetables in the hot weather.
Mr Hugh Clarke, trading policy director of the British Retail Consortium,
says: 'Right through the recession food and drink showed good growth. There
is no doubt people have got used to eating well.'
But another reason may lie in the changing nature of the retail sector
itself.
Under the current system for producing the retail sales data, the CSO
classifies its retail outlets into three main categories - food, non-food
and 'mixed'. But 'food' stores such as supermarkets are increasingly selling
non-food goods such as petrol and clothing. The CSO admits it is hard to
tell just how much these non-food items are affecting the index.
In response to demands from retailers for more detail, the CSO started a
commodity based index last year, which breaks down sales from 44 retailers.
These figures show, for example, that the value of food sales in these shops
grew by 7 per cent in July, compared with the year before - slightly up from
June's figure, when food sales were running 5 per cent higher, measured
year-on-year.
But deducing how much growth there is in the non-food category is difficult
because the CSO does not yet produce figures showing comparable growth in
volumes. Instead, it points out that in 1991 - the last available data -
food was calculated to represent 70 per cent of 'food' retailers' sales
values, and 10 per cent among 'mixed' retailers.
As Mr Philip Gooding, CSO statistician, says: 'The problem with separating
it out is that we would have to ask businesses for a detailed breakdown of
sales and it would impose a heavy burden on them.'
But although the CSO itself has little statistical evidence, the trend among
retailers does suggest a rise.
Tesco, which has 442 stores, opened its 200th petrol station this month, and
says its beauty and pharmacy products are now a 'big growth area'. J
Sainsbury has almost 150 petrol stations, up from 90 four years ago.
Meanwhile Safeway points out that a significant part of its business stems
not only from non-food items, but also from the provision of services such
as post offices. And though the group argues that growth in these non-food
sectors has been matched by growing food sales, the increasingly significant
role played in retailing by the superstore means that petrol and perfumes
could fatten up the CSO's 'food' data even further.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Recovery in housing market remains slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fragility of the housing market recovery was further underlined
yesterday as figures released by the Building Societies Association
reflected another month of mixed fortunes for mortgage lending.
The statistics showed unexpectedly good news for societies in terms of
retail savings, but the unpredictability of savings patterns in recent
months led the association to adopt a cautious tone.
New net lending totalled Pounds 1.16bn in July, only slightly higher than
the Pounds 1.15bn recorded in June, though up by a more significant 14 per
cent on July last year.
This appeared to be a sign of an improved market share for societies, rather
than the strengthening of the market as a whole.
The British Bankers' Association reported that mortgage lending by banks was
weaker in July than it had been the previous month.
Allowing for securitisation - which involves the selling of 'packages' of
mortgages to a company acting as a financial vehicle which issues bonds
against them - banks' new mortgage lending was Pounds 593m last month,
against Pounds 652m in June.
Another indication of the slow growth in the housing market is published
today in the monthly survey from the House Builders Federation.
This found demand for newly built homes still rising last month, but at a
much slower rate than earlier in the year.
There was less encouraging news for societies in terms of net new
commitments in July.
These figures, which are for loans agreed but not yet made, are seen as an
important forward-looking indicator, since they are a guide to the lending
that will be undertaken in the next couple of months.
Societies' net new commitments totalled Pounds 3.22bn in July - higher than
the Pounds 2.94bn equivalent figure for the same month last year, but down
by 10 per cent on the Pounds 3.58bn figure for June.
The numbers of net new commitments showed a similar pattern. Some 54,000
commitments were made last month, compared with 60,000 in June and 52,000 in
July last year.
Mr Adrian Coles, BSA director-general, said that while the figures were
'moving in the right direction, it is still too early to claim that a
sustained recovery is under way'.
He was also wary of sounding too optimistic about the retail savings figures
for societies, even though they showed an unseasonal net inflow of Pounds
286m in July. That was in sharp contrast to the net outflow of Pounds 104m
in June and of Pounds 61m last July.
Mr Coles described the inflow as encouraging, and suggested that the higher
rates being offered by societies on three- to five-year investments might
have been responsible for at least some of the improvement.
He emphasised, however, the continuing fierce competition in the retail
savings market from vehicles such as unit trusts and Peps.
'Given the overall current levels of interest rates and the desire of
investors to seek higher (although more risky) returns in the equity
markets, the recent volatility in building society retail savings is
expected to continue,' he said.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Sinking terminals fight for oily lifeline: The battle to
benefit from Scotland's new finds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What's in a name? Everything, according to local government officials on
mainland Scotland and the northern isles vying for a share in the future
wealth of the UK's most promising frontier oil province.
'West of Shetland' is the most common term for an area of the North Sea in
which British Petroleum is developing its Foinaven discovery.
But use that term in the Orkney Islands and you will soon be reminded that
Foinaven lies 'north of Orkney'. For those on the mainland, 'Atlantic
margin' has the right neutral ring. The one thing all officials can agree on
is that oil fever has broken out again in some of Scotland's more remote
coastal and island communities.
But this time there is little chance of a bonanza on the scale of earlier
North Sea discoveries. Although between 2bn and 10bn barrels of oil may
eventually be found, developing deep-water fields in the harsh conditions of
the open ocean is risky and expensive. And the waxy oil found so far sells
at a discount to Brent Blend, the North Sea benchmark.
Local officials, however, are optimistic that the new finds will throw a
lifeline to at least one of the huge oil terminals at Sullom Voe, Flotta and
Nigg, which without new business face steady decline and eventual closure.
Foinaven's expected production of 75,000 barrels per day by late next year
or early 1996 will do little to fill the increasingly empty tanks at the
terminals, which can handle hundreds of thousands of barrels a day. But
experts believe Foinaven will be only the first of a string of discoveries
developed over the next few years.
Schiehallion and Clair, two other discoveries, are being assessed. And if
the Foinaven reservoir behaves in the way BP engineers hope, the first phase
could be followed by a more ambitious second stage of development. Other
companies are optimistic about the area. There are reports that Amerada Hess
has found sufficient reserves to justify commercial development.
However, even the most optimistic forecast for future production suggests
that it will not be enough to sustain three terminals. Hence the
increasingly bitter competition to secure the contract to land and store
Foinaven oil.
Nigg, the smallest terminal, was built 13 years ago to receive oil by
pipeline from the Beatrice platform. It also offloads tankers from the new
Gryphon field.
Failure to win the Foinaven contract would be 'life-threatening', said an
executive with one of the terminal's owners. With Beatrice production in
sharp decline more of the terminal's operating costs would have to be added
to the smaller Gryphon field, a burden which 'may not be economic', said the
executive.
Only about 25 people work at the Nigg terminal, but its closure would have
wide repercussions. As well as the loss of harbour fees, rates and other
oil-related payments, Nigg would face the departure of the tug boats used to
berth the tankers. That would put an end to the growing number of visits by
cruise ships and the tourist trade which has been built up to serve them.
Nigg's bid to BP is expected to be about half that of Flotta and Sullom Voe,
because it already has the heated storage tanks which Foinaven oil requires.
But shuttle tankers would have to add eight hours to their return-journey
time compared with the other two.
Flotta, which lies alongside the natural deep-water harbour of Scapa Flow,
is likely to offer BP a partnership which could include a stake in the
terminal.
Orkney Islands Council would support using part of a Pounds 60m fund
controlled by it and the terminal's owners to pay for modifications to
Flotta's facilities.
Mr John Bryce of Elf Enterprise, operator of the terminal, said both Flotta
and Sullom Voe would have to invest between Pounds 3m and Pounds 8m in new
Foinaven-related facilities. But the winning local authority could gain
between Pounds 3m and Pounds 6m in additional revenues over five years, he
estimates.
Profits for the terminal operators from a Foinaven contract are likely to be
modest, given BP's rigorous emphasis on cost-cutting. But officials at both
Sullom Voe and Flotta believe success with Foinaven would put the winning
terminal in a better position to serve as the landfall for a pipeline which
might be built once other fields are on stream.
'We need to get business in here now,' said Mr Bryce. 'We don't want to be
in the position of mothballing facilities only to discover that somebody
wants to build a pipeline.'
People in Shetland know it would be humiliating if oil from West of
Shetland, to use the most common term for the area, failed to come to Sullom
Voe. Because of its size Sullom Voe plays a proportionately more important
part in the Shetland economy than Flotta and Nigg do in the economies of
Orkney and of the Highland region respectively.
Daily throughput of oil at Sullom Voe averages about 800,000 barrels per
day, more than double the flow at Flotta. It employs 411 people and pays
rent and other charges amounting to about Pounds 9m a year to Shetland
Islands council.
However, throughput at Sullom Voe is predicted to fall to about 450,000
barrels per day over the next four to five years as the Ninian and Brent
fields which feed it decline. They have already warned Shetlanders that
Foinaven will not be 'a white knight' that halts the terminal's long-term
decline.
Shetland Islands council, concerned not only that Foinaven oil could bypass
it but also that users of Sullom Voe could adopt other ways of transporting
crude, wants to know what it can do to improve Sullom Voe's chances. So far,
it says, it has heard nothing from oil companies, but it would be
understandable if they were to ask for a substantial rent reduction.

the Victoria and Albert Museum said yesterday.
The announcement ends fears that Mr Getty will withdraw his offer. He had
been upset at remarks by Mr Timothy Clifford, director of the National
Galleries of Scotland, implying that the offer was made because of a grudge
towards his father.
Mr Clifford retracted his remarks and apologised unreservedly to Mr Getty.
The museum said it had Pounds 6.8m towards the required total of Pounds
7.6m. The remaining Pounds 800,000 has to be raised by November 5.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Howard defends longer cautions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday denied that the new form of
words police must say when cautioning a suspect is long-winded after he
announced a 60-word formula to replace the 22-word caution.
The new caution reads: 'You do not have to say anything. But if you do not
mention now something which you later use in your defence the court may
decide that your failure to mention it now strengthens the case against you.
A record will be made of anything you say and it may be given if you are
brought to trial.'
The present caution is: 'You do not have to say anything unless you wish to
do so but what you say may be given in evidence.'
Mr Howard said the new caution contained three sentences. 'I don't think
that's very long-winded and use of a caution in very similar terms in
Northern Ireland does not appear to have given rise to any problems.'
Mr Alun Michael, Labour home affairs spokesman, said it meant the
'vulnerable and those of low ability' would be at risk. Liberal Democrat
home affairs spokesman Mr Robert Maclennan said the new caution was 'an
inelegant tongue-twister and a real mouthful which could be easily
misunderstood in the heat of the moment.'
The all-party law reform group Justice said the proposed caution would be
difficult for suspects to understand and for police officers to remember.
The Association of Chief Police Officers in England and Wales reserved
judgment until it had studied the wording in detail.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Union attacks Railtrack services claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The RMT transport union last night attacked a claim by Railtrack that 40 per
cent of Britain's railway network will be open for services during Monday's
one-day strike by signal workers.
A 40 per cent service would be a considerable improvement over the 30 per
cent operated during recent stoppages.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the union's general secretary, accused the state-owned
company which runs the railway track and signals network, of being
'desperately engaged in a campaign to try and talk up any return to work in
a bid to demoralise members'.
Railtrack said yesterday that it would run services during Monday's strike
on the east-coast main line between London and Edinburgh for the first time
during a strike since the signal workers' dispute started nearly 11 weeks
ago. There will also be strike-day services for the first time linking
London with Leeds and Sheffield.
The company also said that nearly 16 per cent of signal workers turned up to
work on Tuesday, the second of two strike days this week, including as many
as 10 per cent of RMT signalling members.
The RMT said only about 1 per cent of its 4,000 signal members had worked
through the dispute on Tuesday. Mr Knapp insisted: 'Railtrack's claims for
the numbers returning to work are no more than wishful thinking.'
He added: 'If they put the same energy into devising a sensible pay offer
for my members as they are manufacturing these figures the dispute could be
over tomorrow.'
The RMT released an undated memorandum from Railtrack headquarters to zonal
directors of the company that shows supervisors will be re-rostered from
their rest days or working nights to operate the boxes from Monday's one-day
strike onwards.
The instruction, which is unsigned, says the changes proposed for mobile
operations supervisors will last for 'the duration of the industrial
action'.
Mr Knapp said yesterday that Railtrack's budget provided for a 5.1 per cent
return on assets in this financial year which meant profits of Pounds 332m.
He said the 5.7 per cent offered in June and withdrawn when the government
said it would breach its public-sector pay guidelines would have cost Pounds
4.9m.
'Railtrack clearly can afford to meet the claim,' he said.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Brussels offers hope on disabled scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday conceded that Britain's priority suppliers
scheme for the disabled may breach European Union law but claimed it could
be adapted to conform to the rules.
Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the single market commissioner, said the
commission was still considering the legality of the scheme, which allows
companies employing mainly disabled workers to match the lowest tender for
government contracts.
Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, withdrew government support for
the scheme last week after receiving legal advice that it conflicted with an
EU directive on public procurement.
In a preliminary statement, Mr Vanni said national procurement regimes
giving preference to specified tenderers could be contrary to community
rules if they discriminated against bidders from other member states. But
such regimes could be made 'in certain conditions' to conform to procurement
rules if they pursued a legitimate objective and were extended to similar
bidders from other member states.
Commission officials conceded that Mr Portillo was right to claim the scheme
left the British government open to an action in the European Court of
Justice by unsuccessful bidders for contracts.
The Department of Employment said Mr Portillo was bound to act on the advice
of the government's legal advisers, who continued to maintain that the
scheme was illegal. 'The bottom line is that whatever the commission says,
the legality of the scheme is a matter for the European court,' it said.
In a letter to Mr Portillo, Mr Vanni denied that the commission had
expressed any opinion on the application of the procurement directive before
receiving a letter from the government earlier this week.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Ford spends Pounds 1bn bringing Jaguar to profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford's investment in Jaguar, the UK luxury carmaker, will total around
Pounds 1bn in the seven years to the end of 1996, Mr Nick Scheele, the
Jaguar chairman, said yesterday.
Jaguar, acquired by Ford for Pounds 1.56bn in 1989, is expected to return to
profit next year after six years of successive losses, Mr Scheele said.
Pre-tax losses from 1989 to 1993 totalled Pounds 776m.
Ford is investing heavily to renew and expand Jaguar's product range. The
first result of the programme will be unveiled next month, when it launches
the new XJ series of luxury saloons, developed at a cost of around Pounds
200m to replace the XJ6 range.
The XJ range is expected to lift total Jaguar production to at least 38,000
next year - from 32,000 this year, 29,548 last year and a low of 20,593 in
1992.
Volume production began two weeks ago and the cars will be launched in the
UK and the US next month, in continental Europe in October and in Japan and
Australia in November. It will be sold in 64 markets around the world.
Jaguar has invested Pounds 8.5m in a new assembly line at its Browns Lane
plant in Coventry which has the capacity to produce 50,000 to 55,000 cars
annually on a single-shift system. Initially the plant will be capable of
producing up to 42,500 of the new XJ series on this basis.
A big part of the Jaguar investment programme is aimed at the development of
a new grand tourer sports coupe and convertible to replace the XJS range in
autumn 1996.
The company is also developing a range of V8 engines for launch in the new
sports car. The engines will be built at a facility under construction at
the Ford engine plant at Bridgend, south Wales.
Jaguar is expected to launch a smaller sports saloon to compete in 1998 with
cars such as the BMW 5 series. This car could double Jaguar output to more
than 100,000 a year by 1998/99.
Mr Scheele said final approval for the project was not expected from Ford
for at least 18 months. It is still unclear whether this car will be built
in the US or the UK.
Jaguar's investment programme has yielded big gains in quality and
efficiency at its UK plants.
Mr Jim Padilla, Jaguar executive director of manufacturing and engineering,
said labour hours per unit had been cut by 54 per cent between 1991 and
1994. The hourly paid workforce has been cut by 54 per cent and the salaried
workforce by 37 per cent. Inventories had been reduced by 35 per cent over
the period.
In terms of quality the number of problems per 100 cars at the end of the
assembly line has fallen from 1,432 at the end of 1990 to 281 by February
this year. A 15 per cent improvement has been achieved on Jaguar's
1994-model cars.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Lift-truck producer plans shake-up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Boss Group, the lift-truck producer formerly known as Lancer Boss, yesterday
announced it was restructuring its sales and service operation to improve
customer support and help increase its market share.
The announcement is the first big change at the company, based in Leighton
Buzzard, Bedfordshire, since its controversial takeover in May by
Jungheinrich, the Hamburg-based lift-truck group. A big investment in the
manufacturing facilities at Leighton Buzzard is scheduled to be unveiled
next month.
The sales and service shake-up could add at least 30 jobs to the service
division, which employs about 250 people. Boss would not disclose the cost
of the plan but said detailed proposals for modernising the depot network
had been drawn up over the past three months.
Mr Bob Bischof, chairman, said: 'With the excellence of our proven product
range, the reorganisation and updating of our regional network had to be one
of our top priorities.'
He was confident the new organisation would contribute substantially to
increasing market share.
The new strategy aims at a clearly defined regional structure of sales and
service centres to give comprehensive territorial coverage. It includes:
The development of new centres in Warrington, Leeds and Bristol.
Refurbishing and modernising existing facilities.
Complementing some of the regional branches with satellite depots.
Investing in information technology for more efficient communications.
Boss Group employs about 700 and has a projected turnover of Pounds 100m
this year. Receivers were called in to most of the old Lancer Boss Group in
April after its former German subsidiary, Steinbock Boss, was forced into
receivership.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Mexican Elections: Sticky problem for hard pressed Cardenas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TAPACHULA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A cartoon this week in the Mexico City newspaper Reforma depicts the three
main candidates in Sunday's presidential election thinking of a date. Mr
Ernesto Zedillo of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and Mr Diego
Fernandez de Cevallos of the centre-right National Action Party are, as you
might expect, both entirely focused on election day. But the date that
occupies the bubble over the head of Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the leading
candidate of the left, is August 22, one day later.
Then Mr Cardenas, the presidential contender of the Party of Democratic
Revolution (PRD), must decide on how to react to the election result, and
whether to bring his supporters out onto the streets to protest fraud.
With his aides declaring that the ruling party's grip on the electoral
machinery means that neither Mexican nor foreign observers will be able to
provide any guarantee against widespread or systematic fraud, Mr Cardenas
closed his campaign late on Wednesday by invoking the armed forces as
guarantors of a fair election.
Speaking to thousands of supporters at his closing campaign rally in the
coastal town of Tapachula, a few miles from the Guatemalan boarder, he said:
'I trust that the armed forces will be attentive and vigilant to ensure that
the law will not be violated .. (and) to ensure that constitutional order
will prevail. I'm sure that members of the army, the navy and the air force
will know how to fulfil their responsibilities.'
Mr Cardenas also called for supporters to rally at midday on Monday in town
squares across the country to celebrate 'the triumph of democracy.'
He coupled these statements - apparent warnings to the ruling party of the
risks involved in election fraud and a suggestion that the period following
the election may be tense - with a call to initiate an immediate broad
political dialogue 'to guarantee peace in Chiapas and in the country.'
Closing the campaign in Tapachula in the state of Chiapas has a double
symbolism, according to PRD officials.
Chiapas, the poorest state in Mexico, was the scene of the Zapatista peasant
uprising at the start of this year which stunned the Mexican political
system. And Tapachula was the town where Mr Cardenas ended his unsuccesful
1988 campaign for the presidency, which he maintains he was deprived of by
fraud.
It was his second and last speech in a day which underlined his unusual
approach to campaigning in the age of television. The day's itinerary made
it almost impossible to get television pictures rapidly back to Mexico City.
Mr Aldopho Aguilar, a spokesman, said that the knowledge that electoral
coverage by the national media would be biased had encouraged Mr Cardenas to
campaign as he preferred: meeting people face to face.
His timetable gave no appearance of being influenced by either the
convenience of the media or by election strategy.
His first speech - made in the pouring rain in the small mountain town of
Motozintia, more than five hours by air and road away from Mexico City and
more than 2,000 metres above sea level - was to a few hundred people.
The region is sparsely populated and dominated historically and often
violently by the PRI, which probably dented the enthusiasm for the speeches.
Mr Cardenas stood by as his party's senate candidate in this state - the
voluble film actress Ms Irma Serrano, know as the Tigress - shouted 'Long
Live sub-commander Marcos,' in support of the leader of the Zapatistas in
Chiapas, but the response was muted.
The Cardenas campaign has been heavily outspent by the PRI.
Aides say the PRD election campaign has cost about Dollars 11m so far, with
the presidential race taking around Dollars 3.8m. They claim the PRI's
entire presidential and congressional campaign runs into of hundreds of
millions of dollars and that government money is helping the ruling party.
Whatever the numbers, Mr Cardenas travels in significantly less style than
the PRI candidate, Mr Zedillo. While Mr Zedillo flies in a private jet, Mr
Cardenas travels on scheduled flights economy class.
Although they have been running far behind in the opinion polls PRD
officials say that the actual result, were the election to be fair, would be
close, with any one of the three main parties able to win. They say fear of
the PRI means people lie to pollsters, making polls unreliable, but they
have difficulty explaining why Mr Cardenas is lagging far behind his opinion
poll showing in the 1988 election.
In 1988, he called people out into the streets to protest at fraud and they
responded in their hundreds of thousands, but he backed down before the
protests degenerated into conflict with the govern-ment.
This year Mr Cardenas's decision about whether to cry fraud will be
complicated by the opinions of the many election observers and the
independent electoral commission not present in 1988.
Whether he wins or loses, the eyes of many Mexicans will be on Mr Cardenas
on Monday.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Mexican Elections: Wary peasants likely to go with the
strength of the PRI
</HEADLINE>

   OXTOTITLAN, MEXICO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexican farmers have yet to benefit from their country's much-touted
economic transformation. The strict monetary policy, foreign competition and
elimination of government programmes that have brought macro-economic
stability have also produced an 18.5 per cent decline in agricultural
production over 10 years and, one might think, fertile ground for the
opposition in Sunday's presidential election.
Yet voters in the countryside, those hit hardest by the cuts in government
spending engineered by the ruling party's presidential candidate, Mr Ernesto
Zedillo, when he was budget minister, are overwhelmingly going to turn out
for him on Sunday, according to the few public opinion surveys that
differentiate between urban and rural voters.
With about a third of Mexico's voters located in rural areas, peasants are
an important voting bloc for any party.
And with the leftist opposition candidate, Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, betting
on the rural vote to give him a fighting chance to dethrone the ruling
party, officials of Mr Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) say
maintaining their core of peasant support is of prime importance.
By Ted Bardacke in
Oxtotitlan, outside Mexico City
In the past, the PRI was able to rely on fraud and intimidation by caciques
 -rural strongmen who run the local PRI machines - to bring in the rural
vote.
In the 1988 presidential election, Mr Carlos Salinas de Gortari's margin of
victory largely stemmed from rural polling stations that reported 100 per
cent turnouts for the PRI.
With electoral reforms in place and independent observers watching over
polling stations, outright fraud is expected to be more difficult this year.
Instead, the PRI is relying on government spending and the lack of true
voting secrecy in small rural polling stations to sway the vote.
The electoral authorities have decided to install 96,000 voting stations
throughout the country, ignoring a demand by the opposition to reduce that
number to 20,000 in order to heighten vote secrecy.
The government has begun a new agricultural subsidy programme, called
Procampo, which involves direct cash handouts of over Dollars 100 per
hectare of farm land.
Government cheques, which are often channeled through local peasant
organisations affiliated to the PRI, were distributed up until a week before
election day.
Peasants are often required to submit copies of their voter identification
cards in order to receive payment.
'You have to be on the side of the people who have the money, that's why
everyone here votes for the PRI,' said one cacique in a village in the state
of Mexico.
'The situation is difficult, there is no money. But the government, not the
opposition, is the only one who can give, so you have to support it.'
Voting in rural areas is still not secret, he says. 'There are two voting
stations around here, each with fewer than 500 voters, and we all know who
sympathises with which party,' he said.
'Simple maths after the election will tell me which families didn't vote as
they promised to.'
In addition to Procampo, subsidisies for purchases of tractors, fertiliser
and fuel have also been announced by the government. High-profile ceremonies
promoting such initiatives have been the norm, although official publicity
about the programmes ended this month, so as not to taint the election.
Opposition parties have attacked what they see as the influence that these
programmes have on rural voters.
Cutting off publicity about them 'is a recognition that they do indeed have
an influence over voters and by that time the damage will already have been
done,' Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the leading opposition candidate,
said recently.
The government and the PRI say that Procampo is not a transitory
election-year scheme, but is planned to last 15 years.
But with both Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the candidate of the
centre-right National Action party, and Mr Cardenas promising to reform the
whole system of agricultural subsidies, peasants are getting the message
that the only way to continue receiving handouts is to vote for the PRI.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Mexican Elections: Uninspiring Zedillo keeps policy pledge -
PRI man fails to move the crowds, but spells out what he would do
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Soon after Mr Ernesto Zedillo accepted the nomination as presidential
candidate of Mexico's governing Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI)
nearly five months ago, he pledged to set out in detail the policies he
would implement.
While his campaign has disappointed many for its failure to inspire the
crowds, no one denies he has kept his word in proposing policies.
Over the past few months he has given 10 set-piece speeches on the most
pressing issues facing Mexico, all but one of which listed 10 points of
policy.
The speeches covered poverty, foreign affairs, the environment, agriculture,
health and culture, (though not, mysteriously, education). Three - on the
economy, justice and security, and democracy - are likely to form the policy
backbone of the new government he looks likely to run after the election on
Sunday.
On economics, Mr Zedillo, a former central banker and budget minister,
proposes the same pro-market policies that have characterised the presidency
of Mr Carlos Salinas. But with the economy apparently stagnant when he made
the speech (a recovery, as new figures indicate, was in fact under way), Mr
Zedillo felt compelled to explain how he would raise economic growth.
The essence of his plan is a 25 per cent increase in public investment in
his first year in office, a new state-financed fund for infrastructure
projects, and a series of modest tax incentives for private investment and
for new businesses. Mr Zedillo does not say whether he will finance the
proposals with higher taxes, spending cuts elsewhere, or with a deficit, but
he promises that economic growth will be twice as much as the 1.9 per cent
increase in population.
Mr Zedillo would commit his government to more competition in the financial
sector, deregulation of the economy, especially at a state and regional
level, further reforms of state-owned companies to make them more efficient,
and to giving more money to development banks to subsidise interest rates
for small and medium-sized businesses - none of which the Salinas
administration would have opposed.
On justice and security, Mr Zedillo, seeking to tackle what opinion polls
indicate is one of the electorate's greatest concerns - the increasing crime
rates and corruption of the justice system - goes further.
Mr Zedillo has promised a total overhaul of the country's notoriously
corrupt police force. While not clear on how he would do this, he talks
about a new police academy, beefed up internal watchdogs to fight
corruption, greater co-ordination between federal and state police, a
special anti-kidnapping force, and a new data base on known criminals.
His programme includes an ambitious but vague promise of an 'integral reform
of judicial power'. This includes the establishment of a judicial civil
service that would promote honesty and the independence of judges and
magistrates; the right to appeal against decisions of public prosecutors;
and speeding up the notoriously slow legal process.
The legal and judicial reforms indirectly form part of Mr Zedillo's sweeping
proposals for a more democratic Mexico. These have met with scepticism, in
part because promising democratic change is a long tradition of PRI
presidential aspirants that they have rarely lived up to.
In what has gained most publicity, Mr Zedillo promised that if elected
president he would not interfere in the internal affairs of the PRI and
would not choose its candidates for office, including his successor. He
would thus be giving up the so-called dedazo (whereby the president points
out the candidate to succeed him) that has been the distinguishing feature
of Mexican politics, and one of the key factors of presidential power.
Instead, Mr Zedillo says before taking office he will propose ways for the
PRI to choose its candidates democratically. If he does this, the PRI would
change from being merely the electoral arm of the government in power, to
something akin to a normal political party in which the rank-and-file have a
greater say.
Mr Zedillo also proposes beefing up the authority of Congress so that it can
better scrutinise legislation, and devolving new powers and resources to the
states and municipalities. He promises that he would have good relations
with all political parties, and promote the spread of civic groups pushing
for democratic changes.
Mr Zedillo has been so clear in his democratic proposals that if he ignores
them he risks heightening still further the cynicism about his party and the
political system. If he is serious and wins on Sunday, he will have little
more than three months to work on changing the PRI, before, as he has said,
he leaves the party to take care of itself.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Impartiality of Whitewater counsel thrown into doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Controversy over the naming of Mr Kenneth Starr as new Whitewater special
counsel in succession to Mr Robert Fiske has grown this week, with
Democrats, legal experts and the media questioning both his impartiality and
the circumstances of his appointment by a special judicial panel.
The New York Times went so far as to call on him to step down. The
newspaper, a harsh critic of alleged ethical violations by the Clinton
administration, said the appointment 'looks terrible under the law and the
ethical precepts the judges say they recognise'.
Earlier, Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, had also come close
to suggesting withdrawal. 'If the standard is the appearance of independence
. . . then it seems to me there is a greater appearance of the absence of
independence in his case than there was in Mr Fiske's case.'
Criticism of the appointment of Mr Starr, the solicitor general under
President George Bush who last year considered running for the US Senate as
a Republican from Virginia, falls into two parts.
The first centres on the relationship between Judge David Sentelle, chief of
the special judicial panel which named Mr Starr, and the two
arch-conservative senators from North Carolina, Mr Jesse Helms and Mr Lauch
Faircloth.
Mr Sentelle, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, is a protege of Senator
Helms. Mr Sentelle was a member of the federal appeals court which
overturned the Iran-Contra conviction of Mr Oliver North, now the Republican
candidate for the Virginia Senate seat.
Last month, shortly before the Starr appointment, Mr Sentelle was noticed
lunching with Mr Faircloth and they were later joined by Mr Helms. All three
deny discussing Whitewater but the meeting brought down criticism from legal
scholars, who described it variously as 'wildly imprudent' and 'probably
unethical'.
The second reservation stems from the fact that Mr Starr, at the request of
a conservative women's group, considered filing a 'friend of the court'
brief in support of Ms Paula Jones, who has filed a civil suit seeking
damages from President Clinton for alleged sexual harassment.
Even though the brief was never filed, the Times wrote that his original
decision further blemished the appearance of his impartiality.

Ms Jean Hanson, Treasury legal counsel, resigned yesterday under pressure

Ms Hanson's resignation came a day after the resignation of Mr Roger Altman,
the deputy Treasury secretary, who said he would leave as soon as a
successor was confirmed. Both had been harshly criticised by the Senate
banking committee for misleading the panel in February about the extent of
contacts between the Treasury and White House over the Whitewater probe,
involving President and Mrs Clinton's financial dealings.
In her resignation letter to Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, Ms Hanson
said she was rejoining a New York law firm. She made no direct mention of

FT  19 AUG 94 / IBM sent back by appeals court to face retrial in anti-trust
suit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A federal appeals court has sent IBM back for a retrial on a nine-year-old
anti-trust suit, in a ruling that could affect the computer group's efforts
to escape from the legal restrictions imposed on it under the Eisenhower
administration.
The appeals court in Philadelphia unanimously overturned a judgment in IBM's
favour in a case brought by Allen-Myland, a company specialising in
overhauling and upgrading IBM mainframe computers.
Allen-Myland claimed IBM abused its dominant position in the market by
manipulating the price of parts for mainframe computers, so it had in effect
illegally tied customers into using its own upgrading services and excluded
Allen-Myland from the market.
The upgrade market was a substantial one, sometimes as large as sales of new
mainframes, and Allen-Myland at one point accounted for as much as half the
upgrades.
But when IBM introduced its 308X generation of mainframes in 1980, it used a
'net pricing policy' in which the cost of installation by IBM was bundled in
with the price of upgrade parts, so discouraging customers from using any
other installer. In addition, IBM required customers to return used parts to
them, thus drying up a potential alternative source of parts.
The district court had rejected Allen-Myland's charge, on the basis that
IBM's share of the market was not large enough to give it 'market power'.
But the appeals court said there was an 'analytical flaw' in the lower
court's determination of the relevant market, and had double-counted some
possible sources of competition.
In particular, it said the lower court was wrong to include computer leasing
companies as alternative suppliers in calculating the market.
Mr Robert Levy, a lawyer with Sutherland, Asbill &amp; Brennan who represents
Allen-Myland, said the distinction was critical in the mainframe market,
because leasing companies accounted in the early 1980s, in the period the
case deals with, for a large share of the market.
Although the appeals court leaves to the lower court the detailed decision,
it orders it to recalculate the size of the market excluding most leasing
companies.
The ruling on the definition of the relevant market could have widespread
ramifications for IBM's efforts to get rid of a 1956 consent decree it
negotiated with the Justice Department under President Dwight Eisenhower.
In June, IBM asked a federal judge to lift the decree, which was imposed
when computers still used vacuum tubes and dominance of the data-processing
market was very clear. The decree requires IBM to offer its computers for
outright sale - where before it had only leased them - and requires it to
operate its computer service business separately from its manufacturing
business.
Although IBM is clearly no longer dominant in the broadest definition of the
computer market, the issue of whether it still dominates the mainframe
market could depend on precise definition of the market.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential candidate of the centre-right
National Action party, has been the surprise element in Mexico's election
campaign. Written off by many at the beginning of the race, he found his
victory in May's television debate of the three main candidates changed his
fortunes overnight, turning him into a serious challenger for the
presidency.
Even if, as the polls indicate, Mr Fernandez fails to win the election, the
PAN is likely to emerge from the campaign considerably stronger than when it
went in. It is almost certain to increase its current tally of 79 deputies
out of a total of 500, and to pick up between 24 and 30 senators in the
expanded 128-member chamber. It currently holds only one out of 64.
Mr Fernandez has nevertheless been strongly criticised for not capitalising
further on his debate victory. After closing the gap with Mr Zedillo in some
opinion polls in late May, he halted his campaign during the World Cup over
late June and early July, and lost much of the support he had gained.
'Diego lost the opportunity of a lifetime' says Mr Vicente Licona, head of
the Indemec/Louis Harris polling company 'There is a great mystery over what
really happened.' While some Mexicans speculate that Mr Fernandez was afraid
of winning, or had even reached a deal with the PRI to lose, advisers insist
the candidate was simply receiving important dignitaries, resting before the
final leg of the race, and preparing for another debate (which never
materialised).
Even if Mr Fernandez had been more aggressive in July, it is questionable
whether he could have maintained his post-debate momentum. The PAN is still
a party of the urban middle class, and has little representation in rural
areas or in the south. Even in the cities there is considerable fear of a
change in government. Mr Licona reckons Mr Fernandez began to lose much of
his support when electors feared he might actually win.
Whatever the election outcome, Mr Fernandez and his party are sure to play a
key part in events after the poll. If they accept a PRI victory, the
legitimacy of the result will be greatly enhanced in the eyes of many
Mexicans - especially if, as the polls indicate, Mr Fernandez relegates Mr
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the left-wing Party of Democratic Revolution into a
poor third place.
Given Mr Fernandez's past record of reaching agreements with the PRI, many
reckon he will happily accept a PRI victory that is not marred by too many
voting irregularities. Mr Zedillo, it is widely if not particularly
authoritatively suggested, will then invite a member of the PAN to join his
cabinet as a sign of gratitude.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Hidden agenda seen behind Carlos arrest: Diplomats are sure
Sudan and France struck a deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Sudanese government would not have handed Carlos over to the French
'without wanting, and being promised, something fairly substantial in
return'. That view, expressed yesterday by a senior Arab diplomat, has in
the past few days emerged as the most prevalent reaction of government
officials and media throughout the Middle East to the arraignment of Illich
Ramirez Sanchez, better known as Carlos, before a French investigating
magistrate to face charges of terrorism.
Paris and Khartoum have hotly denied the allegation. Mr Charles Pasqua, the
French interior minister, insisted there were no trade-offs.
'It's a tissue of lies. It's disinformation, scandalous', he said earlier
this week. The Sudanese government stressed that the decision to extradite
Carlos to France was merely 'confirmation of its long stance against
terrorism and a reflection of its readiness to co-operate constructively
with the international community'.
Few western and Arab governments would recognise the Sudanese
self-assessment. In August last year the US added Sudan to the list of
governments which it accuses of sponsoring international terrorism, linking
it with Iran, Syria and Libya.
According to the US 'the cumulative weight of evidence establishes that
Sudan is providing repeated support for international terrorism'. The
support is said to come more from the provision of training facilities and a
safe haven, than from the active sponsorship of individual terrorist acts
abroad.
Diplomats have pointed to the regular presence in Sudan of representatives
of Iran's revolutionary guards, and members of radical Islamic factions,
such as the Lebanese Hizbollah and the Palestinian Hamas movement.
Sudan's drift into closer association with the most radical Middle Eastern
states has been accompanied by further economic decline, made worse by the
continuing civil war in the south. The seizure of power by radical Islamic
officers in 1989 under Lt General Omar Hassan al-Bashir, now head of state,
and backed by Mr Hassan Turabi's National Islamic Front, accelerated the
trend. The subsequent purges and attempts to eliminate all domestic
opposition have provoked condemnation by human rights organisations and
contributed to Sudan's international isolation. Support for Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein during the Gulf war took the process a step further.
The impact on an already strained economy has been calamitous. International
aid, beyond that from its radical allies, has almost dried up. Gross
national product is certain to contract again this year; exports, which have
more than halved in value since 1989, are expected to fall further, and
inflation to accelerate beyond the current estimated annual rate of at least
250 per cent. There have been reports of violent anti-government
demonstrations from several towns this year and diplomats expect there to to
be more evidence of popular discontent as the economic crisis deepens.
Meanwhile, there is no sign of an end to the 11-year war in the south,
despite the ceasefire between the regime and the two factions of the Sudan
People's Liberation Army. The fighting, which none of the parties appears
able to win militarily, has caused intense suffering among the 4m people of
the south who are mainly animist and Christian. With aid efforts regularly
frustrated by the warring factions, the potential for a wider human disaster
in the south continues to preoccupy international agencies working in the
region.
Against such a background it would be surprising if the Sudanese regime did
not seek to capitalise internationally by delivering a terrorist whom, for
whatever reason, it no longer wanted as a guest. Sudan's economic and
political plight argues against making gratuitously generous gestures.
Lawyers for Carlos claim that a deal was struck between Paris and Khartoum
which allowed the terrorist to be transferred to France. 'Carlos was
betrayed and sold for a sum much bigger than 30 pieces of silver,' said Mr
Mourad Oussedik, one of the defence lawyers. Liberation, the French daily,
weighed in with claims that France supplied satellite surveillance
photographs to help Khartoum in its fight in the south.
The French government has denied the allegations and the Foreign Ministry
described its relations with Sudan as 'marked by prudence', adding Paris had
criticised the human rights record of the Khartoum regime and urged a
settlement to the civil war. A spokesman said France had suspended all
bilateral aid to Sudan in 1990, with the exception of food and medical
supplies.
Western diplomats in Paris, however, believe that France has been
cultivating ties with the Sudanese government for several months. They said
that in addition to its interest in capturing Carlos, the government was
seeking to develop relations with a regime which could prove influential in
the worsening Algerian crisis.
'It may be a typical case of a French dual-track policy, outwardly taking a
tough stance against Islamic fundamentalism and a state suspected of
supporting terrorism, while building contacts,' said one diplomat.
According to this argument, France may be seeking to use Sudan's leaders to
mediate with the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) which has been locked into an
increasingly violent struggle with the government in Algeria since being
denied certain victory in the 1992 general election. The French government
has begun cracking down on suspected Moslem militants and FIS
representatives in France since five of its citizens were killed in Algiers
earlier this month.
In the months ahead the policies and actions of the governments in Paris and
Khartoum are certain to be scrutinised with more than usual attention by an
international community which has grown sceptical about accepting deals
involving terrorists at face value.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Nigerian oil unions defy Abacha over strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's oil unions yesterday said they would press on with the six-week
strike which has cut vital oil exports by a fifth, despite the military
government's seizure of their headquarters and dismissal of executives. But
industry sources said tankers were still loading on schedule at Nigeria's
largest terminals and that there had been no immediate signs of an increase
in strike action despite the crackdown.
Police cordoned off the headquarters of the two main oil unions, Nupeng and
Pengassan, as well as the Nigeria Labour Congress in an attempt to break the
strike and end the stalemate in a political crisis which has halted normal
business and polarised the Moslem north and Christian south. The unions are
demanding the release of Chief Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of last
year's annulled presidential election, who is in detention facing treason
charges.
For the first time, protest spread from Mr Abiola's stronghold in the
south-west to Kaduna, the political centre of northern Nigeria. Hundreds of
people marched through the city in protest against the dismissal of the
union leaders, residents said.
Yesterday's moves followed a nationally televised broadcast on Wednesday
evening by Gen Sani Abacha, Nigeria's military leader, in which he said his
government was dissolving the executives of the three organisations, and
would appoint administrators to run their affairs. Gen Abacha said that he
would not hand over power to Mr Abiola, adding the government would not
intervene to stop the opposition leader's treason trial, which has caused
sporadic rioting.
In Lagos Mr Wariebi Agamene, sacked president of the blue-collar union
Nupeng, said: 'We are going underground to continue with the strike. . . The
strike has not been called off.' His counterpart in the white-collar union
Pengassan, Mr Bola Owodunni, said: 'We are still forging ahead with our
strike and we are going to contest Abacha's action in court.
'Our association will not be run by an administrator because the
administrator will have no one to work with at our secret-ariat.'
Unlike Nupeng, he said, his union's dissolved executive would not go
underground. 'Our association still exists. There is no need going
underground.'
Oil industry officials said it was unclear whether Gen Abacha's move would
hinder operations further. Crude oil production had stabilised after falling
by 20 per cent from normal levels of 1.9m barrels per day because of the
strike.
Exports have not been cut by an appreciable amount as oil that had been
destined for domestic refineries, now closed by the strike, had been
diverted to outside markets.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Japanese money supply picks up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Money supply grew in Japan last month at an increased pace, after slowing
since April when government spending was stalled by a parliamentary dispute
over passage of the budget.
The Bank of Japan said yesterday that M2 plus certificates of deposit grew a
preliminary 1.9 per cent in July against the same month last year, and
confirmed its earlier estimate of a 1.5 per cent increase for June.
The central bank expects the July figure will not be far exceeded in the
current quarter - the strongest growth this year was April's 2.2 per cent
spurt. Last month's rise stemmed partly from tax rebates on salaries.
The rebates, part of a package to stimulate the economy unveiled in the
spring by the then government, accompanied summer bonus payments to
employees. Their effect had yet to show through fully in household spending
data for June, released yesterday by the Management and Co-ordination
Agency.
These showed an inflation-adjusted decline of 0.9 per cent from a year
earlier, although moderated from a 1.7 per cent drop in May.
The agency said July figures might show an upturn, as many families received
proceeds from the tax cuts late in June. The summer heatwave, which is
increasing sales of drinks and air conditioners, is also expected to help.
Demand for electricity in July jumped 13.4 per cent from a year earlier,
according to the Federation of Electric Power Companies yesterday. Household
power demand rose 20.2 per cent, while big industrial users drew just 5.6
per cent more.
But key Japanese industries, which have struggled through the longest
recession since the second world war, are making preparations for a revival,
according to a survey released this week by Nippon Credit Bank, a big lender
to manufacturers.
Automotive and electronics producers, two engines of economic growth, plan
to increase capital spending this year after three years of decline, the NCB
findings indicate. Car makers were stepping up outlays on plant and
equipment by 1 per cent in the current fiscal year to March, and the
electronics sector by 11.9 per cent.
The increases will not be uniform. A Sony executive said yesterday, for
example, that his company would do no more than maintain last year's level
of spending.
Across the Japanese private sector as a whole, capital expenditure planned
for the year was still down by 1.1 per cent from the previous year. But the
cut would be more modest than the 8.1 per cent reduction recorded in 1993,
and the bank said the period of reduced spending commitments was nearing an
end.
The legacy of the country's burst asset 'bubble' of the late 1980s lived on
yesterday in land values set annually by the National Tax Administration
Agency. According to its calculations, land in Tokyo is worth at least a
fifth less than a year ago.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Obdurate rulers at point of no return: Missed chances in
Nigeria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Wednesday General Sani Abacha's regime passed the point of no return. The
presumed winner of last year's presidential election, Mr Moshood Abiola, is
in jail for claiming the presidency and a strike by oil workers is crippling
the economy. And all the time the political split widens between Mr Abiola's
Yoruba tribe in the south-west, who run the economy, and the Hausas and
Fulanis in the north, who control the government.
A nation worn down by political instability was looking for a way out of the
deadlock this week and Gen Abacha's televised speech was seen as a chance to
compromise. Instead the government closed the door on dialogue, hardened its
stance against opponents and imposed strict controls on the striking trade
unions.
'The speech reminded me of that joke: 'Let's have peace. You give in to
me',' said a newspaper publisher.
The two key points of the address were the government's decision to run the
unions directly and the claim that it would not interfere with Mr Abiola's
court case. The judiciary has been discredited by the trial and Mr Abiola's
detention looks likely to be long.
The government has not banned the oil unions or the Nigeria Labour Congress
(NLC) but their leadership structure, which will be replaced by
administrators reporting to the labour minister, Mr Samuel Ogbemudia. The
NLC is a state-sponsored umbrella group for more than 40 trade unions, and
is seen as a willing tool of military government.
Three times in the past month it has delayed or postponed a general strike
in protest at Mr Abiola's arrest, on the assurance of its leader that the
government would compromise. Three times it has been proved wrong.
The two oil unions, Nupeng and Pengassan, will be tougher nuts to crack. Mr
Frank Kokori, head of Nupeng, has warned that, if proscribed, the union
would go underground and that there would be violent reactions.
The risk to the oil companies which operate the 2m b/d capacity oil fields
in the Niger delta is increased by the hardening of positions. Industry
officials say that production is already down by a third with most of the
loss coming from the main producer, Anglo-Dutch Shell. The operators are
minority partners with the government and are not officially revealing
production figures, but they have shut down wells which are exposed to
attacks on staff or equipment.
Shell has refused the government's offer of army protection to keep pumping,
and it is unlikely that union members will accept the offer made on
Wednesday of government protection if they return at once to work. Nigeria
is already acutely indebted and cannot afford to lose nearly a third of its
total export earnings.
The ban on the union leaders is an attempt by the government to break what
it sees as the south-west's stranglehold on the economy.
The crisis has hardened the view in the south that the government is run by
a narrow clique of conservatives in the north, principally the traditional
rulers. The Yorubas believe that the most powerful of these, including the
Sultan of Sokoto who is the head of Islam in Nigeria, are manipulating Gen
Abacha.
However, some influential northerners are also speaking out against the
government. Other more discreet moderates in the north do not want to see
the nation split but fear that Gen Abacha's intransigence may make it
inevitable.
In Lagos, industrialists who were previously non-political now talk openly
about the south-west going its own way and say the present unitary state,
disguised as a federal structure, is holding back the economic development
of the south. They are forming a powerful alliance with the oil workers who
are mainly from the minority tribes in the Niger delta.
Northerners regard the third big Nigerian tribe, the Ibos in the east, as
allies. 'To us it is not as simple as northern domination,' says a veteran
of the Biafran war, in which the Ibos tried to secede from Nigeria but were
defeated by the north with backing from the south-west. 'Time is running out
and I think we are in for a lot more trouble. People in the east were
looking for some concessions from Wednesday's speech but it gave nothing.'
The order to unions to return to work may lead to harsher measures and test
whether the army is a united force or divided on ethnic lines like other
sections of society. Such a split is the most dangerous prospect.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rwanda's victorious Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) guerrilla
army will move into the French-protected 'safe zone' as soon as Paris
withdraws its troops next week, Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Kigali.
'We want to occupy all Rwanda,' he said. 'Indeed, for the credibility of the
government we have to occupy all Rwanda. But we will not attack the zone.'
Mr Twagiramungu told reporters his government, which came to power last
month, would co-operate with UN African forces taking over from the French
forces. His remarks are likely to instil fear in hundreds of thousands of
Hutu refugees staying in the zone set up by France last month to protect
Rwandans from being attacked by the former government army and militia, and
to stop the rebel advance.
They are also certain to upset the UN, which had hoped the zone would remain
demilitarised after the world body took over the area following the French
withdrawal, scheduled to be completed by Sunday.
Thousands of Hutus are already leaving the safe zone and heading into
neighbouring Zaire ahead of the French withdrawal, fearing reprisals from
the RPF.

Ms Taslima Nasreen, the Bangladeshi writer who fled to Sweden last week to
escape extremist Moslem death threats, emerged from hiding yesterday to
proclaim she would keep up her fight against 'fundamentalist insanity' in
Bangladesh and around the world, Hugh Carnegy reports from Stockholm.
Rejecting criticism that her aggressive attacks on the suppression of Moslem
women had provoked fundamentalists in a country where they previously had
little influence, Ms Nasreen said Bangladesh was becoming less secular,
while fundamentalism was 'on the rise'.
'Everyone must speak out clearly and explicitly against fundamentalism
wherever it is in the world. One must speak out against the powers of
darkness,' she told a press conference in Stockholm. She said women in
Bangladesh were 'the slaves of men'. Ms Nasreen, 32, who fled to Sweden
while on bail facing charges in Dhaka of promoting religious unrest, said
she intended to return home 'when things are cooler', but gave no indication
when that might be. In the meantime she intends to visit other western
countries, including Norway and France. Moslem fundamentalists in Bangladesh
have demanded she be hanged for her outspoken comments and writings.

<DATELINE>
   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South African President Nelson Mandela yesterday promised co-ordinated
programmes to transform society following the apartheid era, but said little
to address the concerns of blacks impatient for more rapid change, Patti
Waldmeir reports from Cape Town. Mr Mandela's speech to parliament in Cape
Town, which was broadcast live nationwide, marked the 100th day of the
multi-party government of national unity. It was billed as an attempt to
reassure his mass constituency that he would not put the demands of
potential investors and nervous whites above the needs of those
disadvantaged by apartheid.
'Millions have suffered deprivation for decades and they have the right to
seek redress. They fought and voted for change; and change the people of
South Africa must have,' he told members of parliament, who gave him a
standing ovation when he entered the chamber.
While judging the government's first 100 days a success, he stressed that
'at the end of the day, the yardstick that we shall all be judged by is. . .
are we, through our endeavours, creating the basis to better the lives of
all South Africans?' But the speech gave little detail of proposed
socio-economic development projects, and included almost no new initiatives
to promote that goal. It was couched in language which would not be readily
accessible to a township audience, focusing more on the process of managing
change than on the kind of eye-catching programmes demanded by an impatient
electorate.
He made only a passing reference to the country's desperate need for
millions of new homes. Housing is the most politically explosive issue
facing the new government, and is a significant focus of the Reconstruction
and Development Programme, the government's umbrella plan for socio-economic
development. A white paper on the programme is expected to go to the cabinet
soon.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Sri Lanka enters an uncertain era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COLOMBO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga, the victor in this week's Sri Lankan general
election, who is due to be sworn in as prime minister today, will need all
the luck she can get if she is to turn her complex coalition of opposition
parties into an effective government.
Until she can exert a firm grip on power, Sri Lanka faces a period of
political uncertainty which could easily spill over into society and the
economy. 'We are in a tricky situation. People are going to wait and see
before they make up their minds about the government,' says Mr Desmond
Fernando, a lawyer and secretary general of the International Bar
Association.
Fortunately, Sri Lanka is a country which has learnt to live with political
turmoil. Neither the civil war in the north of the island, an uprising of
nationalist extremists in the south in the late 1980s, nor the assassination
last year of President Ranasinghe Premadasa has caused significant social
disturbances or thrown the economy seriously off course. It is possible the
country will survive unscathed the end of 17 years of conservative rule by
the United National party.
Mrs Kumaratunga's most immediate challenge is to hold together her
parliamentary majority. With only 105 seats in the 225-member parliament,
her People's Alliance, itself a coalition of nine parties, must rely on the
support of at least three minority groupings. Moreover, she will have to
co-operate with Mr D B Wijetunga, the powerful executive president, who
stands above parliament and belongs to the defeated UNP.
Mr Wijetunga's rapid acknowledgement of UNP's defeat suggests he is taking a
conciliatory approach. But he may come under pressure from some sections of
his party to change tack.
Such pressure may surface soon, as among the main aims of the People's
Alliance is a revision of the constitution to curb the president's powers.
This change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament - which could
only be achieved with UNP's co-operation. UNP will also be concerned about
the People's Alliance's pledge to stamp out corruption. While some UNP
members, including outgoing prime minister Ranil Wickremasinghe, concede the
need for tougher anti-bribery laws, they may balk at moves to bring
ex-ministers to account.
Economic policy-making presents Mrs Kumaratunga with a particularly awkward
challenge.
She has promised to follow the UNP government's pro-market policies, which
have in the past five years brought the country fast growth in output,
foreign trade and investment.
But businessmen see three dangers. First, to satisfy her left-wing
supporters Mrs Kumaratunga may be tempted to make some gestures - such as
imposing punitive duties on the import of luxuries. Next, even though the
overall direction of policy will be pro-market, day-to-day decisions may
not. For example, the government is considering the future of the
over-manned state-owned tea industry. UNP, which introduced limited
privatisation of the estates' management, was planning more radical reform
and Mrs Kumaratunga may be tempted to fudge the issue.
Finally, Mrs Kumaratunga could try to increase welfare spending. Her
manifesto includes promises of big food hand-outs to the poor. However, she
may not be as profligate as she sounds, as such pledges are routine in Sri
Lankan campaigning.
On balance, businessmen are willing to give Mrs Kumaratunga the benefit of
the doubt although they may postpone big investment decisions for a few
months. Some executives even argue the People's Alliance will prove good for
business. They say that the corruption associated with the UNP was beginning
to harm investment activity.
Moreover, they welcome Mrs Kumaratunga's determination to end the civil war,
in which Tamil Tiger separatist guerrillas are fighting for an independent
homeland.

Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, yesterday pointed to strong export
growth in North America in its first six months as a free trade area as
evidence that the North American Free Trade Agreement was 'living up to its
promise'.
Although the US trade deficit with Canada is growing, and its surplus with
Mexico shrank in comparison with the first six months of last year, Commerce
Department trade analysts believe the Mexican recovery will soon propel US
exports and lift the trade surplus to at least Dollars 2.1bn in 1994, up
from Dollars 1.6bn last year.
The overall US deficit on trade in goods and services in June eased 1.6 per
cent to Dollars 9.37bn from a revised Dollars 9.52bn in May as growth in
exports outstripped rising imports. Nevertheless officials said the US was
on track for its second highest deficit ever on goods trade this year.
The deficit with Japan swelled 26 per cent to Dollars 5.52bn in June, from
Dollars 4.39bn in May, and brought renewed demand from Mr Brown for
corrective action. 'Those Japanese markets have to be opened,' he said.
US-Japanese trade talks have made little progress. The US has given Japan
until September 30 to reach agreement in a dispute over Japanese procurement
rules.
Mr Brown focused his comments on Nafta, hoping that the 'good news' about
the controversial pact would help gain support for legislation to implement
the Uruguay Round accord on world trade liberalisation. This legislation is
still bogged down in Congress.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, has spent this week trying to
broker a deal among the various factions of both parties.
The latest figures showed that US exports of goods and services increased
3.6 per cent to a record Dollars 58.17bn in June while imports were up 2.8
per cent from May to Dollars 67.54bn.
In the first six months of the year, US exports to North America surged,
accounting for 52 per cent of overall US export growth. US exports to Canada
rose 10 per cent to Dollars 55.6bn and exports to Mexico shot up 17 per cent
to Dollars 24.5bn in the first six months. But imports also rose, especially
in June.
The US export figures had some help from the World Cup. Exports of services
rose Dollars 270,000 in June, 'due largely to increased foreign travel
related to the World Cup,' officials said.

FT  19 AUG 94 / World Trade News: China in Dollars 888m coal pipeline deal -
A US-led consortium is embarking on an ambitious plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday signed an agreement with a US-led consortium for
construction of what is billed as the world's longest coal slurry pipeline
in an Dollars 888m project due to be completed by 1997.
The agreement between Pittsburgh-based Custom Coals and China's Ministry of
Coal Industry provides for 51 per cent foreign ownership and is the 'first
infrastructure project of its kind in China to have western financial and
management control', according to the US partners.
Mr Robert Horton, president of Custom Coals, said the 500-mile pipeline from
Shanxi province in China's north-west to the coastal province of Shandong
could open the way for many such projects to service the world's biggest
coal producer.
The Chinese transport system is greatly over-stretched, and with coal
shipment representing 40 per cent of the country's rail traffic, a coal
slurry pipeline will provide a much needed alternative.
The Yu-Wei project agreed yesterday will include the construction and
operation of a coal cleaning plant, pipeline and port facilities. Custom
Coals will also supply coal-cleaning technology, which it says will greatly
reduce China's coal-burning costs.
'The potential environmental benefits of this project to China are
enormous,' said Mr Horton. 'China is the world's largest coal user, burning
approximately 1.2bn tonnes in 1993 - one-third of the world's total hard
coal consumption.
'If, based on the demonstrated economics of this project, China begins
burning clean coal on a widespread basis, it would provide the single
largest benefit to the earth's environment of any environmental policy or
initiative - far greater than full implementation of the US Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990.'
The pipeline will have an annual capacity of 15m tonnes, of which around 5m
tonnes will be supplied to local power stations. A further 8m tonnes a year
is likely to be sold to purchasers in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan under
long-term contracts, said Mr Horton. The balance will go to the spot market.
China Pipeline Holdings, the US-led consortium that will have developmental
and operational control of the project, also includes Australian-based MRI,
owned by Mr Peter Oei, a Hong Kong businessman.
The consortium will seek equity partners in the international market and
Goldman Sachs (Asia) will assist with fund-raising. Financing is expected to
include government-backed loans and suppliers' credits, although the ratio
of debt to equity has not been finalised.
Equity participants could expect a 20 per cent return on their investment,
said Mr Horton.
Ownership of the project will pass to the Chinese government after 50 years.
The consortium partners expect to spend Dollars 15m-Dollars 20m preparing
for the construction phase. They expect to 'break ground' in mid-to-late
1995.
Some Dollars 400m of the cost of the project will be spent on capital
equipment.
China's 49 per cent interest will be through the China Coal Construction and
Development Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Ministry of Coal
Industry.

<TEXT>
Direct foreign investment in India has risen rapidly, with the government
approving more than 2,100 foreign investment proposals, worth Rs156.2bn
(Dollars 4.98bn) between August 1991 and June 1994, the Ministry of Industry
said yesterday.
Inflows in the first half of 1994 reached Rs11.3bn, compared with Rs17.86bn
for the whole of 1993 and Rs6.75bn in 1992. The 1994 invest-ments included
Rs9.32bn under schemes to attract investment from non-resident Indians.
In all, foreign direct investment in the four years to June 1994 stood at
Rs39.43bn, the ministry reported, compared with Rs3.51bn in 1991, the year
India began its liberalisation programme.
Some 80 per cent of investment approvals have been in high-priority
industrial sectors. They include power and fuels at Rs47.33bn; the
metallurgical industry at Rs15.03bn; services at Rs17.51bn; food processing
at Rs14.14bn; electrical equipment at Rs12.25bn; chemicals, excluding
fertilisers, at Rs10.95bn; tourism and hotels at Rs7.28bn; transportation,
including the car industry at Rs5.39bn; and telecommunications at Rs1.89bn.
'This should allay fears among the critics of the liberalisation programme
that foreign investment is only pouring into the consumer durables and
luxury goods sectors,' a ministry spokesperson said.
The US continues as the leading foreign investor in India, accounting for
Rs58.54bn of the total approved figures in the four years to June 1994.
Other leading investor nations include Switzerland at Rs11.71bn; Japan at
Rs9.88bn; the UK at Rs9.45bn; Germany at Rs6.21bn; the Netherlands at
Rs5.46bn; and Oman at Rs5.44bn.
Approvals to non-resident Indians totalled Rs16.58bn.

FT  19 AUG 94 / World Trade News: ABB wins contract for Java
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A consortium led by Asea Brown Boveri, Europe's largest electrical
engineering group, has won a Dollars 733m order to build a 1,090MW power
sta-tion at Muara Tawar, in West Java.
The order was placed by Perusahaan Unum Listrik Negara (PLN), the Indonesian
state electricity authority.
It will be shared by ABB and its consortium partner, Marubeni of Japan.
ABB's part is valued at about Dollars 400m.
The deal will be supported by a financing package based on the participation
of several export credit agencies, as well as a significant countertrade
contract arranged by ABB Project &amp; Trade Finance.
Marubeni is subcontracting the civil works to UK-owned Balfour Beatty Sakti
Indonesia, part of BICC Group, and Japanese-owned PP Taisei Construction
Indonesia. They have received a letter of intent for the Dollars 158m
contract, which will be shared equally.
The new combined-cycle power station will be gas and oil-fired.
It is due for completion at the beginning of 1997. ABB said its very short
project completion times had helped it win the order, with the first of six
turbo-sets expected to be running within 17 months.

Presidents Itamar Franco of Brazil and Gonzala Sanchez de Lozada of Bolivia
yesterday extended by 12 months the deadline for agreement on a proposed gas
pipeline between the two countries.
The extension gives more time for final feasibility studies and to raise
finance for the project, which was originally due to be ready to go ahead by
this week.
Brazil still plans to buy 8m cubic metres of Bolivian natural gas per day,
rising to 16m cubic metres in 7 years, but admitted for the first time the
possibility of buying more gas, as requested by Bolivia. The price of 90
cents per British Thermal Unit was confirmed.
Final shareholdings in the pipeline were also agreed. The Brazilian part of
the project will be controlled by Petrobras, the state-owned oil and gas
company, with a 51 per cent holding. BTB, a joint venture between BHP,
Tenneco and British Gas, will hold 25 per cent and private Brazilian
companies 4 per cent.
Yacimentos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB), the Bolivian oil and gas
company, will hold 20 per cent, a bigger shareholding than Brazil had
initially offered.
On the Bolivian side, YPFB will hold 85 per cent and Petrobras and BTB 15
per cent.

A gigantic digging machine (above) yesterday began work on the tunnel
section of the Y1,440bn (Dollars 14.4bn) Trans-Tokyo Bay Highway, which will
include the widest undersea tunnels in the world, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The 15.1km toll highway, including two 9.4km undersea tunnels, a 4.4km
bridge over the water and two man-made islands, will run across the centre
of the bay, connecting Kawasaki City on the west coast and Kisarazu City to
the east and reducing the trip between the two from 110km to 30km.
The large cities of Tokyo, Yokohama and Chiba are also on the bay, as well
as the industrial districts of Keihin and Keiyo.
The cylindrical tunneling machines, at 14.14 metres each, are the same width
as the tunnels they dig, with cutters mounted on their forward surfaces. The
Channel Tunnel has a width of 8.6 metres.
A TTB official said the work would be difficult because the bottom of the
bay is very soft. In addition, the tunnels will be built 60 metres below sea
level where water pressure would be strong.
The Trans-Tokyo Bay Highway is scheduled to begin operating by March 31,
1997. The construction of the man-made islands and the bridge started in
1989 and about half of the total construction work had been finished at the
end of July.
Traffic on the highway is expected to be about 33,000 vehicles a day
initially, increasing to 64,000 eventually.

Ten officials from the Russian central bank were arrested by interior
ministry forces earlier this week on charges that they had 'allocated loans
in a criminal fashion'. Government officials yesterday confirmed that the
arrests had taken place but would not give further details. They come at a
time when financial scandals, complete with midnight police raids, are
becoming the norm in Russia. Recently, police have seized sacks of cash from
Siberian branches of a struggling investment fund and earlier this month
they arrested the president of the controversial MMM pyramid scheme only
after clambering along the outside walls of his apartment building. The
allegation that central bank officials have misused loan facilities is
particularly topical because the central economic issue in Russia today is
whether the central bank should bail out the country's indebted enterprises.

A slide this week to record low levels for the Swedish krona was halted
yesterday when the opposition Social Democratic party said its manifesto for
next month's general election, due out today, would contain tough measures
to curb Sweden's big budget deficit. Earlier this week, a suggestion by Mr
Goran Persson, the shadow finance minister, that the manifesto would not
detail spending cuts pushed the krona as low as SKr5.09 against the D-Mark
and drove the yield on nine-year government bonds above 12 per cent. The
krona fell back to SKr5.04 against the D-Mark yesterday afternoon and
nine-year bond yields slipped back below 12 per cent after Mr Persson and Mr
Ingvar Carlsson, the party leader, said the manifesto would, after all,
contain 'exceptionally tough' fiscal proposals. The markets attach
particular weight to the Social Democrats' policies because of their strong
lead in opinion polls. But dealers warned of a further lurch in currency and
interest rates if today's manifesto, not due to be published until the
markets have closed for the weekend, were judged to be less stringent than
billed.

In defiance of intense pressure from Belgrade and the international
community, Bosnian Serb leaders yesterday called for the creation of a
Greater Serbia. The speaker of the makeshift Bosnian Serb parliament in
Pale, near Sarajevo, Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, said he would ask the parliaments
in Serbia and Montenegro, which together comprise the remnants of
Yugoslavia, to unify with self-styled Serb states in Bosnia and Croatia.
Unification is unlikely to succeed but the move will put pressure on
Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic by appealing to nationalists in Serbia
who have criticised his trade embargo against the Bosnian Serbs, imposed
after they rejected an international partition plan. Meanwhile, the Bosnian
Serb parliament has proposed a new prime minister, Mr Dusan Kozic, a
technocrat who promised to clamp down on black-marketeering.

Spanish fishermen fired at French trawlers in the Bay of Biscay yesterday,
wounding one Frenchman, in the latest clash of the Atlantic tuna war, the
fishing ministry said in Paris. Mr Pierre Drege said five Spanish boats
attacked four French ones about 45 nautical miles off Cap Breton in
southwest France early in the morning. The wounded fisherman, Mr Gilles
Tanguy, had undergone surgery and was in stable condition. 'It was
gratuitous aggression. . . the French boats were fishing with nets that were
totally authorised, not the (long drift) nets that have caused problems
recently,' Mr Drege said. The international battle over tuna fishing
practices has been raging since the start of the summer, when Spanish boats
seized a French trawler and towed it back to their home port in an attempt
to prove to EU inspectors that its nets violated regulations.

A cholera epidemic reached further into the Russian heartland this week when
health officials detected the disease in the waters of the Don, one of the
nation's most important and beloved rivers. The outbreak has already claimed
16 lives in the southern region of Dagestan, where more than 500 people have
been infected by the disease, and four in the embattled Chechen republic,
where 34 cases have been registered. One person has died of cholera in
Moscow and health officials both there and in St Petersburg fear that
carriers of cholera may be at large in their cities. The epidemic now
appears to be spreading from the Caucasus to the central regions of Russia.
Officials in Voronezh have detected cholera in the Don and Bityig rivers and
authorities in Krasnodar are worried that it has spread into their region as
well. Four villages in Dagestan, the original source of the infection, have
been placed under quarantine and some air, rail and transport routes have
been closed, but officials fear that travel by car into and out of Dagestan
might led to a further spread of cholera.

The Bundesbank yesterday decided to keep its interest rate policy on hold
for at least another two weeks despite a further encouraging dip in the
annualised rate of growth in M3 money supply. The provisional 9.9 per cent
July rate, although still above the bank's 4-6 per cent target, was a bigger
improvement than expected over June's 11.4 per cent. Release of the figures
during yesterday's council meeting prompted speculation that a discount rate
cut might, after all, be in the wind. In the event, the council's only
action was to leave the rate for securities repurchase agreements fixed at
4.85 per cent. The M3 data yielded hardening indicators of two important
trends. The shift of funds out of short-term into long-term instruments
(so-called monetary capital formation) appeared to accelerate in accordance
with the bank's wishes. Some DM16bn fell out of the M3 calculation compared
with DM7.6bn in July last year. If this trend, encouraged by the May cut in
the discount rate to 4.5 per cent, continues, M3 may approach the upper end
of the target range by the year's end. At the same time, private sector
borrowing gained pace, pushing the annualised growth rate over the past six
months to 9.2 per cent, compared with 8.8 per cent in June.
See Editorial Comment
Switzerland reported a record current account surplus for 1993 of SFr27bn
(Pounds 13.4bn). It was also, at 8 per cent, by far the highest among
industrialised countries in relation to gross domestic product. Swiss
surpluses have averaged SFr14.6bn, just under 5 per cent of GDP, over the
past decade.
Unemployment in Sweden rose to 8.8 per cent (395,000 people) in July from
8.5 per cent in June, the central statistics bureau said. The figure was 9.5
per cent in July last year.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Russian brokers fight to fend off tax police
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russian stockbrokers yesterday were engaged in a fierce battle to block a
draft law which would give the tax police regulatory control over the stock
market and give the government the right to discriminate against foreign
investment banks.
The draft legislation, prepared by the Finance Ministry, is part of the
state's broader inclination to react to the pyramid schemes spreading
throughout Russia with strong-arm tactics which brokers fear 'won't kill the
market but could seriously jeopardise its development'.
The struggle over stock market regulation is one battle in the war between
free market proponents of greater economic liberalisation and those forces
in the government which still back strong central control.
Russia's immature but increasingly robust stock market is straining to
absorb a sharp increase in foreign and domestic investment which began
earlier this year and saw trading worth Rbs1,000 billion (Pounds 310m at the
market rate) in July.
Growing investor interest is a hopeful sign that Russia's massive
privatisation drive is beginning to pay rich dividends but it is a
development with which the fledgling stock market, currently regulated by
four separate government institutions and a contradictory thicket of
legislation, is ill-equipped to cope.
Brokers say the Finance Ministry's draft law, which they describe as a
'hasty and ill-prepared' reaction to mounting problems most vividly
exemplified by the MMM investment fund crisis, would make matters worse.
The draft law would give the tax police, the branch of the ministry which
orchestrated the dramatic armed raid on the president of the MMM pyramid
scheme earlier this month, a direct role in regulating the stock market. It
would also open the door to explicit government discrimination against
foreign investment institutions.
However, in a sign that Russia's emerging capitalists are beginning to play
an effective role in shaping public policy, Moscow brokers this week have
been waging a fierce but covert battle to prevent the draft legislation
becoming law.
They have quietly lobbied officials from the cabinet, president's office and
state privatisation agency and have written a letter to Mr Alexander
Shokhin, deputy prime minister, which is scheduled to be published in a
leading Russian business newspaper over the weekend.
'This is an effort by the government to turn off the taps of commerce and to
control the financial markets,' Mr Dmitri Vasiliev, deputy chairman of the
state privatisation committee said. 'It is very dangerous.'
For stockbrokers, the draft law embodies their worst fears about the
possible government reaction to the collapse of MMM, which became a cause
celebre in Russia earlier this month. When the pyramid began to crumble,
brokers, who have formed self-regulatory associations throughout Russia,
urged the government not react to the crisis by tightening government
control.
Instead, they are lobbying the Kremlin to introduce a US-style
self-regulatory system and to recognise that over-the-counter trading,
already the dominant form in Russia, is increasingly becoming the norm in
the west and should be accepted here as well.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Schering denies drug carries cancer risk: Patients advised
to consult doctor about using hormone which may affect DNA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Schering, the Berlin pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals group, yesterday
denied that one of its drugs contained a carcinogen, a substance that
encourages the growth of cancer.
At the same time, Germany's Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices
said it would advise patients 'not to panic' but ask their doctors whether
to continue using cyproterone acetate (CPA), a hormone Schering developed 20
years ago.
In a form marketed as Diane-35, the drug is used for reducing male hormones
in women, curing acne, and for contraception. With its elements combined
differently, and known as Androcur-10, it is administered to hypersexually
active men and is used as a treatment for prostate cancer.
Professor Gunter Stock, a Schering board member, said 15m people had
successfully used the drug since it went on the market in the early 1970s.
Turnover last year totalled DM400m (Pounds 165m), of which DM70m came from
domestic sales. The medicine, Schering's second-biggest seller, accounts for
about 10 per cent of its pharmaceutical division sales.
Schering's response was designed to reassure its shareholders after shares
fell from DM952 at the close of trade on Monday to DM908 yesterday following
the disclosure that the institute had written to Schering on August 5
seeking a response to the findings of two separate independent studies on
the effects of CPA.
The studies were carried out by the Institute for Toxicology in Munich and
the Institute for Pharmacology of the University of Genoa in Italy.
Professor Helmut Greim, head of the Munich institute, who conducted the
study over five years, said Schering had been aware, and it was accepted
internationally, that when the oestrogen contained in CPA was used in large
doses, it could promote tumours in liver cells.
Schering yesterday said it had repeatedly carried out studies in cultured
(isolated) liver cells from rats and had found some cases of tumour
promoters which led to the proliferation of cells; but it could not be
proved that this would develop into cancerous cells.
Both Schering and Prof Greim said that, because these cases were so rare and
the success rate of the CPA drug so high, its therapeutic effects outweighed
these incidents.
However, Prof Greim explained that in most of the trials carried out by
Schering on cultured liver cells of rats, and on the liver tolerance of its
patients, 'the Schering people had been concentrating on tumour promoters
which cause the proliferation cells in the liver, but not on the effect CPA
had on the deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA system'. DNA contains the genetic
instructions in all cells.
'In our studies, we stumbled upon what effect the CPA drug would have on the
DNA system and we discovered earlier this year that the drug interacted with
DNA, which means that there is a danger to the reproduction of the genetic
system of cells. This is much more dangerous than the proliferation of
cells,' said Prof Greim. He said the findings, later applied to cultured
human liver cells by the University of Genoa, appeared to confirm how the
CPA drug interacted with DNA.
Schering said it had until September 19 to respond to the Institute for
Drugs and Medical Devices. 'We have not asked them to withdraw the drug. We
will have to assess Schering's findings,' said Ms Julia Terzoglou of the
institute.
However, Prof Greim said Schering would have to look at the women who had
taken the drug over the years, particularly those who received high doses:
'This could take a couple of years.' Over a quarter of a million patients
had been treated with high doses of CPA.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Russia braced for big bankruptcies: Minister points way for
tough action against indebted companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government has begun to brace the country for a painful round of
big industrial bankruptcies in the state sector.
Mr Oleg Soskovets, the deputy prime minister who chairs an emergency
commission convened to deal with the mounting debt crisis, warned on
television late on Wednesday night that 'we must not be afraid of
bankruptcies.' The minister told Russians that his commission had prepared
24 draft laws to resolve the debt crisis which would be signed into law over
the next few weeks.
Mr Soskovets' tough but vague statements were the strongest signal yet that
Russia's fragile economic reforms may weather the debt crisis largely
intact. Growing inter-enterprise debt, which Mr Soskovets said amounted to
Rbs90,000 billion (Pounds 27.7bn at the market rate), is the most serious
test the Russian government has yet faced.
If the Kremlin gives into the temptation to bail out indebted factories the
country's tentative macro-economic stabilisation could be jeopardised, but
allowing the factories to go bankrupt could cause widespread unemployment
and trigger social unrest.
'The state must be very harsh with those companies which behave themselves
badly in the transition to a market economy,' Mr Soskovets said. He referred
specifically to the troubled Zil motor manufacturer, which is hoping the
government will save it from looming financial ruin. But, if Mr Soskovets
prevails, there will be no state salvation for the company which was once
the flagship of the Russian car industry.
'There (at Zil) is an obvious lack of understanding of marketing and an
inability to deal with creditors. So we cannot simply give them soft loans,'
Mr Soskovets said.
He warned viewers that some further contraction of Russia's already
drastically reduced industrial production was inevitable in the transition
to a market economy. He also rejected the notion, increasingly popular among
cash-strapped factory managers, that foreign competition was the source of
their travails. 'We must not be confused by some pseudo-patriotic idea about
defending our markets,' said. 'The state cannot stem the inflow of foreign
goods.'
But while Mr Soskovets, like the Russian prime minister a former factory
director, offered Russians a 25-minute flow of rhetoric which would warm the
heart of even the most zealous market reformer, his address was short on
details.
Apart from urging Russians not to fear the term 'bankruptcy' he mentioned no
specific measures the government would take to resolve the debt crisis.
Moreover, neither the prime minister nor the president has yet spoken out on
the issue and the most concrete step the government has taken in recent days
has been to issue fresh soft loans.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Kok completes Dutch cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Dutch Labour party leader, Mr Wim Kok, yesterday finished choosing his
cabinet, clearing the way for Queen Beatrix to swear in the new government
on Monday.
The new foreign minister will be Mr Hans van Mierlo, leader of the
left-leaning D66 party, one of three parties in the new coalition.
Mr van Mierlo, who helped found the reformist D66 in 1966, served briefly as
defence minister in a short-lived coalition with the Labour party and the
Christian Democrats in 1981.
Mr Gerrit Zalm, the prospective finance minister, is a member of the
right-wing Liberals, the third party in the coalition, and is the head of
the semi-autonomous Central Planning Office. He has also been a senior civil
servant at the finance and economic affairs ministries.
Mr Kok's new government, which is committed to increasing employment and
changing elements of the country's generous welfare system, ends more than
three months of political uncertainty since May's inconclusive general
election.
The cabinet is unusual because it brings together three parties that have
never governed in the same coalition before and because its two main
components, Labour and the Liberals, have traditionally clashed on incomes
policy.
This difference of opinion could cause tension in future. However, the
coalition has already cleared one hurdle by agreeing on the broad outlines
of the 1995 budget, due to be presented to parliament on September 20.
The budget talks were part of the long and detailed coalition negotiations
conducted over recent weeks by Mr Kok, who was finance minister in the
outgoing cabinet.
His government programme is a careful compromise between the wishes of the
Labour and Liberal parties. He has managed to avoid cutting the level of
unemployment and disability benefits, yet he has also committed himself to
making spending cuts of Fl 18bn (Pounds 6.67bn) over the next four years in
such controversial areas as health and education.
Labour, which had been the junior partner to the Christian Democrats in the
outgoing centre-left government, saw a sharp drop in support in the May
poll, partly because of its agreement to previous welfare changes, but it
narrowly emerged as the biggest party overall.
The Christian Democrats suffered a historic defeat and now face being
relegated to the opposition for the first time since universal suffrage
began in the Netherlands in 1917.
It is still trying to find a replacement for Mr Elco Brinkman, who resigned
on Tuesday as leader of the party in parliament. Mr Brinkman is held
responsible for the party's electoral defeat, which was also caused partly
by the decision of Mr Ruud Lubbers, the veteran prime minister and Christian
Democrat politician, to retire from national politics.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Yeltsin decree muddies the waters: New soft credits could
set stage for political battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the Russian government, the country's mounting debt crisis represents a
political and economic Rubicon.
If Russia's leaders take the potentially explosive decision to force factory
managers into bankruptcy, there will, for this government, be no turning
back from market reforms.
This week Mr Oleg Soskovets, deputy prime minister and chairman of the
special government commission convened to resolve the debt crisis, warned
the nation in a television address that the government may be preparing to
do just that.
He said the state could not afford to bail out factories, no matter how
large or important, that had through mismanagement or corruption accumulated
a mountain of unpaid bills.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Soskovets' hard line will become government
policy. A contradictory signal came a few days earlier from Russian
President Boris Yeltsin who late last week quietly announced that he would
grant Rbs3,500bn - later increased to Rbs4,200bn - worth of soft credits to
the defence sector and for investment.
The decision, made with so little fanfare that it seemed almost clandestine,
threatens to jeopardise the agreement Russia made with the International
Monetary Fund earlier this year and trigger a new round of inflation.
'The Russian government has two options,' a prominent Russian private
businessman said, 'either to continue with its fiscal and monetary rectitude
or to again turn on the printing presses and trigger a fresh wave of
inflation. Mr Yeltsin's decision is a signal that the government has chosen
to turn the printing presses back on.'
Officials from western financial institutions, first informed of Mr
Yeltsin's decree by journalists, were equally concerned. 'It is very
disconcerting,' an official said. 'They are breaking the rules of the game
established with Mr (Michel) Camdessus (IMF managing director) this spring.'
Russian officials insisted that the new soft loans would not push Russia
over the budgetary limits agreed with the IMF. But Mr Sergei Ignatiev, a
deputy minister of the economy, did predict that the new expenditures would
push inflation up to 10 per cent a month by October.
However, Mr Yeltsin's move represented only the first volley in a battle
which observers believe will determine the fate of Russia's fragile economic
reforms. As Mr Soskovets' television address suggests advocates of initially
painful market reforms, who fiercely opposed the president's decision, are
still fighting to introduce a series of measures which would force factory
managers to bear responsibility for the mounting debt that threatens the
whole economy.
The debt crisis, which officials say is at the top of the government's
agenda, is the first decisive test of the Kremlin's commitment to market
reforms. The stringent monetary and fiscal policies which Russia adopted at
the insistence of the IMF this spring cut off the soft credits which were
the traditional life-blood of Russia's inefficient industries. But factory
directors have managed to soften the blow by extending credits to one
another.
This practice, which at first shielded Russian industry from the pain of
economic restructuring, is now bringing the nation's economy to a halt and
factory directors are turning to the government for a bail-out.
Officials from western financial institutions speculate that Mr Yeltsin, who
has taken care to distance himself from the government's most painful
economic decisions, 'is playing good cop to prime minister (Victor)
Chernomyrdin's bad cop'.
Mr Yeltsin's decision to extend soft credits, which the central bank -
recently converted to fiscal orthodoxy - fiercely opposed, was made on the
eve of the president's tour of Russia's industrial heartland. While he
cruised down the Volga river the president was a captive audience for
cash-squeezed factory directors, like the managers of the Avtovaz car plant
who lobbied the president for tax breaks and more soft loans when he visited
their factory. Because of the debt crisis, Avtovaz is four weeks behind in
paying wages to its employees.
Carmakers are not the only industrialists campaigning for an end to the
government's painful economic rigour. This week the fiscal squeeze hit the
sector which is Russia's greatest source of solace and one area in which
Moscow rightly feels it makes a world-beating product: vodka.
The Kristall factory, makers of Stolichnaya, one of the world's best vodkas,
has been declared insolvent by the Federal Bankruptcy Agency. But like the
carmakers, the director of Kristall is fighting back in a very public
campaign to force the government to reverse its decision. He and other
factory directors will be appeased by an increased flow of soft credits and
an end to the state's new tough policing of fiscal mismanagement.
Indeed, if Mr Soskovets' televised speech was a signal of a new government
approach rather than a rhetorical testing of the waters, the Kremlin should
brace itself for a fierce and public battle with the factory directors'
lobby. If Mr Soskovets' tough line - rather than Mr Yeltsin's quiet granting
of soft loans - is to be the new rule in Russian economic policy, then
Russia could be poised for one of the most serious political battles it has
yet faced.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Russians hold three men over plutonium smuggling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Anxiety about nuclear material being smuggled out of the former Soviet Union
grew yesterday when Russian police confirmed they had arrested three men
trying to sell a quantity of plutonium for Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) in
the Baltic port of Kaliningrad last week.
The police admission, which follows heated denials from Moscow that
plutonium allegedly found in Germany last week and earlier this year was
from Russia, coincided with efforts in Bonn to defuse speculation about an
impending clash with Moscow over plutonium smuggling.
Although there has been only one reported find of what could accurately be
described as weapons-grade plutonium in Germany - around 5 grammes seized
more than three months ago - last week's highly publicised police action at
Munich airport sparked widespread criticism of Russian security.
But Mr Friedrich Bohl, minister in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's office, said
yesterday there was no way the latest scare, sparked by three arrests and
the capture of nuclear material at Munich airport last week, would lead to a
crisis in relations between the two capitals,
Smoothing the way for the arrival in Moscow this weekend of a delegation of
nuclear experts led by Mr Bernd Schmidbauer - Mr Kohl's security adviser -
Mr Bohl said the two sides were already negotiating possible co-operation
agreements.
Moscow had already basically agreed that German experts might be allowed to
work jointly with Russian specialists to check security measures in a
Russian nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, he said.
But the arrests in Kaliningrad will heighten fears that criminal gangs have
gained access to nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union despite
persistent denials from Russian officials that any of their weapons-grade
plutonium has gone missing. The three men are all Kaliningrad residents.
In Brussels, the European Union's atomic energy authority, Euratom, said
tests had confirmed that plutonium seized in Germany over the past four
months had definitely been manufactured in Russia.
Mr Schmidbauer and a team of nuclear experts will arrive in Moscow tomorrow
for a two-day visit to discuss the plutonium finds with the Russians.
The Munich find last week is understood to have been part of a fuel rod,
used, from a nuclear power station or reactor.
Used fuel rods can contain plutonium 239 used in weapons but extracting it
requires reprocessing. Even then, the amount of weapons grade plutonium
would depend on the amount of time the fuel rod had been in use - the longer
it had been used, the less usable plutonium would be available. In addition,
fuel rods are more difficult to transport than reprocessed plutonium.
According to senior German government officials, some ill-informed media and
ill-advised officials 'who do not understand the nature of our relations'
were to blame for inflaming tempers and sparking angry rebuttals from the
Russian capital.

FT  19 AUG 94 / Clinton urged to act on flood of Cuban refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The governor of Florida declared a state of emergency and appealed to
President Bill Clinton for help yesterday to cope with a growing tide of
refugees from Cuba.
But the White House attempted to play down the refugee influx, declaring the
situation was 'orderly'.
US Coast Guard cutters picked up a further 330 Cuban refugees from small
boats and makeshift rafts by yesterday evening after rescuing 547 on
Wednesday and nearly 600 earlier this week. With nearly 3,500 picked up this
month, the refugee flow to Florida has swelled to its highest in 14 years.
The Florida governor, Mr Lawton Chiles, said thousands more Cubans might be
about to flee to the US, with President Fidel Castro's government apparently
encouraging them to go so as to ease unrest in the country.
Mr Chiles said he might have to call out the national guard to cope with the
refugees. Even so, he said, Florida urgently needed money and other help
from Washington to shelter and feed the Cubans.
US State Department officials believe Mr Castro has informally eased
restrictions on Cubans wanting to leave the country. 'The systems of control
seem to have been lifted,' an official said.
Cuba's relations with the US have deteriorated recently, with Mr Castro
accusing Washington of being behind recent disturbances and boat hijackings.
The isolated socialist republic has been struggling to cope with an economic
crisis since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the east European
communist bloc.
While the US is embarrassed by the prospect of a refugee influx, Mr Castro
has suggested Washington is getting what it deserves in view of hardship
caused by the US trade embargo.
The arrival of Cubans in boats, on makeshift rafts and clinging to rubber
rings is stirring memories of 1980, when 125,000 refugees fled to the US in
just a few months when Mr Castro declared they were were free to go.
The Clinton administration is bound by the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966,
which grants refugee status to any Cuban who reaches the US. Although the US
sets aside 20,000 visas a year for legal Cuban immigrants, many Cubans see
risks in making a formal application in Havana and have a strong incentive
just to set sail for Florida.
The US is advising Cubans not to 'risk life and limb' in attempting to make
the crossing to Florida and has warned the Castro government that it will
not tolerate an exodus, though there appears to be little it can do to halt
the flow.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokeswoman, said yesterday the US would
'not allow Fidel Castro to dictate immigration policy'. But the State
Department said it was looking at 'contingency plans for dealing with a mass
exodus'.
The Air Force began to erect a tent city at a base south of Miami yesterday,
though it claimed the measure was a drill.

Despite the 50 basis point rise in US interest rates earlier this week, the
dollar yesterday slipped below Y100 again. The catalyst for renewed weakness
was the Bundesbank's decision to keep its rates on hold, lending further
strength to the D-Mark. A jump in the US's bilateral trade deficit with
Japan in June also prompted further dollar selling. Currencies, Page 25;

FT  19 AUG 94 / Asbestos accord may herald end of US litigation: Deal could
allay worst fears of Lloyd's Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The end of multi-billion dollar litigation that has forced many asbestos
companies to close and posed a threat to insurers, including many Lloyd's
syndicates, could be in sight after the approval of a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds
830m) out-of-court settlement in the US.
Judge Lowell Reed, a federal judge in Philadelphia, this week approved the
deal which involves 20 asbestos companies.
About 100,000 Americans who have been exposed to asbestos will be
compensated if they contract certain diseases in a deal negotiated between
lawyers and the Centre for Claims Resolution, an asbestos industry body
formed to handle personal injury claims.
Under the scheme, victims of mesothelioma, a cancer of the lung lining, will
receive between Dollars 20,000 and Dollars 200,000 and victims of other lung
cancers between Dollars 10,000 and Dollars 86,000. Awards will be Dollars
5,000 to Dollars 32,000 for other cancers linked to asbestos exposure and
between Dollars 2,500 and Dollars 30,000 for non-malignant diseases.
Each year's total awards will also be capped, however, further reducing the
average level of individual awards.
Britain's T&amp;N, the second largest company represented by the Centre,
predicted that the settlement would significantly reduce its liability
provisions for asbestos-linked legal action.
Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive, said: 'It will restrict future
liability and, once the transition to the new procedures is complete, result
in a reduction in litigation costs over the next 10 years.'
However, he ruled out such a scheme being adopted in Britain, where
claimants do not have the same recourse to product liability action as in
the US.
T&amp;N - which as Turner &amp; Newall was Britain's main supplier of asbestos  -
also claimed that the overall incidence of asbestos-related diseases was on
the decline.
The Centre represents only about a quarter of the now largely defunct US
asbestos industry. But Mr Lawrence Fitzpatrick, chief executive, said other
former asbestos companies were interested in expanding the scheme which
could serve as a model for resolving the problem.' This country has let the
asbestos litigation get badly out of control,' said Mr Fitzpatrick.
Some 200,000 legal claims - not covered by this week's deal - have been
filed. Total costs already amount to some Dollars 10bn, with much of the
burden falling on insurers. These insurers, who are expected to fund about
two-thirds of the US settlement, should benefit from the deal.
Lloyd's Names may gain some relief from the settlement, which could allay
their worst fears about huge claims in US courts. The extent of the London
market's exposure to the companies involved in this week's settlement is not
yet known.
However, final approval of the deal is uncertain, because lawyers acting for
victims or potential victims are divided. Mr Ron Motley, an attorney acting
for potential victims, said the decision 'puts an end to asbestos gridlock
that has meant victims dying on the court house steps'.
But other lawyers oppose the deal and will appeal. Mr Brent Rosenthal of the
Dallas-based lawyers, Baron &amp; Budd, said people who have not yet developed
asbestos-related diseases were in effect being asked to give up their legal
rights, and he criticised the ceilings on the awards.

FT  19 AUG 94 / J. Rothschild fined Pounds 100,000 by life industry
regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J. Rothschild Assurance, the life insurer which Sir Mark Weinberg helped to
set up, has been fined Pounds 100,000 and told to pay Pounds 40,000 costs
for failing to monitor its sales force properly and to keep adequate
records.
Lautro, the life insurance industry's self-regulatory organisation, said it
had identified a number of cases where JRA sales agents had given unsuitable
advice or in which there was not enough justification for selling customers
a product to replace one already held.
JRA had not ensured that sales agents had complied with regulatory
requirements, and had not kept records which could show that best advice had
always been given, Lautro said.
Sir Mark, one of the UK's leading innovators in the sales of financial
products, was the prime mover behind the successes of Abbey Life and Allied
Dunbar. Abbey Life, set up in 1961, was one of the first companies to
introduce unit-linked assurance policies. He set up JRA in 1992.
The charges relate to JRA's first months of operation, and follow the first
routine inspection visit by Lautro, in October 1992 and an advisory visit in
May.
Mr Mike Wilson, JRA's chief executive, said that the company had undertaken
an extensive sampling of sales made in 1992. In fewer than 10 cases, JRA had
felt it necessary to compensate customers by changing the policy which had
been sold or by refunding premiums paid.
While the fine is well below Lautro's record of Pounds 300,000 - levied on
Norwich Union and on Premium Life earlier this year - it is among the higher
penalties for failings revealed by the first round of inspection visits.
Mr Wilson said that since 1992 JRA had improved its record-keeping and
compliance procedures.
JRA's policy is to recruit only sales agents who have had significant
financial services experience, and Mr Wilson admitted that this carried a
risk of unjustified 'replacement selling' as clients moved with their
advisers.
He argued, however, that the customer was better off with experienced sales
staff than with a new recruit 'let loose' after a training course of just a
couple of weeks. JRA currently has 570 sales agents.
Sir Mark, JRA's chairman, said that Lautro's penalising of some two dozen
companies was a sign that self-regulation was effective.

<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American Home Products, the US drugs and consumer products group, said
yesterday it had no plans to sell the agricultural chemicals business of
American Cyanamid, the healthcare and agricultural products company which
agreed this week to be bought by AHP for Dollars 9.7bn (Pounds 6.25m).
Mr John Stafford, AHP's chairman, said: 'Our plan is to keep the
agricultural chemicals business. It's growing, it's technology-based, which
is consistent with our approach to the business. It's really an outstanding
business, and will become part of our diversified portfolio.'
Mr Stafford also said that there was significant unrealised potential in the
Cyanamid unit. 'It has a chemical library of some 300,000 compounds; by
using today's technology it can be screened for pharmaceutical uses - that
can be an extra plus.'
The comments followed speculation on Wall Street that AHP would move quickly
to sell the agrochemicals unit once it had completed the integration of
Cyanamid's drug business.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Private insurer in tobacco lawsuit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AP-DJ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The state of Minnesota, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, are
suing various elements of the tobacco industry to recover Medicaid and
insurance costs tied to smoking-related ailments, AP-DJ reports from New
York.
The suit, filed yesterday, is the first such action in the US joined by a
private insurer.
The state government, Blue Cross and Blue Shield are Minnesota's largest
insurers. They are suing the big six tobacco companies, claiming conspiracy,
anti-trust violations and fraud.
In the south of the US, the Mississippi state attorney-general filed a
similar suit in May, and Florida lawmakers authorised a lawsuit this year.
The Minnesota suit alleges consumer fraud, and a conspiracy to conceal the
health hazards of cigarettes and to manipulate nicotine levels.
The suit also alleges that the tobacco industry controlled the market for
cigarettes in violation of a state anti-trust law. The suit did not specify
the amount of damages sought.
A Philip Morris spokesman could not be reached immediately for comment. In
the past, tobacco companies have said no conspiracy existed.
The Mississippi suit relies on state law in respect of unjust enrichment and
breach of contract. The suit has not yet reached court.
In May, the governor of Florida signed a law that not only allows the
state's attorneys to sue to recover smoking-related Medicaid costs, but
would also deny the tobacco industry such traditional legal defence as the
argument that smokers knew the risks and chose to smoke.
Florida has not yet filed a suit under the law, partly because the tobacco
industry is challenging it on constitutional grounds.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Row over call for curb on population
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Worldwide spending on family planning needs to rise to Dollars 17bn by the
end of the decade - more than treble present levels - if the growth in the
world's population is to be curbed, the United Nations population fund said
yesterday.
The UN call comes amid an international row over the agenda of next month's
population conference in Cairo, the first UN meeting to tackle the issue for
a decade.
This week, US anti-abortionists joined the Vatican and Islamic leaders in
attacking the conference's draft agenda, which calls on countries to draw up
plans for stabilising the world's population.
The agenda also covers homosexuality, women's rights and teenage sex, but it
is the comments on abortion that have provoked the fiercest opposition. The
US's powerful anti-abortion lobby took full page advertisements in leading
newspapers this week to accuse the UN and the US of promoting abortion as a
means of contraception.
Governments from the Philippines to the Middle East have been drawn into the
controversy, in which the US and the Vatican have been cast as the prime
antagonists. Pope John Paul II, who has accused the conference of promoting
the 'culture of death', last week attacked the conference's support for
artificial birth control.
Islamic leaders in Cairo, and Iran's Moslem-led government have also
criticised sections of the draft document.
Mr Timothy Wirth, the US undersecretary of state for global affairs, has
insisted that 'neither US policy nor the Cairo document promotes abortion'.
The UN said the agenda commented on abortion only in the context of a threat
to women's health.
The UN population fund, which estimates that 250,000 women die each year
from the 50m abortions performed worldwide, has called for better
distribution of contraceptives to help reduce the number of unwanted
pregnancies. UN officials are exasperated that the abortion row threatens to
distract debate from the broader issues of population growth.
According to the fund's annual report, published yesterday, the world's
present population of 5.7bn is set to rise to 10bn by the middle of the next
century even if the sharp falls in birth rates seen in recent years
continue.
But it argues that the population could be stabilised at 7.8bn if
contraception were made much more widely available.

FT  18 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Telegraph hint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A whiff of speculation in the market suggested that Mr Conrad Black, the
newspaper entrepreneur and proprietor of the Telegraph, may have embarked on
his threatened move to buy in shares of the company. Mr Black retains a 57
per cent stake in the Telegraph, via his Hollinger company.
Telegraph shares retreated from a record 620p in May this year to a low of
332p after Mr Black's Hollinger group sold a block of 12.5m shares at 587p
and the Telegraph chopped its cover price from 48p to 30p in an effort to
maintain its pre- eminent position in the quality end of the newspaper
market. In the resulting controversy over the share sale and the price cut,
Cazenove resigned as broker to the Telegraph.
The shares plunged 35 per cent the day after the price cut news hit the
market. The stock edged up 5 to 361p yesterday on turnover of 303,000
shares, having topped 500,000 shares earlier this week.
Heavy turnover was again being recorded in GEC as the two-way bid
speculation refused to die down. Volume reached 15m shares by the close and
the stock advanced a sprightly 8 to 300p.
Market chatter was full of the same stories which have been swirling around
the stock for several sessions now. Potential British predators BTR and
Hanson were being joined by Alcatel, Siemens and General Electric from
abroad. BTR shares climbed 8 to 384p and Hanson slipped 3 to 261p.
There was also speculation that the cash-rich defence and electronics group
was considering spending its estimated Pounds 2.8bn cash pile - either with
a big acquisition or by buying back its shares.
A decline in crude oil prices impacted on the oil majors, excluding them
from the general market upsurge.
The worst performer in oils was again Enterprise Oil, which lost 5 more at
398p in heavier than usual turnover of 3.1m. The recent sell story from
NatWest Securities was again seen as driving the stock lower, but dealers
reported a general feeling that the shares remain 'unloved' by most of the
big domestic institutions. Some large lines of stock, reflecting the sale of
a block of 1m shares, were said to be still overhanging the market.
Lasmo added 3 at 157p after the drilling success in Algeria, while news of a
4,300 barrels a day oil strike in the North Sea boosted British Borneo, 2
firmer at 221p, and Seafield Resources, which raced forward 9 to 63p.
The regional electricity stocks (recs) scored some strong gains as the lull
in the post-Offer buying spree appeared to be over. NatWest Securities
underlined the positive mood by raising its 1994-95 dividend growth forecast
for the recs from 10 per cent to 15 per cent. South West Electricity forged
ahead 21 to 727p and Northern 20 to 742p.
A squeeze among the generators sent National Power running up 18 1/2 to 501
1/2 p and PowerGen 24 to 581p. There was talk that one US securities house
was bringing out a positive note on the stocks in the next few days.
Banking shares were in favour following the US increase in interest rates.
Those that stood out included National Westminster, which advanced 18 to
479p, and Barclays, 15 better at 560p on good volume of 4m.
A clutch of brokers' recommendations together with general bargain hunting
helped HSBC Holdings rise out of the doldrums that followed the release of
Monday's half-year figures. The shares rallied 17 to 734p in strong trade of
7.1m. James Capel, Nikko Securities and Lehman Brothers favour the stock.
There was more interest in the brewers, with dealers reporting some heavy
trades amid continuing investor buying interest. Vaux, the Sunderland-based
brewer, climbed 9 to 250p on a hefty 2m traded. Boddington, due to report
results early next month, advanced 11 to 281p, while Greenalls added 10 at
450p and Greene King gained 3 at 499p. A big buyer of Whitbread helped the
shares jump 18 to 575p on 2.5m dealt.
There was also big turnover in Guinness as the shares moved up 8 to 469p.
Volume reached 13m, with dealers reporting, as last week, Salomon Brothers
unwinding what appeared to be a large order.
Media conglomerate Pearson strengthened 21 to 645p, which dealers put down
to a technical bounce, rather than reports of BSkyB's success in obtaining
some rights to screen English cricket matches. Pearson has a 17.5 per cent
stake in BSkyB.
United Newspapers rose 11 to 518p. The company said its Express Newspapers
subsidiary had bought a picture library operator for Pounds 27m.

Rumours of a profits upgrade in transport and property group P&amp;O sent the
shares 14 ahead to 704p in trading volume of 4.7m.
The talk suggested that a leading broker was about to raise its full-year
profits estimate to match BZW's top of the range Pounds 375m prediction.
However, none of the names cited as possible candidates for the upgrade
would confirm such a move.
Sentiment in the stock was further lifted by reports of a Smith New Court
recommendation, and a favourable outlook for container shipping from P&amp;O's
Dutch rival Nedlloyd. The group reported disappointing interims but
mentioned stable rates and growing volumes on its north Atlantic and Far
East routes on which it competes with P&amp;O.

FT  18 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Warrant underpins C&amp;W rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bullish mood surrounding Cable and Wireless continued, with BZW issuing
25m call warrants on the non-Hong Kong rump of the shares. The warrants are
designed to fac-ilitate arbitraging between C&amp;W and Hong Kong Telecom, in
which C&amp;W has a 57.5 per cent stake.
According to BZW, C&amp;W's market capitalisation without HK Telecom is Pounds
900,000, but it estimates that the non-Hong Kong business is worth Pounds
3.6bn. The broker believes the apparent 75 per cent discount could narrow to
25 per cent. The warrants, which expire in one year, were issued at 105p
each and closed at 112p yesterday.
C&amp;W shares, inspired by some other recent positive moves by brokers,
advanced 10 to 448p. Hoare Govett reiterated its strong buy stance on
Tuesday, pointing out C&amp;W's exposure to the Chinese cellular telecoms
market. C&amp;W's rise came amid a strong per-formance from the rest of the
telecoms sector, with BT partly-paid shares gaining 4 1/2 at 260p and
Vodafone finishing 9 1/2 ahead at 195 1/2 p.

FT  18 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures traded around the 3,200 September Footsie level for most
of the day as dealers responded to strong UK economic data and the move on
US interest rates, writes Joel Kibazo.
Buyers of the September contract on the FT-SE 100 were seen at the outset as
dealers reacted with relief that the US Federal Reserve Board had lifted
rates by a decisive  1/2 percentage point. Within the first half an hour,
the contract was trading 20 points ahead.
But it was the release of better than expected figures on UK inflation and
unemployment that sent September sharply ahead to break through 3,200.
Goldman Sachs was reported to have been among the main buyers in the market,
although rumours of independent traders (locals) being short helped underpin
the rise.
Dealers said good selling at the higher levels was well absorbed and there
was good arbitrage activity particularly later in the session.
September hit a high of 3,220 but relinquished some of the earlier gains in
concerted profit taking towards the close. It finished at 3,207, up 55 on
its previous close, and around 6 points above its fair value premium to cash
of about 10 points. Volume jumped to 18,767 lots.
In traded options, volume at 46,550 was more than double that of Tuesday.
The FT-SE 100 option traded 16,332 lots.

FT  18 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities surge after excellent
inflation news - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Much better than expected economic news, principally on inflation trends in
the UK, coupled with widespread relief in international markets that the US
Federal Reserve had at last moved to increase interest rates, triggered a
burst of strength on the London stock market.
The FT-SE 100 Index, which has struggled to penetrate the 3,170 level since
the start of the month, moved into overdrive yesterday, piercing the 3,170
short term resistance level and closing a net 43.0 higher at 3,190.3. The
market's second tier index, the FT-SE Mid 250, was less impressive but still
managed to record a 26.6 gain at 3,741.7.
And dealers said the UK market was set fair to launch a determined challenge
on the Footsie 3,200 level as the institutions digested the raft of
excellent news on the UK economy.
Adding to a generally buoyant mood across the market was a sharp increase in
turnover in London equities. Volume jumped to 771.9m shares, with non-FT-SE
100 stocks accounting for only 50 per cent of the total, indicating that the
big international instititutions had moved in to buy the leading stocks. The
value of customer business in London in expected to easily surpass the
Pounds 1.2bn figure recorded on Tuesday; 'There has been some seriously good
business transacted in the market today,' said the head trader at one of the
UK integrated trading houses .
Senior marketmakers were impressed with London's resilience to pockets of
profit-taking, triggered by some hefty bouts of selling pressure in
international bond markets where gilts ended an extremely volatile session
with gains of around 10 ticks, having been up almost 1 1/2 points early in
the session.
'The equity market feels good; it's taken everything the market has thrown
at it and is still only five points off the day's high; we should be okay
tomorrow but I would expect to see further profit-taking,' was the view of
one marketmaker.
The market was braced for a strong start to the trading session after the
move by the US Federal Reserve, late on Tuesday, to lift its Fed Funds rate
and the discount rate each by 50 basis points, a move which European markets
had mostly factored in.
What impressed UK traders was Wall Street's overnight response to the move
by the Fed and, more so, the response of US bonds which raced ahead on the
news.
The FT-SE 100 index kicked off over 20 points higher and thereafter moved
progressively higher, with the market extremely happy with the raft of good
news on the UK economy.
The negative inflation figure for July, which showed a 0.5 per cent decline,
its biggest ever monthly fall, was much better than even the most optimistic
strategists had hoped for; 'the RPI figure beat best expecations by a long
way,' said Mr Steve Wright at BZW. 'It's very good news for equities,' he
said.
Mr Roger Barker, equity market strategist at UBS, described the inflation
result as a 'positive surprise,' but, in keeping with UBS's cautious stance
on UK equities, said 'the market is running to the limits of its upside;
fair value is around 3,000; on fundamentals we can't see it going much
higher.'
A slightly disappointing performance by Wall Street at the opening yesterday
took some of the shine off London's performance but a general mood of quiet
optimism was evidentaround the City's trading desks. The Dow-Jones Average
was down almost eights points two hours after London closed.
All eyes in Europe are now focused on the German Bundesbank which meets
today to formulate German monetarey policy. Super optimists are hoping for a
reduction in German rates, but the more cautious expect the Bundesbank
Council to hold fire until next month.

FT  18 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Smaller stocks gain, blue
chips slow down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Small-capitalisation stocks outperformed blue chips yesterday as investors
continued to react to Tuesday's bold move to higher interest rates, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 8.09 easier at 3,776.48, investors
having booked profits following Tuesday's 24-point advance. The more broadly
based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up a scant 0.16 at 465.17.
Advancing New York SE issues outscored declines by 1,187 to 944 in brisk
activity, volume on the Big Board reaching 309m shares by the close.
In the secondary markets, the Nasdaq composite built on its relatively small
gain of the previous day, climbing 7.15 to 742.66. The American SE composite
ended 1.28 higher at 444.94.
For most investors it was a day to pause and reflect on the implications of
the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening of monetary policy a day
earlier.
On Tuesday, the announcement of a move to lift two short-term interest rates
resulted in solid gains for stocks across the board, but not before the
market wrestled with worries over the impact of the policy change on
corporate profits. In the end, however, investors were able to shrug off
their concerns and focus on a welcome surge in long-term bond prices.
The positive mood in equities carried over into yesterday's trading, even
though the rally in bonds had stalled.
In both markets, investors were busy cashing in on the previous session's
gains, holding most of the leading stock indices in check throughout the
day. The Nasdaq was the exception as technology and heatlth care stocks
maintained their forward momentum.
There was no economic news on offer to influence sentiment, although it was
unlikely that any fresh data would have had much of an impact in the wake of
Tuesday's events.
In the vacuum, most stocks meandered. Among the big cyclical issues,
however, Deere advanced Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 67 7/8 thanks to favourable
comments by Mr Mitchell Quain, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder.
Caterpillar was Dollars  7/8 ahead at Dollars 109 3/4 , but International
Paper dropped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 71 7/8 and 3M slipped Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 54 1/4 .
Amid the general drift, American Home Products and American Cyanamid made
some waves with the announcement of a Dollars 9.7bn merger agreement.
After a delayed opening, Cyanamid jumped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 96 1/8 on
news that stockholders would receive Dollars 101 a share in cash as part of
the deal. AHP's stock added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 59 1/4 .
Retailing issues cooled off after Tuesday's heated session which was
highlighted by the release of a batch of quarterly results.
However, Toys R Us, which had climbed Dollars 2 on Tuesday, put on an extra
Dollars 1 3/8 to close at Dollars 37. Gap Stores retreated Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 41 1/2 .
Kmart was marked up Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 18 1/8 in heavy volume of 4.2m
shares. After Tuesday's close the discount store operator announced plans to
spin off three of its specialty divisions.
Canada
Toronto stocks closed mixed with a negative bias after Tuesday's rate-driven
rally failed to produce any expected follow-through, in spite of a further
rise in Canadian bonds.
The TSE 300 index edged 2.48 points higher to 4,205.27 but falls led rises
by 391 to 314 after volume of 52.8m shares. Eight of the 14 sub-sectors
showed improvement. Strength in transportation and conglomerates was
countered by weakness in gold, forest products and oil and gas issues.
Mexico
Equities ended with only a slight gain after profit-taking erased most of an
early rally in response to sharply lower domestic interest rates, which fell
to their lowest level in almost five months.
The 37-share IPC index finished 5.05 points up at 2,699.65 after touching
2,732.45. Turnover was a heavy 2.77bn new pesos on 194.3m shares traded.
A trader said: 'Prices went up like crazy when interest rates fell and that
triggered profit-taking because the investors active in the bolsa now are
just speculating, the others are waiting for Sunday's (presidential)
election to be over.'
The interest rate on the bellwether 28-day Treasury bill fell 175 basis
points to 13.4 per cent at this week's auction. Analysts noted that
forecasts had been for a reduction of about 100 basis points.

FT  18 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Talk moves on to German
interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The crystal balls were out in force yesterday, some strategists arguing
early in the day for an immediate cut in key German interest rates when the
Bundesbank meets today, writes Our Markets Staff.
However, Reuter's poll of 20 economists around Europe reported that 85 per
cent of them thought that there would be no Buba cut today, although a
majority expected a cut some time in September.
At Goldman Sachs, Mr Sushil Wadhwani thought that European assets might
underperform US assets temporarily, because of domestic interest rate
concerns: 'Specifically,' he said, 'given that a majority of analysts still
expect the Bundesbank to cut the discount rate one more time, there is clear
scope for disappointment here.'
FRANKFURT responded to Tuesday's US rate reduction, the Dax index closing
the session up 19.15 at 2,162.29, and the post bourse at an Ibis-indicated
2,166.56. Turnover recovered from DM5.1bn to DM7.8bn.
Banks and chemicals were mixed, the latter seeing a switch from Hoechst,
down DM2.50 to DM356.50, and into BASF, up DM2.50 at DM329.70 with results
due today.
Schering, weakened by doubts cast on the safety of two of its drugs, hit
DM895 in early Ibis trade before closing a net DM5.50 lower at DM909.50. The
German health agency which made the accusations, meanwhile, was accused of
overreaction to heavy criticism of its predecessor.
ZURICH saw its banks move both ways as SBC fell on Tuesday's half-year
results, the bearers losing SFr19 at SFr378 in an expected punishment for a
drop in trading income. CS Holding moved ahead SFr18 to SFr549, rewarded for
results in line with expectations.
The SMI index ended just off the 2,600 mark, rising 10.6 to 2,599.3. Brown
Boveri shed SFr9 to SFr1,250, but this was seen as selling on the good news
after a 30 per cent rise in half-year net profits at the Swiss/Swedish
operating group ABB.
AMSTERDAM reacted sharply to results from Nedlloyd, the transport and
shipping group, which released first-half figures at the lower end of
analysts' expectations. The shares were marked down 9 per cent in active
trading, losing Fl 6.40 at Fl 64.60.
Analysts had been expecting the group to come in with a profit between Fl
34m and Fl 65m, against a loss in the same period last year of Fl 116m.
However, the group posted a figure of Fl 35m, viewed as disappointing in
light of the recent batch of results from other Dutch companies which have
been at the upper end of forecasts. Nedlloyd also reported that it expected
second-half results to be at a similar level to the first half, but could be
pressured if the dollar remained weak.
The AEX index ended 0.73 up at 417.80, after a session's high of 419.74.
MILAN closed the last day of the August account slightly softer, with the
Comit index dipping 4.93 to 649.22.
In banks, BCI fell L184 to L4,174 ahead of today's launch of its capital
increase programme which aims to raise some L2,360bn. Shareholders are
entitled to buy new shares at L3,000 in a one-for-two rights issue, and
analysts said the issue should be fully subscribed.
The telecommunications sector also attracted interest, with Sip, the
domestic operator, losing L91 at L4,094 on its last day of trading before it
was absorbed, together with Italcable, down L166 at L9,782, into Telecom
Italia. From today Telecom Italia becomes the country's integrated national
telecommunications service operator and will be quoted on the bourse. Stet,
the holding company, shed L33 to L4,825.
PARIS strengthened, although activity remained unexceptional, as it had been
for previous sessions, The CAC-40 index rose 22.93 to 2,034.98 in turnover
of slightly above FFr2bn.
MADRID closed lower for the fourth consecutive session, as nervousness set
in late in the day following weakening trends in the domestic debt market,
and on Wall Street.
The general index fell 1.51 to 309.67, with Telefonica Pta25, or 1.4 per
cent, off at Pta1,775.
STOCKHOLM built on Tuesday's rise, helped by a good gain in Ericsson, up
SKr9 at SKr402 in the 'B' shares, as investors anticipated today's half-year
results.
The Affarsvarlden general index rose 5.70 to 1,406.00.

FT  18 AUG 94 / World Stock Market (South Africa): De Beers recovers by 3.4
per cent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Local investors were active yesterday, encouraged by a positive reaction on
the world's financial markets to the rise in US interest rates, which was
announced late on Tuesday.
With De Beers and Anglos leading the way, the overall index closed 61 up at
5,823, industrials added 41 at 6,610 and golds rose 42 to 2,152.
Although the price of gold bullion firmed, strong renewed support for golds
and mining financials was based mainly on the belief that the gold price was
set to break out of its currently narrow trading range.
De Beers recovered all of Tuesday's loss following its announcement of
disappointing half-year results, rebounding R3.75, or 3.4 per cent, to
R113.25. Anglos moved forward R5 to R256.50. In golds, Vaal Reefs rose R5 to
R395.

<TEXT>
Equities saw late afternoon profit-taking which eroded most of their earlier
gains, and the Nikkei 225 average closed only moderately higher, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index was up 38.20 at 20,824.56 after a day's low of 20,791.96 and high
of 20,875.78. US interest rate rises provided a brief stimulus, with buying
by domestic investors and dealers, and arbitrageurs later in the afternoon.
Volume expanded from 254m shares to 360m. Profit-taking and index-linked
selling around the 20,800 level persuaded many investors against active
buying.
The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 5.07 at 1,663.75 and the
Nikkei 300 gained 1.17 at 302.79. Advances outnumbered declines by 516 to
427, with 219 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 1.79
at 1,352.62.
Overseas investors continued to buy steels and chemicals, with some domestic
financial institutions following suit. Leading steels took the top five
places in the active stocks list, with Nippon Steel, the most active,
remaining unchanged at Y375, Sumitomo Metal Y14 stronger at Y341 and Kobe
Steel Y3 firmer at Y330.
Sumitomo Chemical moved ahead Y6 to Y578 and Mitsubish Kasei advanced Y8 to
Y565. However, cement shares, which had also been bought earlier in the
week, could not sustain their gains. Chichibu Cement dropped Y60 to Y1,360
and Onoda Cement retreated Y16 to Y663.
Foreigners also bought Kumagai Gumi, the contractor, which climbed Y15 to
Y572.
Telecom and multimedia- linked stocks were popular. Reports that the
government would invest in multimedia networks ahead of the 1998 Nagano
winter Olympics, and the development of a new wireless network by Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone and Victor, revived interest. Dealers also purchased
electricals, regarded as laggards. Victor appreciated Y60 to Y1,390 and
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone moved forward Y21,000 to Y880,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average finished 141.85 higher at 23,207.30 in volume of
28.1m shares.
Roundup
The region responded to the US interest rate rise, Australia adding one of
its own. Jakarta and Colombo were closed.
HONG KONG jumped 1.8 per cent, the Hang Seng index closing 171.36 ahead at
9,537.98 in turnover of HKDollars 5.46bn. Property stocks led the rally,
with Henderson Land Development gaining HKDollars 1.60 at HKDollars 41.80
and Sun Hung Kai Properties adding HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 52.75.
Traders suggested that much of the buying came from Japanese and US
investors. Some analysts expected a rate rise tomorrow but felt that this
was already factored into local share prices.
Wharf Holdings advanced HKDollars 1.10, or 3.5 per cent, to HKDollars 32.10
on a 26 per cent rise in half-year earnings. Hang Seng Bank recovered after
its fall on Monday's interim results, rising HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars
54.75, one of the largest gains of the session.
China's Qingling Motors rose to HKDollars 2.75 from its initial offering
price of HKDollars 2.07. The stock bucked the trend of the H-share index,
which fell 7.57, or 0.55 per cent, to 1,313.40.
SINGAPORE bought blue chips, the Straits Times Industrial index ending 35.83
higher at 2,334.40 in volume of 409m shares. City Development added 40 cents
at SDollars 7.60 in heavy volume on high expectations of new projects
sched-uled for the rest of the year, and on an upturn in its office rental
and hotel operations.
KUALA LUMPUR added more strong earnings reports, the easing of capital
controls by Bank Negara and a lower than expected July inflation figure, to
the US interest rate news and the KLSE composite index put on 17.96, or 1.6
per cent, at 1,126.14.
Volume climbed from 310m shares to 563m. Renong and Idris, both speculative
favourites, led activity with rises of 32 cents and 10 cents respectively to
MDollars 4.24 and MDollars 5.65. Genting rose 50 cents to MDollars 24 on
strong half-year results.
SYDNEY rose as the Reserve Bank of Australia outdid its US counterpart,
lifting official interest rates by 75 basis points. The removal of
uncertainty left the All Ordinaries index 19.5 higher at 2,059.5 in turnover
of ADollars 389.55m.
CRA rose 32 cents to ADollars 19.26, matching its previous record close on
February 8, aided by speculative buying after troops recaptured the closed
Panguna copper mine, in which CRA has a 53.6 per cent interest, on
Bougainville Island.
WELLINGTON liked the US and Australian moves and the NZSE-40 index ended
18.49 firmer at 2,101.46 in turnover of NZDollars 30m. TAIWAN blamed its own
government's tight monetary policy for the fact that its advance - 62.00 to
6,645.90 - was not greater.
KARACHI saw selective buying of financials and some foreign interest as the
KSE index edged up 19.04, or 0.85 per cent, to end at 2,265.75. Dewan Salman
Fibre rose Rs4.75, just over 3 per cent, to Rs161.50 as synthetics
manufacturers came into demand on the new account day.

FT  18 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Emerging Markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bombay's stock market, so far, has lived up to forecasts made by a number of
analysts at the start of the year that it would be one of the world's best
performing emerging markets. Last Friday the BSE index closed at a record
high of 4,508, retreating slightly on Monday and Tuesday as investors took
profits, before moving higher once again in yesterday's trading to finish at
4,507. According to data collated by the IFC, the market has risen nearly 22
per cent in dollar terms since January 1, outperforming other South Asian
markets and only bettered by some of the Latin American bourses.
However, the rally has largely been driven by local investors, with the flow
of foreign institutional funds down to Dollars 43m in July, from Dollars
123m in the previous month.
Some analysts believe that the market now has further to go: industry is
coming out of recession, while the steel and automobile industries are doing
well and are expected to publish good first-half results. This season's
monsoon rains are also above normal, holding out prospects of an above
average crop for 1994.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Dollar in narrow range

The dollar traded in a narrow range yesterday after Tuesday's 50 basis-point
rise in US short-term interest rates, writes Philip Gawith.
The market's response was more encouraging than after the previous three
rate rises, where the dollar fell sharply. But investors remain wary of the
US currency, having paid for their bullishness earlier in the year.
It closed in London at DM1.5603, compared to DM1.5480 before the rate rise.
Against the yen it finished at Y100.26 from Y100.425. In New York the dollar
ended lower at DM1.5515 and Y100.135.
Market attention quickly shifted to the Bundesbank council meeting today,
the first after the summer recess. In a Reuters poll of 20 analysts, 85 per
cent said they did not expect a cut in official German rates. A possibility
remains that the Bundesbank will announce a return to a variable rate repo,
which could herald a gradual fall in rates.
Some observers, however, believe that the central bank may set another fixed
rate repo, to avoid the possibility of rates rising under the variable
option.
The other main development was in the UK, where better than expected
inflation and earnings figures boosted financial markets. Short sterling
rose sharply, but the pound remained little changed as the fortunes of the
D-Mark and the dollar continued to determine its progress.
The trade weighted sterling index closed unchanged at 78.8.
The Australian dollar was slightly weaker at Dollars 0.7402 from Dollars
0.7418 after the Reserve Bank followed the US Fed's lead and raised interest
rates by 75 basis points to 5.5 per cent.
The relative improvement in the dollar's performance, post the rate rise,
can probably be attributed to the firmer tone of the US bond market.
'Previously the bond market had always felt that maybe there was more to
come in terms of rate increases. Now there is a sense that maybe enough has
been done,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS in
London.
He warned, though, that there was a risk of further speculation if the
Bundesbank failed today to offer the prospect of lower rates. This, said Mr
Cunningham, might prompt a flow of funds from peripheral European currencies
into the D-Mark, which would put downward pressure on the dollar.
Mr David Cocker, currency analyst at Chemical Bank in London, noted that
overnight to one week money rates in the US had now crept above those in
Germany. 'For the first time, then, a trader in the interbank market will
have an incentive to hold dollars rather than D-Marks.'
He said three other factors would probably have to be met in order for the
dollar to make a sustained recovery. First, there would need to be a clear
resolution of the US-Japan trade dispute. Second, there would need to be a
sense that US rates were close to their peak for a while, so that the bond
market could enjoy a significant rally.
Finally, the US presidency required increased credibility, 'something that
seems further away than ever'.
Mr Cocker noted that sentiment remained fragile, and said that a poor
inflation number in the next month would renew fears that the Fed was
'behind the curve' in combatting rising prices, prompting further dollar
sales.
Events in the UK were dominated by the recovery in short sterling, prompted
by the exceptional RPI figures. The underlying growth of retail prices by
only 2.2 per cent in the year to July was the best performance in 27 years.
The December contract saw 41,595 lots traded and ended 13 basis points
firmer at 93.36 after a high for the day of 93.45. Economists were nearly
unanimous in concluding that the latest data show that the economy does not
need higher rates. But the futures market is still expecting rates to rise
by about 135 basis points by the year-end.
In Europe the D-Mark was slightly weaker against most currencies. The lira
finished firmer at L1,018 from L1,023 and the French franc closed at
FFr3.430 from FFr3.431.
One exception was the Swedish krona, which was under severe pressure after a
leak of the social democratic party's economic programme disappointed the
bond market. The krona closed at SKr5.054 against the D-Mark, from SKr5.040,
after slipping to a low of SKr5.0740.
Mr Niels Christensen, currency analyst at Technical Data in London,
commented: 'A lack of a move up in bonds and a strengthening of the D-Mark
could easily be the scenario that triggers a move up towards SKr5.10.' But
he added that there was a lot of negative news already built into the very
low bond prices.
In its daily operations the Bank of England provided UK money markets with
Pounds 305m late assistance. Earlier it had provided Pounds 70m assistance
at established rates, compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 400m.
Overnight money traded between 4 1/4 and 6 1/2 per cent.
In Germany, call money rates eased to 4.80/90 per cent, from 4.85/95 per
cent, ahead of the Bundesbank meeting.
