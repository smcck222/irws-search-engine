FT  17 AUG 94 / Whitehall error over disabled workers: Officials missed EU
change in job support scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whitehall officials last night admitted it was their mistake over a change
in European Union law that prompted employment secretary Michael Portillo to
scrap a job support scheme to help disabled workers.
Senior civil servants failed to realise that the new directive on awarding
public supply contracts, which came into force in June, had dropped previous
legal protection that had enabled EU states to support subsidised schemes
for the disabled.
'They failed to pick it up,' said one official. As a result, Mr Portillo
believed he had no option but to terminate the government's Priority
Suppliers Scheme, dating back to just after the second world war, which
helped disabled workers tender at a lower price than others for public
contracts.
The news came as the European Commission denied UK claims that it had
questioned the legality of the priority supplier scheme last week. The UK
Foreign Office said a letter from Mr Martin Bangemann, EU industry
commissioner, to Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, had confirmed the
Commission's doubts about the scheme.
Brussels officials said the letter had nothing to do with the case. The new
consolidated directive was drafted at the end of 1992 by EU officials after
Brussels consulted civil servants of all the member states. In Britain both
Treasury and the Department of Employment officials gave advice on the
contents of the draft.
It was stressed last night that ministers were not directly involved in that
consultation process. During that period Mr Portillo was chief secretary to
the Treasury and Mrs Gillian Shephard was employment secretary.
The previous EU directive, drawn up in January 1977 on co-ordinating
procedures for the award of public supply contracts, stated clearly that
opt-outs were permissible which would protect the position of disabled
workers.
That directive said public supply contracts must go to 'either the lowest
price only' or to 'the most economically advantageous tender', depending on
a number of commercial considerations.
But it also made clear that the economic criteria 'shall not apply when a
member state bases the award of contracts on other criteria within the
framework of rules existing at the time this directive is adopted, whose aim
is to give preference to certain tenderers, on conditions that the rules
invoked are compatible with the Treaty of Rome.' It was this opt-out that
enabled the British government to continue subsidising disabled workers in
sheltered workshops.
However, the crucial paragraph was not included in the new consolidated
directive, which UK officials believe cannot be amended; legislation would
be needed to remedy the omission.
Yesterday no official in Whitehall was able to explain why this had
happened. But it has been accepted that the omission from the directive had
not been spotted by civil servants in late 1992. This is why it was never
raised with ministers.

FT  16 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Calor slips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Calor, the bottled gas producer, was a poor performer among the energy
stocks following a press report suggesting that Calor had been losing market
share because of intense competition and price-cutting in the bottled gas
market.
The stock opened sharply lower at 275p, but then embarked on a sustained
rally which left it a net 9 off at 281p. The story led to a big increase in
turnover in Calor shares. Some 470,000 changed hands, compared with usual
volume levels of well below 100,000 per day.
The rally was helped by soothing comments from the company, which insisted
that it had maintained market share at around 50 per cent but conceded that
there had been pressure on profit margins.
Calor shares have fallen steeply since the start of the year, from 361p in
late January to a 1994 low point of 261p in June.
Speculators were active in the drugs sector again, inspiring some chunky
volumes and firm movement in selected shares. Wellcome was said to be
attracting particular interest, speeding forward 13 to 692p on turnover of
2.4m.
The sector has been buzzing since last month's Dollars 8.5bn bid from US
drugs group American Home Products for American Cyanamid - the sector's
first unsolicited takeover attempt since Roche launched an attack on
Sterling six years ago. One leading US broker, Wertheim Schroder, recently
put a 900p a share bid value on Wellcome, among a forecast of Dollars 40bn
worth of merger and takeover activity over the next 18 months.
Takeover chatter also swirled around Reckitt &amp; Colman, spurred on by weekend
press speculation that the household goods group was indeed a frontrunner
for the corresponding business owned by Eastman Kodak.
Analysts believe the move would make good strategic sense, although fears of
a rights issue to fund the mooted Dollars 1bn price tag saw the shares come
off in early trading. However, they later rallied to close 4 up at 635p.
Brewers were firm as the sector's recent strength was compounded by rumours
that the government was at last listening to the industry's big bug-bear -
the rate of excise duty.
However, analysts were wholly sceptical that the government would consider a
cut in duty, particularly given the political sensitivity of increasing VAT
on fuel bills this autumn. This failed to dampen investor enthusiasm from
some quarters, with Scottish &amp; Newcastle advancing 5 to 532p, Whitbread 8
1/2 to 560 1/2 p, Bass 6 to 574p and Greenalls 4 to 439p.
Granada was the subject of a big bought deal, with SG Warburg said to have
been the engineer. According to dealers, the broker took 5m shares on at
507p and was selling them on at 510p. Turnover by the close had reached 10m,
suggesting that given the daily average trade in Granada is around the
million mark, not all the shares had been sold. The price dropped 8 to 513p.
Shares in the regional electricity companies (recs) ran into profit-taking
and fell into retreat. Eastern was the exception, with talk in the market of
another big buyer around. Last week, a US fund was thought to have been
behind the purchase of a 2.9 per cent stake. The shares climbed 3 to 766p.
Dealers pointed out that, given their sparkling run since the Offer document
last week, the recs had lost some of their attraction for income funds and
that some sideways trading was likely until some more corporate activity -
such as share buy-backs, or takeovers - excited investor interest.
Marginally firmer crude oil prices, coupled with evidence of keen buying
from the US, helped the oil majors move ahead.
Shell Transport, which disappointed the market last week in announcing
results a little below expectations, advanced to 728p before easing back to
close a net 4 up at 724p, while British Petroleum hardened 2 to 412p.
Among publishing stocks, Telegraph shares were firm following publication on
Friday after the market had closed of official figures showing that its UK
newspaper's daily circulation was sharply ahead. The shares improved 5 to
350p.
A sparkling debut from Pillar Property Investments, coming in the face of a
weak property market, saw the shares go to a 7p premium to 157p by the close
of trading. Turnover reached 8.6m.
Catalogue retailer Argos receded 7 to 367p after unveiling mildly
disappointing interim results. Profits came in line with forecasts, 16 per
cent up at Pounds 15.3m. Analysts were pruning full-year expectations by
around Pounds 2m to about Pounds 93m.
National Westminster Bank moved forward 12 to 462p after analysts at Strauss
Turnbull advised investors to switch into the stock and out of Barclays,
which nevertheless gained 5 at 544p ex-dividend.
Reports suggesting that August car sales would fall below expectations hurt
dealer Cowie Group, the shares ending 8 lower at 252p.
The building and construction sector eased slightly after a press report
published yesterday suggested that the price of land for residential
building in England rose 35.3 per cent in the year to June.
Analysts feared that the rise would hit future profit margins in the sector
as Taylor Woodrow and Beazer Homes both retreated 4 1/2 to 134p and 150p
respectively.

cent from a year earlier.
First-half revenues rose 25 per cent to NTDollars 595m.
Carbon black is a petrochemical material used in the manufacture of tyres,
paints and dyestuffs. Production was lifted by 30 per cent to 83,000 tonnes
a year. At the end of this year annual capacity will rise to 92,000 tonnes.

FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Charter sets new deadline for
Esab bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Charter, the UK industrial group, has declined to raise its stalled Pounds
260m (Dollars 400m) bid for Esab, the Swedish welding group, but extended
its original offer for two weeks to August 26 in the hope of a change of
mind by reluctant Esab shareholders.
The UK company said it had received acceptances at its offer price of SKr345
a share worth 53.1 per cent of the voting capital in Esab by last Friday's
initial deadline. With shares acquired in the market, Charter is assured of
57.3 per cent of the votes in Esab.
But the bid, recommended by the Esab board, is conditional on Charter
receiving 90 per cent acceptances and has been blocked by the rejection of
Swedish institutional shareholders who say it is underpriced.
Since the bid was launched in late June, Esab has raised its earnings
forecast and its share price has risen as high as SKr365.
The share price has been kept high by the widespread expectation in
Stockholm that Charter will raise its offer. But Charter has so far refused
to budge from its insistence that the bid price - which at the time it was
laid represented a 20 per cent premium - is based on a fair valuation of
Esab, the world's largest supplier of welding equipment.
Extension of the deadline to August 26 will at least give Charter more time
to try to persuade Swedish minority shareholders that the bid is reasonable.
It still has behind it the acceptance of Incentive, the Wallenberg family
industrial group which is Esab's controlling shareholder.
But the institutions, sensing Charter's reluctance to pull out of the
takeover, argue that at the least, the premium in the original bid has been
wiped out and should be restored in a revised offer. Charter may be
calculating that this argument will be undermined by the bearish mood on the
Stockholm stock market.
Yesterday, Esab's B shares slipped SKr2.00 to SKr360 in trading interrupted
for much of the day by technical problems in the trading system.

FT  16 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Gaza town to have Dollars 60m port built
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Agreement has been reached on the construction of a Dollars 60m port near
Gaza town, in a move intended to provide a boost to the economy of the newly
autonomous Gaza Strip.
An international consortium headed by Ballast Nedam, the Dutch dredging and
construction company, has signed a turnkey contract with the Palestinian
National Authority, the organisation representing the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, which has taken control of the Gaza strip.
The new port will be the first commercial harbour on the Gaza strip, now
served only by a fishing jetty. It will be built to take vessels of up to
5,000 dwt and will have a water depth of 9 metres.
The port will be built in shallow water to the south of Gaza town and will
include a breakwater. It will open up the Gaza Strip to trade which has
previously been constrained by the need to move goods through neighbouring
Israeli ports.
It is being financed with Dutch, French and Italian government aid. When
final financial approval has been given in about three months, dredging and
construction work is expected to take a further year.
The other members of the European Gaza Development Group are Grabowsky &amp;
Poort, Dutch engineering consultancy; Spie Batignolle, French construction
group; and Sistema Ingegneria of Italy.

FT  16 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Taiwan computer products boosted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The strength of the yen has spurred Taiwan's exports of computer-related
products to Japan, but not enough to turn around the latter's bilateral
trade surplus.
Taiwan's exports to Japan of information products, including hardware and
software, jumped 67.5 per cent in the first half of 1994, compared with a
year earlier, according to the Taiwan Industrial Development Bureau. Such
exports are expected to surpass Dollars 450m for the year, against Dollars
232m last year.
The Taiwan dollar has fallen by nearly a quarter against the yen in the last
year. The bureau predicts Taiwan-made information products will make up 17
per cent of Japan's computer market by the end of the year.
Japanese demand was boosted by increased demand for DOS software, which
Taiwan produces relatively cheaply, as it is one of the main producers of
IBM-compatible personal computers. DOS programs are the basic operating
software for IBM-type PCs.
However, Taiwan's computer industry remains heavily reliant on expensive
high-technology imports, mainly from Japan. Key components including the
liquid crystal display for computer monitors, hard disk drives, and more
advanced memory chips are bought from Japan.
Imported components make up roughly half the production cost of a personal
computer made in Taiwan. That figure contributes to Taiwan's trade deficit
with Japan, which was Dollars 14.42bn in 1993 and is forecast to top Dollars
16bn this year.
Taiwan ranked fifth in output of computer hardware products after the US,
Japan, the UK and Singapore in 1993, according to government figures.
Revenues for the information sector (hardware, software and services)
climbed 15.5 per cent to Dollars 10.8bn, of which Dollars 1.1bn was
generated from software and services.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Nigerian newspaper closed by military
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's military regime yesterday stopped publication of the country's
leading liberal newspaper, the Guardian, in the tense run-up to today's
hearing of Mr Moshood Abiola's treason trial.
The Guardian reflects growing opposition to General Sani Abacha's
government, especially in Mr Abiola's native south-west, and has criticised
annulment of Mr Abiola's election victory last year and his arrest in June.
Mr Abiola was charged with treason after declaring himself president.
The closure underlines the weak position of civilian ministers in the
provisional ruling council. The publisher of the Guardian is Mr Alex Ibru,
the interior minister.
Sunday's edition of the Guardian alleged that the government's hard line
against civilian opposition is dictated by traditional rulers and other
powerful interests among the Hausa-Fulani tribes in the north, which has
dominated government for most of Nigeria's recent history.
Despite attempts by the Nigeria Labour Congress and the constitutional
conference delegates to mediate, the government has refused unconditional
release for Mr Abiola, who says that he will not accept bail if there are
strings attached.
At today's hearing, the judge in the high court, which has been specially
convened in Abuja for this case, will rule on the defence petition that the
court has no jurisdiction to try it and that the charges be struck out.
Strikes which have paralysed the commercial capital Lagos and the rest of
the Yoruba-speaking south-west are partly suspended until today's hearing.
Recent demonstrations in Lagos have led to violence and dozens of civilian
deaths. Last month in Abuja police shot and killed demonstrators near the
high court.
The strongest threat to the government comes from the strike by the oil
workers which has disrupted fuel supplies and forced multinational oil
companies, which produce Nigeria's main export, to cut production by at
least one quarter of its 2m barrels a day capacity.
The oil workers say they will not return to work until the military hand
over power to a civilian government led by Mr Abiola.

Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a record Dollars 90.14bn (Pounds
60bn) at the end of June on an influx of foreign funds to invest in
Taiwanese shares, writes Laura Tyson in Taipei.
The Central Bank of China also attributed the increase from Dollars 87.8bn
in May to the weakness of the US dollar and the relative strength of other
currencies held by the government. The previous record high was in September
1992 when the reserves reached Dollars 89.5bn.

FT  16 AUG 94 / London to list global depositary receipts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange yesterday announced that it is establishing its
first global depositary receipts programme enabling foreign companies to
obtain a full London share listing.
The move to allow global depositary receipts - sterling-denominated bundles
of shares - is part of the exchange's effort to market itself to non-UK
companies and strengthen its position in international share trading.
Mr Michael Lawrence, exchange chief executive, has pointed to the success of
US exchanges in attracting foreign companies, particularly those based in
emerging markets. This has strengthened the international role of the US
exchanges.
Mr David Landman, executive director at Morgan Stanley, the US-based
investment bank, said that London's pre-eminent position as a global
financial centre would be strengthened as a result of the introduction of
depository receipts.
The exchange expects the strongest interest in obtaining a listing for
depositary receipts to come from companies based in emerging markets.
Yesterday the Inland Revenue said that unlike trading in the shares of UK
listed companies, depositary receipts would not attract the standard 0.5 per
cent stamp duty on each transaction. Issuers would, however, have to pay
stamp duty of 1.5 per cent on all shares transferred into the depositary
receipts programme.
The rules are intended to make trading in depositary receipts competitive
with trading costs in the home country. Listing requirements and fees for
those seeking global depositary receipt status will be lower than for an
outright London listing, although the requirements may be no weaker than the
minimum set out in European Union legislation.
The issuer must have a three-year trading record and although audited
accounts for the previous three years must be presented, the accounts need
not be prepared in accordance with international accounting standards, nor
need they be consolidated.
The depositary, typically a bank, must be one which is acceptable to the
exchange and there must be at least one firm which agrees to act as market
maker.
Continuing obligations will include a requirement to notify the exchange in
the event of a price-sensitive development. Annual and half-yearly reports
must be released within six months of the period to which they relate. The
initial listing fee will be Pounds 4,000 and the annual fee Pounds 2,000.

Chapter 11

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thinking Machines, the company that pioneered the use of massively parallel
processing technology (MPP) to build high performance supercomputers, has
filed for court protection under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code.
The Massachusetts company announced it has made approximately one-third of
its 425 employees redundant and plans to reorganise, 'to support the
company's existing customer base and aggressively market its technology
through licenses to other companies'.
Founded in 1983, Thinking Machines originated the idea of massively parallel
computing; chaining together thousands of inexpensive microprocessor chips
to build a powerful supercomputer. The approach, which involves breaking
down big computing problems into millions of discrete elements and solving
them simultaneously, has transformed supercomputing technology.
'Together with our customers, we have opened a new frontier in computing. I
am sad we have not been able to turn our technical successes into financial
success,' said Mr Danny Hillis, co-founder and chief scientist at Thinking
Machines.
Like other companies in the supercomputer market, Thinking Machines has been
hard hit by cuts in US defence spending. Competition from larger companies,
in particular IBM and Intel, has taken its toll.
Thinking Machines is not alone among MPP companies in facing financial
problems. Cray Computer, a spin-off from Cray Research, has yet to sell a
computer and has acknowledged that it faces a cash crunch.
Kendall Square Research is also struggling after an accounting debacle in
which it overstated sales. Earlier this month the company laid off 80
people.

FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Regulation of cable charges hits
net at TCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tele-Communications (TCI), the largest cable television operator in the US,
saw second-quarter net earnings fall to Dollars 6m from Dollars 26m
following tighter regulation of cable charges.
Revenues for the quarter inched up by 3.7 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn,
restrained by the Federal Communication Commission's curbs on cable
operators following the 1992 Cable Act.
Mr Brendan Clouston, vice-president for domestic distribution, said the
company had seen 'continued fundamental subscriber growth' despite 'the
turmoil associated with cable rate regulations'.
Evidence of the regulatory squeeze on cable profits comes during a series of
deals which is rapidly consolidating the US cable industry as operators
chase economies of scale.
The number of pay subscriptions at June 30 was 11.3m, up 18 per cent on the
year end. But although interest charges showed only a small increase at
Dollars 185m from Dollars 182m, after sharp increases in selling and
administrative costs and depreciation, pre-tax earnings fell to Dollars 27m
from Dollars 43m. Earnings per share fell to 1 cent from 6 cents.
The quarter's results cut net earnings for the first six months of 1994 by
more than half to Dollars 38m compared with the Dollars 78m achieved in the
first half of 1993. Earnings per share for the half-year dropped to 8 cents
from 17 cents.
Earlier this month the group reached agreement to acquire TeleCable, a
smaller, privately-held rival, for Dollars 1.4bn. The deal, which will be
equity-financed, will boost the group's share of the market to more than 18
per cent. It will then have just under 11m subscribers out of a total of 60m
homes in the US with cable television.
It also confirmed this month that it has been in talks with Viacom, the
entertainment group, about possible strategic pacts between the two groups'
operations.

FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: AHP puts pressure on Cyanamid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American Home Products stepped up the pressure on takeover target American
Cyanamid last night, telling the US healthcare and agricultural products
group it was willing to lift its bid from Dollars 95 a share to Dollars 100
if the group's board agreed to the offer by tonight. The new offer values
Cyanamid at more than Dollars 9bn.
AHP, however, warned that it would pursue its original bid if an agreed deal
could not be negotiated.
There was no immediate response from Cyanamid, which last week urged its
shareholders not to accept the unsolicited bid until its board had fully
reviewed the bid. If the new offer is rejected, the stage will be set for a
proxy battle for control of Cyana-mid.
Yesterday's developments came a day after Mr Jack Stafford, chairman of AHP
(whose interests range from prescription drugs to confectionery), met his
counterpart at Cyanamid, Mr Albert Costello.
At that meeting, Mr Stafford failed to persuade Mr Costello to accept AHP's
offer, and in a letter to the Cyanamid chief yesterday he expressed his
disappointment at their lack of agreement. Mr Stafford wrote: 'While we have
always believed that our Dollars 95 per share offer represented a full and
fair price, as I stated last night, we were willing to propose an increase
of that price to Dollars 100 on the basis of our belief that such an
increase would permit us to reach agreement and proceed rapidly to conclude
a transaction supported by both companies.'
Although Cyanamid's management is thought to oppose a takeover by AHP,
analysts believe it will be difficult for the board to reject an offer which
values the group's shares at a more than 50 per cent premium over their
pre-bid price.
If Home Products wins control of Cyanamid, it will be the largest takeover
yet in the spate of deals currently reshaping the US drugs industry.

FT  16 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dealing profits hit HSBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharp fall in dealing profits at international banking group HSBC
Holdings took the market by surprise, sending the shares tumbling, after it
reported favourable interim figures.
Headline profits up 24 per cent at Pounds 1.46bn were better than
anticipated, but it was the fall in profits from treasury and capital market
operations at subsidiaries Midland Bank and HongKong Bank that raised most
concern. Analysts were also disappointed by the big rise in the tax charge.
The shares fell back sharply and were down 20 at the day's worst before
recovering to end 10 off at 749p, as sentiment shifted its focus to the
lower than expected bad debt provisions. Volume stood at 6.9m shares at the
close.
Several brokers said that they would be upgrading full-year profit
expectations. That list includes Mr Simon Samuels at Smith New Court who
indicated that his current forecast of Pounds 2.8bn will be raised to around
Pounds 3.1bn.
However, he remains cautious on the stock and said: 'The concerns raised by
the poor quality of earnings in 1993 was further highlighted by these
figures. I feel the shares are fully priced at these levels. Hong Kong
investors will be concerned about the significantly higher tax charge.'

FT  16 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity prices slip back after
promising start - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The final few minutes of what was a relatively subdued trading session on
the London equity market saw share prices succumb to bouts of unease over
the short term direction of global interest rates.
The FT-SE 100 Index of leading UK stocks finished 0.1 off at 3,142.2, easily
outperforming a FT-SE Mid 250 Index which had been dragged down towards the
close of trading in the session by a late sell-off in the regional
elec-tricity stocks.
But senior traders in the City were by no means dismayed at the start of
what promises to be a tension-filled week across global markets, with the US
Federal Reserve meeting today to deliberate on US monetary policy and the
Bundesbank council scheduled to meet on Thursday to formulate Germany's next
moves on interest rates.
Analysts said the market would also have to contend with a long list of
crucial economic statistics from the US, Japan and across Europe.
Trading in London got off to a good start, with dealers encouraged by
reports in the weekend press that the Bundesbank council could well move to
lower German rates on Thursday, and also by positive commentaries on the
better than expected interim profits and dividend performances of many
leading UK stocks, such as Barclays and Royal Insurance.
Aiding the initial improvement in equity prices was a solid showing by
international bonds, which took heart from a firm performance by US markets
last Friday.
The closure of many European bourses and financial centres for the
Assumption Day holiday had only a minimal impact on trading, dealers said.
The FT-SE 100 reached the day's best level, 3,156.5, within an hour of the
opening, with talk of at least two medium-sized and a number of small
programmes weighted to the buy side said to have been partly responsible for
the early strength in share prices.
No real selling pressure was evident over the lunchtime and early afternoon
period but sentiment began to falter in mid-afternoon as most international
bond markets, especially in the US and Germany, began to tick off, taking UK
gilts with them.
Yesterday's US economic news on industrial production, manufacturing output
and capacity utilisation gave no real lead to the markets. Today will bring
data of US housing starts.
Turnover in London reached 463.1m shares, a figure regarded as creditable by
dealers, who pointed out that many institutions were reluctant to take new
positions ahead of the US and German decisions on interest rate policy.
Activity in non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounted for 277.3m, or just short of 60
per cent of total business.
The head of trading at one of London's leading integrated securities houses
said the market had already factored in a rise in the US Fed Funds rate of
at least 25 basis points, with a 50 basis-point increase also a possibility.
But he emphasised that any rise could well be delayed, possibly to the end
of the week. He added that the chances of a German rate cut were 'much less
than evens'.
Bank shares attracted plenty of keen interest, with HSBC shares slipping
back as the market pondered the lack of progress in the group's underlying
banking profits as opposed to sharply reduced provisions against bad debts.
National Westminster Bank shares, which have suffered badly recently as
institutions switched into other banks, were among the FT-SE 100's best
performers, as were the international drug stocks, such as Glaxo and
Wellcome. The regional electricity issues came in for a sharp bout of
profit-taking, with some institutions said to be shifting allocations to
some of the other high-yielding areas of the market, such as banks.

FT  16 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The derivatives sector recorded one of its least active days this year as
attention shifted to the possible outcome of today's Federal Open Markets
Committee meeting in the US, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,158.
However, with many of the European markets enjoying an extended weekend, and
no economic data on which to focus, trading was dull and carried out in very
thin trading.
A sharp mark-up said to have been led by independent traders (locals) saw
September advance to 3,174, the peak of the session, before running out of
steam on the back of a retreat in UK gilts.
US industrial production data released in the second half of the session was
in line with expectations and did little to encourage trading in September.
After falling to a low of 3,144, the contract settled at 3,152, down 7 from
its previous close and at a 10-point premium to cash. Volume was a paltry
5,786 lots.
It was also a poor day in the traded options, a mere 21,265 contracts being
traded, against Friday's 36,099. Among the index options, volume in the
FT-SE 100 option fell back to 6,246 contracts, and the Euro FT-SE option saw
business of 1,224 lots. Sears was the busiest stock option with a total of
2,000 trades dealt.

FT  16 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Easier Dow anticipates FOMC
move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices receded in sluggish trading yesterday as investors
anticipated a change in monetary policy today, writes Frank McGurty in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 8.42 down at 3,760.29, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.72 at 461.23. Volume on the Big Board
reached only 223m shares. The American SE composite dipped 0.38 to 443.32
but the Nasdaq composite added 1.28 at 732.89.
Most equity investors were marking time ahead of today's meeting of the
Federal Open Market Committee. The policy- making arm of the Federal Reserve
was expected to announce this year's fifth move to tighten credit
conditions.
That widely held view, based on a stream of fairly strong economic data over
the past two weeks, was reinforced by yesterday's news on July industrial
production and capacity utilisation. Both figures suggested that the Fed's
previous rate increases had not slowed the economy sufficiently to delay a
further tightening.
Even though a rate increase was seen as a foregone conclusion, most
investors were reluctant to take new positions. There was still uncertainty
over how the bond market would react to any action by the Fed. A sharp
downturn could spill over into equities. With such questions still
unanswered, the market was generally static until the final hours of
trading, when dealing in a few large cyclical stocks picked up.
Caterpillar gained Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 106 1/4 , but International
Paper dropped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 72 and Alcoa Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars
77. As a result, an early rise in the Dow was eroded, and the index closed
with a modest loss.
HJ Heinz added a touch of spice to the mostly bland proceedings amid
stepped-up speculation that it was ripe for takeover. The stock, however,
ended Dollars  1/4 down on balance at Dollars 36 3/4 after opening Dollars 1
3/8 ahead. Ouaker Oats, another food company considered vulnerable, added
Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 76.
On the Nasdaq market, Lotus Development stood out with a Dollars 3 climb to
Dollars 45.
Canada
Toronto stocks tended to ease in quiet trade as most players held the
sidelines ahead of today's US Federal Reserve policy committee meeting.
That meeting is expected to result in a rate increase by the US Fed. The
Bank of Canada's bank rate is also expected to rise today following six
weeks of easing.
The TSE 300 index ended 5.4 points off at 4,169.7, while declines outscored
advances by 402 to 292 after volume of 32.9m shares valued at CDollars
399.7m. Nine of the 14 stock groups were lower but with none showing major
swings.
Future Shop, CDollars 1 up at CDollars 18 1/8 , said it will acquire the
outstanding shares of Granada Canada for about CDollars 3m.
Mexico
Equities finished higher but off the day's peaks in a cautious advance ahead
of next weekend's presidential election.
The IPC index gained 13.74 at 2,651.5. Turnover was a light 70.8m shares.
Analysts expect volume to stay low prior to the election.

FT  16 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Strategists ponder prospects
for Swedish shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several capitals were on holiday for Assumption Day. Activity in working
bourses reflected this, and the hiatus between last week's interest rate
increases and this week's FOMC and Bundesbank meetings, writes Our Markets
Staff.
Currency weakness after the Swedish and Italian rate rises led Mr Sushil
Wadhwani, a senior strategist at Goldman Sachs, to expect Stockholm and
Milan to underperform Europe in the short term, adding the rider that
Swedish equities were 'already significantly undervalued on a medium term
sense'.
His counterpart at Lehman Brothers, Mr Joe Rooney, was less reserved,
increasing his weighting in Sweden from 3 per cent to 4.4 per cent.
There was precedent, said Mr Rooney, for expecting equity performance from
Sweden after the initial increase in interest rates. He called Stockholm: 'A
well managed, growth market which is cheap, and where the flow of earnings
is not dependent on the domestic economy.'
FRANKFURT pounced delightedly on reports, confirmed by the company, that
Hoechst had found a way to transform ozone into oxygen using a synthetic
agent. The shares rose DM8.50 to DM356 as the Dax index moved ahead 14.16 to
2,138.44.
Mr Jorg Blattermann, a trader at Robert Fleming in Frankfurt, said that the
story was tailormade for Hesse, which has just brought in an ozone alarm
that involves reducing speed limits when the ozone level rises above
specific targets. He added that Hesse had had six days of ozone alarms in
the recent hot spell.
Turnover fell from DM7.7bn to DM5.1bn, Hoechst accounting for DM330m of
that, against DM217m last Friday. In the post bourse, Daimler reflected
futures based selling, falling from an official close of DM806 to DM799.40,
down DM8 at the end of the day.
AMSTERDAM took a breather following last week's heavy round of results and
ahead of another batch scheduled over the next few days.
The AEX index finished 0.75 easier at 415.18, after seeing a session's high
of 416.31.
There were slight gains in a number of the international stocks which
reported last week, including Royal Dutch, up 30 cents at Fl 193.03, and
Unilever, 60 cents ahead at Fl 196.50.
Both Nedlloyd, the transport and shipping group, up 90 cents at Fl 70.70,
and Hunter Douglas, the manufacturer of venetian blinds, outperforming the
market with a gain of Fl 2.00 at Fl 85.00, are due to report half-year
figures today.
Hoare Govett, in a forecast of Hunter Douglas published at the end of last
week, said that it expected the company to announce higher sales and
earnings for the first six months of 1994, due to a good performance in
North America and the Pacific. Analysts also expect a positive set of
results from Nedlloyd, helped by a strong contribution from the shipping
division.
ZURICH waited for the US FOMC and the SMI index eased 7.8 to 2,572.7 in thin
trading.
Ciba-Geigy bearers rose SFr9 to SFr827 on a buy recommendation. General
interest rate worries left CS Holding SFr8 lower at SFr523, but SBC held its
ground at SFr394, both ahead of half-year results due this week.
STOCKHOLM suffered an interrupted session owing to technical problems in the
exchange's automated trading system. After a brief half- hour's resumption
in the afternoon, the session was later abandoned with the Affarsvarlden
general index having lost 15.70 to 1,400.60.
COPENHAGEN moved lower following a disappointing half-year result from ISS,
the cleaning group. The KFX index dipped 0.34 to 100.45.
ISS, which posted an increased DKr235m pre-tax profit for the first half,
just lower than market expectations, fell a net DKr22 to DKr197 after
testing DKr190.
HELSINKI weakened as many investors took stock of last week's turbulence in
the money and debt markets.
The HEX index receded 15.00 to 1,807.10.
ISTANBUL advanced 4.4 per cent, helped by weakness in the bond market. The
composite index gained 1,076.72 at 25,515.63, having risen more than 10 per
cent last week.
TEL AVIV had begun its week looking for trouble, the Mishtanim index falling
5.15, or 2.7 per cent, to 187.60 on Sunday in advance of Israel's monthly
inflation figures. Similar apprehension yesterday took the index 0.46 lower
again, to 187.14. The July consumer price index, released after trading
ended, showed a rise of 1.1 per cent - a figure which, said analysts, was
indeed higher than expected.

FT  16 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Italy leads the European equity retreat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until last Wednesday evening, Italy was the sick man of the week in Europe,
but it was joined by a number of its neighbours after Thursday's key
interest rate increases in Sweden, and Italy itself.
James Capel talks of 'rate contagion' in its latest World Economic Watch.
'The long period of monetary ease must now come to an end,' says the broker,
'and the move by Sweden and Italy signals that rate contagion will spread
beyond North America.'
The broker expects US interest rates to rise at the FOMC meeting in
Washington today. Australia and the UK are next on its list for upward
interest rate moves.
In Europe, Capel says that the Bundesbank's discount rate is likely to rise
by March, around six months earlier than Merrill Lynch was forecasting last
week in the US broker's reaction to the Swedish interest rate rise. 'The
whole of Europe,' says Capel, 'is now on interest rate watch.'
By the end of last week, Europe, excluding the UK, was down by 3.3 per cent
in local currency terms over five days. Italy still led the downtrend with a
fall of 9.2 per cent in a severe but still partial correction of the
outperformance it has seen against other European markets this year.
Mr Albert Edwards, global strategist at Kleinwort Benson, sounded a warning
note a week ago about recent bourse gains. By early August, he calculated,
German and French equity markets had seen rises of 7.9 and 11.4 per cent in
the five weeks since June 30.
He added last Friday that interest rate jitters would affect the Continent
more than the UK. While most commentators (Kleinwort apart) believed that an
upward move in UK base rates was imminent, consensus 12-month forecasts for
German and French three-month rates were 4.2 and 4.6 per cent, both well
down from current rates of 4.9 and 5.6 per cent respectively.
'We may think that tightening is some considerable way off,' remarked Mr
Edwards, 'but that will not stop the markets worrying about future
developments.'
Secondly, he noted, Continental equity valuations were more vulnerable at an
earlier stage in recovery and the earnings cycle. Prospective 1994 p/e
ratios for non-financials were 36.1 in Germany, 21.6 in France and 13.8 for
the UK.

FT  16 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei records its
lowest volume in three months

<TEXT>
Tokyo
Share prices closed off early highs on a round of late selling as volume
dropped to its lowest level in three months with many investors remaining on
holiday, agencies report from Tokyo.
Analysts added that activity was also dulled ahead of today's US Federal
Open Market Committee meeting.
The Nikkei 225 average finished at the session's low with a decline of 37.50
at 20,626.33 after a day's high of 20,747.45. Volume amounted to 152m
shares, the smallest since May 2 when 132m were traded.
The Topix index of all first section stocks was finally 0.60 up at 1,652.38,
while the Nikkei 300 lost 0.05 at 300.15. Advancing issues led declines by
462 to 438, with 235 stocks unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put
on 1.50 at 1,337.95.
Investors were also awaiting the auction of shares in Japan Tobacco which
begins today. The Finance Ministry is inviting bids for 230,000 JT shares
between today and Thursday. The stock is due to be listed on October 27.
Analysts hoped that the listing of Japan Tobacco would revitalise stock
market activity, although some institutional investors were less
enthusiastic, while brokers remarked that few foreign investors seemed to be
interested in the issue at all.
The main advancing sectors were airlines, steels, non-life insurance, banks
and communications.
Steel shares were firmer on small-lot buying: Kobe Steel, which attracted
the day's second highest volume, appreciated Y6 to Y320, while NKK added Y3
at Y285, Kawasaki Steel Y4 at Y418 and Nippon Steel Y1 at Y372.
Chemicals issues rose on overseas buying and expectations of increasing
demand for the products. Ube Industries gained Y12 at Y419 and Sumitomo
Chemical Y4 at Y554.
Roundup
Elections, or the prospect of them, weighed on New Zealand and Sri Lanka,
while other markets in the region awaited today's US FOMC meeting.
WELLINGTON held on to its morning gains to close 1.24 per cent up as the
market celebrated the government's by-election victory on Saturday. The
NZSE-40 index put on 25.7 at 2,097.64, just under the day's peak of
2,102.41.
With the election out of the way, analysts now expect shares to rally in the
coming months, but they add that the continuing political uncertainty, and
the change to a proportional representation voting system, could hinder
progress.
Telecom rose 10 cents to NZDollars 5.00, but Goodman Fielder fell 9 cents to
NZDollars 1.66 after the US-based food group Phillip Morris announced that
it had no plans to buy Goodman.
COLOMBO ended marginally lower as investors awaited today's general
election. The all-share index shed 2.73 to 1,015.03 in turnover of SLRs100m,
against Friday's SLRs124m.
Trading is to be restricted today to one 90-minute session.
SYDNEY was slightly firmer as investors braced themselves for a rise in
official interest rates. The All Ordinaries index edged up 3.8 to 2,055.7 in
modest turnover of 121.8m shares. BHP put on 10 cents at ADollars 19.44.
HONG KONG saw low activity as investors awaited half-year results from HSBC
Holdings, which were released after the close of business. The Hang Seng
index was up 21.57 at 9,488.57 after touching 9,544.47. Turnover fell to
HKDollars 2.18bn from Friday's HKDollars 3.35bn.
HSBC, which ended 50 cents firmer at HKDollars 92, reported a 24 per cent
increase in half-year pre-tax profits, at the upper end of analysts'
expectations.
The H share index, made up of Chinese incorporated companies, went against
the trend, falling 15.22 to 1,336.89.
BANGKOK rallied in heavy trade on institutional buying of blue chips. The
SET index rose 27.92, nearly 2 per cent, to 1,453.41 in Bt13.5bn turnover.
Some analysts reported that institutional interest had been spurred by good
second-quarter results, particularly from the communications sector.
Shinawatra jumped Bt48 to Bt768 after revealing a 91 per cent leap in
first-half profits to Bt1.21bn.
KUALA LUMPUR dipped on profit-taking, the composite index shedding 12.49 to
1,092.80. Volume shrank to 267m shares from 556m. Falls led rises by 296 to
140.
Linatex moved ahead MDollars 1.40 to MDollars 15.90 after the Securities
Commission approved its purchase of two banks and a securities firm.
SINGAPORE fell back as profit-taking in over-the-counter stocks spilled over
into the broader market.
The Straits Times Industrial index closed 16.04 down at 2,301.75 in turnover
of SDollars 518m.
Brokers said that OTC shares, which mainly comprise Malaysian companies, had
led the market higher in recent sessions and were pulled back following
losses yesterday on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange.
Among the main movers, Singapore Press Holdings lost 40 cents at SDollars
16.60.
TAIPEI weakened on a late round of selling which eroded earlier gains. The
weighted index fell 20.34 to 6,543.57, off an intraday high of 6,614.11.
Turnover was TDollars 50.76bn.
KARACHI finished lower in thin, cautious trading ahead of today's settlement
day. The KSE index fell 27.16 to 2,271.25, a loss of 1.2 per cent.
MANILA ended 1.41 down at 3,005 after profit-taking cut short an early
climb.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Exchanges wait for Fed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchanges yesterday traded in a fairly narrow range ahead of today's
meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee which will decide on US
interest rate policy, writes Philip Gawith.
Traders were reluctant to take positions with both the FOMC meeting, and the
Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday, holding out the possibility of rate
changes.
Most European markets were closed for the Assumption Day holiday, and this
put a dampener on activity.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.5533, from DM1.5557 on Friday, and at
Y100.265 from Y99.99. It finished in New York at DM1.5521 and Y100.13.
In Europe, the D-Mark retained its recent strength, although the Italian
lira and Swedish krona managed to recoup some of their losses of last week.
The pound suffered at the hands of the stronger D-Mark and the trade
weighted sterling index ended at 78.8 from 79.1.
The New Zealand dollar firmed after the ruling National party's weekend
victory in holding on to the closely contested Selwyn by-election seat. It
finished at Dollars 0.6041 from Dollars 0.6007.
The market consensus has now shifted firmly towards asking not whether the
Fed will tighten, but by how much. Opinion is split as to whether the
Federal Funds rate will be increased, from 4.25 per cent, by 25 or 50 basis
points.
Whichever route the Fed takes, it is not clear that the dollar will profit.
The market does not appear yet to have shaken off the bearish psychology
that attaches to the US currency. Higher rates thus seem more likely to
upset the US bond market, with the dollar falling in sympathy, than to
attract funds into dollar deposits, helping the currency.
The spectre of political weakness also hangs over the dollar following
President Clinton's setback last week when the House blocked a key piece of
domestic legislation on crime.
So far this year the dollar has failed conspicuously to profit from four
previous rounds of monetary tightening. Some analysts argue that sentiment
will turn when US and German short-term rates cross - the gap is currently
about 60 basis points in Germany's favour.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said that while
most policy moves under Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve,
had been in 25 basis-point increments, there was sufficient evidence to
allow a larger move.
Although underlying CPI and PPI remain subdued, Mr Greenspan has called into
question the utility of such figures as advance indicators of inflation. He
told a House Committee recently that once 'price indexes reveal that
inflation is on the upswing, many imbalances that are costly to rectify have
developed already'.
He suggested that information from financial and commodity markets could
serve better as a leading indicator. July industrial production and capacity
utilisation figures released yesterday had little market impact.
While market consensus towards the dollar is clearly more bearish than
earlier in the year, some analysts are still calling its recovery. Mr Mike
Norman, publisher of the Geneva-based Economic Contrarian Update, said the
US currency was oversold and he was advising his clients to buy the dollar
during the current dip against European currencies. He is forecasting for
the dollar to reach DM1.75 by the end of the year, and Y110-113.
With most Continental exchanges closed, trading of European currencies was
quiet following the turmoil sparked off last Thursday by rises in Swedish
and Italian rates. The lira closed at L1,024 against the D-Mark, from
L1,026, while the krona finished at SKr4.985 compared to SKr5.008.
Mr MacKinnon of Citibank said the weekend rapprochement between Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, and Mr Umberto Bossi, his Northern
league ally, had provided the lira with only temporary relief.
'Investors feel that the Berlusconi administration has a very limited shelf
life. They are not convinced the government intends to do anything serious
to address the budget deficit,' he commented. 'The lira remains friendless
and it would be a brave soul who regarded current levels as a buying
opportunity.'
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 200m assistance
after forecasting a similar size shortage. Overnight money traded between 4
and 4 3/4 per cent. In the cash market, rates were up slightly, with
sterling three-month LIBOR at 5 per cent.
In Germany, call money was unchanged at 4.90/5 per cent ahead of Thursday's
Bundesbank council meeting. There is speculation about whether official
rates will be cut, and whether the central bank will set another fixed rate
repo, or revert to a variable rate tender.
The interest rate futures markets were very quiet. The December short
sterling contract saw less than 10,000 lots dealt and ended at 93.19 from
93.23. The Euromark contract traded under 13,000 lots to close at 94.82 from
94.80.

FT  16 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Hang Seng Bank interim
results below expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hang Seng Bank, the Hong Kong subsidiary of the Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation, lifted net profits by 13.2 per cent to HKDollars 3.1bn
(USDollars 401m) for the first half of 1994 from HKDollars 2.7bn in the same
period last year, but the result was below expectations.
Operating profits were squeezed by the narrowing of the spread between the
best lending rate and the savings deposit rate; the elimination of exchange
gains on Hong Kong dollar notes (following the change of the settlement
currency to Hong Kong dollars in January); and the reversal in the latter
half of last year of an over-provision relating to the accrued liabilities
of the staff retirement benefit schemes.
Sir Quo-Wei Lee, chairman, said: 'Competition for deposits remained intense,
in particular Hong Kong dollar wholesale deposits, and the interest margin
was under pressure. In such an operating environment, Hang Seng's result for
the first half of 1994 was satisfactory.'
The market had been looking for growth in excess of 15 per cent, but
disappointment in results from the banking sector had already been signalled
by Bank of East Asia, Hong Kong's third biggest listed bank, which last
month reported a 12 per cent improvement at the interim stage.
Standard Chartered, the UK-based international bank which is one of Hong
Kong's three note issuing banks, added to the gloom in the colony's banking
sector last week when it reported a drop in profits from Hong Kong, to
Pounds 108m (USDollars 167.40m) from Pounds 122m.
Hang Seng said government measures to cool property prices, announced in
June but signalled in March, had already fed through to a slowdown in
mortgage lending.
The bank is paying an interim dividend of HKDollars 0.60, up 20 per cent on
the HKDollars 0.50 paid out last year at the interim stage.
However, directors were quick to warn that this should not be construed as
an indication of the profit trend in the second half, but rather as a
symptom of Hang Seng's strong capital base, reflected in its 27.8 per cent
risk asset ratio. Earnings per share stand at HKDollars 1.61, up from
HKDollars 1.42 in the first half of 1993.
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts were slashed to HKDollars 43.8m,
compared with HKDollars 72.3m in the same period last year.

FT  16 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Emerging market debt trading
volume more than doubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading volume in emerging market debt reached almost Dollars 2,000bn in
1993, more than twice the volume recorded in the previous year, according to
a survey by the Emerging Markets Traders Association.
Growth was concentrated in the market for Brady bonds (LDC bank loans
repackaged as bonds). Trading in these bonds in 1993 increased fourfold to
Dollars 1,000bn, representing about 52 per cent of market volume, up from 34
per cent in 1992.
Trading in secondary market loans reached Dollars 273bn in 1993, up from
Dollars 229bn, marking a decrease in market share from 31 per cent to 14 per
cent.
'Investors in 1993 responded to opportunities created by the completion of
Argentina's Brady deal, progress toward debt restructuring in Brazil and
other nations, widespread economic and political reform throughout Latin
America and in Russia and Eastern Europe, the North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta), as well as low US interest rates,' said Mr Alexis
Rodzianko, chairman of the EMTA.
However, the rise in US interest rates in February sparked a sell-off in
debt markets, which severely undermined confidence in emerging markets. As a
result, the same sort of growth rate is unlikely to be achieved this year.
Volume in emerging market derivative instruments rose by nearly 275 per cent
last year, as trading in debt options grew from Dollars 15bn to Dollars
57bn.
The survey also showed that the debt instruments have become more
geographically diverse, as traders and investors searched for the next
market likely to offer the sort of gains realised in Latin American debt in
the early 1990s.
Consequently, Russia and Eastern European debt trading rose to Dollars 86bn,
or 4.4 per cent of the market, from Dollars 26bn. Africa's share also rose
to 4 per cent (12 countries) from 2.8 per cent (six countries) with trading
volume up 300 per cent to Dollars 79bn.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries soften ahead of Fed meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bond prices softened in light trading yesterday as the market
braced itself for a move by the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest
rates.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/32 lower
at 99 13/32 , with the yield rising to 7.504 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 99 3/4 , to yield 6.244 per cent.
With the Fed set to convene its policy-making session today, traders were
convinced a rate increase was inevitable.
Last week's data on inflation and retail sales, coupled with the continued
strength of the employment market, provided ample evidence for the central
bank to tighten credit conditions for the fifth time this year, according to
most analysts. Yesterday's economic news did nothing to undermine that view.
The Fed announced a 0.2 per cent increase in industrial production last
month, while capacity utilisation - an important barometer of incipient
price pressures - held steady at 83.9 per cent.
While the July figures represented a slowdown, the data were still well
above a level which would suggest the economy had shifted into low gear.
Still, the reaction was muted, as a rate increase appeared to be already
priced into Treasury bonds. Prices dipped on the news, edged back just
before mid-day and receded again during the late afternoon.
The only outstanding question was whether the bank would lift the Federal
Funds rate by 25 or 50 basis points.
A more aggressive move could prove to be a positive development for the
inflation-sensitive long end of the maturity range.
Analysts said a 50-point increase would demonstrate the central bank's
vigilance against inflation. In addition, it would not leave the market
wondering if yet another small rate increase was just around the corner.
Still, most analysts were expecting the Fed to strike the more cautious
course. 'There is still too much uncertainty regarding the economy's
performance for the Fed to firm by more than 25 points,' said Mr Elliot
Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the New York securities house.
The public holiday in many parts of Europe crippled trading in the
government bond markets which were open for business yesterday.
However, dealers are preparing themselves for a sudden increase in activity
in the event of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates today.
'This is an important week for bond markets despite the deceptively quiet
atmosphere,' said Ms Wendy Niffikeer of IBJ International.
The market is also waiting for guidance from the Bundesbank, which is due to
resume its fortnightly council meetings on Thursday after the four-week
summer break. The scheduled run of four fixed-rate repos, set at 4.85 per
cent, comes to an end this week.
Ms Niffikeer said the market's attention had shifted away from a rate cut in
Germany, following last week's rises in Italy and Sweden.
Nevertheless, she believed a decision to keep the repo fixed at 4.85 per
cent would be damaging to an already fragile market. 'Any cut in the repo
would be favourable,' she said.
The market is clearly divided about the Bundesbank's intentions. Ms Alison
Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Markets, believes the
gap of 35 basis points between the repo and the discount rates, although
wide in theory, may be too tight to allow the Bundesbank to return to its
preferred variable repo rate.
'In the absence of an official rate cut, do not expect the repo rate to look
too dissimilar to 4.85 per cent - whether fixed or variable,' she advises.
Mr Holger Fahrinkrug of UBS in Frankfurt says a return to variable repos
should be seen as confirmation that the Bundesbank sees scope for a further
discount rate cut.
Activity in both cash and futures markets was quiet yesterday. On Liffe, the
September bund future was virtually unchanged at 91.57 with 56,338 contracts
traded. The September long gilt future rose  1/16 to 100 3/4 .
The Bank of England said two tranches of index-linked bonds totalling Pounds
200m were exhausted yesterday. Dealers estimated that as much as 90 per cent
of the Pounds 500m of outstanding taps was still unsold.

Amid growing investor interest in commodities, Merrill Lynch is to issue 5m
call warrants this week on its new Energy and Metals Index, which it
launched in late July.
The pricing for the European-style warrants will be decided on Thursday, but
under current conditions the strike price would be Dollars 83.60, the

The warrants are targeted at both fixed-income and equity fund managers

<TEXT>
Amid growing investor interest in commodities, Merrill Lynch is due to issue
5m call warrants this week on its new Energy and Metals Index (ENMET), which
it launched in late July.
The pricing for the European-style warrants will be decided on Thursday, but
under current conditions the strike price would be Dollars 83.60, the
index's spot value yesterday, with an issue price of Dollars 5.62 per
warrant.
The warrants are targeted at both fixed-income and equity fund managers
seeking a diversification tool or a way to hedge their real rate of returns,
said Merrill Lynch.
Commodities have become increasingly popular, due in part to improved
fundamentals in key commodity markets, the poor performance of other asset
classes - especially fixed income, their positive correlation to broad
inflation indices and their negative correlation to stocks and bonds.
ENMET includes six commodities grouped in three sectors: energy (West Texas
Intermediate crude oil, natural gas), precious metals (gold, silver) and
base metals (aluminium, copper), and is based on the nearest traded futures
contracts.
In two weeks, Merrill Lynch also plans to issue two short-term structured
notes linked to the index.

FT  16 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Traders count cost of Confederation
Life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With little other activity to distract them, those traders and investors who
were at their desks yesterday were busy trying to analyse their position
with regard to bonds issued by Confederation Life, the Canadian insurance
company placed in the hands of government regulators last week.
Market-makers are no longer making prices in bonds issued by Confederation
Life and its subsidiaries, given the uncertainty surrounding their value.
Bonds issued by other Canadian insurance companies have also been hit, with
prices marked down by up to 4 points, although most traders were not bidding
for paper.
'Confederation Life's fate has made people more nervous about the (Canadian
insurance) sector generally, and investors have been looking for bids,' said
one market-maker, adding that few bids have been forthcoming.
He also said that his firm had received a number of enquiries from vulture
funds, looking to see how cheaply they could pick up paper, but there had
been little sign of any buying.
According to dealers, the Confederation Life group has three deals
outstanding in the sterling bond market: Confederation Treasury Services,
guaranteed by Confederation Life, has a Pounds 100m issue of 9 1/2 per cent
notes due 1997, arranged by SG Warburg, and Confederation Life has a Pounds
100m issue of subordinated bonds due 2003, arranged by Barclays de Zoete
Wedd. In addition, Confederation UK Holdings has a Pounds 50m deal due 2004
arranged by SG Warburg.
In the Canadian dollar sector, Confederation Treasury Series, guaranteed by
Confederation Life, has a CDollars 100m issue due 1997.
The subordinated bonds are the weakest credit, as they will rank below other
types of debt when any pay-out is made.
Until August 8, the senior bonds were rated A by Standard &amp; Poor's, the
credit rating agency. They were then downgraded to BBB and on Friday dropped
to D, which means interest payments are in default or jeopardised.
Meanwhile, the primary eurobond market ground to a halt yesterday, with
large parts of Europe closed for the Assumption Day holiday.
Moreover, the few remaining market participants were lying low ahead of
today's meeting of the US Federal Open Market Committee. 'Although the
market has largely priced in a rate hike, no one wants to anything before
the meeting,' said one syndicate manager.
All this, and the general summer apathy, should keep the flow of new issues
to a minimum, traders said, with only a handful of small deals expected in
some sectors, such as Canadian dollars and Japanese yen.

ABN-Amro hopes to double the size of its derivatives operations by 1998,
Reuter reports from Amsterdam.
'Derivatives will be the growth engine for the investment bank in the coming
years,' said Mr Dolf van den Brink, the bank's head of treasury and fixed
income.
The bank, the biggest in the Netherlands, aims to double its front office
staff to at least 200 people over the next four years as it builds up its
foreign derivatives operations.
Derivatives are a capital and risk-management intensive business and
ABN-Amro intends to keep control firmly in Amsterdam. However, most of the
expansion will take place abroad as it builds up derivatives capacity in
Chicago, London, Hong Kong and Singapore.
Longer term, the aim is to use these centres as hubs to grow fully-fledged
derivative operations in a wider range of the countries where it is active,
Mr van den Brink said.

FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Bell Atlantic to post loss after
charges of Dollars 2.3bn

<TEXT>
Bell Atlantic, the US regional telecommunications group, said yesterday it
would take after-tax charges of Dollars 2.3bn in the third quarter to cover
a write-down in equipment values and a cut in the workforce. The charges
mean the group will report a loss for both the quarter and the year.
Most of the charges relate to the revaluation of the old copper-wire
telephone network that the group is currently replacing with a digital
network able to carry voice, data and video services.
Another Dollars 100m of the charges will cover the cost of reducing Bell
Atlantic's workforce by 5,600 over the next three years (a quarter of the
cuts will come from management positions), while a further charge of Dollars
35m to Dollars 45m will go towards funding the group's withdrawal from
several non-strategic businesses.
Bell Atlantic is the latest of the 'Baby Bell' regional phone companies to
take a big charge to pay for cost-cutting. Earlier this year New York-based
Nynex took a Dollars 1.6bn charge and announced plans to cut its workforce
by 16,800. Before that, BellSouth and US West both unveiled similar
restructurings.
The Baby Bells are slimming in preparation for competition in their local
telephone markets and for the development of new businesses such as
delivering interactive video, entertainment and information services to
customers homes via the phone companies' telecommunications lines.
Although the interactive business is still in its infancy, the regional
phone groups are scrambling to forge alliances with entertainment providers.
Bell Atlantic and two other Baby Bells - Nynex and Pacific Telesis - are
said to be discussing plans with Creative Artists Agency, the Hollywood
talent agency headed by Mr Michael Ovitz, to create a joint venture to
deliver entertainment programming to consumers homes. According to the
Hollywood newspaper Variety, the venture with CAA would be similar to the
recently-announced alliance between three other Baby Bells and the Walt
Disney group.
Bell Atlantic's shares fell Dollars  3/4 to close at Dollars 56 3/4 on the
New York Stock Exchange yesterday.

Weak demand in its international stores held back the pace of profits growth
to 7 per cent at Toys R Us, the US toy retailer, in the second quarter to
July.
Net earnings rose from Dollars 35.5m in the comparable period to Dollars 38m
on turnover up by 10 per cent to Dollars 1.45bn from Dollars 1.32bn.
Earnings per share, boosted by the company's share repurchase programme,
rose by 8 per cent to 13 cents from 12 cents.
Mr Michael Goldstein, chief executive, said US toy stores achieved sales
growth of 2.2 per cent for the quarter on a store-for-store basis, with
strong increases in basic toy merchandise.
By contrast, the international toy stores continued to suffer from local
economic conditions and reported sales decreases on a store-for-store basis,
except in Canada.
For the first six months, sales were 12 per cent ahead at Dollars 2.91bn
while net profits were 7 per cent up at Dollars 75.6m, and earnings per
share were 8 per cent ahead at 26 cents.
Mr Goldstein said the company planned to open about 40 toy stores in the US
and 60 internationally this year.

(USDollars 206m), a 14 per cent rise on the corresponding period last year.
DBS said group net interest income was SDollars 332m, a rise of 22 per cent.
It said the increase was due to improved net interest margins and an
expansion of its loan base.
The bank reported a 47 per cent increase in income on fees and commissions
to SDollars 124m, mainly due to higher income from merchant banking and
investment banking.
Per share earnings rose from 61 Singapore cents to 71 cents. over the

The dividend is unchanged at 8 cents.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Viacom, the entertainment group, reported a sharp rise in second-quarter net
earnings to Dollars 221.7m on the back of strong growth at MTV, the music
television channel, and a first contribution from Paramount Communications.
The results, which compare with net earnings of Dollars 41.6m in the second
quarter last year, include a Dollars 267m pre-tax profit on the sale of
Viacom's stake in Lifetime Television.
The rise in group revenues to Dollars 1.7bn from Dollars 496m was helped by
a 21 per cent leap in revenues to Dollars 198.3m at MTV Networks, which
includes the MTV channel.
MTV benefited from growth in advertising and in payments from television
stations. However, revenues at Viacom Entertainment, the television
production and distribution arm, fell by 15 per cent to Dollars 34.4m
following a fall in re-run fees from television stations for The Cosby Show,
the long-running sit-com.
The second-quarter results reflect the 50.2 per cent stake in Paramount held
during the quarter, and are not directly comparable with previous results.
The figures include revenues of Dollars 1.2bn and pre-tax earnings of
Dollars 105m from Paramount. Viacom's long-running struggle to take over
Paramount was formally completed on July 7, and the third-quarter results
will fully consolidate the acquisition.
Second-quarter earnings per share amounted to Dollars 1.44 against Dollars
0.35 in the same period last year. However, the group declared a net loss of
Dollars 232.4m for the six months, Dollars 1.72 a share, compared with net
earnings of Dollars 122.6m, or Dollars 1.02, in the first half of 1993.
John Labatt, the Canadian brewing group confirmed it had not made a bid for
Madison Square Garden, owned by Viacom.
'We examined MSG in great detail and determined not to submit a bid,' said
Mr George Taylor, Labatt president and chief executive.

<TEXT>
Impala Platinum Holdings, the world's second largest platinum mining
company, has reported a 15 per cent drop in attributable earnings to R170m
(Dollars 47.4m) for the year ended June, down from R210m the previous year.
The drop was largely due to the weak international rhodium price.
Although platinum revenue rose to R1.44bn from R1.23bn and palladium sales
increased to R202m from R144m, this was largely due to a 15 per cent
depreciation in the rand and improved metals prices. Overall production of
both metals declined, with platinum dropping to 1.05m ozs from 1.1m ozs a
year ago and palladium to 472,000 ozs from 500,000 ozs.
But a steep drop in the price of rhodium led to a fall in earnings to R285m
on sales of 91,000 ozs, from R564m on sales of 95,000 ozs last time.
Capital expenditure increased 27 per cent to R199m from R157m, and the
company has continued to improve its cash position, currently at a net
positive R21m.

Cascades, the Canadian-based international paper and packaging group, posted
second-quarter net profit of CDollars 2.5m (USDollars 1.8m), or 1 cent a
share, against a loss of CDollars 1.9m, or 7 cents, a year earlier.
Sales were CDollars 394m, against CDollars 416m. The figures reflect the
sale of part of Cascades Paperboard International and the shutdown of the
Duffel boardmill in Belgium.
Most of the Cascades group's packaging interests in North America and Europe
are part of majority-held Cascades Paperboard International.
First-half profit for Cascades amounted to CDollars 7.7m, or 7 cents a
share, against a net loss of CDollars 1.1m, or 8 cents. Sales were CDollars
759m, down from CDollars 835m, a fall of 9 per cent.
Mr Laurent Lemaire, president, said the company would contest a fine of
CDollars 28m imposed on its Paris-based holding company, Cascades SA,
following a European competition commissioners' finding against the European
paperboard industry. The commission alleges price-fixing.

climbs 14% as loan base grows

<TEXT>
Development Bank of Singapore (DBS), the island republic's largest bank, has
announced pre-tax profits for the six months to end-June of SDollars 311m
(USDollars 206m), a 14 per cent rise on the corresponding period last year.
DBS said that group net interest income was SDollars 332m, a rise of 22 per
cent. The bank said the increase was due to improved net interest margins
and an expansion of the bank loan base.
DBS reported a 47 per cent increase in income on fees and commissions to
SDollars 124m, mainly due to higher income from merchant banking and
investment banking.
However, the bank reported a sharp drop in other income, including that from
securities trading, from SDollars 85m in the first six months of last year
to SDollars 46m in the period to June. Activity on the Singapore stock
market has declined significantly over the last five months.
DBS made provisions against bad loans of SDollars 58m compared with SDollars
54m in the previous equivalent period.
Per share earnings rose from 61 Singapore cents to 71 cents over the period
while the dividend was unchanged at 8 cents.
Overseas Union Bank (OUB), another of Singapore's main banking groups, has
reported pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 of SDollars 144m, a
rise of more than 50 per cent.
Tat Lee Bank, a smaller Singapore institution, reported pre-tax profits for
the same period up 69 per cent to SDollars 46m.
DBS, OUB, the United Overseas Bank (UOB) and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp
(OCBC) are Singapore's four main banks. Last week UOB and OCBC reported
pre-tax profits up 34 per cent and 26 per cent respectively.
In spite of the healthy earnings picture, analysts say that profit margins
are unlikely to continue at the present high level. In particular, they say
higher interest rates are likely to curtail demand for housing loans, one of
the most profitable areas of Singapore banking activity.

FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Kmart plans shake-up after 25%
profit dip
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK

<TEXT>
Kmart, the troubled US discount store group, yesterday reported a 25 per
cent fall in earnings for the second quarter and said it was close to
announcing plans for a big restructuring.
The plans, expected to be announced in the next 30 days, will include fresh
proposals for the future of the group's specialty retailing operations and
may also embrace a strategy to restore profitable growth to its ailing
discount store business.
At the beginning of June, dissident institutional investors delivered a
humiliating blow to Kmart's management by voting down its plans to create
new shares tied to the performance of the specialty retailing subsidiaries.
Kmart had planned to sell up to 30 per cent of these shares and use the
proceeds to help fund the refurbishment of its ageing discount stores.
Investors rejected the plans because they believed Kmart should sell the
specialty retailing business outright and devote its energies to
revitalising the discount stores, which are losing customers to Kmart's
bigger and more successful rival, Wal-Mart Stores.
Yesterday the continuing difficulties of the discount stores were
illustrated when Kmart reported a decline in group profits from the already
depressed level of Dollars 125m in the comparable period to Dollars 94m in
the quarter to July, excluding the discontinued PACE Membership Warehouse
and PayLess Drug Store businesses.
However, the figures were not as bad as the market had expected, and the
shares edged up Dollars  1/8 to close at Dollars 17 1/8 .
Sales were up 4.6 per cent at Dollars 8.83bn but earnings per share on
continuing operations were down from 27 cents to 20 cents.
For the first six months, sales rose 5.4 per cent to Dollars 16.64bn, net
income fell from Dollars 183m to Dollars 112m excluding discontinued
operations and exceptional items, and earnings per share fell from 39 cents
to 24 cents on the same basis.
Mr Joseph Antonini said: 'Performance in our core US Kmart division is below
our expectations.'
The gross margin for the quarter fell from 25.2 per cent to 24.8 per cent,
mainly because sales were lower than expected on fixed occupancy costs and
because lower margin grocery products took a higher proportion of sales from
the new Super Kmart Centers.
Mr Antonini said 'aggressive actions' were being taken to improve sales and
profitability for the rest of the year.

FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Homestake Mining silences its
critics - The rapid recovery of North America's oldest gold producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How quickly times have changed for Homestake Mining, North America's oldest
gold mining group. Today, some analysts wonder whether it will spend wisely
the money it is earning or borrowing. Two years ago, some of the same
analysts worried about its losses and its debts.
At that time, Homestake refused to follow the example of most Australian and
North American precious metals groups and hedge its production, in spite of
a steadily falling gold price and even though selling its gold at the spot
market price was barely profitable.
Homestake merged with Corona, a Canadian gold group, in July 1992. This made
it one of the world's biggest gold producers - with operations in Australia,
Chile and Mexico as well as North America - but Corona brought with it a big
burden of debt.
Corona was a relative newcomer to the gold scene, run by speculators.
Critics of the merger said there was no way the corporate cultures would
mix. They predicted disaster.
Mr Harry Conger, Home-stake's chairman, can be forgiven for smiling when he
says results from the Corona merger are better than expected. Corona had
more debt than it could afford. Homestake's production costs were too high.
But putting them together enabled Homestake to absorb Corona's USDollars
227m of long-term debt and have relatively modest gearing.
Mr Conger emphasises the merger did not bring the Corona management style
with it. 'Corona had two management styles, one at board level, one at the
operating level. We brought in only operating people.'
For example, Corona hedged a great deal of its production but Homestake
sticks firmly to the view that its shareholders do not want it to hedge.
However, as half Homestake's gold is sold outside the US, Mr Conger believes
it is reasonable to protect the company by hedging against severe swings by
Canadian and Australian dollars against the US currency.
One big benefit from the merger was that it brought Homestake the services
of Mr Peter Steen and his team from Corona. They brought with them 'new
eyes, new approaches' that have helped to turnround Homestake's fortunes.
Even at the 150-year-old Homestake mine in the Black Hills of Dakota, where
they have gone down 8,000 feet to dig out the gold, the new approach is
working. Mr Conger is devoted to the mine but he would not tolerate losses
for ever.
Mr Steen closed some of the marginal areas. The workforce was reduced to
less than 1,000 from 1,400 five years ago but output increased. In 1992, the
Homestake mine produced 397,000 troy ounces of gold at a full cost of
Dollars 337 an ounce. Last year it produced 448,000 ounces at Dollars 288 an
ounce.
'Homestake is still the company's biggest single gold producer and gives the
biggest operating profit,' Mr Conger points out.
The Homestake group's costs have come down. Last year's 1.9m ounces were
produced at a cost of Dollars 282 an ounce, down from Dollars 303 in 1992.
Cost-cutting and a gold price rise put Homestake back into the black in
1993. Net income was Dollars 52.5m against a Dollars 175.8m loss in 1992 and
a loss of Dollars 261.9m for 1991.
Group management has been restructured and simplified. The gap left by Mr
Steen's recent departure at short notice to become president of Lac
Minerals, the beleaguered Canadian mining group, was quickly plugged. Mr
Jack Thompson was appointed president of Homestake and, meanwhile, Mr Conger
at last set a date for his retirement - early in 1996.
Now, he says, the most important task for Homestake is to add new long-life
gold reserves with lower total costs than present production.
Although Homestake is relying on exploration success to secure its long-term
future, it has sacked geologists, closed exploration offices and cut the
budget.
Homestake previously spent about Dollars 30m a year and Corona Dollars 6m on
exploration. But Mr Conger admits Homestake has not been particularly
successful since finding the McLaughlin mine in California in the late
1970s. So the approach has been changed. The combined exploration teams of
260 people have been reduced to 120 and, instead of having several site
offices, there is a centralised exploration team in Reno, Nevada. The budget
has been cut to Dollars 15m in North America and Dollars 3m in Australia.
'The idea is that, when prospects are identified, promising projects will
get extra money,' says Mr Conger.
Homestake just might have struck lucky again at its Eureka property in
Nevada. Preliminary drilling indicates there is gold along a 37-mile strike
and some tests show very high grades.
Homestake expects to have its Eskay Creek polymetallic mine in British
Columbia in production by the end of 1994 to produce about 210,000 ounces of
gold and 9.4m ounces of silver annually for 10 years. Corona was involved in
a bidding war for Eskay and in 1991 and 1992 wrote off Dollars 176m on the
project. Homestake has had better luck. The capital cost of bringing Eskay
into production has been cut by Dollars 150m to Dollars 60m because it has
been found the ore can be sent directly to smelters for processing rather
than being upgraded into a concentrate (an intermediate material) at the
mine site.
Mr Gene Elam, Homestake's chief financial officer, says the group has
Dollars 200m cash and a line of credit for Dollars 150m. Total debt is
Dollars 185m but there are no debt repayments until 2000. The present gold
price provides Homestake with annual free cash flow of about Dollars 90m a
year, so it should soon be free of net debt.
The dividend has been doubled to 20 cents a share, a level shareholders have
not seen for several years.

<TEXT>
Bilspedition, Scandinavia's biggest freight-forwarding group, yesterday
announced plans to offer Dollars 50m worth of shares in its Atlantic
Container Line shipping unit to international investors. It also said it
would seeking a listing for the company on the Oslo Stock Exchange.
The moves are in line with the Swedish group's decision to pull out of
shipping to concentrate on its core transport, forwarding and logistics
businesses. It has been through a period of heavy restructuring after
suffering heavy losses from property and shipping in 1992, and sees the
recent improvement in ACL's performance and prospects as a good opportunity
to sell.
A total of 5m shares will be offered to investors in the US, UK and Norway
at between Dollars 9 and Dollars 11 each. Proceeds will be used to
strengthen the balance sheet of ACL which operates a roll-on roll-off
shipping service across the North Atlantic.
Mr Hakan Larsson, Bilspedition chief executive, said ACL had made its first
profit since the 1980s during the first half of 1994, helped by
cost-cutting, rising freight volumes and price rises. 'The market is now
stable and the economic climate is expected to continue to improve in both
Europe and the US over the next few years,' he stated.
Liner shipping on the North Atlantic has been plagued by overcapacity and
low rates in recent years, although the problems have been substantially
addressed by the formation of the Transatlantic Agreement, a collaborative
arrangement between many of the big operators on the route to promote price
stability.
Bilspedition, which had gross turnover of SKr30bn (Dollars 3.86bn) last
year, will retain a 17 per cent stake in ACL. Disposal of the rest of its
stake is expected to cut interest-bearing liabilities, which stood at
SKr5.46bn at the end of last year, by SKr735m.
The decision to list ACL in Oslo reflects the city's importance as a centre
of international shipping.
The issue is being promoted by Fearnley Fonds A/S.

<TEXT>
Charter, the UK industrial group, has declined to raise its stalled Pounds
260m (Dollars 400m) bid for Esab, the Swedish welding group, but extended
its original offer for two weeks to August 26 in the hope of a change of
mind by reluctant Esab shareholders.
The UK company said it had received acceptances at its offer price of SKr345
a share worth 53.1 per cent of the voting capital in Esab by last Friday's
initial deadline. With shares acquired in the market, Charter is assured of
57.3 per cent of the votes in Esab.
But the bid, recommended by the Esab board, is conditional on Charter
receiving 90 per cent acceptances and has been blocked by Swedish
institutional shareholders who say it is underpriced.
Since the bid was launched in late June, Esab has raised its earnings
forecast and its share price has risen as high as SKr365. The share price
has been kept high by the expectation that Charter will raise its offer.

FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Compaq Computer cuts PC prices
by up to 22%

<TEXT>
Compaq Computer has lowered US prices on a broad range of personal computer
products by up to 22 per cent in an attempt to gain market leadership.
Competitors are expected to follow suit, sparking a new round of price cuts.
Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq chief executive, aims to overtake IBM and Apple
Computer to make Compaq the world market leader in PCs by 1996. Compaq
already sells more PCs in the US than its competitors.
The price cuts come as the PC industry is entering its strongest buying
season, from September to December. Intel, the leading microprocessor
supplier to the PC industry, has aggressively reduced the prices of its
highest performance chips over the past few months.
Desktop PCs based on Intel's latest Pentium chips will be widely available
in the US for about Dollars 2,000 this Christmas, Intel predicts. The market
is growing as US consumers seek the latest multimedia PCs for home use.
Defying predictions of a slowdown in the PC market, US shipments increased
23 per cent in the second quarter, according to Dataquest, a market research
firm.
'Many industry insiders expected a slowdown in the second quarter, but
shipments continued to increase despite the fact that price cuts are
looming,' said Mr Philippe de Marcillac, principal analyst of Dataquest's PC
research group.
Compaq Computer outstripped all competitors in the US market in the first
half of the year, according to Dataquest. The company sold more than 1m PCs
for a 13.4 per cent market share.
Apple Computer took 10.8 per cent of the market, and Packard Bell 9.9 per
cent. IBM slipped to fourth place with 7.9 per cent of the US market,
measured in units sold.
With Compaq lowering its prices, it would be increasingly difficult for IBM
to catch up, analysts said.
However, IBM is overhauling its PC operations to become more competitive.
Apple Computer's new Power Macintosh products were selling more slowly than
expected, the Dataquest analysts said, but strong sales of the company's
laptop computers lifted unit shipments in the first half.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears of increased Russian NICKEL shipments arriving in London Metal
Exchange warehouses and re-deliveries of Russian metal taken out earlier by
Chinese operators helped undermine prices yesterday. Bearish chart patterns
also played a part as the LME three months price slipped Dollars 112.50 to
Dollars 5,677.50 a tonne.
COPPER traded at the lower end of its expected Dollars 2,400-Dollars 2,450
range throughout the day as prices struggled to overcome rising LME stock
levels, which is a normal occurrence during the slow summer period.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver market retreats to
seven-month lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Silver prices dropped in London yesterday to the lowest levels for nearly
seven months following a sharp plunge in New York late on Friday caused
mainly by heavy trade selling.
The silver price was 'fixed' in London at Dollars 5.05 a troy ounce, its
lowest since January 28. It was also nearly 3 per cent below Friday's 'fix'
and 12 per cent below this year's peak of Dollars 5.74 3/4 an ounce reached
on March 24. The price recovered slightly to close in London last night at
Dollars 5.06 1/2 , down 6 cents from Friday's close.
Dealers cited various technical factors for Friday's drop in the price for
September delivery on the New York Commodity Exchange. Silver's failure to
break through the technical resistance level at Dollars 5.20 an ounce had
disappointed some speculators, they said.
Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at Merrill Lynch, suggested that silver was more
likely to fall below Dollars 5 an ounce in coming months than rise to the
Dollars 6 some US hedge and commodity funds were said to be targeting
earlier this year. 'There are signs that the Swiss and the Arab syndicates
are begining to feel that a more aggressive short selling technique may pay

Precious Metals Report. The Swiss seemed to be aiming to drive down the
silver price first to Dollars 5.15, then to Dollars 5.07 and finally Dollars
4.95 an ounce. Mr Arnold forecast that in the next two or three months
silver would trade between Dollars 4.50 and Dollars 5.60 an ounce.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Conference seeks accord on high
seas fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fishing nations are being urged to sink their differences and agree an
international treaty governing catches on the high seas in an attempt to
halt serious over-fishing.
Over the next two weeks, a United Nations conference in New York will seek
common ground between coastal states, whose territorial waters contain 80
per cent of the world's fish, and distant-water fishing nations such as
Japan, Spain and Russia, which have large fleets operating on the high seas.
Tensions between these two groups have risen as stocks of valuable species
such as cod have dwindled.
The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation says the global fishing fleet
increased at twice the rate of the world marine catch between 1970 and 1990,
compounded by government subsidies worth some Dollars 54bn a year to fishing
fleets.
Stock losses have led some countries to halt or reduce fishing effort -
Iceland has cut back domestic fishing by 50 per cent.
The problem is exacerbated by unregulated fishing fleets flying flags of
convenience and subject to no country's rules.
Canada, one of the coastal states most concerned about the impact of high
seas fishing on the catch in its territorial waters, seized a foreign
fishing vessel outside its waters last April, saying the crew were 'modern
day pirates stealing Canada's cod and keeping 30,000 Canadian fishers out of
work'.
There is not yet any overall international regulation of the world's high
seas fisheries - those beyond coastal states' 200-mile exclusive economic
zones - although multinational agreements exist in certain regions. The
North West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, for example, is supposed to
cover high seas stocks off Canada.
The UN conference was initiated by the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and started
work last year to try to close these gaps in the 1982 UN Convention on the
Law of the Sea.
This month's meeting is scheduled to be the final session.
Fish do not obey artificial geographical limits and the 'highly migratory
and straddling' stocks covered by the conference are those species found
within two or more states' territorial waters or the adjacent high seas.
Cod off eastern Canada and pollack in the Bering Sea, for example, straddle
several countries' waters, while species such as tuna and swordfish migrate
over huge distances. Coastal states want a dominant role in regulating
fishing for these species, whereas the long-distance fishing nations are
seeking international regulation.
Mr Satya Nandan, the Fijian chairman of the conference, has drawn up
principles for a treaty, including provision for enforcement, compulsory and
binding settlement of disputes, and acceptance of scientific evidence on the
state of fish stocks as the basis of the agreement.
Some participating nations believe conflicting interests make agreement on
an all-embracing treaty unlikely. They suggest, however, that one important
loophole - Panama's issue of flags of convenience - may be closed if a
convention can be drawn up stating that countries may issue flags and
fishing rights only for their own territorial waters.
'It appears Panama would agree to co-operate,' said an official from a
European Union member state. In exchange, Panama would be offered tariff
concessions on fish exports to the EU.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Pig cycle
gets stuck in low gear - UK prices have now been below break-even levels for
12 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pig farming has always been a notoriously cyclical affair; but the present
down-swing in prices has been deeper and much longer than usual and is
causing severe pain in the sector.
A year ago this week the average ex-farm price for finished pigs was just
over 105p a kilogram deadweight. It had fallen sharply during the previous
six weeks to that level, which was generally recognised to be about the
break-even price on efficient farms. The decline continued through last
autumn and winter and although there was some recovery during the spring and
summer of this year the price consistently failed to reach the break-even
point.
Since then it has dropped back again, to 96.45p last week. Moreover the
average all pigs price (AAPP), calculated weekly by the Meat and Livestock
Commission from a mix of open market and contract deals, has failed to reach
a profitable level during the whole of the past 12 months.
We pig keepers are used to our charges being either 'copper or gold' as the
cycle of production and price revolves. But a full year of heavy losses is
an extreme situation and has resulted in many business failures. Just how
many pig producers have been forced out of business is not yet known but
there must now be significantly fewer of us than the 11,800 operating across
the UK in June 1993.
It is not just farmers who have lost money on pigs. Many abattoir operators
claim to have had similar problems and some have gone out of business. Some
of those that remain have had to cancel or modify minimum price contracts
half way through their term and still more have assessed the situation and
refused to continue with such contracts.
Feed companies too have reduced their exposure to the vagaries of the pig
market. In the past most major companies financed the breeding and feeding
of large batches of pigs, employing farmers as contractors and paying them a
share of the proceeds for the use of their buildings and labour. The system
locked in guaranteed feed business for the manufacturers and reduced capital
involvement for farmers while at the same time providing them with an
income. This kind of vertical integration was never popular with
traditionalists but it served its purpose for the parties involved.
Now, however, following substantial losses during the past 12 months, most
feed manufacturers are reducing their involvement in such schemes or pulling
out altogether.
The single major exception appears to be BOCM Pauls, which earlier this year
took over the 100,000-head-a-year Louis Dreyfus operation and is also
reported to have agreed to buy 6,000 sows from Unigate, which were farmed by
its Malton Bacon Factory subsidiary. BOCM Pauls is now thought to control
the production and marketing of some 1.5m pigs per year - about 10 per cent
of the UK total. The company is almost alone among major feed suppliers in
expressing its faith in the future of pig rearing.
The disillusionment of the others is hardly surprising. For while the
incomes of most other sectors of UK agriculture have been boosted by the
devaluation of sterling and associated increases in EU prices, pig farmers
have had virtually no such assistance. Indeed rises in the ex-farm price of
cereals increase the cost of pig feed, thereby raising further the
break-even point for pig production. The combination of currency devaluation
and a potential shortage of feed grain because of poor yields across Europe
has increased the price of feed grain by Pounds 12 to Pounds 15 a tonne
above expectations in the UK this harvest.
The problem is not confined to the UK but affects most of the main pig
producers of Europe. A few months ago, in response to the crisis, the French
government allocated special aid to its pig farmers, which was later judged
to be illegal under European Union law. In Germany a few days ago the
average pig price was similar to that in the UK at the equivalent of 97.5p a
kilogram deadweight and in Holland it was even lower at 89.7p. On the
reasonable assumption that production costs across the EU are similar, it
must also be assumed that pig farmers in those countries are losing
substantial amounts on every animal they produce.
However, better news may be just around the corner. At last, it seems, there
is a reduction in the number of pigs coming to market. Losses, which were at
their highest last November, led to a reduction in the number of sows kept
for breeding. The resulting cut in births, the MLC believes, is about to
feed through to the supply of finished pigs and this should boost prices.
Indeed spot, open market prices have already strengthened a little and this
could be the beginning of the recovery.
The MLC forecast some months ago that the AAPP would reach 100p a kilogram
deadweight by August and 110p by October. The August forecast cannot now be
achieved by the end of the month and in view of that the October prediction
now seems too optimistic. Even so a rise into profit does appear to be on
the cards in the relatively short term - and very welcome it will be too. If
MLC forecasts are to be believed, prices should hold above break-even levels
through the autumn and for at least the first half of 1995.
Goodness knows, after 12 months of losses, they need to. And I expect that,
unlike most feed companies, we on this farm will carry on farming pigs for
the time being. However, an exodus of big companies that have been committed
to pig rearing for many years is bound to make us wonder if we are right to
do so.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG gold mine back in operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea, one of the largest in the world
outside of South Africa and an important source of revenue for the PNG
government, resumed full production at the weekend.
Operations were halted on August 2 by an explosion at an explosives facility
near the mine which killed 11 people.
On Saturday Sir John Kaputin, PNG's Minister of Mining and Petroleum, gave
approval for full production after recommissioning processes last week
confirmed that the mine and plant were operating safely.
Placer Pacific, the project manager, says it will take several months to
repair the damage to the mine. Porgera produces nearly 1.5m troy ounces of
gold annually and, apart from collecting royalties, the government has a 25
per cent stake.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Inflation success translates into poll support for Cardoso:
Architect of Brazil's economic plan is now front runner in Brazil's October
presidential election race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outspoken governor of the Brazilian state of Amazonas, Mr Gilberto
Mestrinho, has no doubt who will be his country's next president, even
though he says he will vote for another candidate in the first round of the
election on October 3. 'Brazil's president is already chosen and it is
Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The trend in his favour is irreversible,' he
says.
For the first time last week, opinion polls confirmed a significant lead for
Mr Cardoso, the former finance minister who fathered the country's popular
anti-inflation plan. Two polls last week showed him seven points ahead of
his main rival, Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers' Party
(PT), with support for Mr Cardoso running at about 35 per cent of the
electorate.
If the gathering trend in favour of Mr Cardoso continues, a run-off ballot
on November 15 of the two leading candidates may be unnecessary. Mr Paulo
Calmon, a political scientist at the University of Brasilia, says: 'It's
possible that Cardoso could win in the first round.' To do this he must win
more votes than the other six candidates together.
If there is a second ballot, Mr Calmon and others think Mr Cardoso stands to
gain more votes from supporters of the most prominent losing candidates in
the first round, probably Mr Orestes Quercia of the Democratic Movement
party (PMDB) and Mr Leonel Brizola of the Democratic Workers party (PDT).
Mr Cardoso's gathering support is based mainly on a single issue: the
economic plan. In the six weeks after the introduction of the real, Brazil's
new currency, inflation has dropped sharply. After price rises of 50 per
cent in June, inflation fell to 6 per cent last month, and may be as low as
2 per cent this (though the forecast is highly uncertain). As a result, up
to 70 per cent of Brazilians say they favour the plan.
'The only platform in this election is the economic plan,' says Mr Bolvar
Lamounier, a Sao Paulo academic and supporter of Mr Cardoso. As a result, Mr
Cardoso is vulnerable to reverses in the plan's early successes. Reversals
could come from political pressure to raise the wages of the military and
federal workers - a subject that President Itamar Franco frequently raises -
or from a consumer boom.
However, with his support falling away, Mr da Silva, widely known by his
popular political name Lula, cannot sit back and hope the economic plan goes
awry. He has already been forced to tone down his attacks on it to avoid
accusations of being a friend of inflation. Instead, he has criticised it as
being too narrow in conception and for not addressing Brazil's deep social
ills - a so-far unsuccessful attempt to manoeuvre the campaign into areas
where political analysts agree Mr da Silva is strong.
He has also stepped up criticism of the alliances that Mr Cardoso has made
with the traditional power brokers of Brazilian politics such as Mr Antonio
Carlos Magalhaes who, from his base in the north-eastern state of Bahia,
controls the powerful right-wing Liberal party (PFL) which had strong links
with the pre-1985 military government.
Mr da Silva's campaign is drawing strong parallels between the two Fernandos
 -the disgraced former President Collor who beat him into second place in
1989 and Mr Cardoso. 'Collor is not a thing of the past, he's a reality of
the present. His friends are still there in the Cardoso campaign,' he told
foreign journalists in Sao Paulo at the weekend.
Yet, a negative campaign carries risks for the PT too. For one thing,
Brazilian voters have in the past not responded positively to such tactics.
And, says Mr Lamounier, 'if the PT starts throwing mud around, it's
potentially equally damaging for Lula'. For example, Mr da Silva may be
vulnerable if the Cardoso campaign emphasises his links to the fractious
parties of the extreme left in Brazil.
Many political analysts reckon Mr da Silva's only answer would be to start
building party alliances of his own. However, he is constrained by the
likely criticism he would receive from within his own party ranks for
practising traditional party politics.
From Mr Cardoso's point of view, his political alliances deliver important
campaign advantages. The amount of free television air time candidates have
 -they are together allowed one hour a day four days a week - are linked to
the number of supporters they have in the out-going congress. Mr Cardoso's
campaign broadcast takes up more than a quarter of an hour against Mr da
Silva's seven minutes. The alliances also deliver important backing in key
parts of the country.
Whether they will help Mr Cardoso should he come to office is another
matter. Most economists agree that any candidate would need to push through
important changes to the complex 1988 constitution to complete the fight
against inflation, and that will require large scale support in congress,
which also faces elections on October 3.
'Governability: that's what this campaign is all about,' say backers of Mr
Cardoso such as Mr Lamounier. 'I don't think the PT is in a position to
govern this country.' By contrast, he says, Mr Cardoso knows what must be
done and will have the strong initial power of the presidency to push
through necessary reform.
On the other hand, the PT argues that Mr Cardoso has bitten off more than he
can chew in building alliances with crafty machine politicians such as Mr
Magalhaes.
Some independent observers are sceptical too. Mr Jose Augusto Guilhon of the
University of Sao Paulo is not optimistic that the coalition built by Mr
Cardoso would stay together for long.

FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Huntingdon shares shed 9p after third
quarter decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Huntingdon International Holdings fell 9p to close at 65p after
the life sciences group announced a drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds
10.1m to Pounds 3.34m in the nine months to end-June. Revenue, net of
subcontracts, fell from Pounds 115.6m to Pounds 109.2m.
For the three months to June 30, the fall was from Pounds 4.32m to Pounds
774,000 on revenues of Pounds 35.7m (Pounds 38.7m).
Mr Ian Campbell, chairman, said the nine-month results were disappointing.
Although current trading was stronger in all operating groups, he said it
was unlikely there would be an overall improvement in the fourth quarter.
In May, the group said it would concentrate on its life sciences business
and Mr Campbell said yesterday that discussions were under way with
potential purchasers for both its US engineering and environmental services
business and for Travers Morgan, its UK-based consultancy.
For the nine months there were losses of Pounds 299,000 (Pounds 2.77m
profits) from US engineering while Travers Morgan contributed just Pounds
183,000 (Pounds 1.89m).
Life sciences slipped to Pounds 5.83m (Pounds 6.6m) as a result of price
competition, lower-than-anticipated throughput and increased unit costs.
However, the installation of new equipment had been speeded up at Huntingdon
Research Centre and additional staff recruited. Also, both forward orders
and quotations were now 13 per cent ahead of last year with orders from
Japan and the US considerably higher.
Mr Campbell added that having initiated a 'comprehensive restructuring' of
the group, he intended to step down once a replacement had been found.

FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Serif losses rise sharply
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Serif, the specialist printing and packaging group, saw pre-tax losses widen
sharply from Pounds 494,000 to Pounds 913,000 in the first half of 1994, on
turnover of Pounds 9.18m, against Pounds 8.7m.
Mr Richard Harrison, chairman, said the second half was expected to show an
improvement, but a profit for the period was not anticipated.
He said the result reflected rationalisation costs and implementation of the
reorganisation started towards the end of 1993, the benefits of which were
taking longer to materialise than hoped.
Losses per share, on capital increased by November's Pounds 4.9m rights
issue, were 1.2p (2p).

<TEXT>
Epwin, a manufacturer of PVC-u windows and doors, made substantially higher
profits in the six months to July 2.
On turnover up 18 per cent to Pounds 29m, pre-tax profits rose 41 per cent,
from Pounds 1.75m to Pounds 2.47m.
Mr Jim Rawson, chairman, said the group, which moved into North America with
the purchase of 50 per cent of Canadian Berlinex Polymers in April, was
'broadening its spread of activities'. The acquisition in June of Permadoor,
a manufacturer of composite doors, was the first step in this process. The
group financed both purchases, which cost Pounds 6.75m, from reserves and
with a Pounds 4.3m placing.
Earnings per share were 7.54p (5.68p), and an interim dividend of 2.7p
(2.3p) is declared.

FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Deluxe solution to a growing problem - Why
a UK banking software company preferred getting a US parent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Software Partnership, Cheshire-based and uncompromisingly British, had
every intention of staying that way when it set out to find a buyer towards
the end of last year.
A specialist in banking software, which last year reported pre-tax profits
of Pounds 1m on turnover of Pounds 5.6m, it sought a buyer for two reasons;
it wanted access to international markets and it needed a partner with deep
pockets to underwrite both its expansion and ambitious research and
development programme.
However, in June this year it was bought for an undisclosed cash sum by
Deluxe Data Systems, the electronic funds transfer subsidiary of Deluxe
Corporation, the US cheque printer. DDS has revenues of about Dollars 100m
(Pounds 65m) and its parent is one of the 300 largest corporations in the US
with revenues of Dollars 1.7bn.
Mr Nigel Walsh, co-founder and managing director, said he was happy with the
outcome but regreted a suitable UK parent could not be found.
He had ruled out a flotation, arguing that software houses generally fare
badly on the stock market, and was disappointed by the attitude of large UK
electronics groups.
'They looked at us from the point of view of the balance sheet and were
prepared to acquire us on that basis. They did not seem to understand our
technology or to have a strategy after acquisition.'
Mainland European groups were not much better, seeing the company chiefly as
a bridgehead into the UK market. In the end, it was Broadview Associates,
the US-based mergers and acquisitions specialist, which identified DDS as a
suitable parent.
The deal seems more of a merger than a takeover, despite the discrepancy in
size. Mr Walsh and co-founder Mr Ian Booth will continue to run Software
Partnership in Runcorn, now recast as DDS's international headquarters.
A third co-founder, Mr Howard Hanson, has been given charge of DDS's global
research and development programme. Mr Brian Eadie, formerly Software
Partnership's sales director, is now sales development director for the
group.
Mr James McGowan, DDS chief executive, emphasised the synergy between the
two companies. 'Not only have we acquired a first class set of products to
complement our own solutions, but we have also gained a highly experienced
team with a solid understanding of the international financial marketplace.'
Deluxe Corporation has been printing cheques since 1915 but is seeking to
become less reliant on what is a maturing market.
DDS, formed in 1961, is part of this programme. It provides processing
services and software for electronic banking.
According to Mr McGowan, Deluxe should have revenues of Dollars 4bn by the
end of the century of which DDS's share should be some Dollars 500m.
The acquisition of Software Partnership fills an important gap in its
strategy.
'Within the decade, financial institutions will tailor their electronic
delivery systems to the individual . . . screen phones, personal computers
and interactive televisions will be used alongside automated teller machines
and point-of-sale terminals,' said Mr McGowan.
'With the Software Partnership software, we now have the key piece needed to
help institutions reconfigure their systems and move to the cutting edge of
direct banking.'
Banks and financial institutions using Software Partnership products include
Barclays and the National &amp; Provincial Building Society.
It was ahead of its time in realising that electronic delivery of banking
services would take a diversity of forms and that the secret of rapid and
economic development of new services was a common design allowing any
device, such as a telephone, personal computer, or television, to connect to
any banking system or application. It is essentially a building block
approach.
Now Software Partnership is the latest building block in Deluxe's growth
strategy. It seems unlikely that Mr Walsh and his team will have much time
or inclination for regrets that the Stars and Stripes rather than the Union
Flag hangs over their corner of Cheshire.

FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Takare rises 35% and defends its accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Keith Bradshaw, chairman of Takare, yesterday defended the nursing home
group's accounting policies as it announced a 35 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.4m for the six months to June 30, on sales 22
per cent higher at Pounds 42.5m.
'Within the sector we are not soft on accounting policies,' Mr Bradshaw
said. 'We are hard on them and always have been.'
Takare's share price has been hit in recent months by concerns over its
depreciation and capitalisation of interest policies.
The group, like many other nursing home operators, does not depreciate the
value of its homes. It also capitalises the interest costs of building the
homes - adding that value to its fixed assets - for up to three months after
opening. Others in the sector stop capitalising when the home opens.
Mr Bradshaw said since the group only opened homes on a phased basis, it was
justifiable to stop capitalising costs in an equally phased manner.
On depreciation, Mr Bradshaw said: 'If you have a company that does not
revalue and which expenses the maintenance and refurbishment of assets, to
depreciate on top of that would be understating the performance of my
company.'
Mr Bradshaw was confident the group would allay fears about its profits
through continuing growth. 'We are filling our beds faster than ever
before,' he said.
This was in spite of the Community Care Act which has introduced means
testing for potential residents and was expected to hit companies such as
Takare catering for the state-funded resident.
Takare was stepping up its expansion programme, with 1,500 and 1,800 extra
beds planned for this year. Some 900 were already under construction. The
group had 5,610 beds in operation at the end of the period, against 4,770
last time, with a 97.5 per cent occupancy rate.
The increase in profits was largely fuelled by the increased number of beds.
Price inflation was about 2 per cent, Mr Bradshaw said.
The Pounds 68m rights issue last September helped Takare cut interest costs
from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 243,000. About Pounds 1.6m was capitalised.
The interim dividend is increased by 14 per cent to 0.8p. Earnings,
depressed by the rights, fell by 0.3p to 6.4p.
COMMENT
Mr Bradshaw's robust defence of accounting policies has failed to set the
ghosts to rest. While the group's potential for growth remains encouraging,
particularly next year when the capital spending comes through, the dispute
about what is conservative accounting for a nursing homes group will never
be far from most investors thoughts. Whatever Mr Bradshaw may say, this will
have to be thoroughly addressed. Forecasts are for profits this year of
Pounds 20.8m, putting the shares on a prospective p/e of almost 16. This
looks up with events in the short-term, but next year's prospects make the
shares look more attractive.

FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Midland advances to Pounds 443m - Strategy
of maintaining existing branch network to be reviewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland Bank will re-examine its strategy of maintaining its branch network
and keeping senior managers in branches if it fails to attract sufficient
new income to compensate for the cost, the bank said yesterday.
Sir William Purves, chairman of Midland and its parent company HSBC
Holdings, said that it wanted to use its 1,740 branches to increase its
market share in the UK, but 'it remains to be seen if we have got it right'.
Sir William said that he had been shocked at the level of dissatisfaction
with UK clearing banks compared with Hong Kong, where most letters from
customers praised banks. He said that some complaints were 'very justified'.
Sir William said he believed the 2.5 per cent pay rise imposed on Midland's
45,000 staff was fair despite ballots on a series of one-day strikes
organised by Bifu, the banking union which represents 13,900 Midland staff.
The strategy of putting managers back into local branches and keeping a
strong network was set by Sir Brian Pearse, the bank's previous chief
executive. Sir Brian retired earlier this year, and was succeeded by Mr
Keith Whitson.
Midland disclosed a Pounds 58m rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 443m for
the half year to June 30, but there was an 11 per cent drop in operating
income to Pounds 1.5bn (Pounds 1.68bn).
Net interest income rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 897m (Pounds 840m), but
non-interest income fell by 29 per cent to Pounds 599m (Pounds 840m). 'The
biggest worry in clearing banking must be that revenue is simply not growing
as fast as overheads,' said Sir William.
Operating expenses were flat at Pounds 1.04bn, but the ratio of costs to
income rose to 69.6 per cent (61.9 per cent). This is above the HSBC group
target of 60 per cent.
Mr Whitson said Midland had made gains in its credit card business, and had
increased its share of the UK mortgage market.
He said the pressure on margins had been limited except in lending to big
companies, but he expected that pressure to grow.
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell to Pounds 54m (Pounds 321m),
including a net release of Pounds 45m related to less developed country
lending. Mr Whitson said he expected the provisions figure to rise somewhat
when lending growth resumed.
Midland made a Pounds 65m profit from reducing its equity shareholding in
3i, the venture capital company formerly owned by banks, from 17 per cent to
8 per cent.
The profit will be realised in the second half's financial accounts. Assets
weighted by risk rose to Pounds 48.2bn (Pounds 42.9bn) and the tier 1 ratio
of core capital to risk-weighted assets stayed at 6.5 per cent.
Midland paid a Pounds 106m dividend (Pounds 50m) to HSBC out of unchanged
attributable profit of Pounds 282m. Earnings per share amounted to 34.6p
(35.4p).

FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Bank of Ireland sells UK finance
house for Pounds 25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of Ireland, one of the two main clearing banks in the Irish Republic,
has sold its UK finance house subsidiary to a consortium of UK-based asset
finance specialists for Pounds 25.7m.
British Credit Trust was originally acquired in 1978, and at its peak had
Pounds 400m in leased assets and hire purchase agreements. However, Bank of
Ireland decided to withdraw from the general instalment credit business in
1990, when the industry was incurring heavy losses, and has since run down
BCT's book to Pounds 8m.
The bank said the sale ended its involvement in the instalment credit
business in the UK. Bank of Ireland's strategy in the UK is to develop its
branch banking and mortgage finance businesses.
Mr Roger Gewolb, one of the directors of the consortium that has bought BCT,
said: 'The asset-based financing business is now undergoing something of a
renaissance and it is a good time to acquire the right sort vehicle to build
up a business.'
BCT had been well-managed by Bank of Ireland, he said, and offered good
potential 'both through organic growth and acquisition'.
The company will focus on commercial and consumer finance in the middle and
small-ticket leasing and hire-purchase sectors.
The consideration for BCT included secondary collectables, properties and
cash, in addition to the primary loan book.
'We paid very little in goodwill,' Mr Gewolb said.
Bank of Ireland said it had received more than the book value of BCT.

<TEXT>
BOC, the industrial gases and healthcare company, has bought a Dutch
equipment supplier for Fl 29.4m (Pounds 10.8m).
The Calumatic group, which supplies filling, sterilising and capping lines
to the pharmaceutical industry, will be integrated with Edwards Freeze
Drying, part of BOC's vacuum technology division and a supplier of freeze
driers to the pharmaceutical industry. The acquisition will be funded by
cash, a proportion of which is deferred and contingent on future
performance.
Mr Danny Rosenkranz, managing director, said the acquisition 'allows us to
develop our freeze-drying business'. The new business, BOC Edwards
Calumatic, will be able to provide complete packaging solutions for a
variety of injectable formulations.
BOC is implementing a three-year restructuring, and made an Pounds 85m
provision in its latest accounts, Pounds 60m of which was for the healthcare
business. It reported a fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 169.3m, compared
with Pounds 261.6m, in the nine months to June 30.
BOC shares rose 7p to 732p.

FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: SeaCon net income at Pounds 6.4m and asset
disposal considered
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sea Containers, the Bermuda-based leisure, ferry and container leasing
group, reported flat net income of Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.4m) compared with
Dollars 10.4m, for the second quarter to end-June. Profits before income tax
fell from Dollars 11.2m to Dollars 10.7m.
For the six-month period, profits before income tax fell from Dollars 14.4m
to Dollars 3.44m, although the company said the comparison was distorted by
the fact that in the first half of 1993 it made a substantial gain on the
sale of a factory, as well as significant foreign exchange profits.
Revenue for the quarter rose from Dollars 102.8m to Dollars 114.2m, while
for the six-month period it increased from Dollars 183.9m to Dollars 199.5m.
Mr James Sherwood, president, said the board had decided not to go ahead
with its previously announced share offering, as the current share price is
too low and market conditions too weak. However, he said it was considering
an asset sale later in the year.

FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Andrews Sykes net assets cut by Pounds 4m
after valuation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Andrews Sykes Group, the specialist industrial services company, announced
yesterday that since the 1993-94 results were announced, on August 1, the
result of an actuarial valuation of its UK pension schemes had been received
resulting in a drop in the current surplus from Pounds 5.9m to Pounds 2.4m.
The company said that the valuation reinforces the board's belief that it
was inappropriate to bring this surplus onto the balance sheet, where it had
been held since 1990, as it did not represent a readily available tangible
asset.
As a result, final results for the year will include a prior year adjustment
to reflect a change of accounting policy, excluding the brought forward
surplus from the balance sheet.
The loss before tax of Pounds 4.7m and the gearing ratio of 256 per cent
(excluding the surplus) are unchanged, but net assets at March 31 are
reduced by Pounds 4m to Pounds 6.7m.

FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Big number, but deferred - Tim Burt and
William Lewis look at reaction to Peter Davis's Pounds 2.02m compensation
package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Peter Davis, the former co-chairman of Reed Elsevier, returns next
week to the London office suite provided by the Anglo-Dutch publishing
group, he will be more than Pounds 650,000 richer than when he left for his
holiday.
The 52-year-old executive, who was a leading figure in last year's merger of
Reed International and Elsevier, will also be able to contemplate Pounds
70,000 of fringe benefits and a retirement cushioned by Pounds 1.3m of
enhanced pension payments.
His former employers, however, yesterday acted to defuse the potential row
over the Pounds 2.02m compensation package by pointing out that Mr Davis's
bank account would have looked far healthier had he not resigned in a
dispute over management responsibilities in June.
'It looks a big number,' a senior company source admitted yesterday. 'But
most of it is deferred payment. We've negotiated a good deal and he's lost
out by not staying with us.'
The group's lawyers and actuaries have agreed a package which, they claim,
reflects Mr Davis's contribution during eight years at the helm of Reed
International, a period in which profits almost doubled and the share price
climbed from 160p to 805p.
Although the headline figure puts Mr Davis third in the league of executive
pay-offs this year - behind the Pounds 3.1m paid to Mr John Cahill of
British Aerospace and a combined Pounds 2.9m payment for two former Lasmo
directors - Reed Elsevier claimed to have secured a 'conservative' package.
A senior company official said the pay-out was below top expectations
because of the group's use of mitigation: payments adjusted for Mr Davis's
chances of finding another job and early retirement.
The group, which operates a final payment scheme for pensions, is said to
have extracted a discount of more than 30 per cent on what Mr Davis would
have received had he stayed until he was 60.
'Being blown out of a final salary scheme is very expensive,' said one City
analyst.
Mr Davis is also receiving enhanced pension entitlements for only two years
of his three-year rolling contract.
Nevertheless, the size of those entitlements - worth Pounds 650,000 a year -
has angered some institutional shareholders.
'The pay-off is excessive and difficult to justify, said Mr Michael Taylor,
a fund manager at Royal Insurance.
Another, who asked not to be named, said he would be seeking clarification
from Reed. 'This looks like the pay-off of a man who was asked to leave. We
have to find out what exactly happened.'
Other institutions have voiced concern at the value of Mr Davis's share
options.
The company declined to comment on reports that he had options on more than
180,000 Reed shares, but it admitted he could receive a pay-out 'in the
event of a significant enhancement of earnings per share' under a long-term
incentive sch-eme.
The Top Pay Research Group, however, said the final package was not
excessive.
Mr Peter Brown, the group's chairman, said: 'The cash payment is not much
more than a year's pay. For those angry at over-compensation, there are
better examples than this.'

FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Welsh Water to cut 18% of workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Welsh Water yesterday said it would announce plans for its Pounds 55m cash
pile in October when it unveils its corporate strategy to investors and
analysts.
The group also revealed details of a cost-cutting plan which will mean the
loss of 18 per cent of the utility's 3,000-strong workforce.
Welsh, which has one of the strongest balance sheets among the 10 water and
sewerage companies, has several options for the cash from buying back shares
to expanding its non-regulatory businesses.
Mr Graham Hawker, Welsh's chief executive, implied the preferable option
would be to expand the businesses. 'If we can use our skills and assets to
generate superior returns to shareholders then that's what we should do,' he
said.
Any diversification would have to be treated cautiously after the group's
unhappy experiences as hotels manager and unwelcome investor in Swalec, the
regional electricity company.
Welsh also announced yesterday that it planned to shed 550 mostly white
collar jobs, in a move designed to help it beat efficiency targets set by
the industry regulator last month.
The company was widely regarded to have done well out of the regulator's
price review, with annual increases of 0.5 percentage points above inflation
allowed to 2000.
The job cuts will result in a Pounds 17m provision against profits this year
but are expected to bring a similar level of savings over two years.
Mr Hawker said the redundancies included senior managers and head office
staff. All would be voluntary and more than half of the proposed cuts had
been agreed already. Some 140 people had left between April 1993 and 1994,
with a further 230 planned by the end of this year. The balance would leave
by the end of the 1996-97 financial year. Savings of between Pounds 8m and
Pounds 9m were expected in the first full year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, the electronic security services and car auction group with operations
in North America, the UK and continental Europe, saw net profits fall in the
second quarter to end-June, due to higher interest and tax charges.
Net income amounted to Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.3m) against Dollars 32.2m,
reflecting a Dollars 2.5m rise in tax, and a Dollars 1.3m loss, compared
with a Dollars 400,000 profit, from discontinued operations.
Interest expenses amounted to Dollars 18.4m, up from Dollars 11m; however,
disposals have reduced gearing from 153 per cent to 78 per cent.
Total net sales for the quarter rose from Dollars 317.5m to Dollars 340.8m.
Net income per share fell from 25 cents to 20 cents.
For the six-month period, ADT made 38 cents per common share, down from 45
cents, on net income reduced from Dollars 58.4m to Dollars 57.1m.

FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Argos advances 16% to Pounds 15.3m - Market
share rises but sales growth slows in last two months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argos, the catalogue retailer, said yesterday it had been hit hard by tax
increases in April, but was still able to produce a 16 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits for the first half from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds 15.3m.
Turnover for the 24 weeks to June 18 improved by 13 per cent, from Pounds
366m to Pounds 412.9m. Mr Mike Smith, group chief executive, said
like-for-like sales had grown by 9 per cent in the first four months but had
fallen to 1.3 per cent in May and June resulting in overall growth of 6.7
per cent.
He said the slower growth after April was due partly to stronger comparative
figures and to catalogues being in short supply after heavy demand early in
the year, which had signalled an upturn in consumer confidence.
Mr Smith added that the tax increases had made customers more cautious,
spending less on consumer durables and more on items such as food and
clothing, and occasional luxuries such as holidays and cars.
However, in spite of the slowdown in sales growth and lower average ticket
prices, Argos had increased market share in most product areas. While
increasing its price competitiveness, Argos had held the reduction in its
gross margin to 0.2 percentage points.
Like-for-like sales had improved in the last two weeks since the publication
of the autumn-winter catalogue, and Mr Smith said he was optimistic about
prospects for the second half.
An aggressive store opening programme also contributed to the increase in
total turnover. Cost controls and the introduction of new systems helped
Argos achieve a 19 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 11.6m
(Pounds 9.7m). Net interest received increased from Pounds 3.42m to Pounds
3.65m.
Three superstores and seven traditional stores were opened during the period
with a further 13 being refurbished. A total of 32 new stores should be
opened during the year, taking the chain to 348.
Capital spending this year will be about Pounds 41m (Pounds 29m). However,
Mr Smith said this was likely to be the peak of the opening programme, with
future openings projected at 25 a year, and annual expenditure between
Pounds 30m and Pounds 35m.
Argos expects to achieve this while continuing to add to its net cash, which
averaged Pounds 146.3m in the first half.
Mr Smith said the company was examining a number of options, including
electronic home shopping and mail order, for future investment, but no
decisions had been made.
Earnings per share increased from 2.93p to 3.37p, and the interim dividend
increased by almost 13 per cent from 2.35p to 2.65p.

Shares in Calor Group, the liquefied petroleum gas distributor, fell 7 per
cent, or 20p, to 270p yesterday, following press reports on Sunday about a
price war in the bottled gas market which threatened 'to undermine Calor',
which has a 50 per cent share of the market.
Calor responded yesterday, saying the market for bottled gas remained 'very
competitive', but it believed it was 'currently maintaining market share,
with pressure on margins being matched by cost reductions and operating
efficiencies.'
The shares recovered to close down 9p at 281p.
Calor is due to announce its results for the six months to June 30 on

Shares in the Storm Group, which is involved with intellectual property
rights relating to toys and cartoon characters, lost 5 1/2 p to close at 12
1/2 p, a fall of 31 per cent, after Sunday press reports described by the
company as containing 'a range of ill-founded statements and material

Mr Jim Driscoll, chairman, said he could not comment in greater detail as
the group was considering further action. 'We are obviously very worried by
the fall in the share price.'
The USM-quoted group recently raised Pounds 2.3m with a placing and open
offer.
Pre-tax profits for the year to end-December were Pounds 122,000, compared
with losses of Pounds 2.1m restated in accordance with FRS 3. Turnover fell
from Pounds 6.04m to Pounds 5.23m but there were operating profits of Pounds
311,000 (Pounds 2.03m losses), after much lower exceptional debits of Pounds
107,000, against Pounds 2.05m.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Malaya Group, the USM-quoted motor retailer, yesterday reported a return to
profitability in the six months to June 30 and announced a resumption of
dividend payments.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 503,000 compared with losses of Pounds 153,000
last time on turnover sharply ahead to Pounds 73.2m (Pounds 15m). The nearly
five-fold increase in sales partly reflected recent takeover activity with
acquisitions contributing Pounds 27.9m of the gain.
Earnings per share were 0.41p, against losses of 0.35p; the group is
returning to the dividend list with an interim of 0.25p - the last
distribution to shareholders was for the 1989 year.
Acquisitions contributed Pounds 353,000 to operating profits of Pounds
754,000, which compared with a Pounds 82,000 operating loss in the 1993
first half. Net interest payable was Pounds 251,000 (Pounds 71,000).
Following two acquisitions in May the group said it was on target to
assemble the first phase of its dealership grouping in London and the home
counties. Malaya now represents 18 franchises in a broad range of specialist
and volume marques, with 18 outlets and seven Bodytech accident repair
centres.
Commenting on the outlook Mr Keith Goldie-Morrison, chairman, said: 'As
expected the market has improved during the period and the company has in
general enjoyed strong, and in some cases, record order books for August new
car deliveries at its dealerships.'

FT  16 AUG 94 / Telecoms alliance may turn to merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The national telecommunications companies of Sweden, Switzerland and the
Netherlands could turn their alliance into a full merger in response to
accelerating competition within Europe, according to company strategists.
The three companies last year launched a joint venture, Unisource, to target
the growing multinationals market for one-stop telecoms networks. They have
taken steps towards merging their international networks.
Dr Bertil Thorngren, director of corporate strategy at Telia, the
state-owned Swedish operator, said: 'Within five to 10 years the three
companies could become one company. We are set to become more integrated.'
A full merger was one of the 'serious options', Dr Thorngren said. Others
include equity exchanges and/or a merger of long-distance and international
operations, spinning off separate local operators in each country akin to
the US regional Bells.
Such radical options reflect the impact of competitive pressures on Europe's
smaller telecoms operators as monopolies are abolished and the EU's larger
operators form alliances to target cross-border traffic.
Most of the smaller western European operators are urgently reassessing
their futures. The Irish, Belgian and Portuguese state concerns are
considering selling minority stakes to larger operators, possibly as part of
privatisation.
Several smaller operators are in talks about joining Unisource. Telecom
Eireann and Belgacom, the Irish and Belgian operators, have also approached
British Telecommunications.
A London-based telecoms analyst said a Swiss/Swedish/Dutch merger would be a
'logical extension'. However, he highlighted some difficulties, including
the enlargement of Unisource and the state-owned status of Telia and the
Swiss telecoms operator.
A one-third stake in KPN, the Dutch operator, was floated earlier this year.
Privatisation of Telia is under serious consideration in Sweden, which is
one of the world's most competitive telecoms markets. However, the Swiss
state operator has yet to be split from its postal division.
Last month Unisource admitted Telefonica, the private Spanish operator, as a
full member and forged an alliance with AT&amp;T, the largest US operator, which
may take an equity stake.

FT  16 AUG 94 / US report gives coffee a fillip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee futures prices rose strongly in London and New York yesterday
following a report from the US Department of Agriculture estimating that
frost damage would cut next year's Brazilian coffee crop by 30 to 40 per
cent.
The USDA report, regarded by traders as the most accurate available,
suggested that the crop would total between 17m and 20m bags compared with
the 29m it predicted before the frosts in June and July. Brazil usually
accounts for at least a quarter of world coffee output.
Traders had expected that the USDA estimate of the damage would be lower
than that of the Brazilian government, which said last month that 40 per
cent of the crop would be lost.
In practice, the US figures, released late on Friday, were at the top end of
expectations, giving a fillip to prices that had suffered a sell-off last
week, as investment funds and spec-ulators took profits.
In London, robusta coffee futures staged a 4.8 per cent rally, with the
contract for delivery in November rising Dollars 157 to Dollars 3,430 a
tonne. Arabica coffee futures in New York were up strongly in the afternoon
session, the December contract closing 13.6 cents, or 7.3 per cent, higher
at 198.45 cents a pound.
However, neither market regained all last week's losses, suggesting that
prices might have risen too far, too fast - London peaked at Dollars 4,085 a
tonne and New York at 274 cents a pound on July 13.
GNI, the London commodity broker, said dry weather now appeared to be the
most important concern for next year's crop. The USDA found there had been
less rainfall than usual in virtually all the coffee areas it visited in its
3,800-mile field survey, saying normal rainfall was needed for a
'favourable' flowering season in October to December.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Hanson set to gain Dollars 200m from toy maker's flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate which announces third-quarter results
today, plans a stock market flotation for Ertl, the US-based toy maker, as
part of its debt reduction programme.
Mr David Clarke, chief executive of Hanson Industries, Hanson's US arm, said
yesterday that Ertl had filed a registration statement with the US
Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of 8.5m
shares at an estimated Dollars 16 a share.
Ertl, which is based in Dyersville, Iowa, will use the proceeds together
with bank borrowings to pay Hanson about Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m). Hanson
will retain a stake of up to 37 per cent in the company after the flotation.
The proposed offer price values Ertl, whose products include die-cast models
of Thomas the Tank Engine, television advertised promotional toys and
plastic model kits, at about Dollars 216m.
Ertl posted pre-tax profits of Dollars 14.1m in the year to September 30 on
sales of Dollars 186m, and had net profits of Dollars 9.6m.
Hanson acquired Ertl from Kidde in 1987 after a proposed Dollars 89.5m sale
to Tonka fell through. Since then the company has consolidated its position
as one of the leading US toy makers.
The proposed deal is structured in a similar way to the flotation of Beazer
Homes USA, Hanson's US housebuilding business, which was completed earlier
this year as part of the group's strategy of reducing debt through the
disposal of non-core businesses.
Hanson's gearing rose to 86 per cent after last year's acquisition of
Quantum Chemical, the US polythene and propane group.
Since then a succession of disposals has reduced net borrowings to around
Pounds 2.55bn and gearing to about 54 per cent, excluding the proposed
purchase of Scholes, the UK electrical equipment manufacturer, which has yet
to be completed.
So far this year Hanson has raised about Pounds 810m through disposals,
including Pounds 490m in the UK, and further sales are expected. Analysts
expect future disposals to be focused on smaller companies in the US.

FT  16 AUG 94 / HSBC stops own-account bond trading: Pre-tax profits up 24
per cent at Pounds 1.46bn - Sharp drop in dealing income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HSBC Holdings, the international banking group, has largely suspended
proprietary trading on bond markets after losing Pounds 123m on bond and
interest rate-related trading during a turbulent first half, it disclosed
yesterday.
HSBC's shares fell 10p to 749p after it revealed that its exposure to
financial trading led to a 10 per cent fall in non-interest income to Pounds
1.47bn. This included a sharp drop in dealing income to Pounds 73m from
Pounds 522m.
Despite the setback, a fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts to
Pounds 173m from Pounds 432m allowed HSBC to raise pre-tax profits by 24 per
cent to Pounds 1.46bn from Pounds 1.18bn. The interim dividend goes up 14
per cent to 8p.
Sir William Purves, HSBC chairman, said that the bank's treasury had been
positioned for a rise in US interest rates in February, but was caught out
by the 'rather drastic' rise in European bond yields that accompanied this.
None of HSBC's internal limits were breached and no staff had been
dismissed. But HSBC was 'not running significant positions today and we will
not start again until we see markets that are more predictable'.
Dealing income from foreign exchange rose to Pounds 196m from Pounds 180m.
But it lost Pounds 92m on proprietory position taking in interest rate
products, and lost a further Pounds 31m on other, primarily interest
rate-related, trading.
Losses continued at Concord Leasing, its US leasing arm, which has suffered
from falls in the value of commercial aircraft. It lost Pounds 100m, against
Pounds 22m in the first half of 1993 and Pounds 140m in the second half.
Sir William said HSBC had changed Concord's chief executive and was
negotiating with US banking regulators to fold it into Marine Midland, its
US banking subsidiary. This would help it to use tax allowances arising from
the losses.
There was strong asset growth in Hong Kong, with advances at its subsidiary
HongkongBank rising by 5.7 per cent from the end of 1993. This was due to
demand for residential mortgages and corporate loans, and buoyant trade
finance.
The net interest margin stayed at 2.7 per cent, with interest-earning assets
rising to Pounds 169bn from Pounds 159bn. Margins in HongkongBank narrowed
from 2.4 to 2.3 per cent, mainly because of narrowing spreads on
liabilities.
Sir William said that he had 'no gleam in my eye' over the possibility of
acquiring a UK building society. A purchase to add to Marine Midland was
more likely, but it was unwilling to pay current prices for US regional
banks.
The annualised post-tax return on equity fell slightly to 19.3 per and the
return on assets stayed at 1 per cent. The tier 1 ratio of capital to
risk-weighted assets rose from 7.5 to 8.6 per cent.
Profit attributable to shareholders advanced 13 per cent to Pounds 938m. The
increase was lower than the rise in pre-tax profits because tax allowances
from past losses have been used at Midland, and largely used at Marine
Midland.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Life on the edge as Confed collapse shakes up insurers:
Bernard Simon sees nervousness in a Canadian industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shiver has rippled through Canada's life insurance industry after last
week's collapse of Confederation Life, the fourth biggest domestic insurer.
Since regulators decided to take over Confederation last Thursday, pending
the winding-up and liquidation of the Toronto-based company, other companies
have rushed to reassure employees and policyholders that Confed is a special
case and that its problems are not typical of the industry.
Confed's businesses were relatively sound, but it was dragged down by a
1980s foray into property development and lending, with property making up
more than 60 per cent of its investments.
The concern remains, however, that the biggest failure of a life insurer in
North America, involving a company with CDollars 19bn (Pounds 8.9bn) in
balance sheet assets and CDollars 33bn in assets under management, could set
off a chain of events.
Canada's life insurance industry has for long enjoyed a solid reputation.
The biggest companies, Manulife Financial (formerly Manufacturers Life), Sun
Life of Canada and Canada Life, are strongly capitalised and have blue-chip
credit ratings. The biggest companies are also diversified. More than
two-thirds of Sun Life's assets under management are in the US. Manulife is
the third biggest life underwriter in Hong Kong, and writes more business in
Asia than in Canada.
But pressures on the industry have been building. About 150 life companies
compete in a stagnant market. Underwriting margins have narrowed so that
many companies rely on investment income and diversification - into mutual
funds, for instance - to keep them in the black.
Standard &amp; Poor's said this month that while the nine biggest companies
'continue offering a high level of financial security', it expects to
downgrade some credit ratings over the next few years.
Although Confed was heavily exposed to property, the slump in North American
property values has hit the entire industry. Even Sun Life suffered
investment losses, mainly from its property portfolio, of CDollars 255m last
year - a 66 per cent jump from 1992.
The diminishing rewards of the Canadian insurance market are apparent in a
spate of deals. New York Life earlier this year ended a 136-year presence in
Canada by selling its operations to Canada Life. Sun Alliance sold its
Canadian unit to North American Life at the end of May.
More recently, the UK's Prudential group has sold its Canadian group life
and health business, as well as its group pension-plan operations, to Sun
Life. Several other foreign companies are rumoured to be struggling to find
buyers. Regulatory curbs, such as a 25 per cent limit on foreign
shareholdings, have also discouraged mergers and takeovers.
Mr Mark Daniels, president of the Canadian Life and Health Insurance
Association, says the Confed failure could speed rationalisation and
predicts 'significantly fewer players' over the next five to 10 years.
Confed's collapse may encourage Canada's six big banks to accelerate their
drive into insurance, he adds. Several have bought insurance operations
since the lifting of restrictions in mid-1992, but have yet to make an
impact on the market.
Meanwhile the industry is braced for a 'flight to quality'. Companies seen
to be vulnerable could find it difficult to sell policies or attract savings
and there is concern that some may have difficulty raising funds.
Insurers also face a costly call for contributions to CompCorp, the
industry's consumer-protection fund of which membership is compulsory.
Unlike most deposit-insurance schemes, members are assessed for funds only
after a member has been declared insolvent. The industry coughed up CDollars
180m in 1992-93 to pay policyholders of Les Cooperants, a Montreal-based
company. Another CDollars 75m or so will be required to meet the obligations
of Sovereign Life of Calgary, which failed in late 1992. These sums are
likely to pale against CompCorp's obligations to Confed policyholders.
What is especially galling to insurers is that depositors in the rash of
Canadian trust companies which have failed have been compensated by the
government, through the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation. Insurers now
face a period of similar turmoil. But while taxpayers footed much of the
trust industry's bill, insurers themselves will have to carry the burden for
those who fall by the wayside. That prospect may provide a powerful
incentive for stepping up the pace of mergers and acquisitions before more
companies go the way of Confederation Life.

FT  16 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange woos listings by foreign companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange is to set up its first-ever share listing
programme for foreign companies who want to tap into the UK's capital
market.
The move, announced yesterday, is part of the exchange's efforts to market
itself to non-UK companies, strengthening its role as a centre for
international share trading.
Mr Michael Lawrence, London Stock Exchange chief executive, has pointed to
the success of US exchanges in attracting foreign companies, particularly
those based in emerging markets, to seek listings there.
The success of the New York stock exchange and the Nasdaq stock market in
attracting these companies has strengthened the role of the US exchanges in
international share trading. Under the programme, foreign companies will be
invited to set up so-called depositary receipts. These are
sterling-denominated bundles of shares in a single company held by a trust
bank which then issues certificates. The number of shares per bundle and the
underlying currency will vary with each issuing company.
The exchange expects the strongest interest in obtaining a listing for
depositary receipts to come from companies based in emerging markets such as
South East Asia and Latin America.
Yesterday, the Inland Revenue said that unlike trading in the shares of
UK-listed companies, investors would not pay the standard 0.5 per cent stamp
duty on each depositary receipt transaction. However, issuing companies will
have to pay stamp duty of 1.5 per cent on all shares transformed into
depositary receipts.
The rules are intended to make trading in the depositary receipts
competitive with trading costs in the home country.
Listing requirements and fees for those seeking depositary receipt status
will be lower than for UK companies on the Official List. However, they will
conform to the minimum set out in European Union law. The issuer must have a
three-year trading record and, although audited accounts for the previous
three years must be presented, the accounts may be prepared in accordance
with home country standards. They also need not be consolidated.
The depositary, typically a bank, must be acceptable to the exchange, and
there must be at least one firm which agrees to act as market maker in
respect of each company's depositary receipts.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Carsberg asks trade court to review net book agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, has asked the
restrictive practices court to review the net book agreement, one of the
most controversial issues in British publishing.
It is the first time in 30 years that the court has examined the NBA - an
agreement between publishers preventing retailers from selling most books at
less than the net price set by the publishers.
Sir Bryan has taken evidence since last November from more than 100
publishers, booksellers, wholesalers, librarians and literary agents about
the agreement, and has concluded that it operated against the public
interest. He must now convince the court that there has been a 'material
change' in the book market since it last reviewed the agreement in 1964.
The Publishers Association said yesterday it was 'deeply disappointed' that
Sir Bryan was putting the UK book retailing system at risk.
The association said the majority of publishers believed the agreement
helped them sell a wider range of books more effectively, and the agreement
was vital to the survival of independent bookshops.
The Booksellers Association, representing more than 90 per cent of book
retailers, was 'surprised and dismayed' by Sir Bryan's decision. It said
abolition of the NBA would lead to higher book prices overall and the
closure of many shops.
One large retailer, however, welcomed the review. Pentos, owner of the
Dillons chain, has campaigned vociferously for abolition of the agreement.
It argues that by preventing discounting, the NBA keeps the prices of books
artificially high and limits the numbers sold.
Dillons said removal of the agreement would lead to an improvement in
publishing quality and in the public perception of the book trade, by
allowing greater competition between booksellers.
The Office of Fair Trading said the first court hearing was expected before
the end of the year, but hearings could continue for some time.

FT  16 AUG 94 / France holds Carlos 'the Jackal': Notorious terrorist
extradited from Sudan to face trial for killings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Carlos 'the Jackal', the guerrilla and kidnapper who is blamed for many of
the world's most notorious terrorist attacks over the past two decades, has
been arrested and is being held in Paris, the French government announced
yesterday.
The capture of Carlos, whose real name is Illich Ramirez Sanchez, is a
significant victory in the battle against international terrorism. It marks
the end of a bloody chapter of guerrilla attacks, often linked to conflicts
in the Middle East, and partly reflects the limited refuge for terrorists
following peace moves in the region and the collapse of communism.
The 44-year-old terrorist was captured in Sudan where he was planning
operations against foreign interests in the country, according to officials
in Khartoum. After his arrest, following a tip-off from the French
intelligence services, he was extradited to France yesterday morning and
will be brought before judicial authorities on charges of killing French
citizens.
Sudan, which took credit for capturing Carlos, urged the US to remove it
from Washington's list of states accused of sponsoring terrorism. US State
Department spokesman Michael McCurry said Sudan's handover of Carlos was
welcome but 'of itself is not sufficient action to cause us to rescind their
listing'.
The French government sought to capitalise on the arrest. 'This proves that
the government is determined to fight with all legal means against terrorism
and terrorists,' said Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister.
The crimes of which Carlos is accused include some of the most spectacular
guerrilla acts since the mid 1970s, many of which were linked to the
Arab-Israeli struggle or the rise of radical anti-establishment terrorism in
industrialised nations.
He has been linked to the 1975 kidnapping of 11 ministers attending a
meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna.
Three people died in the attack and the ministers were taken in a hijacked
aircraft to north Africa in a ransom bid. The guerrillas gave up after
flying to Algiers and Tripoli, but were allowed to go free within a few
days.
Carlos has also been linked to the 1972 massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at
the Munich Olympics, the 1974 takeover of the French embassy in the Hague,
and the 1976 hijacking to Entebbe, Uganda, of an Air France airliner.
Following his early exploits, the press dubbed him 'the Jackal' after the
terrorist sent to kill French president Charles de Gaulle in Frederick
Forsyth's novel The Day of the Jackal.
France has pursued Carlos since the killing of two French
counter-intelligence agents in 1975.
Mr Charles Pasqua, France's interior minister, said yesterday that Carlos
was involved in attacks in France in which 15 people had died. The French
minister said Carlos himself had admitted responsibility for the deaths of
83 people throughout the world.

FT  16 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Confederation Life
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The travails of Confederation Life of Canada could work to the advantage of
the UK life insurance industry. If its substantial UK operation can be sold
to an established insurer, there could be a rare opportunity to reduce
capacity in an overcrowded market. Despite the prospect of thinner margins
once full disclosure of sales commissions comes into force next year, the
industry has been slow to rationalise. Norwich Union's decision last month
to reduce its sales force was a rare example of a company taking unilateral
action. The biggest deals - such as Abbey National's acquisition of Scottish
Mutual and Aegon's link with Scottish Equitable - have introduced additional
capital rather than reduced competitive pressure.
The reluctance of smaller life insurers to surrender their independence
probably explains the scarcity of deals. In the case of Confederation Life
there is at least a willing seller. It seems unlikely that many UK life
companies make the kind of investment errors which undermined the Canadian
giant. But the prospect of falling sales volumes and squeezed margins points
to more UK life insurers changing hands in the months ahead.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The thinking behind a possible merger of the main Swedish, Dutch and Swiss
telecoms operators has merit. All three are middle-sized operators, whose
highly profitable international activities are vulnerable to growing
competition. The three have already clubbed together to create Unisource,
which provides one-stop services to multinationals. But as the old telecoms
cartel cracks, they need a strategy to address the much bigger market for
carrying ordinary international calls. The danger is that larger carriers
could poach their traffic. The corresponding hope is that by joining forces
the groups will not merely be able to hold their own but win traffic from
rivals' networks.
But engineering any merger would be complex. One precondition would
presumably be the privatisation of the Swedish and Swiss operators. So far
only the Netherlands' KPN is privatised. Without a market reference price,
it would be hard to hammer out financial terms that were seen to be fair.
Privatisation would also be the best guarantee for KPN shareholders that a
merged entity would be run to enhance shareholder value rather than to
advance political objectives.
It is possible that a full merger would be impossible for political reasons
and that the companies may instead opt to exchange equity stakes in each
other. But a web of cross shareholdings would be a worse option for
investors as it would restrict the operators' room for manoeuvre. If
political considerations prevent a clean-cut merger, the companies should
stick to their more modest aim of merging their international arms.

FT  16 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Argos
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is clear from yesterday's interim figures that Argos started to run out
of steam some time in the spring. The rate of like-for-like sales growth was
around 9 per cent until the end of April but fell to little more than 1 per
cent during May and June. Although 6.7 per cent for the six months as a
whole is perfectly respectable, the worry must be that Argos has lost
momentum going into the more important second half of the year.
Tax increases which came into effect in April must take part of the blame
for the slowdown, even though official retail sales figures did not show a
steep decline. Argos's strength in areas such as electrical appliances may
have made it more vulnerable to consumer caution than many other retailers.
As confidence returns this mix of business could work in its favour. After
such a strong start to the year the company also ran out of catalogues
earlier than expected. The early indications are that the new catalogue is
performing well. By holding its selling prices on 80 per cent of its goods,
Argos appears to have lost none of its competitive edge.
Even if the early summer doldrums were an aberration, though, Argos will
have to work hard to improve on strong sales figures achieved in the second
half of last year. Its store opening programme has moved up a gear this year
and has several years left to run. But new stores alone can not sustain the
kind of growth the stock market is looking for. With cash still accumulating
and no sign of a strategic move, it will be difficult for the shares to move
ahead without evidence that sales momentum has been restored.

FT  16 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: HSBC provides profit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Buried among the big numbers in HSBC's interim results was a strikingly
small one - the Pounds 7m provision for bad and doubtful debts at
HongkongBank Group. For a bank with customer advances of Pounds 38bn and a
significant exposure to the slowing Hong Kong property market, that is
unsustainably low. Quite what a sustainable level would be is harder to
judge. If Standard Chartered is right, and the average over a cycle for the
region should be around 1 per cent of risk assets, the annual figure for
HongkongBank would be nearer Pounds 400m. In the UK, talk is of a long-run
level of around 0.7 per cent a year. Yet Midland's first-half provisions of
Pounds 99m, excluding problem country debt, amounted to only 0.26 per cent
of customer loans. Proportionately they were even lower than Barclays' which
caused a few eyebrows to be raised last week.
This would matter less if dealing profits were about to bounce back smartly.
The Pounds 92m lost on proprietary trading in interest rate products brought
back unhappy memories of the Pounds 119m Midland lost in 1989 betting
against a rise in UK interest rates. HSBC does not want a repeat and has
declared that it will not re-open positions until markets have 'stabilised'.
Since it is difficult to make money in stable markets, last year's Pounds
711m of profits from non-foreign exchange dealing may never return.
For bank investors the main attraction of HSBC is that it operates in growth
markets. Yet even here the story is looking less convincing. It is still
showing good volume growth in Hong Kong, unlike Standard Chartered, but
margins are being squeezed and costs are under pressure. Should the trends
continue investors will find it increasingly hard to ignore the political
risks.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Logic rules, OK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rash of takeover activity that is spreading across the English-speaking
economies could hardly be more different from the previous bid flurry in the
late 1980s. Today's mergers and acquisitions are not driven purely by
financial logic; nor, again, by the machinations of junk bond operators. The
conglomerate tendency that marked so many takeovers in the 1960s is largely
absent. What we have in both Britain and the United States is a boring,
plain-vanilla takeover surge, chiefly characterised by an outbreak of
industrial logic.
In the US, the rationalisation of the pharmaceutical, rail and defence
industries is largely being driven by takeovers. Often bids constitute a
response to regulatory change, such as the Clinton healthcare programme, or
to perceived opportunities thrown up by new technology, as with the heady
battle for Paramount Communications.
In Britain, too, regulatory change has spurred rationalisation in the
independent television sector, while the deferred Lloyds Bank marriage with
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester could be categorised as a late response to the
lowering of the statutory ring-fence that surrounds the building society
movement. As for the Commercial Union-Victoire deal, it partly reflects the
changing structure of the European single market in insurance. In contrast,
unadorned commercial logic explains Tesco's offer for the Scottish food
retailer William Low, which inhabits a part of the country in which Tesco is
under-represented.
Can sweet reason continue to prevail against the natural instinct of
investment bankers to urge the marriage of the incompatible with the
unmanageable? Probably not, given the fat fees involved. In the US the pace
is already intense: at the present rate the value of takeovers in 1994 will
exceed Dollars 200bn before the year end. Managers who are inadequately
accountable to shareholders are always tempted to swallow the investment
bankers' bait because size can bring higher pay, pensions and kudos
regardless of industrial logic. Commercial banks are also flush with money
to finance new bids.
Sure enough, the bid premia are already looking skyward. American Home
Products' recent Dollars 8.5bn cash bid for American Cyanamid was pitched at
close to 50 per cent above the prevailing market value. In outbidding fellow
food retailer J. Sainsbury for William Low, Tesco was hardly erring on the
side of parsimony. And the battle for Paramount was a classic tale of
corporate egos writ large.
Tougher acquisition accounting will in due course help curb
over-enthusiastic bidders. Still more desirable would be a requirement on
directors to submit bids over a certain size to shareholders for approval.
American Home Products' offer was even made before sanction from the full
board. The links in the chain of accountability from executives to
shareholders are urgently in need of repair.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Hazards on the high seas: Traditional methods of
guaranteeing maritime safety are proving inadequate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Charles Batchelor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ship that Died of Shame tells the story of a wartime gunboat which is
bought by its crew and used for smuggling in peace time. In the novel by
Nicholas Monsarrat, subsequently turned into a film, the ship acquires a
character of its own and resists the actions of its owners.
In real life, of course, ships do not revolt in this way, though governments
and the international shipping organisations charged with maintaining
maritime safety might be forgiven for wishing they could. For far too many
among the world shipping fleet represent a hazard afloat, and it is not just
the ships but their crews and the marine environment which are the victims.
So bad have matters become that national and worldwide regulatory
authorities are being forced, as a last desperate measure, to shame
shipowners into improving the quality of their vessels.
The UK government this month produced its first monthly blacklist of
sub-standard ships docking at British ports. The US Coast Guard, meanwhile,
has published a list of 137 shipowners and operators, including some
prominent names in the industry, whose vessels will be the subject of
special safety checks when they enter US waters.
These actions by the British and US authorities have been spurred by an
increasing awareness that the established methods of guaranteeing maritime
safety are proving inadequate.
Presenting his report into the prevention of pollution from merchant
shipping in UK waters in May, Lord Donaldson, a former senior appeals court
judge, spoke of his 'astonishment' at the conditions he had discovered and
of 'the quite appalling record' of defects found on vessels visiting UK
ports.
The Donaldson report, Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas, was prompted by the sinking
of the oil tanker Braer off the Shetland Isles in January 1993. In the 15
months it took the inquiry team to produce its 103 recommendations for
safety improvements, no fewer than 67 serious incidents - just over one a
week - occurred in UK waters, which could have led to serious pollution.
The Donaldson inquiry and recent US legislation were both the result of oil
spills - the US Oil Pollution Act of 1990 was prompted by the grounding of
the tanker the Exxon Valdez off the coast of Alaska in 1989 - but
governments, seafarers' trades unions and the international shipping
organisations are concerned not only with environmental dangers but with the
broader aspects of safety.
No fewer than 121 ships were lost at sea in 1993, a 9 per cent increase on
the year before, leading to the loss of 592 lives or 35 per cent more than
in 1992, according to Numast, the international union of ships' officers
based in the UK.
The picture presented by the Donaldson inquiry, Numast and the US coastguard
is one of the world's oceans criss-crossed by ageing rustbuckets, lurching,
and sometimes failing even to lurch, from port to port. The 522-page
Donaldson report includes worrying photographs of badly corroded ballast
tanks and rusted support brackets.
Individual shipowners deny that maritime safety is as bleak as critics
suggest. 'In every sack of potatoes there will be a rotten one but the whole
industry is being judged by these exceptions,' says Mr Jacob Stolt-Nielson
Jr, chairman of a shipping company which operates speciality chemical
tankers. The Donaldson inquiry painted too alarmist a picture to grab
attention, commented another Scandinavian shipowner.
The International Chamber of Shipping, the London-based association of
shipowners, in its latest annual review, points out that 99.9 per cent of
the 1.7bn tonnes of oil carried by sea in 1993 reached its destination
without mishap. 'Merchant ships have been quietly engaging in what they do
best, carrying the world's 4.3bn tonnes of seaborne trade economically,
efficiently and safely,' the chamber
says soothingly.
But this gloss on the state of the world's shipping fleet is not supported
by the frenzy of activity among the regulatory bodies concerned at the
potential environmental disasters and accidents to crew that could be caused
by the world's shipping fleet.
They point to a combination of factors which have led to a downward spiral
in the quality of ship operations. These include:
Overcapacity in the world's fleet, which has put fierce pressure on the
rates shipowners can demand for their vessels. The owner of a new
250,000-tonne supertanker would need to earn between Dollars 30,000 and
Dollars 50,000 a day to meet his operating and financing costs on his
Dollars 100m-plus purchase. In recent times he has only been able to earn
about Dollars 10,000 a day.
'This encourages owners to keep their older ships trading because no one has
the capital to invest in new ones,' says Mr Julian Parker, secretary of the
Nautical Institute, an international organisation representing
professionally qualified mariners, such as ship's captains and harbour
masters. 'There is a downward pressure to lower costs and reduce safety.'
The declining importance of the traditional shipping nations and a shift of
both vessel ownership and registration to third world countries, many
without established training schemes or the infrastructure to provide a
high-class shipping industry.
'Thirty years ago 80 per cent of the world fleet was owned by the
traditional maritime nations,' says Mr Parker. 'There was bags of money,
shipowners sat in the House of Lords and everyone operated to a good
standard. Then 70 per cent of the fleets began to sail under flags of
convenience to save costs.' Many of the world's ships are now owned or
registered - flagged - in countries with weak regulation. The flag states
are responsible for implementing inspection regimes and ensuring a ship's
safety.
For some of the smaller or poorer countries with expanding fleets, European
or American concepts of safety can appear unrealistic. 'If standards are set
too high, the poorer countries say they will not be able to trade,' says Mr
Fernando Plaza, senior deputy director of maritime safety at the
International Maritime Organisation, the United Nations agency responsible
for maritime affairs.
The inability, and in some cases the unwillingess, of countries to police
the ships which sail under their flags, has led to a breakdown in this
traditional mechanism for maintaining maritime standards. If the flag state
does not insist on a proper technical inspection of its vessels or demand
high standards of its crews, an important plank of shipping safety is taken
away.
Panama heads the table of numbers of ships lost in the first six months of
this year, compiled by the Institute of London Underwriters, followed by
Cyprus, Malta, Honduras, Indonesia, China and St Vincent and Grenadine.
Liberia, which is frequently singled out for criticism and the country of
registration for the Braer, lost one ship during the period. The mixed
quality of the classification societies, the organisations which provide the
technical experts to ensure that vessels are well-designed, solidly built
and properly maintained. The societies are called in by owners or insurers
to evaluate a ship's seaworthiness.
The older-established societies such as Lloyd's Register, Det Norske Veritas
and the American Bureau of Shipping have been joined in recent years by a
host of newcomers, and there are now nearly 50 societies around the world.
Few have the resources to maintain a worldwide network of inspectors, so
they cannot always inspect a ship involved in a collision or grounding, and
all are under strong commercial pressure to be generous in their ratings.
Even if a classification society is doing its job well, there is nothing to
stop a shipowner moving his vessel to a different society, which may not set
such high standards and may therefore be cheaper. Though the system is
voluntary, insurance would, in practice, be impossible to obtain without a
rating.
The apparent inability of the International Maritime Organisation to act
speedily to improve standards. Frustration with the slow pace of reform
through the organisation has been a recurrent theme of complaints by
individual governments.
'Prolonged debate by member states in committees and sub-committees can
imply a lack of urgency or a failure to set adequate or clear priorities,'
Britain's then shipping minister, Lord Caithness, told an IMO assembly last
October. Public opinion concerning safety would not be willing to await
'completion of the IMO's deliberations or to accept a long-delayed
compromise solution. If IMO and its member states don't act, others will,'
the minister warned.
The London-based organisation has tried to speed up its procedures in recent
years but is limited in what it can do. The IMO is not a political body but
is a technical organisation with a mandate to provide the machinery for
co-operation among its 147 member states, explains Mr Plaza.
'For some of our members the pace is unbearably quick, for others we are
very slow,' he adds. The speed of change is determined by the need to reach
a consensus among member states and then achieve ratification of a measure
by their governments. Obtaining ratification for changes in international
agreements by a two-thirds majority can take up to 10 years.
The failure lies not with the organisation for its inability to devise
agreements but with member states for failing to implement them, according
to Mr Plaza. The IMO is now shifting its emphasis away from writing new
rules to making sure its members implement those already in existence.
However, the perception exists that the IMO is ineffective. The vacuum is
being filled by individual countries, including the UK and the US, or by
larger regional groupings such as the European Union.
The European Commission has been working on a series of proposals to tighten
up controls on the industry. These are aimed at setting minimum requirements
for seafarers' qualifications, requiring separate ballast tanks so that
tankers do not discharge oily ballast water into the sea, and tough controls
of vessels docking at European ports.
The International Chamber of Shipping worries about the possible
fragmentation of global responsibility for maritime safety. It wants the IMO
to retain responsibility for policing the oceans, but fears the Commission
'is trying to make a takeover bid'. However, an official of DG7, the EU
transport directorate, says the Commission is merely trying to give force to
the IMO's resolutions, which would otherwise be ignored by its members. 'It
must all be done within the framework of the IMO,' she adds.
Shipowners, too, are anxious that regulation of the industry should remain
centralised under the IMO. They point to the US Oil Pollution Act, which has
set demanding new requirements for tankers entering US waters and imposed
unlimited liability on shipowners whose vessels cause pollution.
One unintended effect of the unlimited liability clause has been to keep
some responsible shipowners out of US waters. 'The good shipowners can't get
the level of insurance cover the US wants, while the lousy ones don't
bother,' says Mr Mike Plumridge, deputy secretary of the Nautical Institute.
'The US could end up with the world's scrapyard ships.'
The growing move towards inspection of vessels in the ports where they dock
also weakens global regulation of shipping safety. Port state control, as
this is known, undermines the supervisory role which should be exercised by
the flag state, the country under whose flag the vessel sails.
If inspection moves from the flag states to the local port authorities, it
will become difficult to maintain common standards. In some parts of the
world, port control could become an excuse for delaying ships unjustifiably
to extort payments from their owners. 'Shipping is a global industry,' says
Mr Parker. 'Port control could inhibit free trade.'
It is this concern to balance the traditional self-regulation enjoyed by the
shipping industry with the need to reduce the risks to seafarers and the
environment that lies at the heart of current debate.
The industry points out that the openness of the maritime market has
produced enormous benefits for the shipper and meant that shipping costs are
no higher in real terms than they were 30 years ago. Consumers have also
benefited from this cost control.
Resolving the conflicts between flexibility and safety will not be easy and
may mean a change in much cherished shipping practices. But it will be
difficult to reverse the developments currently under way. Shipowners, it
seems, will have to find a way to adapt to a patchwork of regional rules and
port inspections.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Paris and Algiers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
During the past month the situation in Algeria has continued to get worse,
and France has become more deeply embroiled in it. On August 3, five French
citizens were killed in Algiers, in an attack for which the Armed Islamic
Group (GIA) claimed responsibility. The GIA is a radical group which has
been winning supporters from the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) since 1992,
when the army intervened to cancel elections in which the FIS was about to
win an overall majority.
The killing happened in Algeria, but the French government reacted by
clamping down on suspected Islamic militants in France. At the same time Mr
Charles Pasqua, the French interior minister, complained that other western
governments had failed to act against people 'who claim to be official
representatives of the FIS' on their territory - a criticism not
surprisingly rejected by the governments concerned.
By arresting Islamic militants in France, Mr Pasqua risks drawing the
conflict on to French soil. He has also declared his full support for the
regime in Algeria. The choice there, according to him, 'lies between the
capacity of the present regime to control the situation and the arrival of
the fundamentalists in power'.
Mr Pasqua thus trespassed on the domain of his colleague Alain Juppe,
minister of foreign affairs, whose view of the situation in Algeria is
rather more nuanced. A year ago Mr Juppe said that the status quo there was
'not tenable', and that security measures alone could not offer a solution.
He advocates opening 'a political perspective', by preparing for new
elections.
He also indignantly rejects the notion that France's position is one of
'unconditional support' for the Algerian authorities. But he is not ready to
attach political conditions to France's financial aid, by insisting on
respect for human rights and a genuine dialogue with all opposition parties,
as other western governments have suggested.
France's dislike of violence is entirely justified, and its fear of an
Islamic regime in Algeria is understandable. What it has to face up to is
that the counter-violence of the present Algerian regime offers no guarantee
of avoiding such an outcome, while the longer it goes on the bloodier and
more unmanageable the denouement is likely to be. For that, western
governments will share the responsibility so long as they do not make their
aid strictly conditional on the start of a political process which offers a
credible hope of ending the violence: an amnesty, followed by free elections
under international supervision.
Meanwhile, for Mr Pasqua to import the conflict into France, effectively
targeting France's largest racial minority, is rightwing populist politics
of the worst sort. Race relations in general, and relations between Moslems
and other communities in particular, are bad enough in western Europe as it
is.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Midsummer Blair-mania
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major is still prime minister of the United Kingdom. It is probable
that he will remain in the post until the next general election, which need
not be held until spring 1997. The outcome is unpredictable: the
Conservatives are capable, given the will, of winning again.
These statements of the obvious should serve as reminders that the upsurge
of sympathetic interest in the Labour party under Mr Tony Blair, its new
leader, could be a midsummer bubble. Even if that is not so, Blair-mania is
out of proportion. Mr Rupert Murdoch has famously said that he could imagine
circumstances in which he, and presumably by extension some of his
newspapers, might support Mr Blair. The polls register improbable leads for
Labour. Some business leaders are looking afresh at the opposition.
In consequence, there is a sense that the period of Conservative rule that
began in 1979 is drawing to a close. The electorate is disenchanted with the
Tories. There is no need to draw on anecdote or the polls to demonstrate
this. It has been shown in successive by-elections, local council contests
and the poor performance of Conservative candidates for the European
parliament.
The government's ill-fortune persists, as shown by Mr Michael Portillo's
imprudent and hasty acceptance of legal advice that European Union
legislation on subsidised public procurement contracts necessarily excludes
favourable treatment for disabled workers. The just-promoted employment
secretary may be correct in law, and a doughty Eurosceptic, but he is wrong
in politics. The administration is still walking on banana-skins.
What is questionable is the degree of lasting, solid support for Labour. The
hard evidence - votes cast in recent elections - is that the party is not
doing any better than might be expected of it in mid-term, and rather worse,
considering the level of unemployment and the contempt in which the
Conservatives are held, than it should. The Labour leader is untried. He is
a telegenic, well-spoken politician whose first appearances have held out
much promise. That is all. He has many tests ahead. He must manage, and
survive, his party's autumn conference. He has yet to appear in parliament
as leader of his party. The voters will want to see how he performs under
fire.
In the longer run the electorate will need to be convinced that the Labour
party itself has changed. There are already left-wing rumblings against Mr
Blair's non-socialist precepts. These can be ignored, provided the
mainstream of party thinking is running in the right direction. The new
leader's unique selling point, that the support of the community strengthens
the individual, has to be translated into a programme. The election
manifesto, when it comes, must be costed, the tax implications worked out,
and the whole sold to a public that is wearily sceptical of all political
blandishments. Then, and only then, will a change of government be likely.

Hope Steven Astaire, 42, the fast-talking amateur jockey who runs the family
stockbroking firm, Astaire &amp; Partners, has more success with his latest
business venture than he does with his gee-gees. Astaire, who has only won
six of his 150 races, has scoured the world and decided to open his first
overseas office in . . .Israel.
Tel Aviv is not the most obvious first port of call for brokers intent on
international expansion. Its stock market does not even rank in the major
emerging stock market indices. But Israel is politically stable,
under-broked and has lots of wealthy citizens. Throw in the Middle East
'peace dividend', and it's worth a gamble.
Astaire, whose uncle Edgar runs a rival firm in London's West End, says he
is the first British broker to open in Israel and only the second foreign
firm to have a presence. Fear of upsetting Arab clients may have been one
reason why the big US firms have shied away in the past. But Lehman Brothers
is on its way, so it may not be long before Steven Astaire's aim of making
handsome profits in one of the world's last under-broked financial centres
turns into a pipe dream.

The good news is that Sir William Purves, HSBC Holdings' panjandrum, has
finally held his first press conference in London to talk about the profits
of his giant banking group which gobbled up Midland Bank some time ago. The
bad news is that Sir Willie - who has presented results in his beloved Hong
Kong until now - did not let off any verbal fireworks.
Instead, journalists were treated to a benign canter through the figures.
Apart from ruminating about what 'my old mother in Edinburgh' might think
about the group's bond losses and a passing reference to 'the governor of
the Bank of England, and whatnot', Sir Willie's dry humour was kept under
control. An entertaining first outing, but Sir Willie can do better.

Northwest Airlines is flying high. Or at least one of its co-chairmen has
been. Returning from a rafting holiday in Idaho, Gary Wilson was passing
through the security screening point at Boise airport when he was
apprehended by security officials puzzled by an X-ray image of an
oddly-shaped object in his bag.
On close examination, the object turned out to be a kind of pipe, and with
it were 2.7 grams of marijuana. The red-faced Wilson was fined Dollars 500
and, on reporting back to Northwest Airlines' head office in St Paul,
Minnesota, suspended himself from duty pending an internal inquiry.
In all probability, he will soon be back at his desk. After all, he is more
of an investor than an executive; with Alfred Checchi, the other
co-chairman, he led a Dollars 3.6bn buy-out of Northwest in 1989 which took
the airline private. Also, he was off duty at the time, and the airline says
that other employees committing comparable misdemeanours have stayed.
Even so, the turn of events has astonished Northwest's staff. Wilson is 54,
so hardly falls into the category of the Woodstock generation. 'He's the
last person you would suspect. He's such a button-down, senior type of
person,' said one employee. 'It just goes to show; you never can tell . . .'
Come to think of it, has anyone inspected Sir Colin Marshall's hand-baggage
recently?

FT  16 AUG 94 / Personal View: Clever trick but the cracks remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Prof JOHN KAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation of the water industry was, and remains, the least popular
and most problematic of utility privatisations. In the first comprehensive
regulatory review, Ian Byatt, water industry regulator and former Treasury
civil servant who has become the most respected of public utility
regulators, seems to have pulled off the trick of simultaneously satisfying
water companies, consumers and the stock market.
Water bills should rise by far less in the next five years than in the last,
and yet water share prices emerged at the end of July with substantial
pluses across the board.
But this has been achieved by papering over some of the large cracks in the
structure of the industry. The most important of these cracks is the divorce
between economic regulation and environmental regulation - between the
determination of what water quality standards should be and how they should
be paid for.
This divorce seems to have much to commend it. We all want our water to be
safe, and what it costs should always be secondary. This is not the subject
of concern - the days when you risked contracting cholera or typhoid from
British drinking water disappeared a long time ago.
What is at issue is whether concentrations of pesticides, already far below
levels at which there is any likely danger to health, should be reduced
further - from one thimbleful per swimming pool of water to one
tea-spoonful.
Excessive quantities of nitrates in water can cause blue baby syndrome. But
the incidence of this is negligible and the last case occurred more than 20
years ago. We can be less sanguine about the ways we dispose of our sewage.
So how much should we be expected to pay for higher quality standards? In
other markets, such as the car or holiday market, people make up their own
minds - a Rolls Royce for some, a Lada for others; you can visit Mont-ego
Bay while I go to Black-pool.
In the water industry, the archetype of natural monopolies, the quality of
water supplied is the same for everyone. You can ask some people what they
want, but only those who have undertaken their own extensive research would
find it easy to answer the question: What price would you pay to have x mg
of nitrates per x litres of water rather than y mg?. Nor is it clear how you
would analyse the different answers.
The exercise in customer consultation which the Office of Water Services
required the water companies to undertake - the preparation of a 'market
plan' for a product for which there is no competitive market - does not
seem, in the end, to have led very far.
Most people's answer to the question about spending Pounds x to have x mg of
nitrates per 1,000 litres of water rather than y mg would be: 'Someone
qualified should decide that.'
The basic weakness of the existing structure is that there is no one with
responsibility for posing such questions or implementing the results.
Water quality standards are imposed by the European Union with virtually no
regard to, and certainly no knowledge of, what the likely cost implications
are for the countries on which they are imposed.
European Union involvement in all this is a piece of pure opportunism. In
the 1980s, Brussels saw a chance to seize the moral high ground from member
states by aggressive and populist promotion of environmental standards. It
is, as a matter of fact, difficult to think of a better issue for the
application of subsidiarity than water quality.
If we choose to drink and bathe in dirty water, that is really our own
business, and for Brussels to fine us when we admit to doing so is only to
add public insult to private injury.
But whether it is sensible for the EU to be concerned with these matters or
not, it is the EU which has control of the standards, and they are enforced
in the UK by government agencies which have no real discretion in
implementation of the rules.
The economic regulator - Ofwat - has to reconcile its obligations to ensure
the proper financing of water company functions with tariffs that customers
can afford and are willing to pay.
The answer Ofwat has adopted has been to squeeze all expenditure that is not
legally necessary to keep rises in charges within acceptable levels while
meeting EU requirements.
In the south west, where the cost of waste water standards is greatest, this
objective cannot be squared. In the rest of the country, other kinds of
investment - to meet growing water demand, in security and replacement -
have been arbitrarily cut back. That may matter to customers, but no-one has
asked them.
The principal argument for water privatisation was that it would allow a
more rational approach to investment planning.
It was intended to be an antidote to the decades in which those in the water
industry put forward ambitious plans for capital spending which were
successively squeezed by a Treasury anxious to keep the charges down and
avoid burdens on taxpayers.
Five years on, substitute Ofwat for Treasury: otherwise, nothing much has
changed.

Sir, The brouhaha about the Loi Toubon ('The French choose their words

Notably, public institutions were enjoined to have someone write up, on a
daily basis, a 'word for the day' on strip-boards put up at various points
in the building. The 'telephone' became (in translation) a 'distant talker'.
And further shenanigans to this effect. The positive side of the whole
affair was that more people than usual started smiling, and linguistic
'purity' started dissolving in guffaws while people went about the ordinary
business of communicating with each other according to their natural
compulsions.
If the French politician is not careful, he might succeed in prompting the
comment that while the French are a great people, the only problem is they
speak a language called French]

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J BLANCHARD SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I must agree with the title if not with the content of 'Surprising
claim about market testing in efficiency study' (Letters: August 9). The
fact remains that value for money has been achieved with the use of external
consultants. The taxpayer has seen a net saving on a range of projects
through the use of outside consultants.
Furthermore, many agencies compete and succeed in attracting private sector
work through increased efficiency as a result of the implementation of
consultants' recommendations. There will be consultants who do not achieve
the quality or results required and they will not be used again - an option
not available with permanent departments.
An undertaking of the stature of the Market Testing Initiative should be
judged objectively and as a whole, and not, as seems to be the fashion these
days, be subject to sound bites taken out of context.
Should a sound-bite be required, however, the following, drawn from the
Efficiency Unit scrutiny report, may be useful: 'Our scrutiny has left us in
no doubt that consultants have, and will continue to have, significant
'added value' to contribute to departments and agencies.'

politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Readers concerned about developments in West Africa will welcome the
balanced approach and relevant conclusions of your editorial, 'Time to help
Nigeria' (August 3).
As you pointed out, it is for Nigerians, soldiers and civilians, to resolve
the present crisis. This does not exclude appropriate measures by British
and other governments to ensure a speedy end to military rule and
installation of a civilian coalition under Chief Moshood Abiola as
president. He was the victor of the presidential election, organised on June
12 1993 by the military regime.
His alleged 'treason', resulting in arrest and trial, derives from the fact
that he won the contest, against the preferred candidate of the military
leadership, while his Yoruba affiliations aroused misgivings in parts of the
north. He won a clear majority in Kano State, home to the opposition
candidate and also to General Sani Abacha, current head of state.
After a year that has seen the military reject the election results, then
'withdraw' only to resume power shortly afterwards, Abiola has recently
asserted his right to assume the presidency under the military-approved
constitution.
At the time of the election his support bridged the religious and ethnic
divisions within the country. His insistence on a negotiated outcome and his
rejection of violence has kept open the possibility of peaceful compromise.
I have recently returned from South Africa and your comparison with the
successful transition in that country is apposite.
The military will best serve its own interests and those of Nigeria by
distancing itself from politics, as in 1979, and giving loyal support to an
incoming civilian regime, restoring the freely elected legislatures, state
and national, as well as the elected state governors. The new regime would
be transitional only in the sense that, after a suitable interval, two or
three years, new elections should be held but no longer restricted to only
two parties.

<TEXT>
Maurice Saatchi may not know it, but in the past few days there are those in
the City of London who have bestowed on him a symbolic significance as the
first cuckoo of the advertising industry's spring.
For much of the wintry 1990s, the chairman of the world's highest-profile
advertising group (though these days far from its largest), has delegated to
his henchmen the task of briefing City observers on the group's relentlessly
poor performance.
Last week, at briefings on the group's interim results, Maurice Saatchi took
centre stage, flashing up slides showing impressive upward-rising trend
lines. 'His appearance is as good an indicator as any of an upturn in the
sector,' said one industry expert.
Apart from this personal appearance there are other, more conventional,
signs that advertising - which paid with a huge hangover for its excesses in
the 1980s - is getting ready to party again.
Zenith, the media-buying company owned by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, sees worldwide
advertising expenditure growing, at current prices, by 5.5 per cent this
year, compared with 3.4 per cent in 1993. In December, Zenith forecast that
1995 advertising expenditure would grow by 6.5 per cent; its latest estimate
is 7.4 per cent growth. Similarly, the forecast for 1996 was uprated this
month from 7.2 per cent to 8.8 per cent.
This growth level will not be geographically uniform, however: Europe is
expected to see 8.1 per cent growth in 1995 and 9.7 per cent in 1996; the
US, 4.1 per cent next year and 4.4 per cent in 1996; and Japan, 1.4 per cent
for 1995 and 2.4 per cent the following year.
Saatchi set the trend in March, when it announced it had returned to the
black, for the first time since 1988, in its full-year results for 1993;
last week's first-half figures showed pre-tax profits up 68 per cent to
Pounds 15.3m. At WPP, the agency which supplanted Saatchi as the biggest in
the world and which also announced its interim results last week, pre-tax
profits rose 50 per cent to Pounds 36.2m.
But not everyone is getting excited. Mr Martin Sorrell, the ex-Saatchi
finance director who now heads WPP, flatly refuses to exaggerate the
industry's prospects. He says if the company's performance for the first six
months of this year is examined, there has been 'continued significant
growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America, in the UK, and a small pick-up in
continental Europe. The bottom line is it's better than it has been.'
As Mr Sorrell says, advertising spending has lagged the wider upturn in the
economy. The advertising cycle is an exaggeration of the economic cycle,
says Ms Lorna Tilbian, media analyst with S G Warburg Securities, the
investment bank. 'It always grows faster than the economy at the top and
always falls further than the economy at the bottom,' mainly because it is a
variable, rather than a fixed cost.
Before the last recession took hold in the early 1990s, the industry
believed it had gained immunity from malaises afflicting the wider economy.
It was the 1981 recession, which was largely confined to manufacturing
rather than service industry, which gave rise to this belief.
According to Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst with Goldman Sachs, the US
investment house, in the 1980s many in the industry believed that companies
had 'understood the defensive imperative of continuing to advertise through
the recession in order to protect market share'.
From the early 1980s until 1989, Ms Tilbian says the advertising industry
was 'one big jamboree. It was acquisitions every month and all in different
geographical areas and in different related services'. WPP and Saatchi paid
inflated prices for US agencies, acquiring huge debts to fund the
acquisitions.
The event that sums up the era was Saatchi's abortive bid for Midland Bank
in 1987. 'Everybody talks about the bid as the time when the business was at
its maddest,' says one industry observer. 'Its delusions of grandeur were
such that, as a simple service business, it could bid for one of the
clearing banks, and actually expect to be taken seriously. And for a moment
it was.' Midland, roughly twice as big as Saatchi, rejected the idea out of
hand.
Unlike the recession of a decade ago, the 1990s downturn sank many in the
sector. Saatchi and WPP are only now getting debts down to manageable
proportions. From having operating margins of a high of more than 13 per
cent in the peak year of 1988, Saatchi reached a trough of 2.3 per cent
three years later. The broad thrust of the restructuring at both Saatchi and
WPP has been to cut jobs, reduce costs and sell non-core businesses acquired
during the jamboree. These moves combined with the more recent increases in
revenes should bring margins at both groups back up to 10 per cent by 1996.
Given these signs of advertising's recovery, could the whole giddy process
of boom and bust start again? No chance, is the consensus. For a start,
advertisers have learnt certain lessons during the lean times which they
will want to continue to apply.
For example, a recent survey conducted jointly by the Financial Times and
the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, among chief executives and
finance and marketing directors, found a sharper scrutiny of budgets and a
greater demand for accountability from advertising agencies.
Perhaps the most significant change of all, which will prevent the windfall
profits that advertising saw during the last boom, is the change in the way
agencies are remunerated. Commission of 15 per cent on a client's media
spending used to be the norm. A survey by specialist UK advertising
accountants Willott Kingston Smith recently found that agencies are now
about as likely to get their income from fees as commission in the UK, and
the picture is likely to be much the same in continental Europe and north
America.
Overall, the move from fees to commission is seen as a stabilising factor by
Andrew Brown, director-general of the UK's Advertising Association, the
industry umbrella organisation. 'The commission system has swings and
roundabouts. Agencies do well on the commission system when the business is
doing well. In times of recession, agencies would prefer to be on fees,' he
says. Some way has to be found to allow agencies to run themselves more
sensibly, avoiding the huge ups and downs, he adds.
Finally, Ms Tilbian of S G Warburg Securities, argues that, this time round,
agencies will be forced to 'stick to the knitting'. No more will they be
able to persuade the City that the dreaded word 'synergy' has any meaning in
the sector. It was synergy which was supposed to have justified the binge of
acquisitions by agencies of management consultancies, public relations
firms, recruitment agencies - and even Saatchi's assault on banking. The
synergies proved illusory and many of the businesses have since been sold
off.
'At the end of the day you're as strong as your weakest link when you try to
sell all your services to your clients,' says Ms Tilbian. 'If one of them
botches up, then you could lose your most valued business. For advertising,
it's back to basics.'

FT  16 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Risks of Mercosur deal slight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN SINCLAIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The flaws you point to in the recent Mercosur agreement (Editorial:
'Freeing Latin American trade', August 9) may not be as obvious as you make
out.
While Argentina has agreed to raise tariffs on capital goods to 14 per cent
as a concession to Brazilian demands, in exchange Brazil has agreed to lower
tariffs from 20 to 14 per cent. Since Brazil's economy is roughly twice that
of Argentina's and its ability to absorb imports proportionately higher, one
may take the view that the effect of the agreement on access to the joint
market will not have changed very much. Moreover, Brazil's own economic
policies have led it to reduce its tariffs and open up its market to imports
over the past four years. One may expect it to abide by the recent agreement
and continue the trend with its Mercosur partners not only as an extension
of the existing policy, but also as a result of pressure from Argentina,
which will not want to see back-peddling on the deal. The pressures on
Brazil will become even greater if the most committed of the free marketeers
in the area, Chile, joins the group.
Bilateral trade between Brazil and Argentina has increased more than
fourfold since 1990. Over the same period Brazil's trade with the rest of
the world has also been rising, and its trade surplus of more than USDollars
1bn a month maintained. Surely this is the best evidence that Mercosur will
not lead to inwardness.
The risks that the members may be led to believe they have an alternative to
global competitiveness and that the agreement may make regional integration
more difficult is, I would have thought, slight.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Many 'food miles' apart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HUGH RAVEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report (Management: 'Granting an end to the Food Trade Gap', August
11) 'a breakthrough for the UK's vegetable industry' in the form of lettuces
and celery from Cambridgeshire being exported to Belgium. In April, you
reported on a 50-fold increase in the past 10 years of imports of lettuces
from Spain.
The absurdity of this reflects the perversity of the UK's response to its
trade gap in food and drink - a rising proportion of which is accounted for
by foods which could be produced domestically. The Ministry of Agriculture
and its agency Food From Britain have said the gap should be closed via
export promotion rather than import substitution. One of the many
consequences has been an increase in the distances food is transported.
According to Department of Transport, in the 15 years to 1990 more than a
third of the increase in demand for freight was accounted for by food, drink
and tobacco - which account for well under a sixth of the UK economy.
Those who worry about air pollution, congestion and new roads should ponder
these increasing 'food miles' when deciding what to buy on their next trip
to the supermarket.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Arts: Drawn to two dimensions - William Packer reviews two
of the Tate Gallery's latest bulk acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Big shows apart, the Tate Gallery is always worth a visit whether for the
latest shift in the permanent hang, the return to the light of a
long-forgotten treasure, or simply a sight of a recent acquisition. Not that
this is a guarantee of pleasurable approval, you understand, but certainly
of interest - lip-pursing, breath-sucking interest.
Two bulk acquisitions figure prominently at the moment, one of drawings from
the last 15 years by British sculptors, the other of comparatively recent
British figurative painting. Of the two, the Sculptors' Drawings, a
collection put together by the Weltkunst Foundation under the advice of the
late Adrian Ward-Jackson and presented to the Tate between 1986 and 1991, is
the more contentious.
The accompanying pamphlet sets the tone: 'The early 1980s saw the emergence
of a new generation of British sculptors . . . who looked beyond the
traditions of modern Western sculpture . . .All . . extend the possibilities
of drawing in adventurous ways.'
Richard Long, with one of his mud dribbles, and a diagram on graph paper of
a parquet floor by Rachel Whiteread are also included. The Long 'involved
dipping the paper in wet mud and then letting the water run off in rivulets
. . . Long often uses mud from the river Avon near his home in Bristol, but
has here taken his medium from the Mississippi.' Gosh.
So here we have the same old, I mean young, gang pushed at us yet again, and
in the familiar breathless, self-justifying curator-speak, as though there
were never any true sculptors in England before them, or beside them, or
since. It is the jargon that gives the game away, all that posturing stuff
about 'looking beyond', 'challenging', 'breadth of creative vision',
'extending possibilities in adventurous ways'.
And of course these artists do no such thing. Miss Whiteread's parquet
image, tastefully rendered in correcting fluid, may have its 'outer areas
(the writer means by this the nearer edges or facets) rendered in
elevation', but it is no less conventional an isometric image for that. And
what of Long's antecedents - Morris Louis, Max Ernst, Rorschasch tests,
Alexander Cozens? Beautifully worked as they are, do Anish Kapoor's lush,
abstracted images of orifices and other organs really 'communicate across
barriers of history and culture?' They seem pretty straight-forward surreal
abstraction to me, shades of Ernst and Miro and early Pollock. Antony
Gormley's figure outlines are, well, figure outlines. As for Alison
Wilding's 'Angry' drawings, 'suggesting her state of mind when she made the
apparently violent and staccato marks across the drawn forms', we can only
sympathise with her frustration at an apparent failure.
The myth persists that sculptors make good drawings by virtue of their being
sculptors. The truth is that they make good drawings if they make good
drawings. A working diagram (Richard Deacon) is still a working diagram, a
scrawl (Wilding), even a useful scrawl (Shirazeh Houshiary) a scrawl still.
Stephen Cox's Etruscan Studies, two blind masks with an ineptly constructed
nose and mouth apiece, are hardly studies in any true sense at all.
That the Tate should show and indeed collect such things is entirely
defensible, for they are the currency of contemporary activity, and a gift
is a gift after all. What is questionable is only the vapid belief in their
cosmic significance, and to the exclusion of so much else. There is an awful
lot of other drawing out there, of such different kinds. What of that?
By contrast, the Wilkie Gift is simplicity itself. David Wilkie, who died in
1992 at the age of 71, was a man of modest means who nevertheless built up a
significant collection of contemporary British art, with a particular
leaning towards the mystical and symbolic. By his will, a part of it was to
be offered to public collections, of which the Tate was one. In the event it
accepted some 30 drawings by Frank Auerbach, and a further eight paintings
by him, which extends the holding in that artist four-fold overall and more
than doubles the paintings. Whether there should be such a preponderance is
debatable, but while the drawings remain unseen, the paintings are of a very
high quality and, with the studies after Titian, the Rimbaud series, and the
classical allegorical compositions, certainly broaden his representation at
the Tate.
Two Winifred Nicholsons, a fine large reclining nude by Craigie Aitchison, a
small early Michael Andrews, and three compositions by John Lessore,
including an imposing allegory of Diana surprised by Acteon in the life-room
at the Byam Shaw, complete the bunch.
Current displays at the Tate Gallery, Millbank SW1: Sculptors' Drawings
presented by the Weltkunst Foundation, until October 30. The Wilkie Gift,
until August 21.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Arts: Runnicles opens with Mahler's 8th - Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems to be a tradition that the Edinburgh Festival should open with a
concert that has a strong Scottish content. There have been occasions in the
past when this has looked like a duty to be performed as quickly as possible
before the real festival gets underway, painless enough if washed down with
a dram of whisky - but not this year.
With evident delight at its good fortune, Edinburgh has awoken to the fact
that it is the birthplace of one of the world's foremost younger conductors.
For 15 years or so Donald Runnicles has learnt his craft in the opera houses
of Europe, progressing from Freiburg to Vienna and Bayreuth, and from there
to San Francisco, where he is now Music Director. With such a prestigious
curriculum vitae he has certainly earned his place heading the opening night
of his home city's international festival.
Among the Scottish contingent, another body which has won a regular slot for
itself is the Edinburgh Festival Chorus, so most opening nights are choral.
This year's choice was Mahler's Eighth Symphony, conceived on such a massive
scale that it can hardly fail to provide a suitably festive start.
At the Usher Hall, neither the playing of the Royal Scottish National
Orchestra nor the choral singing (including the RSNO Junior Chorus) was
unfailingly tidy, but there was a thrilling overall arc to the performance.
After Tennstedt's renowned Mahler's Eighth in London one came out feeling
that one had penetrated some deep inner conviction of the composer, whereas
here any time for communing was swept aside by elation and sheer excitement.
Even the slow introduction to the Faust setting tingled with tension, as
though Goethe's mountain wilderness was ready to explode with all the new
emotions of the romantic era.
Runnicles gave easily the most impulsive performance of the symphony that I
have heard. Sometimes this meant making a quick dash for the next climax;
more often long passages developed an undercurrent that swept the music
irresistibly along, as in the rapturous solos of the baritone Pater
Ecstaticus (the strong Gregory Yurisich) and tenor Doctor Marianus (a
strained Peter Svensson, wrestling with the impossible).
Among a decent band of soloists there were two fine mezzos in Catherine Keen
and Patricia Bardon. Jane Eaglen continues to go from strength to strength,
but Janice Watson's Soprano 1 sounded unexpectedly constricted. Susan
Chilcott sang a heavenly Mater Gloriosa off-stage; Gwynne Howell lacked
incisiveness as the bass.
As the Scottish audience recognised, however, this was the conductor's
evening. In everything Runnicles did here - the seething blend of textures,
the irresistible flow of energy, the high-octane passion - I heard an
inspiring future conductor of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. Now that
Edinburgh has a real opera-house, how about a festival production?

FT  16 AUG 94 / Arts: Musical apocalypse and a biography - David Murray
reviews John Tavener's Prom commission and Mike Westbrook's modern
jazz-inspired opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We had two ambitious pieces of music-theatre at the weekend, on Friday and
Sunday: respectively Mike Westbrook's opera Coming Through Slaughter at the
Queen Elizabeth Hall (part of the 'Now You See It' non-festival), and John
Tavener's Prom commission The Apocalypse. The latter had massive,
well-rehearsed forces for the Albert Hall - all over it, indeed; Westbrook's
piece used just seven singers, a string quartet and a trombone, and still
looked a bit starved of rehearsal time (or money, or both). Yet it was
easily ten times as interesting.
That was because in his devotion to Russian Orthodoxy, Tavener is more
anxious than ever not to be 'interesting'. In this Apocalypse, a biblical
paraphrase by his spiritual advisor Mother Thekla, the composer himself
vanishes. It consists of nine 'Ikons of the Revelation', vignettes or
summaries from St. John's visionary text, with a prologue and epilogue, and
interludes for a string quartet playing slow chromatic glissandi.
Every part of it is ritualised: the plain choral chanting or shouting, the
soloists' roles (sometimes monotone declamation, more often up-and-down
scalic lines ornamented with Byzantine melismata), the bursts of heavy brass
or gongs and tam-tam from the top gallery. Nearly all the music is very
slow. The effects are less dramatic than starkly heraldic - or 'iconic', I
suppose; nothing develops. It took two-and-a-quarter hours, without an
interval.
In short, unearthly peace reigned while we were invited to meditate upon the
devotional words. ('A wonder in Heaven] A great red dragon - Seven heads,
ten horns. And he waits to eat up the child.') Tavener's work has been
confined to deciding how to organise and divide the text between his
performers and their prescribed manners, and to finding suitable sonorities
for weighty moments and for punctuation. The composer is never heard to
intervene; no personal accent is detectable, not even the self-effacing
winsomeness of The Protecting Veil, his unexpected hit in the 1989 Proms.
Richard Hickox conducted the City of London Sinfonia, the Sinfonia Chorus
and the New London Children's Choir with loyal efficiency. Among the many
soloists, Thomas Randle's tenor St. John was unflaggingly fervent, Patricia
Rozario and Ruby Philogene melting (as the Woman Clothed with the Sun and
the Whore of Babylon), the counter-tenors Christopher Robson and David
Hurley coolly stylish. To 'review' this music as music, however, would be to
review the mere scaffolding for something else.
Westbrook's modern-jazz-idiom opera has nothing in common with The
Apocalypse but its length (and to a lesser extent, its slow tempi). It was
inspired by Michael Ondaatje's fictional biography of 'Buddy' Bolden, a jazz
cornettist of such early vintage that he left no recordings, and about whom
there are few established facts. After bursting a blood vessel in his last
Easter Parade in New Orleans, he was declared insane and lived in a state
hospital for his last 24 years, working as a barber.
Ondaatje imagined the rest, and Michael Morris has drawn on the novel for a
chain of 16 encapsulated scenes-from-the-life. Most of those amount to
poetic solo songs, bluesy in Westbrook's modern vein (jazz-chromatic,
doleful or wry); there are a few ensembles which raise the pulse. The
overall effect is quite like Weill's original Mahagonny Songspiel, with the
difference that where Mahagonny's characters are symbolic stereotypes,
Westbrook's are treated as historical people with unseen histories.
Morris's economical staging, constrained further by the singers mostly
having to sing from their scores, left a lot to be taken on trust (or read
up from the programme-note). One would like to see the piece more vividly
set out in, say, the Donmar. It has no routine or negligible number, and the
best of them are strongly inventive.
The cast were first-rate: Denise Hector strong and dignified as Buddy's
wife, bright Dorothy Ross as his transient mistress, monumental
bass-baritone Keel Watson as the old friend who haunts his steps. Above all
Wills Morgan's Buddy, a study in charismatic, angst-ridden sulkiness and
bafflement, also displayed a youthful mastery of articulating his music
through his words, and filling the words with sense and feeling. This is a
dramatic singer of uncommon promise.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Arts: Two Weeks with the Queen - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speaking of the blitz, the film director Jean Renoir observed that it would
have been impossible to make a movie like Brief Encounter in Hollywood. What
Hollywood needed, he opined, was a few bombs dropped on it.
The same ungenerous sentiments occur to me every so often when I see a
bland, bright, bumptious assertion of the current Australian self-confidence
that by implication patronises, blames or simply discounts the old country.
Not that I wish anyone to suffer, least of all the culture that gave Rupert
Murdoch and Neighbours to the world, but an awareness of the complexities,
subtleties and agonies forming a national identity would not come amiss.
These curmudgeonly musings are prompted, doubtless unfairly, by Two Weeks
with the Queen, a good-hearted and well-intentioned piece for children at
the Stephen Joseph Theatre in the Round, Scarborough. You can tell that Alan
Ayckbourn is the director since the nasty characters come more horribly to
life than the goodies. Would that he had written the play as well, but it is
adapted by Mary Morris from a novel by Morris Gleitzman, ex-pats both, long
since settled in the Antipodes.
Young Colin is sent to stay with his English relations when his brother Luke
is fatally stricken with cancer. His innocent frankness in referring openly
to the big C provides a lesson to the evasive adults; and he himself grows
up a little after wild schemes to intercede with the Queen and fly the best
doctor in the world back to Oz to cure his brother. He befriends a gay
couple, one of whom is dying of a newer and deadlier plague; and even
manages to breathe some gumption into his pampered hypochondriac cousin, a
lumpish wimp with psychosomatic dandruff.
The six-strong company plays 28 roles, setting up some sort of speed record
for quick costume changes as the action whisks us from Australia to English
suburbia via an airliner, not to mention sundry hospitals and Buckingham
Palace. Roger Glossop's design centres ingeniously on what look like crates;
their lids and sides open like flaps on which are the necessities for
scene-changes - toys, books, cushions, plants. The plot's swifter moments
(there are at least two in the first half) whizz by with tinkling piano
accompaniment and flickering lights as in a silent film.
Unfortunately, for an adult audience it all seems protracted and
predictable. The play comes to life with the nerdish English uncle and aunt
who might have come from an Ayckbourn play, or even Mike Leigh.
With their pea-sized imagination, a patriotic pride in 'the biggest hardware
centre in Greater London', the cultural identity of a shopping mall,
knee-jerk prejudices (anti- monarchists, take note of how the production has
its cake and eats it) and terminal mean-mindedness, they seem a pretty good
symbol of Britain today. Philip Bird and Sophia Winter must get their teeth
into real Ayckbourn roles as soon as possible.
But then so should Dorothy Atkinson (specialising in startled nervousness),
Peter Forbes (saddled with an improbably nice gay character) and Sean
McKenzie, who makes the naff cousin's revolt against his parents almost
cheer-worthy.
But the show depends on Tamblyn Lord, who created the part of Colin in the
Sydney world premiere. Irrepressibly optimistic, touchingly cheerful,
exhaustingly (for this spectator at least) boyish, he even manages to
silence our puzzlement at Colin's supposed age (anything from eight to 18,
to judge by his mixture of the naive and the resourceful). It's enough to
make you want to run out and stamp on a koala.
At the Stephen Joseph Theatre until Sept 10, then to the National Theatre

It is Viennese Night in BBC Proms 1994 with music by Johann and Josef
Strauss, Lehar, Suppe (the Light Cavalry, what else?) and Mozart (7.30 Radio
3). Floyd On Italy is beginning to make me wonder how reliable this man's
previous series were. His ideas about Italian food look more and more like
English and French ideas merely projected against Italian backgrounds. It is
not the Italians but the English who eat pasta smothered in meat sauce, and
not the Italians but the French who begin their recipes with great dollops
of butter and end with lashings of cream. Though Italian cooking varies
regionally it relies almost everywhere on superb fresh ingredients,
generally cooked separately, with a marked absence of fancy sauces, or
indeed fancy anything. You would not gather this from the BBC2 series
(8.30). Channel 4 begins a repeat of Lipstick On Your Collar, the last
series by Dennis Potter to be shown before his death. Set mainly in the War
Office of the 1950s it again uses miming to popular music in its most
successful scenes (10.00).

FT  16 AUG 94 / Technology: Special agents - Intelligent gophers and experts
are here
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First thing Monday morning. You switch on your office computer. Your
electronic secretary greets you with a suggested schedule for the day, a
run-down of your messages in order of importance, and a summary of articles
and reports retrieved overnight from an international information network.
It also reminds you to arrange meetings and travel plans for a business trip
two weeks away. You tell it to go ahead. It scans your diary to work out
when you can fit in some meetings and sends out an agent to negotiate the
timing of the meetings with your colleagues' agents.
It then sends out an agent to comb the airlines' computer systems for you.
It selects the cheapest flight offered by one of your preferred airlines
that fits your schedule. You approve its choice and it completes the deal by
arranging for your credit card agent to give your card details to the
airline's sales agent.
That scenario takes place around 2000, when electronic secretaries,
librarians and other agents have become commonplace. They 'know' their
users' likes and dislikes and can navigate their way through the most
intricate computer systems.
The technology is now emerging from research laboratories that might allow
this vision to become real. So-called intelligent agents - sophisticated
pieces of software capable of acting on behalf of users - are being
developed with the ability to scan data banks, to schedule meetings and to
handle routine clerical tasks.
Ovum, a UK-based consultancy, estimates that the markets for products and
services using intelligent agents could reach more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds
1.2bn) in the US and more than Dollars 1.5bn in Europe by 2000.
That confidence in the market's potential is shared by a growing number of
suppliers and developers, such as AT&amp;T, Sharp, Hewlett-Packard, IBM,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and General Magic, which are beginning
to deliver products designed for a range of industrial sectors, notably
telecommunications and computing.
Many examples of simple intelligent agents are already in use, performing
tasks such as retrieving information, automating repetitive tasks and
filtering extraneous information.
For example, the White House uses intelligent agents to retrieve
information. It has collaborated with MIT to devise a system that deals with
the hundreds of requests for information it receives via Internet every day.
Agents are used to match keywords in the requests with relevant mailing
lists.
A loan authorisation system devised by Andersen Consulting exemplifies the
way that intelligent agents can be used to address repetitive tasks.
Using this system, about 80 per cent of all loan decisions are made by
agents; only problematic cases are examined by humans.
The ability to filter information is demonstrated in another Andersen
Consulting product, the Commander Exception Monitor, which it produced in
collaboration with Comshare last September.
The product is used by Hertz, the rental company, to analyse pricing
structures in the car rental business. By excluding trivial changes, the
system reduces the equivalent of 28,000 spreadsheets of information about
prices, locations, sizes and type of car into something that can be easily
monitored by its pricing executives.
The agents that will bring the early commercial success are likely to be
those that concentrate on information filtering, in the view of Jeanne
Harris of Andersen Consulting. 'The kind of business problems that we solve
first are time-consuming, involve large amounts of data and are boring,' she
says.
Andersen Consulting believes that agents can be classified into four basic
types. At the simplest level, 'gopher' agents are capable of executing
simple tasks based on rules and assumptions, such as performing daily file
back-up routines.
'Assistant' agents are capable of making decisions, such as scheduling
meetings, as well as executing tasks. 'Expert' agents have specific
expertise that allows them to advise or train the user.
'Analyst' agents are capable of making inferences or suppositions. They can
identify patterns and trends, and can also infer the reasons behind them.
They might, for instance, be able to infer from an article search that
articles on a related subject would be of interest to the user.
Some agents may also be able to negotiate. BT, for example, envisages that
agents will eventually be able to negotiate with each other on behalf of
their respective owners - the caller and telecoms companies - to find the
optimum mix of bandwidth, price and time for making a call.
For researchers in the field of intelligent agents, the problems transcend
the merely technical. The widespread use of intelligent agents will raise
difficult issues about privacy and copyright as organisations allow greater
access to data and information.
Security is another thorny issue raised by agents, particularly 'mobile'
agents, which can move around computer systems. The possibility of agents
roaming the computer networks conjures visions of maverick ones gaining
access to confidential data, destroying files and disabling programs.
Robin Smith, strategic developments manager at BT Laboratories, is concerned
that computer viruses could be spread in the guise of an agent. 'If an agent
could go anywhere on a system, it could be a Trojan horse,' he says.
Another important constraint upon the introduction of intelligent agents is
likely to be the attitude of potential users. People may feel that their
jobs are threatened. Moreover, they are likely to feel nervous about handing
over any responsibility to a computer. 'People will be reluctant to trust
computers to take decisions,' says Harris.
The technical, security and human obstacles that need to be overcome mean
that intelligent agents may take longer than envisaged to fulfil the more
grandiose hopes of their developers. 'Intelligent agents will probably
experience a fall from grace around 1997, as early desktop products fail to
deliver the most lavish futuristic visions,' says Ovum.
But the potential of even the simplest intelligent agents ensures that
agents should be taken seriously by developers and by potential users, it
says. 'Intelligent agents will increase the performance gap between
organisations which use IT effectively, and those which don't'

<TEXT>
Access to international stock market quotes, financial data and business
news is now available via the Internet at considerably lower cost than most
online services.
Quote. Com, a service established by a Nevada company of the same name,
lists 23 exchanges in Europe and North America. Users can access quotes for
stocks, mutual funds, commodities, futures and precious metals.
As part of the basic service offered by Quote. Com for Dollars 9.95 (Pounds
6.40) per month, users can store a portfolio of up to 50 listed financial
instruments and will receive, via E-Mail, a close-of-trading day report.
During the day, they may receive E-Mail alerts if their set price limit
alarms are triggered.
Access to London exchanges or European exchanges costs Dollars 19.95 per
month.
'The Internet gives companies the ability to reach the world market with
very little difficulty,' says Chris Cooper, president of Quote. Com. While
taking advantage of the extensive reach of the Internet, Quote. Com has
avoided the infrastructure and software costs generally associated with
creating a new online service.
Quote. Com's Internet server can be accessed using four connection methods:
telnet (telnet quote. com), E-Mail (info@quote. com), direct Internet
connection on a World Wide Web browser (http://www. quote. com) or via file
transfer protocol (ftp. quote. com).
Voice of America, the international radio broadcasting system funded by the
US government, this week began digital audio newscasts via the Internet. The
10-minute newscasts are available in 15 languages to computer users
worldwide, 24 hours a day. The digitised signals can be converted into sound
by most PCs.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Technology: American R&amp;D rich in paradox - Innovations
multiply as research stagnates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH SHAPLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest survey of US companies' investment in research and development
echoes the 'ingenious paradox' in The Pirates of Penzance, the comic opera
in which hero Frederick was 20 years old and a little boy of five at once -
because he was born in a leap year.
How the total which American companies spend on R&amp;D can remain flat for six
years while so many are vibrantly innovative is a paradox worthy of WS
Gilbert, librettist of The Pirates.
In 1993, US companies' spending on their R&amp;D rose by 4.2 per cent over the
year before, or a tiny 1.9 per cent after inflation, according to Business
Week's annual compilation of industrial R&amp;D, based on Standard and Poor
Compustat data.
Internationally, the 4 per cent rise put US companies slightly ahead of
non-US concerns, whose R&amp;D rose overall by only 2.1 per cent, but well
behind the UK, Switzerland and Sweden, which increased by 10 per cent or
more.
In the US, industrial R&amp;D has been nearly stagnant in real terms since 1987,
according to the National Science Foundation. The total, now Dollars 83bn
(Pounds 54bn) has been held down by nearly level spending by the big auto
concerns and by office equipment and computer manufacturers such as IBM and
Digital Equipment.
Companies had many reasons to cut R&amp;D in the late 1980s. Military contracts
were drying up, so defence companies cut their own military-related R&amp;D. The
pervasive loss of global market share in a host of industries, followed by
the 1990-91 recession, caused chief executives to make further cuts.
President Bill Clinton took office pledging to raise industrial R&amp;D, but his
supporters can no longer blame the stagnation on his predecessors.
Charles Larsen, executive director of the Industrial Research Institute,
believes that R&amp;D spending in 1994 will be little better, since CEOs are
holding back spending to pay for Clinton's health reforms.
So North America's slice of the world's industrial research total will
continue to narrow. In the postwar decades, more than half of all industrial
R&amp;D spending in OECD countries was carried out by US companies. But between
1985 and 1990, the US share declined by five percentage points to 47 per
cent. Japan's share increased by six points to 21 per cent and Europe gained
1 per cent during the same period. By 1993, the US share had narrowed
further, to 43 per cent.
The trend seems unlikely to be reversed by the much-touted
industry-government 'partnerships' which form the core of Clinton's
technology policy. They are too small-scale, and the dollars that firms are
using to match federal funds seem to be taken from other projects.
How can US industry R&amp;D totals stagnate as companies show the very
innovations that R&amp;D is supposed to produce? How could IBM have won more US
patents than any other company in 1993 - fully 1,087 - while the company
slashed its R&amp;D?
Berkeley economist Paul Romer argues that monopoly theory has the answer. He
notes that the giants such as General Motors, IBM, AT&amp;T and General Electric
have found they can no longer afford enormous research programmes as their
markets have been eroded by competition.
'A monopoly which controls a whole industry has an incentive to do R&amp;D for
the whole industry,' he says. 'But as its market erodes, it has a
disincentive to fund the full range of work because its competitors can free
ride.'
By the new pattern in the US, aggressive small and mid-sized firms invest
heavily in research, while the old giants hold R&amp;D down. The related trend
by which companies obtain more R&amp;D from universities may help to give US
firms a global edge as such arrangements are fewer in Europe and Japan.
The pattern is still worrisome because as a side-effect big companies have
cut basic science; overall, US industry cut this by one-quarter to Dollars
3.7bn last year.
So the final paradox is that industries need to engage in basic research to
remain market- competitive in the longer run.

FT  16 AUG 94 / People: Smith's Challenge in New Zealand
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Smith, 43, one of the contenders to take over as the next chief
executive of ScottishPower, is moving to the other side of the world to run
a new utility business being set up by Fletcher Challenge, one of New
Zealand's largest conglomerates.
Smith, a former general manager of Thorn Lighting who joined ScottishPower
in 1990, takes up his new post as chief executive of Fletcher Challenge's
utility sector at the end of the month. New Zealand, like Britain, has been
deregulating its energy industry and Smith has been given the job of
developing Fletcher Challenge's utility operations in New Zealand and
globally.
Fletcher Challenge grew rapidly during the 1980s but its dependence on
cyclical capital intensive industries, such as forest products and oil and
gas, has caused problems and it has been selling off assets in order to
reduce its gearing. It sold majority control of its New Zealand natural gas
utility two years ago. However, the company's fortunes have been recovering
and it is understood to be keen to take advantage of the opportunities
thrown up by the privatisation of the local electricity business.
Smith, who has a marketing background, has been responsible for developing
ScottishPower's non-regulated businesses which include CaledonianGas,
retail, and electrical contracting. ScottishPower's core business is looking
after a large part of Scotland's electricity supply but it has more than
doubled its retail outlets, to 155, since privatisation and expanded into
supplying natural gas and is moving into telecommunications.
Although Smith is said to have done a good job developing ScottishPower's
non-core businesses, he was not thought to be the front-runner to take over
from Ian Preston, who has headed ScottishPower since before privatisation
and is expected to retire next year. Duncan Whyte, a 47-year-old Scot
running the core electricity business, is thought to be the most likely
internal candidate.
Smith said yesterday that thoughts of succession at ScottishPower had not
prompted his decision to move to Fletcher Challenge. It is understood that
he was partly swayed by family reasons. He is married to an Indonesian and
spent six years in that country in the 1970s with Voluntary Service
Overseas, Mobil Oil, the Ford Foundation and the World Bank.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hollas, the Manchester-based clothing and textiles group, yesterday
announced the resignation of Allan Richens as chairman and chief executive
of Hawkshead Sportswear, its 50 per cent-owned outdoor clothing mail order
group.
The move marks the latest stage of a wide-ranging overhaul at Hollas, which
began last autumn when Julian Lee was appointed chief executive.
The departure of Richens - formerly finance director at Empire Stores Group
and Hawkshead chief executive since November 1990 - follows trading
difficulties which cost Hollas Pounds 71,000 last year.
Lee, who presided over the successful sale of Bricom in 1990 and came out of
retirement - at the ripe old age of 48 - to run Hollas, said: 'The
anticipated improvements in Hawkshead Sportswear did not come through in the
year.'
Executives from Hollas, which owns Hawkshead jointly with Kleeneze, the home
shopping business, will take responsibility for day-to-day operational
matters at the Cumbria-based subsidiary. Clive Westbrook, Hollas's group
financial controller, will look after its financial affairs, while
merchandising control will pass to Kleeneze.
'With these changes, I believe we will see an improvement in Hawkshead's
performance during the current financial year,' Lee said.

Tim Hely Hutchinson, chief executive of Hodder Headline, continues to carve
his faintly iconoclastic path through the publishing world by bringing on
board as his deputy a man from the company that brought you Sonic the
Hedgehog. In Mark Opzoomer, commercial and finance director of Sega Europe,
Hely Hutchinson recognises what he calls 'the acceptable face of high-level
finance'.
The new broom is obviously not bowled over by the calibre of his peers in
other publishing houses. 'We employed headhunters Spencer Stuart because we
were pretty sure the right person didn't exist in our industry,' he says.
But what do the folks from Hodder &amp; Stoughton, that grand old publishing
name that was 'merged' with Headline last year, think of the arrival of an
electronic media buff? 'The people who remain here from pre-merger days are
the forward-looking ones,' says the boss. And the only 'family' man still
extant is the head of marketing for general books, Jamie Hodder-Williams,
who is 'actually very good'.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Business and the Law: Intellectual licence - Proposed new
patent guidelines in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The arrival of new guidelines on the licensing of intellectual property,
from an administration that has sometimes appeared to promise a new and more
aggressive approach to anti-trust enforcement, has been anxiously awaited by
lawyers and high technology companies.
In the end, guidelines from the Department of Justice last week for a 60-day
public comment period represented less of a change than some had feared.
They recognise that the restrictions in many patent licensing agreements can
be conducive to innovation and competition, rather than necessarily
anti-competitive. Moreover, they contain no hint of mandatory licensing,
which some officials had hinted they might try to enforce on companies whose
technology dominates certain markets.
Yet there is a shift in tone from the 1988 rules, which these proposed
guidelines would replace, and from the laisser-faire attitudes of the Reagan
Department of Justice.
'The 1988 guidelines had, perhaps, a subtext that anything goes, and that
subtext is not present in these new guidelines,' says Mr Joseph Kattan, an
anti-trust lawyer at the Washington office of Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius.
The guidelines say that the Department of Justice will challenge some
licensing agreements which it believes are used to restrict competition. In
the 1980s, most patent licensing arrangements were viewed as vertical
relationships between supplier and customer, rather than horizontal
relationships between competitors, and thus less subject to challenge.
The new guidelines show a greater willingness to treat the relationship
between licensor and licensee as horizontal when the two would be actual or
likely potential competitors had they not signed a licensing deal. While the
existence of a horizontal relationship 'is not inherently suspect', it does
open up more possibilities for challenge.
There is not, however, a wholesale return to the ideas pervading the
department in the 1960s and 1970s, when the underlying assumption was that
patents were monopolies and were really narrowly defined exemptions from the
normal anti-trust rules. Then, Justice defined 'nine no-nos' and brought
many in-tellectual property cases and lost a high proportion.
The new guidelines preserve much of the Reagan era view that patents and
other forms of intellectual property create desirable incentives for
innovation and productive activity by rewarding entrepreneurs, inventors and
creators.
'The anti-trust laws and the intellectual property laws share the common
purpose of promoting innovation and enhancing consumer welfare,' said Mrs
Anne Bingaman, the assistant attorney general who heads the Department of
Justice's anti-trust division.
One departure is the definition of a safety zone within which the Department
of Justice will not usually challenge a licence's restraints as long as they
are not so flagrantly anti-competitive that they should be treated as
unlawful per se, and as long as the licensor and licensee together account
for no more more than 20 per cent of each market affected by the agreement.
But because the zone is defined in terms of market share rather than dollar
terms, there is uncertainty over how the market will be defined. For
example, is the developer of a plain paper fax machine competing in the same
market as makers of old thermal paper faxes, or has it created a new market
in which its share is greater than 20 per cent?
'It's a good idea in that it gives comfort to people in an area in which
they should have comfort, but if your innovation beats the socks off the
alternatives in cost and quality, then it is probably a new market,' says Mr
Donald Baker, a former assistant attorney general at the Department of
Justice who practises anti-trust law in Washington DC.
The guidelines also contain the first theoretical elaboration of the idea of
innovation markets, although the concept has already been used, for example
in a complaint last year against the proposed acquisition of a General
Motors subsidiary by ZF Friedrichshafen. The Department of Justice argued
the merged unit would almost monopolise the facilities for research on bus
and lorry automatic transmissions.
'If the capacity for research and development activity that likely will
produce innovation in technology is scarce and can be associated with
identifiable specialised assets or characteristics of specific firms (which
may or may not currently participate in the relevant technology or goods
markets) it may be appropriate to consider separately the impact of the
conduct in question on competition in research and development among those
firms,' the guidelines state.
What the department says and what it does may not, however, be the same. As
one anti-trust lawyer points out, guidelines are written by 'intellectual
front-office types', while cases are brought by back-room litigators who
want to win cases - and Ms Bingaman's division has hired more of this
species.
Moreover, intellectual property lawyers have to take a long view in advising
clients: will a licensing restraint stand up not only under this
administration but in future? The question is not made simpler by the old
age of some of the Supreme Court precedents, which might not survive in
today's Court.
Recent cases brought by the division in the intellectual property field
suggest a more aggressive attitude in this administration. 'I don't have any
doubt that the US is going to see a far tougher anti-trust policy than it
did in the 1980s,' says Professor Robert Pitofsky, an anti-trust expert.
While investigations began during the Bush administration into the licensing
arrangements enforced by Pilkington, the British glassmaker, for its plate
glass technology, the deployment of large platoons of government lawyers and
economists that persuaded Pilkington to settle came under the Clinton
administration.
Attracting most attention is the settlement with Microsoft, the computer
software group whose Dos and Windows operating systems give it a mighty
position in the software market for IBM-compatible personal computers. The
consent decree negotiated with Microsoft is actually limited. It avoids
pursuing the argument that Microsoft has leveraged its de facto monopoly
position, and declines to pursue the idea of erecting a Chinese wall between
the company's operating system and applications software divisions,
concentrating instead on some specific pricing and distribution complaints.
Nevertheless, some of Ms Bingaman's predecessors from the 1980s have said
they would not have brought the case.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Intellectual property: US Justice Department's new guiding principles
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Anti-trust laws apply to intellectual property as they do to any
   other property
 - Anti-trust enforcement should not unnecessarily interfere with the
   licensing and transfer of intellectual property rights
 - The Justice Department will not presume that a patent, copyright
   or trade secret will necessarily give its owner 'market power'

FT  16 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Capital seeks fresh
adventure - Scarcity of deals for the UK houses means that something must
give
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago UK venture capitalists were somewhat apprehensive. They were
celebrating an extremely good year during which many companies they backed
had floated.
But there were serious doubts whether all the venture capital houses seeking
to replenish their funds would be able to do so.
Talk of venture capital groups being forced to merge was rife. Quite
separately, there was concern whether there were enough financeable deals
about.
A year later most of these fears have come to nothing. Even venture
capitalists demonstrating weaker track records have successfully raised
funds, although they have had to scour the US to raise the money.
And with one notable exception, there have been few forced mergers. Much of
the consolidation has brought new commitment to the development capital
industry.
But there is a problem with deal flow. Particularly at the larger end of the
market, there are too many venture capitalists chasing too few deals.
According to a report from the management buy-out group of accountants Ernst
&amp; Young, this is the single biggest issue the UK venture capital industry
must confront in the coming years.
Ernst &amp; Young's research is based on an independent study of UK venture
capitalists, fund investors on both sides of the Atlantic, corporations that
have been or are likely to sell subsidiaries, and venture-backed companies.*
Many of the UK's larger development capitalists made net divestments from
their portfolios in 1993 and are continuing to do so this year.
The good news for venture capitalists, the survey says, is that vendors are
not preparing to curtail their divestment activities at all.
Such optimism should be tempered by the fact that the relatively low level
of mergers and acquisitions activity in the last two years will have reduced
the number of opportunities for MBOs and management buy-ins.
Ironically, the successful year of fundraising exacerbates the problem.
There are not enough deals to go round. Something has to give. Ernst &amp; Young
believes venture capitalists might react in the following ways:
Lowering returns. Nearly two thirds of the venture capitalists surveyed
expected no change to their own internal rate of return requirement during
the next two years. Of the remainder, three quarters expected downward
pressure on returns. Venture capitalists have lowered their targets for IRRs
from above 30 per cent, where they have been for years, to the mid- to
high-20s, says Martyn Aguss, part of Ernst &amp; Young's MBO team.
More debt in deals. Since many banks withdrew from the market in 1990 -
after their unhappy involvement in very highly leveraged deals in the late
1980s - there has been a shortage of senior debt providers. That is now
changing. Banks are increasingly willing to provide debt and are prepared to
see gearing ratios rise quite sharply from the one-to-one level that has
prevailed for the last few years. That is likely to allow vendors to ask
purchasers for higher prices and for venture capitalists to be able to fund
them without undermining their returns.
Venture capitalists will increasingly bid as principal on the larger deals,
competing directly with trade buyers. To a lesser extent, the venture
capitalists will also be bidding against management buy-out teams, Ernst &amp;
Young says. Backing quality management remained a priority but the incidence
of financial bids, as they are called, was likely to increase.
Gone are the days when an MBO team ran an auction between equity suppliers
and chose the venture capitalist that offered the best deal to management,
not to the vendor.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Spreading the wealth - In
the first of an occasional series on employee shareownership in private
companies, Richard Gourlay looks at its effect as a motivating agent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CMG Computer Management Group is one of those rare companies about which
champions of widespread employee share ownership should be shouting from the
hilltops.
Founded 30 years ago, the European computer services company that helps
industry and government make better use of computers has grown to 2,000
employees but is still a private company.
Some 200 of these people have been with CMG for more than 10 years, double
the average in the software industry, which suggests that it has avoided the
bane of many smaller companies' existence - how to motivate employees.
Successful businesses generate loyalty. But Douglas Gorman, CMG co-founder
and current chairman, believes extending share ownership through the company
was a crucial motivating ingredient, particularly in a business where the
assets wore shoes and went home each night.
As a measure of the now blurring distinction between employee and owner,
staff have spent Pounds 14m buying CMG shares since the founders started
dispersing shares in 1968.
'Once the company started to take off, we offered people the shares,' Gorman
says. 'We have to assume people want the same kind of things as we did -
capital growth and involvement.'
Gorman has travelled further along this path of employee participation than
many founders of successful companies. But organisations which promote wider
share ownership, such as Proshare, say many private company owners are
unaware of the benefits of spreading ownership.
Increasing motivation and a sense of sharing in the fruits of success is one
benefit. But for the owner seeking a total or partial sale of shares,
employee share option schemes are also tax-efficient vehicles for
transferring ownership to employees.
So when is the right time for owners of a growing private company to
consider selling shares, granting options, starting a Save As You Earn-based
scheme or setting up an ESOP?
Peter Kindersley is in no doubt. The co-founder and chairman of Dorling
Kindersley, the publishing and multimedia company, who last month made
Pounds 2.6m of his own shares available to his senior managers in an option
scheme, says there is no time like the present.
'It is a no-lose situation,' Kindersley says of the scheme he began nearly
20 years ago. 'I have had nothing but good out of it. It makes people work
together much better and makes people happier.'
Proshare agrees. As long as the business is on a sound footing, there is a
case for introducing some form of employee participation. 'This is a huge
under-exploited possibility for the private sector,' says David Senior,
Proshare's director of company services.
But like Dorling Kindersley, CMG was only able to contemplate a share scheme
because it had a sound foundation and was growing successfully.
Gorman says some of the credit for CMG's success goes to Charles de Gaulle.
After the French president blocked the UK's entry into the Common Market in
1963, Gorman decided continental Europe was where the future lay and that
CMG needed to be there. At a time when some of his staff were reluctant even
to expand beyond the company's base in Croydon, south London, Gorman decided
to open in the Netherlands.
The Dutch business took off, through contracts with the government and
Philips, the electronics company. But Gorman is convinced his staff turnover
levels were lower than the industry norm at a crucial phase in CMG's
development because of the share scheme.
'They would have splintered off had we not given shares,' Gorman says of the
staff who helped build the business. 'The share scheme has a lot to do with
staff retention.' Gorman first started offering shares when the company had
only 17 employees in 1967, three years after it was founded.
From the early days, CMG's shares traded once a year. The price was decided
by two external assessors, the company's auditors and a merchant bank. There
was no bid-offer spread. And the founders made available the shares to meet
whatever demand there was at the designated price.
Over the years this process has reduced Gorman's stake in the company from
40 per cent to 15 per cent. But CMG only became a true employee-owned
company when Gorman's co-founders - together owning 60 per cent of the
company - sold their shares. 'People put in a huge financial effort, like
taking out loans, to buy the shares,' says Gorman. Within a period of 18
months the founders' combined stake fell from 75 per cent to 28 per cent.
'It was dramatic. In the next two or three years the company really took off
more than before - there was a release of entrepreneurial atmosphere,' says
Gorman. 'The difference was gigantic. People said: 'If we don't like things
we can outvote Gorman or get rid of him'.'
For some owner managers, such an open invitation to rebellion might be too
much to swallow. Accustomed to their word being law, many founders might not
stomach such breaches of discipline. Gorman says this democratisation of the
decision process was less unpalatable because the three founders had always
discussed strategic moves.
The only significant insurrection Gorman reports was led by the co-founder
with the smallest stake. Isolated in his view that CMG should float sooner
rather than later, he started a pressure group to canvass support. When it
came to a vote he found little support, Gorman says.
The system worked until three years ago when the company grew too big and
the share scheme became unwieldy. 'The value of the shares rose faster than
salaries so we are going to a flotation to have a market in the shares,'
says Gorman. 'There were more sellers than buyers and we decided as a
temporary step we would sell to outsiders.' As a result, CMG shareholders
sold 4 per cent of the company's equity to Midland Montagu Ventures, now
named Montagu Private Equity, for Pounds 3m.
By that time the impact of wider ownership was waning. 'I think as a company
gets bigger the positive feeling of owning shares, the feeling of belonging
to a select club get diminished slowly.'
Dorling Kindersley's growing size also lay behind Peter Kindersley's
apparent largesse last month. He shares Gorman's belief in the motivational
effect of employee share ownership. 'It is a positive thing,' he says. 'We
are trying to keep people and not trying to prevent them from going.'
The problem was that senior executives arriving at the company were out of
step with colleagues who had been collecting shares since Kindersley started
the employee share participation scheme. At the same time, Kindersley wanted
to push the share option scheme further down the company. Making his own
shares available freed up the ordinary option scheme which, with a limited
amount of share options, would otherwise have been used up by senior
management.
The approach is unusual, if not unique. It is certainly enlightened
self-interest. But variations on the theme are only slowly catching on.
This is in spite of studies carried out by the Involvement and Participation
Association, an organisation supported by unions and employees. These show
that people in companies with share schemes that reach all employees have
more positive attitudes than those without them.
To people like Gorman, such findings are obvious. The old demarcation lines
in the UK that so often lead to conflict, mistrust and lack of co-operation
are fatal for the development of many businesses, he believes. This is
particularly true when businesses are smallest and retaining good people is
toughest.
For many companies, introducing share participation schemes that reward and
motivate may provide a more certain way of breaking into the growth corridor
and staying there.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Labour slammed over NHS 'fiction'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, yesterday dismissed Labour claims
that the government was preparing to sell parts of the National Health
Service as 'a monstrous fiction'.
She denied that talks between Mr Tom Sackville, health minister, and Salick
Health Care, the US cancer specialist, would lead to privatisation. 'Talk of
parts of the NHS being sold off to US firms is complete and utter nonsense,'
she said.
Her decision to intervene in the row highlights the government's sensitivity
over the issue with its backbenchers.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield, called for a debate
on the future of the NHS. 'While I support the principle of a private health
service, it should complement the NHS and not replace parts of it.'
Mrs Bottomley accused Mr David Blunkett, Labour's health spokesman, of
'scaremongering' after he said that the government was prepared to see the
service run by people whose only motive was profit.
She said: 'The Labour party and the press have transformed the small fact of
Tom Sackville's meeting with Salick Healthcare into a monstrous fiction.'
She said the NHS was 'the most cost-effective healthcare system in the
world. We could teach the Americans a thing or two about cost control.'
Mrs Bottomley said the government was always ready to explore better ways of
delivering health services - 'but not at any price'.
Mr Blunkett told BBC Radio that the involvement of US companies in the NHS
would be to the detriment of patients.
He said the US was desperately trying to move away from its own system of
healthcare while the UK government was moving in the 'wrong direction' -
away from a 'world-beating cost-efficient service' towards commercialisation
and competition.
He added: 'We want a service that is funded, delivered, accountable to the
public, not a regulatory body where the Department of Health sit on their
hands and allow our service to be bought up, to be privatised, to be
invested in by people whose raison d'etre is profit, not the delivery of
healthcare.' One in four non-executive board members and people who chair
NHS trusts do not live in the area they serve, Labour said yesterday.
Mr Blunkett said: 'In any democratic system a residential qualification is
the norm but with quangos the only qualification necessary appears to be a
willingness to toe the Tory party line.'

FT  16 AUG 94 / Doomed flotilla finds itself on the beach: Bernard Gray on
what to do with submarines past their sail-by dates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   US nuclear submarines meet a curious and surreal fate
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the boats designed for the deep oceans of the world end up buried in the
desert, which is considered the safest place to allow their radioactivity to
decay naturally.
Britain has no desert in which to bury its retired submarines and so they
languish in the two nuclear dockyards, Devonport in Plymouth and Rosyth in
Fife.
There are seven boats at the two yards. The hunter-killer boats Dreadnought,
Swiftsure and Churchill with the Polaris nuclear missile boat Revenge are at
Rosyth, while hunter-killer boats Courageous, Warspite and Conqueror, the
submarine that sank the Argentine cruiser Belgrano, sit mournfully side by
side in an unused dock at Devonport.
The government's policy on the boats is to do nothing for the time being.
Each submarine has had its highly radioactive fuel and nuclear cores removed
and sent to British Nuclear Fuels for storage and eventual disposal. The
hulls are sealed and the reactor compartments - radioactive as a result of
long exposure to the nuclear cores - are being allowed to cool down over a
period of years.
Since the risks and costs of sawing up the hulks will be lower once some of
the radioactivity has decayed, the government argues that there could hardly
be a better place for the reactor compartments than inside the strong
pressure hulls of the submarines.
The Ministry of Defence said: 'There is no urgency. With the cores removed
most of the radioactivity has gone and the remaining radioactivity continues
to decline.'
The policy of laying up the boats where they are decommissioned is likely to
result in a sizeable flotilla at both Rosyth and Devonport over the next few
years. Eleven nuclear submarines - including all four Polaris boats - will
have been decommissioned by the end of the century. If normal practice is
followed the Polaris boats will go to Rosyth, where all of their
maintainance work has been carried out.
While the MoD is content to play it cool, the options for final disposal are
very limited. The boats cannot be taken out to sea and scuttled because that
would violate the international moratorium on nuclear dumping.
Burial whole in a dry-land site, which would prevent the radiation leaching
into the water table, is difficult in a crowded and notoriously wet island.
The remaining option is disposal in the nuclear waste repository which is
planned by the government, but which has yet to get approval and will not be
available until 2005 at the earliest.
Even that would require the radioactive compartments to be cut up, an
expensive job that the MoD is understandably in no hurry to start.
As a result, Rosyth, Devonport and all of their potential users are likely
to have to get used to the sight of disused nuclear submarines.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Sales of M-registered cars lower than hoped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New-car registrations in the first 10 days of August, the most important
sales month of the year, were 3.7 per cent higher than in the same period
last year.
The increase was smaller than was forecast by some carmakers and has
undermined industry hopes of achieving record sales this month.
It is understood that new-car registrations rose to 258,392 in the first 10
days of August from 249,153 in the same period last year. In August
registrations are boosted by the change of prefix and account for about 25
per cent of new car sales.
Britain has led the European new-vehicle market out of recession. In the
first seven months new car registrations rose by 13.3 per cent year-on-year
to 990,752.
In view of this performance and with strong order books, carmakers had
forecast that sales this month would rise by 13 per cent to 14 per cent
year-on-year to about 500,000, challenging the previous record of 500,112
achieved in August 1989. Carmakers are retreating from the most optimistic
forecasts, however, and several leading manufacturers said yesterday that
sales of M-registered cars were unlikely to exceed 470,000 or 480,000. Sales
of new cars last August totalled 440,206.
The industry has become increasingly disenchanted with the registration
system, which distorts the pattern of annual sales with the creation of the
August sales 'bulge'.
The transport industry yesterday joined the campaign to change the system.
Mr Paul Bates, general manager of Vehicle Management Services, part of NFC,
the logistics and moving services group, said that the August workload
created 'undue pressures and costs . . . for no discernible gain.'
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders is investigating a number of
alternative registration systems which it hopes to present to the government
before the end of the year.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Race gap narrows in Bar exams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pass rate among ethnic minority law students taking exams to practise at
the Bar rose to 80 per cent this year, having been as low as 55 per cent in
1992.
White students, however, were still significantly more likely to pass the
Bar Vocational Course this year, with a pass rate of 90 per cent.
In 1992 the failure rate by ethnic minorities of 44.7 per cent, compared
with a failure rate of only 16 per cent for whites, prompted the appointment
of an independent committee under Dame Jocelyn Barrow to investigate the
disparity between the pass rates. Last year the ethnic-minority success rate
rose to 70 per cent.
Mr Graham Hamer, registrar of the Council of Legal Education, which runs the
exams, said he was pleased with the improvement in performance by ethnic
minority students but was asking Birkbeck College, London, to carry out a
detailed analysis of the results to investigate the continuing disparity.
Dame Jocelyn's inquiry found no evidence of direct or indirect
discrimination against ethnic minority students, but said there was 'a
significant link' between those who found traineeships and success in the
Bar's final exams.
It concluded that discrimination by barristers' chambers in selecting
trainees was partly to blame for the racial disparity in success and failure
rates in the exam.
There were no marked differences between the marks for men and women in this
year's final results. The pass rates for both were about 90 per cent.
Mr Hamer attributed the increase in overall success rates from last year's
85 per cent to the additional academic support made available to students
experiencing difficulties.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Portillo firm over effect of EU rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a government climbdown on employment for the disabled was
receding last night after Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, said he
could see no legal basis for the reinstatement of the priority suppliers
scheme.
Mr Portillo, who withdrew government departments from the scheme last week,
said he had asked the European Commission how the scheme could be reconciled
with an EU directive on public procurement which took effect in July.
He said: 'I would like to keep the scheme if I can, but my legal advisers
tell me that it is just unlawful to maintain it since this new directive.
That legal advice is absolutely unambiguous.'
The commission urged the government to work with Brussels to find a way of
reconciling the scheme with the directive, which was not intended to affect
disabled workers.
Commission officials said they were bemused by the government's
interpretation of the directive, which was approved with British support in
June last year when Mr David Hunt was employment secretary.
They said Britain had not raised the impact of the directive on the scheme,
which allows companies employing mainly disabled workers to make a second
bid for government contracts to match the winning tender.
The issue was not discussed by ministers during the negotiations over the
directive, which took place when Mr Portillo was chief secretary to the
Treasury.
British officials threw doubt on the commission's claims that the decision
to withdraw government support for the scheme came as a complete surprise.
Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, is understood to have
written last week to Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, informing the
government that the commission was investigating the legality of the scheme.
Mr Portillo said the government would not accept a compromise such as
agreement by the commission to 'turn a blind eye' to the continuation of the
scheme.
He said such a compromise would leave the government open to an action in
the European Court of Justice by aggrieved competitors of companies
employing disabled workers. He added: 'The commission is not the European
Court of Justice. They don't decide what the law is, neither is it the
policeman of European law. So whatever they say about the intentions of the
directive is irrelevant.'
The demise of the scheme puts the jobs of thousands of disabled workers at
risk, although companies will still be eligible for subsidies of up to
Pounds 10,000 per job. Remploy, the biggest company involved, has 8,736
disabled workers in 95 factories.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Nuclear graveyard claims denied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence yesterday denied Labour claims that it plans to turn
the Rosyth naval dockyard into a 'graveyard' for decommissioned
nuclear-powered submarines.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said that leaked government
documents showed that seven obsolete nuclear submarines were to be dumped at
the yard.
Mr Brown, whose Dunfermline East constituency includes Rosyth, said that
safety regulations were to be relaxed, leaving the area without proper
protection.
He said that plans to move the navy office responsible for nuclear safety to
Faslane, on the Clyde, and to base tugs used for moving submarines at
Devonport were 'completely unacceptable'.
He added: 'We will not allow the Rosyth area to be frozen by nuclear dumping
or becoming a nuclear graveyard. The government proposals cannot be allowed
to go ahead.'
The MoD said that no decision had been made to lay up nuclear powered
submarines at Rosyth, and denied that the relocation of the navy office
would affect safety.
It added: 'Laid-up nuclear-powered submarines present no hazard to the
general public or the dockyard workforce. There is thus absolutely no reason
why they should have any bearing at all on redevelopment possibilities at
Rosyth.'
There was no difficulty associated with the stationing of tugs at Devonport
because movements of nuclear submarines at Rosyth would be very infrequent
and planned well in advance.
Seven nuclear-powered boats are laid up, four at Rosyth and three at
Devonport. A further four are expected to be decommissioned by the end of
the century.
The radioactive spent fuel and nuclear cores are removed from decommissioned
boats and the hulls are sealed while the level of radioactivity in the
reactor compartments declines.
The Rosyth naval base, which is next to the dockyard, was downgraded to a
support establishment under cost-cutting plans announced last month by Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary.
The cuts will have a substantial impact on the local economy. The civilian
workforce will fall from 1,300 to 600 and the number of service personnel
will be cut from 1,800 to 300.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Life assurers warm to policy of tougher training: William
Lewis and Alison Smith on radical changes that have shaken up a financial
sales industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three years ago life assurance regulator Lautro held a 250,000-strong
register of people permitted to sell regulated financial products.
Today that figures stands at 90,000 and is shrinking at the rate of 2,000 a
month. Mr Martin Tuckwell, a senior official at Lautro and its successor as
industry watchdog - the Personal Investment Authority - said: 'It will
probably go on dropping to 70,000.'
The reason for the sharp fall, Mr Tuckwell said, had a lot to do with the
regulator's initiative to shake up training and management standards in the
industry.
Termed the Training and Competence Scheme, it has laid down strict
guidelines for standards that new recruits must meet, including examination
details. It has also sought to implement higher standards of management by
firms of sales staff, encouraging the development of a new line of
supervisors whose job is to watch over those that sell.
With similar changes being introduced by the other main financial services
regulators, including Fimbra, the watchdog for independent financial
advisers, the T&amp;C programme has acted as a catalyst for fundamental change
in the industry.
Mr Tuckwell said a new PIA scheme, to be introduced next year, would be
little different from Lautro's, which he said had forced companies to
implement changes they had spent years resisting.
'The T&amp;C scheme has been responsible for pushing radical changes forward,'
he said.
It has not been without its price for life assurance companies, however.
Thousands of pounds in fines have been levied by Lautro after training and
competence audits, including Pounds 300,000 on Norwich Union after
breakdowns in management controls and concern over recruitment procedures.
Other companies, which have not been fined, have often been forced to take
dramatic measures to meet Lautro's demands. In July Nationwide Building
Society suspended all its 1,300 sales staff and sent half of them to an
intensive retraining programme.
All this has been done amid great publicity which some senior industry
executives, including Sir Simon Hornby, chairman of Lloyds Abbey Life, blame
for a sharp fall in the sales of pensions and other financial products since
the beginning of the year.
Figures for the second quarter of this year from the Association of British
Insurers, due out this week, are expected to confirm the trend already
apparent from the new business figures for the first half of the year from
some of the largest life companies.
Some are sceptical about the difference the T&amp;C scheme has made.
Mr Philip Scott, life and pensions general manager at Norwich Union, said:
'I cannot point to anything and say that's better because of it.'
However, Norwich Union has shed a large number of sales staff, as have
several other life companies which are being forced to amend their training
regimes. As disclosed in yesterday's Financial Times, Nationwide has decided
to cut the number of its sales staff permitted to sell regulated products
from 1,300 to 650.
This is due in part to the cost of fully training a life assurance salesman.
Mr Stephen Maran, of Lloyds Abbey Life, estimates that compliance costs for
the company are seven or eight times the costs of compliance four or five
years ago.
The public face of the T&amp;C initiative, at least in the short term, is likely
to be limited. Cold calling - where sales staff phone or knock on doors
without an introduction in an attempt to make a sale - is already coming to
an end. It is no longer done at Sun Life, which has 240 direct sales people,
and has been banned at Norwich Union.
Fact finds - the industry term for the information-gathering process sales
staff go through with all prospective clients - are likely to take longer
because the regulator insists on rigorous checking by managers.
Important changes are also taking place behind the scenes at life companies.
For the first time managers are being employed to supervise sales staff
rather than act as super salesmen. Mr Tuckwell said: 'The main hidden agenda
within the Lautro scheme is making supervision the key element in all this.'
Managers are likely to be paid a salary rather than have their pay based on
the commission that sales staff are earning. This change is also taking root
in sales forces, with Sun Life planning to move away from commission-only
staff to a combination of salary plus commission - in line with Barclays
Life and others.
For Mr Don Shore, deputy managing director of Royal Life, the main effect of
the T&amp;C scheme will be on sales staff themselves. Uniform training standards
'means there is no longer any hiding place in the industry', he said.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Temps hired to tackle insolvency backlog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's Insolvency Service was criticised by a trade union
yesterday for hiring temporary staff from recruitment agencies in an effort
to clear a backlog of outstanding regulatory work.
The service has been bringing in extra staff to process thousands of reports
from private-sector insolvency practitioners recommending the
disqualification of directors of failed companies.
The service, which is an executive agency of the Department of Trade and
Industry under the government's Next Steps programme, has been allocated
more than Pounds 1m for the next few months to reduce the backlog of reports
but has avoided hiring full-time staff.
It received only a limited response to its attempt to take on practitioners
seconded from the private sector, and has now turned to two high street
accountancy recruitment agencies to fill the vacancies.
Mr Keith Ellis, chairman of the insolvency service branch of the Institute
of Professional and Managerial Staffs, the civil-service union, said the
policy would be expensive and raised fears about the quality of those hired.
The attempt to boost the number of disqualifications came in response to
publication last year of a highly critical report on the subject from the
National Audit Office, the Whitehall watchdog.
Mr Ellis said: 'If the government was serious about disqualifying directors
it would ensure there were adequate staff to investigate cases fully in the
longer term. This is knee-jerk reaction to the NAO report. They are hoping
it will blow away.'
It also emerged yesterday that the former deputy inspector-general of the
service is considering setting up an advisory service for insolvency
practitioners to help them prepare for visits from regulators.
Mr Philip Pink, a certified accountant and insolvency practitioner, has sent
a circular to individuals and firms offering to review their methods and
compliance standards and to help prepare them for inspections.
The Joint Insolvency Monitoring Unit has recently been set up as part of a
new self-regulatory mechanism under pressure from the DTI to examine
insolvency practitioners. The DTI is inspecting some practitioners directly.
Mr Pink, who left the insolvency service five years ago, has recently been
rehired on an 18-month secondment from Touche Ross.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Union sights fixed on 5.7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'You cannot say we have not been flexible,' Mr Vernon Hince, senior
assistant general secretary and chief negotiator of the RMT transport union,
said yesterday. 'But we have to settle the interim claim for the signal
workers before we can negotiate on restructuring.'
On that issue he remained as unyielding as he was two months ago when the
signal workers' strikes started, although he added that the union 'does not
want this dispute to go on'.
In the current trial of strength Mr Hince seems in no mood to back down. He
believes his stance reflects the opinion of most signal workers. 'We have
phone calls all the time from (them) telling us to stand firm,' he said.
The rejection of the union's strike call by its signalling supervisors 11
days ago had done nothing to lessen the workers' resolve. The RMT accepted
the need for restructuring the pay and working practices of the signalling
staff, but would not negotiate on a comprehensive package until past
productivity improvements were rewarded.
He remained sceptical of the Railtrack plan to bypass the union and seek
agreement on restructuring with each signal worker.
Mr Hince believes a substantial number would suffer a cut in earnings under
the proposals and that concessions demanded by Railtrack - such as agreement
to Sunday working - would not be adequately compensated for.
Even if agreement were reached on an 'up-front' payment for the signal
workers there was no guarantee of agreement on restructuring.
Mr Hince said that, in spite of repeated requests, Railtrack had not
revealed its calculations on the cost savings it could expect from the
changes it wanted in signalling staff working practices.
He was emphatic that Railtrack would have to provide the signal workers with
an interim payment of 'at least 5.7 per cent', the figure the union insists
was on the bargaining table on June 8 before the government intervened.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Prisons on market testing shortlist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Prison Service has drawn up a shortlist of 12 prisons and nine open
prisons which have the greatest potential for improved performance as
candidates for market testing later this year, John Authers writes.
The list is based on statistics for escapes, assaults, prisoner activity,
time unlocked and cost per place. Each of the prisons has a month to provide
more qualitative information which might explain their performance.
The board will then choose one or two prisons to be tested against the
market by the end of September.
The 12 are: Aylesbury, Coldingley, Erlestoke, Everthorpe, Feltham, Hollesley
Bay, Huntercombe, Northallerton, Reading, Rochester, Shepton Mallet and
Styal. The nine open prisons to be subjected to more detailed qualitative
analysis are: Ford, Hewell Grange, Kirkham, Leyhill, Morton Hall, North Sea
Camp, Spring Hill, Standford Hill and Sudbury/Foston.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Clothing and furniture stores show big sales drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales at car dealers and furniture and clothing stores fell significantly
last month, while off-licences and chemists reported a rise in business.
Overall, however, the growth in high street sales slowed in July after
gathering pace in June, according to the Confederation of British Industry's
distributive trades survey, released today.
The survey, which covers 15,000 outlets in retailing, wholesaling and the
motor trades, shows that the proportion of retailers reporting an annual
increase in the volume of sales in July, compared with those who reported a
decrease, was a positive balance of 12 per cent.
This was lower than in June, when 27 per cent of retailers reported an
annual rise in sales volumes. The balance was also significantly lower than
the proportion of traders in the previous survey who had expected sales to
rise in July, suggesting that last month's business left many retailers
disappointed.
Nevertheless, the CBI yesterday noted that the level of sales had been
fairly volatile in recent months, and said business was not signifi-cantly
below average for the time of year.
Mr Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director of economic analysis, said:
'The slower growth in retail sales in July is not surprising when set
against the strong annual volume increases reported this time last year . .
. the trend in retail sales is firmly upwards.'
Motor traders showed the most negative levels of business, with the
proportion reporting that sales had fallen over the year, compared with
those who said they had risen, running at a negative balance of 2 per cent
in July. This was the lowest level since December.
The fall was partly offset by a positive balance of 30 per cent of traders
who said they expected sales to rise next month, after the introduction of
the new 'M' registration plates.
Nevertheless, the CBI pointed out that motor traders' expectations of sales
levels had been overly optimistic in each month since May, and noted that
the majority of them continued to report that their stock levels were
excessive in relation to expected business.
Wholesalers presented a more upbeat picture, with a positive balance of 42
per cent reporting an annual rise in sales. This was lower than in June,
however, and the proportion of wholesalers that said they expected sales to
rise in August fell sharply.
In the retail sector the picture was patchy, although most areas reported a
slowdown in the level of sales growth, and overall volumes of orders placed
on suppliers fell to their lowest for 17 months.
The strongest increases in sales were reported by off-licences, chemists and
grocers. Furniture and carpet traders, however, reported a significant fall
in business, and DIY and durable household goods retailers said sales were
well below average for the time of year, which might reflect the uncertain
nature of the housing market.
The survey suggests larger retailers continued to perform better than small
retailers and mail order groups.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Post office queues to get piped TV shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Customers queueing in the 500 largest high street post offices will in
future be able to watch advertising-based television programmes while they
wait, the Post Office has announced.
Programmes will contain film reviews, children's cartoons and competitions,
as well as product information and advertisements. Customers will be able to
pick up leaflets and order forms for goods and services advertised.
Some post offices already show TV advertisements to customers, but this is
the first time full programmes will be shown. The Post Office is one of the
first retailers to experiment with the medium, and
has attracted advertising from Barclaycard, Citroen and Alliance &amp;
Leicester.
Aspen Specialist Media, which will operate the channel, said advertisers
typically paid about Pounds 20,000 for a 30-second commercial which played
up to eight times an hour for five weeks.
Aspen said about 7m adults would visit a post office more than four times
during each five-week programme period, giving the channel a potential
audience of nearly 29m.
Mr Howard Bickley, media markets manager at the Post Office, said the
programmes would be 'seen in the heart of the high street, close to major
retail outlets, where consumers' impulse to respond to direct response
television advertising can be satisfied immediately'.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Both sides 'out of ideas' in rail deadlock: CBI condemns
'colossal inconvenience' as 12th strike day starts - BR says one-third of
trains will run
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most of the rail network will be shut down for a 12th day today as a result
of the 10-week-old rail dispute, with both sides claiming they had done all
they could to break the deadlock.
'I can't think of anything else we can do,' said Mr Vernon Hince, the RMT
transport union's chief negotiator and senior assistant general secretary.
'We have provided a number of ways in which Railtrack could restart
negotiations by meeting our interim claim. Coming up with any more now would
be a waste of time.'
Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack's chairman, said the company had made 'all the
offers we can make' and that it was up to the union to respond more
favourably.
Railtrack was adamant that both sides had to talk about restructuring and
not purely about the union's interim pay claim. 'Our offer to sit down and
throw away the key and talk about restructuring until we reach a settlement
still stands, but we've made all the offers we can make. We are not prepared
to pay to open negotiations.'
The RMT expects Railtrack to try to 'sell' its latest offer to individual
signalmen and women, bypassing the union. 'They cannot get any takers
because it is such a poor deal. We are back exactly where we were when the
dispute started,' the union said.
British Rail estimated that about 5,000 trains, roughly one-third of the
normal total, would run during the 48-hour shutdown, which ends at midnight
tonight. Frequencies are much reduced although several weeks of strike
procedures have meant most train operators are able to run to set
timetables. Travellers now had sufficient faith in the timetables to make
use of the train services for commuting, cross-country journeys and leisure
travel, Railtrack said.
It said it had agreed timetables with British Rail for this stoppage. No
additional services ran yesterday but new routes were opened on Friday
between London and Edinburgh via Sheffield and in the Glasgow commuter belt.
Despite the gradual build-up of services on strike days, many commuters into
London chose to use their cars yesterday and road traffic into the capital
was very heavy.
A Confederation of British Industry spokesman said: 'It's just a colossal
inconvenience to the travelling public and it does nothing to help our
reputation for competitiveness abroad.'
British Rail estimated the impact of the strike on revenues at Pounds 10m a
day on passenger services and Pounds 1m a day on freight services, though
many freight shipments can be held back to run on working days.
Another 24-hour strike will be held next Monday and the prospects for a
settlement look as far away as ever.
A passenger and a railway guard were slightly injured yesterday when a North
London Railways train crashed into buffers at London Euston. The train, from
Northampton, was coming to a halt. North London Railways said an internal
inquiry would be held.

FT  16 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Unfinished business of the Uruguay Round -
Gatt negotiations on four key services sectors have quietly restarted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trade negotiators in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks can claim as
one of their biggest achievements the writing of a framework of rules which
put all services under international fair trade disciplines for the first
time.
But securing specific commitments to open individual services markets to
foreign competition proved a daunting task - so much so that when the Round
concluded last December some key sectors were left undone.
Largely unnoticed, negotiations on the four unfinished areas - financial
services, maritime transport, basic telecommunications and labour movement -
have quietly restarted under the auspices of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
These sectors between them represent perhaps 10 per cent of total
cross-border trade in commercial services of more than Dollars 1,000bn last
year, and much more when business by foreign subsidiaries is taken into
account.
For the rapidly-growing sectors of basic telecommunications and financial
services in particular, the trading opportunities offered by liberalisation
on a global scale would be immense. But these high stakes also guarantee
some rough bargaining to come.
Basic telecommunications: It became clear early in the Uruguay Round
negotiations that there were going to be big problems in securing agreement
to open the basic telecommunications sector (mostly voice telephone
networks) to foreign companies. This was mainly because in many countries
the telephone network is still the exclusive domain of state-owned
monopolies.
However, all over the world, state telecoms companies are being privatised
and/or deregulated and trade officials hope the timing may be right to start
bringing down trade barriers on a global scale.
The 22 countries involved (the 12 EU countries counting as one) are due to
wrap up the talks by April 1996. The obstacles remain formidable. But rapid
technological advance and the development of new services (such as
multimedia) are forcing the pace of liberalisation almost irrespective of
what negotiators discuss in Geneva.
Maritime transport: Talks foundered late last year when it became clear that
Washington was prepared to offer virtually nothing on ocean shipping. Though
the US claims to have a fairly open deep-sea shipping market, the sector is
in effect subsidised and protected by a cargo reservation system that
requires certain ocean-going freight to be transported by US carriers.
Under pressure from Greece and Denmark, the EU took its own modest offer off
the table altogether, while Japan curtailed its commitments to cover only
access to port services. In the end the US and EU agreed neither would offer
anything at that stage, though 32 other nations, including Japan, have done
so.
The possibly forlorn hope, given the inordinately influential US shipping
lobby, is that by June 1996, when the talks are due to end, Washington will
be forthcoming enough to persuade Japan and the EU to restore their original
offers. Even then many restrictive practices in shipping - such as shipping
conferences which tie up routes between operators - would remain in being.
Financial services: The US nearly scuppered the entire services negotiations
last year when it proposed a two-tier market-access arrangement for
financial services that would have discriminated against Japan and some
developing countries deemed to have done too little to open their markets.
This idea directly contravened the basic most-favoured-nation
non-discrimination principle on which the open international trading system
is founded and led to threats by trading partners to dilute their own offers
or withdraw them altogether.
Under a Gatt-brokered compromise, the US agreed to open its financial
services market to all-comers for six months after the Uruguay Round comes
into force next year, to allow others to improve their offers. If the
improvements are not to Washington's liking, it may then refuse MFN access
for new market opportunities. These might include the planned lifting of
restrictions on interstate banking or any relaxation of the demarcation
between investment and deposit banking.
Though there is to be a multilateral negotiating group on financial
services, which will hold its first meeting in September, this issue is in
essence a bilateral argument between the US and Japan and is being discussed
in the so-called framework talks intended to prise open Japan's markets.
Labour movement: At the instigation primarily of India, Uruguay Round
negotiators agreed last December to hold further negotiations on the
'movement of natural persons'. This concerns people moving temporarily
abroad to provide services.
India, which has a big software industry exporting both computer programmes
and software writers, was disappointed that most countries confined
liberalisation offers to the transfer of company managers and specialist
staff.
The negotiations on labour movement are due to end at the same time as the
financial services talks, six months after the Uruguay Round comes into
force. But it is doubtful whether much will be achieved, since few nations
(India included) are keen on encouraging large numbers of foreign workers.

FT  16 AUG 94 / World Trade News: US Pushes workers' rights - Clinton ties
support for borrowing to observance of labour laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton is set to approve legislation which would make
observance of workers' rights a condition of lending by the international
lending institutions.
With no fanfare House Democrats have included in an appropriations bill a
requirement that US executive directors of the international financial
institutions push for 'policies to encourage borrowing countries to
guarantee internationally recognised worker rights.'
The provision completed its passage through Congress with Senate approval
last week.
The Clinton administration itself attempted to include labour rights as a
goal in all future trade negotiations, but was forced to retreat last week
in a deal with Republicans in order to obtain renewal of the president's
'fast-track' negotiating authority on trade issues.
The effort to make worker rights a condition of multi-lateral lending is
less controversial in Congress.
Congressman Barney Frank, chairman of the subcommittee overseeing
international development institutions, said he had the support of
Republicans on his subcommittee, when he slipped the provision into an
appropriations bill.
'What I've made clear to the Treasury is conscientious enforcement of this
(provision) is the price they'll have to pay for continued American
participation in the lending institutions,' he said.
While the US does not have formal veto power over World Bank and IMF
lending, the other executive directors are unlikely to approve loans to
which the US objects. Lending to Vietnam only began when the US finally
agreed.
The legislation calls on the US Treasury secretary to direct the executive
directors of the international financial institutions to include labour
rights 'as an integral part of the institution's policy dialogue with each
borrowing country'.
It establishes as a model the conventions of the International Labour
Organisation, which call for the right to organise unions, a prohibition on
compulsory labour and the establishment of minimum labour standards for
child labour and occupational health and safety rules.
US directors at the institutions are also required to screen programes 'for
negative impact' on workers' rights. This provision could have blocked
programmes such as the World Bank's labour reform plan for Nicaragua, which
prohibits public sector strikes, limits the right to organise unions and
discourages fringe benefits.
US funding for the multi-lateral development banks has become increasingly
unpopular. Last year, the House came within six votes of defeating US
funding for them. Mr Frank said it was saved by congressmen who saw the
possibility of shifting the institutions' policies to direct the benefits of
development to workers and the poor.
Mr Frank says the existing conditions set by the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund for loans - budget discipline, removal of trade
barriers and changes in currency supply - are no more intrusive to a
borrowing country's sovereignty than telling it to abide by internationally
agreed labour rights standards.
'We are saying if you chose voluntarily to do business with us and even
more, if you are asking us to contribute money which you will receive, we
have a right to do that,' he said.

FT  16 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Minicars feel squeeze in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Imported cars are more popular than ever in Japan, but there is one segment
of the market in which foreign makers have been unable to find space: the
so-called minicars.
Not any minicars - the Rover Mini does not qualify under the Japanese
definition. Nor does any other foreign car. The tightest parking space in
Tokyo is a rectangle of 3.3 metres by 1.4 metres, as delineated by the
Transport Ministry, which uses these measurements as a guide to what is a
minicar.
The ministry has this month begun to consider increasing the permissible
length by 10cm. But the Mini, which fits lengthways, is 4cm too wide. And
its engine is too big. The maximum displacement is 660cc, though Japanese
makers such as Subaru, Suzuki and Daihatsu commonly fit turbochargers to
boost power.
About 1.5m minicars are sold each year, and their owners benefit from
sharply lower tax and insurance when they buy the car and reduced charges
for roadworthiness inspections in subsequent years. In addition, unlike city
owners of other vehicles, they do not have to produce a police certificate
showing they have somewhere to put the car at night.
The showroom price of a Mini Mayfair is within Y2,000 (Dollars 20) of that
for a Daihatsu Mira. But according to the Japan Automobile Importers
Association, the difference in getting it on the road for a year grows to
Y80,320, even before paying the landlord a hefty square footage for using a
corner of his backyard.
Rover Japan says that if its Mini met the ministry's minicar specifications,
costs of owning one for five years would fall by about a fifth. It is among
importers which - through the European Business Community Council, a
grouping of EU chambers of commerce - is calling on the Transport Ministry
to consider not just specifying a longer minicar so that not only local
makers can measure up, but abolishing the category altogether.
Standards for minicars in Japan have been progressively brought closer to
those of regular passenger vehicles since they were introduced as a post-war
way of enabling manufacturers of motorcycles and agricultural machinery to
join the automotive boom.
It led to a crowded car market, but one where minicar protection has helped
enable companies like Suzuki to stay in the black during domestic downturn.
The latest change in length, proposed this month, is intended to allow them
to meet the same safety requirements for a frontal impact as larger cars.
Transport Ministry officials argue that the distinction between minicars and
others is relevant to energy efficiency. Mr Hitoshi Usami, a deputy director
of its roads bureau, says that Japan's small land mass and narrow streets
also justify its retention.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is more ambivalent,
pointing out that Toyota and Nissan, the two biggest domestic car makers,
have no direct involvement in minicars and see almost as little advantage
from the distinction as the foreign suppliers do.
'The benefits are lost as the lengths are stretched,' a Miti official said
yesterday.
The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, which groups domestic car
producers, could not agree on whether to ask for an increase in engine size
to go with the longer body profile, and minicar makers are said themselves
to be divided about what happens next.
No US maker has a subcompact model which comes close to minicar
requirements, but as Mr David Blume, Rover Japan marketing director, puts
it, 'Europe has a lot of strength at that end of the market.' Fiat's new
Cinquecento, like Rover's quarter century-old Mini, loses out not on length,
but because it is 8.7cm too wide and packs 240cc too much capacity under the
bonnet.

FT  16 AUG 94 / World Trade News: British trade with Malaysia in surplus
despite boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's trade with Malaysia has recorded a healthy surplus in the first
six months of the year, despite a Malaysian government ban on giving
contracts to UK companies.
According to figures from Kuala Lumpur, UK exports to Malaysia rose 80 per
cent in the period to Pounds 666m (Dollars 1bn). Meanwhile, Malaysia's
exports to Britain dropped by 24 per cent to Pounds 581m.
Malaysia imposed its ban on British companies in February this year in
retaliation over reports in the London press alleging that a British company
had tried to offer bribes to senior Malaysian officials.
The Malaysian government was also angered by the publicity surrounding the
granting of British aid for construction of the Pergau dam and the
parliamentary inquiry into its linkage to multi-million-pound Malaysian
purchases of British defence equipment.
While British officials would not comment on the latest trade figures, it is
thought that a large portion of the goods exported by Britain to Malaysia
over the last six months resulted from contracts signed before the ban was
imposed.
The trade figures are likely to have included British defence equipment,
including British Aerospace Hawker fighter aircraft, delivered recently to
Malaysia under the terms of a controversial 1988 memorandum of understanding
on defence sales signed by former prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher and
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, her Malaysian counterpart.

On the surface, neither side was running away from the fight, and Mr Clinton
was particularly scathing in his attacks on the Republican leadership.
'No more excuses, no more tricks, no more delays and no more discussion,' he
said at a White House ceremony, flanked by angry relatives of crime victims
who were equally damning in their criticism of the Republicans and the gun
lobby.
But both sides appeared ready to make concessions that could bring the crime
bill -blocked last week on a procedural vote that dealt a severe rebuff to
Mr Clinton - back to the floor of the House of Representatives for another
vote.
Mr Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said yesterday the
president would not back away from some of the bill's central elements: the
provision of an extra 100,000 police officers, the 'three strikes and out'
rule imposing mandatory life sentences for a third violent crime, and
particularly the ban on assault guns.
But Mr Panetta said the White House might be willing to reduce some of the
spending included in the bill to finance crime prevention programmes.
Republican critics of the bill have focused on money to fund midnight
basketball leagues, designed to provide alternative activities for city
youths who might otherwise be roaming the streets in gangs, as a symbol of
what they see as wasteful social spending.
Mr Clinton insists that this kind of programme - which is supported by many
police and law enforcement associations - is important to give young
Americans 'something to say yes to'.
But White House officials and the Democratic leadership in Congress appeared
ready to give ground on some of the programmes.
'If we have to pay the price to take out some good programmes to satisfy the
critics, I'm not opposed to doing that,' said Mr Thomas Foley, the Speaker
of the House.
Mr Newt Gingrich, the Republican whip in the House, continued to urge
yesterday that the ban on assault guns should be stripped out of the crime
bill and proposed in a separate bill. But he said he would be willing to
allow the bill to go forward in return for changes such as a tougher
requirement that communities be notified when convicted sex offenders who
have been released from prison come to live there.
No such spirit of compromise was to be seen in the Senate, where Mr
Clinton's other main legislative objective, the reform of the healthcare
system, is now held up in endless debate.
Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, said yesterday that he was not
conducting a filibuster, but he continued to prevent any votes from being
taken.
This may prove to be a political risk, however, in the light of public
opinion polls showing widespread disapproval of any filibuster on healthcare
reform.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Guatemala right wing sweeps elections

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The party of a former general allegedly linked with human rights abuses won
Guatemala's congressional elections on Sunday, the Supreme Electoral
Tribunal said.
The Guatemalan Republican Front party (FRG) led by Christian fundamentalist
General Efrain Rios Montt, won 32 seats in the 80-member Congress, well
clear of the right-wing Party of National Advancement (PAN) with 24 seats,
tribunal president Mario Guerra said. The Christian Democrat party trailed
with 13 seats and other parties won the remaining 11 seats.
Voters appear to have been swayed by the general's promise to root out
corruption and improve security, while largely ignoring his record during
his 17-month de facto rule in 1982-83. Results will be officially ratified
later this week.
The traditional parties which have dominated Congress in recent years and
have come to be viewed with disdain by much of the electorate suffered
heavily, particularly in Guatemala City, where the PAN and FRG appeared to
have won 85 per cent of the vote.
But the FRG's victory was undermined by an abstention rate of almost 80 per
cent, reflecting the deep-seated scepticism towards Congress, which is
widely considered to be deeply corrupt.
The government must gain congressional approval before the end of September
on a Paris Club debt rescheduling and push through tax reforms to meet
commitments to the International Monetary Fund.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US industrial production expanded at a moderate 0.2 per cent in July,
according to the Federal Reserve, a decrease from the 0.5 per cent advance
of June.
The output returns were the last economic data to be published before
today's meeting of the Fed's open market committee. Analysts expect the
central bank to nudge short- term interest rates higher by increasing the
Fed funds rate by 0.25 points to 4.5 per cent.
There was nothing in the industrial production figures to contradict the
consistent picture of an economy now growing at a more moderate pace than at
the turn of the year, but with inflation apparently well in check.
The 14th consecutive monthly increase in July was cut in half by two
particular factors - a drop in the generation of electricity from the
unusually high levels of June and the impact of the strike at Caterpillar.
Otherwise output of consumer goods rose by 0.4 per cent, in spite of some
weakness in the car sector.
Industry in July operated at 83.9 per cent of capacity, the same as in the
previous month and similar to the levels of the last five months, but up
from 81.3 per cent a year earlier. The Fed noted that primary processing
industries such as textiles, petroleum, lumber, iron and steel, were
operating at levels above their long-term averages, but that there was less
deviation from the norm in advance processing sectors.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Balaguer poised for new term as tensions rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Joaquin Balaguer will be sworn in today for a seventh term as president
of the Dominican Republic amid political confusion and rising tension.
This follows the failure of legislators on Sunday to approve an agreement
between the government and opposition to end a three-month political crisis
in the Caribbean nation by having a new election next year.
In a surprising concession to foreign and domestic critics who have
persistently claimed that he has retained office through a tainted election
three months ago, Mr Balaguer had agreed to a new election in mid-November
next year. This was accepted by Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, the loser in
the controversial election, who cancelled a series of strikes and street
protests planned for this week.
However, the pact between Mr Balaguer's conservative Social Christian Reform
Party and the social democrat Dominican Revolutionary Party of Mr Pena Gomez
was scuttled on Sunday when the National Assembly voted to hold the new
election in May 1996. Deputies from the Revolutionary party walked out in
disgust leaving the Reform Party to approve the delay.
Mr Balaguer, aged 87, blind and crippled, at least appears ready to envisage
an end to his political career, as the assembly approved an amendment
preventing a president from having consecutive terms.
Tensions in the country heightened when the elections board, after being
silent for eight weeks, announced a fortnight ago that Mr Balaguer had
defeated Mr Pena Gomez in the May 16 election by just over 22,000 votes,
less than 1 per cent of the electorate.
Mr Pena Gomez, who would have been the country's first black president if
forecasts by pre-election polls had materialised, was unwilling to accept
the result offered by the elections board, which is funded and controlled by
the government. The opposition leader and foreign observers of the election
had concurred that about 200,000 Dominicans who should have ben eligible to
do so, could not vote, and that most of these appeared to be Mr Pena Gomez'
supporters.
Mr Balaguer's promise of an early election was clearly intended to mollify
not only Mr Pena Gomez, but also the US. Mr Warren Christopher, the US
secretary of state, called for new elections because the allegations of
fraud were widespread enough to have affected the outcome.
It is not the first time that the ruling Reform Party has been accused of
less than honest methods in helping Mr Balaguer to a slim victory, but
foreign interest in the recent election has been high because Dominican
political developments will influence the situation in Haiti. The two
countries share the island of Hispaniola.
Mr Balaguer has long opposed international efforts to secure the return of
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti, who was overthrown and exiled
three years ago. Mr Pena Gomez is more inclined towards supporting efforts
to pressure Haiti's military leaders into leaving, allowing Mr Aristide to
return.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Deng's homeland struggles to match coastal China: Inland
Sichuan's efforts to close the development gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Governor Xiao Yang of Sichuan, China's most populous province, feels a bit
like an oriental Sisyphus pushing endlessly a large boulder to the top of a
mountain. Trying to close a yawning development gap between his rugged,
landlocked province and the booming coastal regions brings more than its
share of frustrations.
'I haven't seen the peak yet,' he says. 'Of course, I understand how
difficult it is to balance development in this period of China's economic
transformation.'
Sichuan, with its population of more than 100m, many of whom live in remote
mountainous areas, lags far behind the wealthier coastal provinces of
Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong and the 'city states' of Beijing, Shanghai and
Tianjin.
Sichuan's problems of distance from markets and poor infrastructure are
typical of those of 'inland' provinces. Unbalanced development in which
poorer provinces are getting relatively poorer threatens the cohesiveness of
China's reforms and risks feeding dissatisfaction among the disadvantaged
such as the peasants of the hinterland.
For the proud and resourceful Sichuanese whose favourite son is Deng
Xiaoping, China's senior leader, it is painful to contemplate existence as
'poor cousins' to the prospering residents of the east coast, especially as
Sichuan was the crucible of groundbreaking agricultural and industrial
reforms in the late 1970s.
It was, ironically, Mr Deng himself who fuelled the surge of new investment
into coastal areas when he launched the second stage of his economic
revolution - the first phase began in 1978 - with a visit early in 1992 to
southern regions, including Guangdong, adjacent to Hong Kong.
Governor Xiao notes wryly that when he goes to coastal areas these days he
is reminded constantly by fellow officials that Sichuan now is the source of
a flood of vagabond itinerant workers or mangliu (literally 'blind roamers')
who have streamed out of the province in search of work.
It is in the crowded streets of Chengdu and Chongqing, the province's main
cities, and in the verdant but overpopulated rural areas, that the
development gap - and enduring poverty - is most obvious.
Human 'beasts of burden' - men and women dragging heavily laden two-wheeled
carts - are commonplace, and in the fields there is little sign of the
mechanisation that is transforming the lives of prosperous coastal peasants,
freeing them to engage in more remunerative activities such as work in
township and village enterprises.
Chen Kuan Jin, senior economist in Sichuan's Planning Commission, says that
in spite of a concerted effort to attract new investment and enliven the
local economy through hastening economic reforms the gap with coastal
provinces is 'growing larger'.
Sichuan's economy grew last year by 12.8 per cent compared with the national
average of 13.4. Ten years ago it ranked fourth or fifth in China in gross
national product: now it is down to sixth place. But it is in new investment
that the contrast is starkest.
Last year Sichuan attracted Dollars 850m in pledged foreign investment.
Utilised investment for Guangdong, whose growth rates were about twice the
national average, was Dollars 9.65bn. Capital investment in Guangdong last
year reached Yn300bn (Pounds 22.5bn) against Yn63bn for Sichuan.
Unemployment rates, at 3.4 per cent, are higher in Sichuan than the national
average of 2.6 per cent. Wages are about 15 per cent lower than the national
average. Some 80 per cent of Sichuan's population of 100m live in rural
areas. Of these, 44m are classed as 'able bodied workers' but surplus rural
labour totals about 20m.
This means that Sichuan has China's largest pool of surplus labour - about
one-sixth of a huge army of rural workers nationwide whose livelihoods
cannot be sustained by small family holdings.
Sichuanese officials estimate that about 5m peasants have left the province
in search of work, drifting to the coastal regions and the larger cities. In
a way this has proved a blessing for Sichuan's economy since these itinerant
workers are remitting Yn15bn annually to support their impoverished
families.
But feelings have been running high among hard-pressed rural workers who
sense they are being left behind in China's economic boom. One of China's
worst cases of recent rural unrest occurred in June last year when peasants
protesting against higher taxes besieged officials in a county headquarters
near Chengdu, Sichuan's capital, holding them hostage for several days.
Apart from its problems of excess rural labour and an undeveloped
infrastructure, Sichuan is also burdened by a slew of heavily indebted and
over-manned state-run industries. A number are defence-related, re-located
in the inland province in the 1960s to protect them from attack after
Chairman Mao Zedong concluded that a third world war involving China was
inevitable.
But the news for Sichuan is not all gloomy: indeed, the central government
in Beijing, sensing there are flaws, not to mention risks of social unrest,
in a policy of allowing the coastal provinces their head economically in the
hope that this would drag the hinterland along with them, is now giving more
attention to balancing development.
Additional funds are being allocated for spending on infrastructure such as
new airports, railway lines and telecommunications. Tax advantages accruing
to the coastal regions are now also being made available to inland
provinces.
But for Governor Xiao the task of restoring Sichuan to the front rank is not
proving easy. Not least of his difficulties is persuading people, and
investors in particular, that Sichuan is more than, in his words, 'very
remote, full of peasants and a place of exile'.

<TEXT>
China plans to provide Yn10bn (Pounds 752m) in soft loans over the next six
years to rural enterprises in remote areas in an effort to stop a widening
economic and social gap between wealthy coastal regions and the hinterland,
Tony Walker reports. These funds will augment Yn10bn earmarked for
infrastructure projects in deprived areas. 'Ridding central and western
China of their high poverty rates is a primary aim,' a State Planning
Commission official told the China Daily newspaper. The move reflects
growing concern in Beijing over the social and political costs of increasing
disparities between rich and poor areas.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Indonesian sentenced to 17 years in bank scandal

<TEXT>
The Indonesian entrepreneur at the centre of Indonesia's biggest banking
scandal since independence was sentenced to 17 years' imprisonment yesterday
and fined Rp30m (Pounds 9,000).
Mr Eddy Tansil, owner of Golden Key, a retail and manufacturing group with
petrochemical interests, was also ordered to pay Rp500bn and surrender some
of his property to compensate for the losses incurred at Bank Pembangunan
Indonesia (Bapindo), the state-owned development bank.
Mr Tansil, an ethnic Chinese businessman, was accused of illegally securing
a Dollars 430m (Pounds 278m) loan from the bank by colluding with senior
government officials. The loan was never serviced, leaving Bapindo
technically bankrupt. Mr Tansil was accused of obstructing government
efforts to develop the economy by abusing the loan from Bapindo.
The sentence and fine were lighter than expected. Prosecutors had asked for
life imprisonment and fines and compensation totalling Rp830bn.
Mr Tansil is the second person to be convicted in the Bapindo scandal.
Last month, Mr Maman Suparman, manager of a Bapindo branch, was sentenced to
nine years for his role in extending the loan. Mr Tansil is one of six
people involved in the scandal. Two Bapindo directors are still to appear in
court and trials are proceeding against two others.
Over the past six months, prosecutors have been trying to establish how Mr
Tansil, who had little capital to back him and had a history of unsuccessful
ventures, could have qualified for the loan without any collateral.
The answers are alleged to lie with Mr Sudomo, a former minister in charge
of political and security affairs and now a government adviser, Mr J B
Sumarlin, former finance minister and now a chairman of the national audit
agency, and Mr Nasruddin Sumintapura, a former junior finance minister.
So far, Mr Sudomo has appeared as witness in one of the trials, with Mr
Sumintapura and Mr Sumarlin due to be witnesses in coming weeks. Mr Sudomo
admits he authorised the Bapindo loan for Mr Tansil and Mr Sumarlin is
alleged to have overseen the loan.
It remains to be seen whether the government goes further than just a
showcase trial with Mr Tansil as sacrificial lamb.
Indonesians have used the case as a rallying point against institutionalised
corruption. Since the start of the trials, demonstrations have taken place
demanding that Mr Sudomo, Mr Sumarlin and Mr Sumintapura also face trial.
Bankers say the case marks the start of a new era in Indonesia's banking
history.
The Bapindo scandal prompted Indonesia's finance minister, Mr Mar'ie
Muhammad, to disclose the extent of bad loans at state banks, many of which
were brought about by illegal collusion between lenders and borrowers.
According to Mr Muhammad, 21.2 per cent of state banks' loans were bad or
doubtful at the end of 1993, compared with 17.4 per cent a year earlier and
only 6 per cent in 1990.
The figures should be treated with caution because the state banks
themselves are the source for them and they could be far worse, bankers say.

   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea should be prepared for a sudden and unexpected reunification
with North Korea, President Kim Young-sam warned yesterday.
Mr Kim expressed hope for a 'gradual and step-by-step' reunification, but
indicated that North Korea's economic problems could cause a quick collapse
of the country and its absorption by the South.
'The competition between the South and the North over which can create a
better society is over,' he said in a speech marking the 49th anniversary of
Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule. 'We must gather the strength
and courage needed to endure the pain and sacrifice any unification may
entail.'
The South Korean leader formally offered to provide North Korea with the
capital and technology to build light water reactors if Pyongyang accepts
full nuclear inspections. North Korea said last week it would agree to
replace its graphite reactors with safer light water ones as part of a deal
with the US over its nuclear facilities, which are suspected of being used
to produce atomic weapons.
South Korea is competing against Russia for the supply of the light water
reactors. Pyongyang has said it prefers the Russian models because of its
experience in operating Soviet-designed reactors. South Korean reactors are
based on US technology.
Mr Kim described the offer of nuclear technology as the first investment in
a 'joint project for national development' between the two Koreas.
Absent from the president's speech was the hostile rhetoric South Korea has
used to attack North Korea in recent weeks, following the death of North
Korea's President Kim Il-sung.
South Korea has conducted a propaganda campaign against the North to counter
expressions of sympathy for the late president from radical students, who
regard the former North Korean leader as a nationalist hero for his fight
against Japanese colonial rule.
As the students were conducting widespread and sometimes violent
demonstrations in Seoul, the president warned that 'any challenges to our
free and democratic system will not be tolerated.'
Mr Kim pointedly left out of his speech any proposal for resumption of a
planned inter-Korean summit or other forms of bilateral dialogue.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Industry output shows rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial output in Japan grew in June compared with a year earlier, for
the first time in 33 months, according to revised figures from the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry yesterday.
It said production was up 0.6 per cent, compared with a fall of 1.8 per cent
in May and an initial June estimate, released late last month, which showed
neither growth nor decline.
The upward revision is further evidence that a cautious revival may be in
process after the country's longest post-war recession. Output was up by a
seasonally adjusted 2.7 per cent compared with May. Miti had previously put
that figure at 2 per cent.
Officials warned that July data could show a fall both on a month-on-month
and year-on-year basis. Drought is disrupting water supplies to high-volume
users such as the chemicals industry, and overall inventory adjustments have
not ended.
Of individual sectors, machinery lagged, with shipments down and stocks up.
Many consumer industries are benefiting from the hot weather, and Miti
singled out demand for sake as a factor in the strong June performance.
Shipments of all products rose an unadjusted 2 per cent from June 1993, the
first year-on-year rise in 15 months.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Inflation target 'will not be met'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's central bank conceded for the first time yesterday that this year's
8 per cent inflation target would not be met.
Mr Jacob Frenkel, Bank of Israel governor, said tight monetary policy had
failed to rein in inflation, which is being driven primarily by rising
housing prices and public sector wage settlements. He refused to predict the
final figure, but declared: 'We will not make single-digit inflation this
year.'
His remarks came hours before the Bank released the July index which showed
inflation for the month of 1.1 per cent. At least 0.5 per cent of itdue to
housing costs. Bank officials said inflation for the first seven months of
this year was 8.1 per cent. If prices kept rising at this rate, 1994
inflation would an 'extremely worrying' 13 per cent, raising the prospect of
a further interest rate rise soon.
The central bank has raised its interest rate to commercial banks from 10 to
12.5 per cent in three separate increases this year in an effort to meet the
government's 8 per cent target, but Mr Frenkel said monetary policy was
being 'overburdened.' It's a mistake to assign all the efforts in attaining
the inflation targets to monetary policy alone,' he added.
Decreasing housing prices, reducing the budget deficit, continued trade
liberalisation, increased competition and reduction of monopolies and tight
public-sector wage policies were all critical components of Israel's battle
against inflation. Mr Frenkel was especially concerned about recent
government wage pacts.

acute dilemma faced by Arafat

Palestinian security forces yesterday rounded up some 35 members of the
extremist Hamas Islamic movement after Israel threatened to halt peace talks
until the Palestine Liberation Organisation curbed guerrilla attacks against
Jewish settlers and soldiers.
The move, which could ignite violent conflict among Palestinians, has
exposed the acute dilemma faced by Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman. If he
does not take stiff measures against Hamas, the peace process momentum will
quickly decline; if he does crack down on Hamas, seen by many Palestinians
as freedom fighters against continued Israeli occupation of Arab land, he
risks unpopularity and the threat of civil war.
Israel's Premier Yitzhak Rabin welcomed the arrests, calling it a 'good
sign' after a spate of attacks by Hamas gunmen on Israelis in the Gaza
Strip. In Damascus, Hamas condemned the crackdown, accusing Mr Arafat of
'playing the role of the enemy's army', and said it would continue the armed
struggle against Israel.
Earlier, Mr Rabin had visited the Jewish settlement block in the Strip and
toured the road in Gaza where Hamas guerrillas killed an Israeli and wounded
six others in ambushes on Sunday. 'It is inconceivable we will continue the
process without seeing on the part of the Palestinian Authority a serious
effort to deal with those terrorist elements,' Mr Rabin said.
The Israeli military said there had been 39 attacks by Palestinian militants
since they redeployed their forces three months ago, and not a single gunman
had been arrested by Palestinian police.
Mr Rabin said he had frozen talks on releasing more Israeli-held Palestinian
prisoners. Officials said Israel could halt negotiations on reaching
agreement on transferring power from Israeli to Palestinian hands over West
Bank education, health, taxation, welfare and tourism. Israel could also
delay opening a safe corridor between Gaza and Jericho, and setting up
Palestinian terminals at the Rafah and Allenby Bridge crossings.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Hopes revive of Japanese compensating war victims
</HEADLINE>

Japan aims to 'address issues which remain unresolved since the war,' Prime
Minister Tomiichi Murayama said yesterday. His statement revives hopes in
Asia that Japan will provide financial compensation for victims (or their
descendants) in territory occupied before 1945.
At a ceremony in Tokyo on the 49th anniversary of Japan's surrender to the
allies, Mr Murayama did not elaborate on the unresolved issues but went
slightly further than his predecessors in atoning for the actions of the
imperial army.
The prime minister spoke of 'tragic sacrifices beyond description' inflicted
on a large number of people in Asia and elsewhere. He offered 'heartfelt
condolences to them with a deep repentance'. Officials said Mr Murayama,
aged 70 and a life-long socialist and pacifist, had chosen the remorseful
phrases himself to insert into a prepared speech.
A year ago, the then premier, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, raised hopes of
financial redress after acknowledging the forces' misdeeds. Japan insists
the issue of reparations was resolved in the San Francisco peace treaty with
the US, but the possibility of setting up a substantial fund to provide
benefits over 10 years is said to be under discussion ahead of the 50th
anniversary next year.
Japanese are suspected in Asia of insufficiently recognising the
consequences of their country's wartime aggression and mourning only their
own 3m war dead, the actual purpose of yesterday's government-sponsored
service. A separate and more controversial gathering at the Yasukuni Shrine,
where war criminals are among those commemorated, drew seven cabinet
ministers, despite a request from Mr Murayama that they stay away.
Six of the ministers were from the Liberal Democratic party and one from the
New Harbinger party, partners of Mr Murayama's Social Democratic party in
the six-week-old coalition.
On Sunday, an LDP minister resigned after suggesting the Japanese occupation
benefited parts of Asia, bringing independence from European powers, an
increased literacy rate and resultant economic success. Mr Shin Sakurai was
replaced as head of the Environment Agency by Mr Sohei Miyashita, also from
the LDP.

FT  16 AUG 94 / China's central bank calls for tight money policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's central bank, in an unusually forthright public declaration, has
issued a clarion call for tight money policies, continued fiscal restraint
and curbs on capital spending to combat inflation.
The People's Bank, which for years has sheltered behind a dusty cloak of
bureaucratic anonymity, made its 'fight-inflation-first' views known in a
glossy publication titled 'China Financial Outlook, 1994'.
While the document contains errors and omissions, such as understating the
value of China's gold reserves, it does provides a relatively timely
accounting of the country's financial position to the end of 1993. This
contrasts with the bank's previous reporting which has tended to be much
delayed and barely recognisable from propaganda.
China, the bank said, should control investment through fiscal and monetary
policies, and reduce domestic demand through a 'tight credit policy, thus
increasing exports and curtailing imports'. Money supply should not be
allowed to grow faster than 24 per cent for 1994, which is broadly in line
with monetary growth in 1993.
Publication of 'China Financial Outlook, 1994', with its smart graphics,
elegant lay-out and attempts at forecasting economic and financial trends
for this year, coincides with new legislation redefining the People's Bank's
role as the leading institution in the fight against inflation.
The document also reflects the bank's greater self confidence under the
governorship of Mr Zhu Rongji, senior vice premier in charge of the economy.
In its analysis of likely inflation trends, the bank predicted that price
rises would gradually slow over the latter part of the year, although there
would be 'fluctuations and the whole years's average. . . may continuously
remain at a high level.'
China reported the cost of living increase in the 35 main cities was 22.7
per cent in June compared with the same month last year. Retail inflation
was about 20 per cent.
The bank's forecast gave no indication that it might be prepared to relax
credit restrictions during the year or ease monetary targets. But the
forecast was drafted in the first quarter before pressures from ailing state
enterprises forced some easing of credit.
The People Bank, in reference to reforms of its charter, defined its role as
'keeping the currency stable and promoting economic growth'.
'The PBC (People's Bank of China) has to increase the use of indirect
regulation while at the same time maintaining credit ceilings on specialised
banks (state-owned commercial banks),' the forecast added.
China's foreign exchange reserves were expected to support 2.8 months of
imports in 1994 compared with 2.94 months in 1993. In fact, the forecast
underestimated the improvement in China's reserves, which rose by 50 per
cent in the first half of the year to Dollars 31.8bn. Slower growth in
imports contributed to the improvement.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Hoechst boosted by 'ozone-eating' filter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in the German chemicals group Hoechst were invigorated yesterday by
news that it had developed an 'ozone-eating' filter material with a wide
range of industrial and domestic applications - and sales potential of up to
DM500m (Pounds 207m) a year.
Although the maximum local atmospheric concentration of the irritant ozone
was well below recent alarm levels, the Frankfurt-based company's
announcement alerted dealers, who marked the stock up DM8.50 to DM356.
According to Mr Andreas Schleicher, manager of the Noxon project, Hoechst is
negotiating with around 40 companies interested in applying its ability to
convert air- or water-borne ozone into pure oxygen by 'eating' the extra
oxygen atom in ozone.
Potential partners included manufacturers of filters and air-conditioning
appliances for commercial and domestic use and swimming pool and sewage
equipment makers.
Hoechst claimed its research had shown Noxon could destroy concentrations of
up to 200 grammes a cubic metre - some 1.5m times Germany's recommended
outdoor level of 120 microgrammes.
The Hoechst material offered no health risks in itself and had many
promising applications in protecting people from ozone's harmful effects, Mr
Schleicher said. Ozone can cause headaches and irritate lungs, throat and
eyes. Children and the elderly are often especially sensitive.
Hoechst suggested hospitals, old people's homes and schools as likely buyers
of Noxon filters and air-conditioners, along with car and aircraft
manufacturers.
The company was also working on developing ozone sensors for industrial
applications where it was essential to be alerted to the presence of excess
gas. These included ozone generation plants, and offices fitted with laser
printers or large photocopiers. Under German law, workplace concentrations
may not exceed 200 microgrammes per cubic metre.
According to Mr Schleicher, cyclists were among potential beneficiaries from
projects such as the combination of Noxon with other materials such as
activated charcoal in smog masks.
Heavy ozone contamination was the focus of Germany's latest environmental
controversy when drivers in Hoechst's home state of Hesse were ordered not
to exceed 80kmph during the recent heatwave. Fast driving was blamed for an
unacceptably high concentration of atmospheric ozone in the state.

FT  16 AUG 94 / France adjusts slowly to recovery: Green shoots are viewed
with some caution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The green shoots of France's economic recovery have been breaking through
with increasing vigour.
A series of statistics released over the past 10 days, from revised first
quarter growth figures to first half employment trends, reveal a rise in
momentum as the economy seeks to put behind it the sharp recession of 1993.
Revised first quarter growth figures showed a rise of 0.7 per cent in gross
domestic product, with most economists predicting a stronger performance in
the second quarter. In June, unemployment fell for the first time in four
years, while statistics released last week showed that 60,000 jobs were
created in the April-June period. A string of company results, from Air
Liquide, the industrial gases group, to the Peugeot-Citroen car company,
have revealed healthy sales increases for the first half of the year.
Inflation remains moribund at an annualised rate of 1.7 per cent.
'Some of the numbers have been impressive,' says Mr Paul O'Brien, European
economist at JP Morgan. 'We are seeing a nice, healthy adjustment on the
production and business side.' Like many other economists, he has revised up
his forecasts for GDP growth this year to just under 2 per cent, compared
with a 1 per cent contraction in 1993.
The numbers add up to good news for Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister,
as France heads for presidential elections next spring. But his reaction has
been guarded rather than enthusiastic. 'I think that this is the beginning
of a real recovery,' he says. 'But it may be that in the months ahead we
have some disappointments. . . . whether it is production figures, export
figures or employment figures.'
Such a reaction reveals more than Mr Balladur's cautious nature. As he is
aware, the pattern of recovery this year contains elements of weakness which
may yet undermine its resilience and duration.
So far this year, the economic revival has been based largely on a slowdown
in company destocking and strong export demand from other reviving
economies. According to Insee, the national statistics office, the
rebuilding of inventories was the single biggest factor in economic growth
in the first quarter and remained important in the second.
Such a development, reflected in the strong sales performance of companies
supplying intermediate and capital goods, is normal in the early stages of
recovery. The concern arises over the prospects for other engines of growth,
in particular, consumption and investment.
France's consumers remain very wary of parting with their money. An
estimated 1 per cent rise in consumer spending in the second quarter was
largely the result of special government incentives in the motor sector, in
particular a FFr5,000 (Pounds 605) payment to car-owners trading in old
vehicles to buy new. Strip out that sector, argues Ms Esther Baroudy, senior
economist at Credit Lyonnais, and one is left with an anaemic performance by
the French shopper.
The explanation for consumer caution lies partly with continued concerns
about the level of unemployment and the reduced generosity of state
benefits, for example pensions. Says the manager of one Paris bank: 'Many
people have friends or relatives out of work. Most are aware that they state
pension system is becoming less generous. So the response is to be more
careful, spend less and save more.'
Mr Balladur hopes this sentiment is beginning to change as the perception of
recovery spreads. Economists disagree whether this hope will be realised. Ms
Baroudy believes there is a danger the savings ratio will remain stuck where
it is and that consumption will weaken sharply in the third quarter. Others
argue that, with the employment situation stabilised and preparing to
improve, the fear of unemployment will recede. 'The developments in the
labour market will have a big positive impact,' says Mr Bernard Godement,
chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute in Paris.
The government has taken several steps besides the car measures to help lift
consumption. It is due to transfer FFr6bn to families to help pay for the
expenses of the new school year. FFr15bn will also enter consumers' pockets
through income tax cuts in the third quarter.
However, another potential constraint on growth is out of the government's
hands. Despite the lack of inflationary pressures, turmoil in international
bond markets has prompted a rise in long term interest rates from about 5.6
per cent at the start of the year to more than 7 per cent.
Economists play down the threat to industrial investment. 'If you look at
most French companies they have a relatively strong financial position at
the moment,' says one. 'On balance they are net cash holders.' He cites
Saint Gobain, the glass and building materials group, as just one company
with ambitious investment plans.
The effect on the housing market may be more serious. New house purchases
have slipped since the beginning of the year, partly because of the higher
cost of long-term finance. Still more worrying is the impact on interest
payments on the government's debt as it struggles to curb its budget
deficit, targeted at FFr300bn this year.
Economics ministry officials claim the target will be reached, pointing to
the imposition of austere spending targets across the government ministries.
A further rise in long term yields, however, would present the government
with a difficult choice in the run-up to a presidential election: to rein in
government spending still further or raise taxes. Neither is a palatable
option, and both may damage the green shoots of recovery.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Czechs to repay all IMF debt early
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Czech Republic is to repay its entire outstanding debt of Dollars 471m
(Pounds 305m) to the International Monetary Fund before the end of
September, two years ahead of schedule.
The Czech National Bank said that because of the strength of the country's
official foreign exchange reserves, which stood at Dollars 5.3bn at the end
of July, the loan should be repaid earlier than the first official payment
date in 1996. 'We expect a further rise in reserves by the end of the year
and this allows us to make the repayment ahead of time,' said Mr Tomas
Potmesil, an adviser to the governor of the bank, Mr Josef Tosovsky.
The loan is part of a package of credits totalling Dollars 1.6bn granted by
the IMF in 1991 to the former Czechoslovakia. The intention was to
strengthen hard currency reserves and finance the country's balance of
payments deficits as it embarked on the most ambitious economic reform
programme among the former communist economies of eastern Europe.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia separated at the end of 1992, and the debt
was divided in the ratio 2.29 to 1 respectively. The loan to be repaid
represents the outstanding amount of the Czech Republic's share of the
total.
Since the split, the Czech Republic's balance of payments has moved into
surplus, driven by a rise in exports to western Europe and the growth of the
services sector. At the end of July the surplus stood at Kcs8.7bn (Pounds
201m).
Czech foreign exchange reserves have risen sharply this year because of a
big increase in the inflow of foreign capital, attracted by the country's
economic stability and high long-term interest rates. Reserves stood at an
average Dollars 3.8bn in 1993 and rose to Dollars 4.8bn in May this year.
Reserves at the end of July are at their highest since the economic reform
programme of Mr Vaclav Klaus, prime minister, began in 1992.
Apart from the official reserves, Czech banks have also attracted big
capital inflows and reserves in the banking system stood at Dollars 6.8bn at
the end of last month.
Last week the national bank raised its estimate of total foreign capital
inflows for 1994 to Kcs100bn from Kcs60bn, which would give official
reserves of nearly Dollars 9bn. It also raised its growth estimate for M2
money supply from 14 per cent to 17, but said the impact on inflation, which
hovers close to the bank's target of 10 per cent for the year, should be
broadly neutral.
The national bank raised the minimum reserve requirements of Czech banks on
August 4 from 9 per cent to 12 per cent of deposits to dampen the
inflationary impact of M2 growth and to maintain it at a level consistent
with a projected 2 per cent rise in gross domestic product for this year.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Killings shatter Zurich's orderly drug scene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Zurich's infamous open hard drug scene has been witness to many shocking
human dramas in the past few years. But it has been virtually free of
violence - as if even drug addicts and dealers agreed to respect the Swiss
insistence on order in all things.
No more. In the past month, four people have been murdered near the
abandoned midtown Letten railway station where some 1,000 dealers and
addicts huddle together over a thick carpet of syringe wrappers and blood
soaked cotton wool.
Last Friday night, a Lebanese youth was shot dead in the back, setting off
an unprecedented chain of violence and threats of further violence.
Street fighting broke out between gangs of dealers and between dealers and
the police. A police car was overturned and several private vehicles damaged
as rumours spread that the police were responsible for the shooting. Then,
following the arrest of a Lebanese youth, a group of Lebanese dealers
threatened to bomb the city.
The stunned Swiss authorities believe the cause of this deterioration has
been the attempt by Lebanese and other Arabs to muscle in on drug dealing in
Zurich, a trade hitherto dominated by former Yugoslavs.
Police also believe the violence is related to the sharp fall in the street
price of heroin - to about SFr50 (Pounds 25) per gram, about a quarter of
the price prevailing two years ago. In a bizarre show of power at the
weekend, angry Letten dealers withdrew from the market, driving addicts out
into the city streets in a desperate search for their fixes.
'We are observing a virtual drug war. The fight for market share has become
harder and has escalated in recent months,' Ms Monika Stocker, Zurich's
social services director, said on Sunday.
The violence first broke out in mid-July when a North African man was knifed
to death in the drug quarter. Then early in August, two Algerians were shot
in the head.
'We cannot let murders like this happen every week,' a spokesman for the
city's overstretched police said yesterday. But he had few ideas for
preventing them.
Ironically, the escalation has come at a time when the Swiss finally seemed
to be getting to grips with their outsized drug problem.
Last year, the federal government authorised a limited experiment in legal
distribution of heroin to Zurich addicts, with a view to breaking the
criminal distribution system. Next month, parliament is to vote on a bill
making it more difficult for immigrant dealers to take advantage of the
asylum law to escape detention and expulsion.
Next spring, another 300 prison cells will become available in Zurich. At
the moment, prosecutors tend to release minor drug offenders because of the
lack of prison accommodation.
For Ms Stocker, it is all too little too late. She says that if the federal
government does not soon authorise a widening of the controlled distribution
of heroin, the city could act unilaterally by declaring a health emergency.
Such a radical step may not be necessary. The Swiss people, who have long
preferred not to recognise their drug problem, may finally have been shocked
into an awareness of its seriousness by last Saturday's bombing threat.
And that, in turn, could spur the country's timid politicians to push
through long-discussed drug related reform measures.

The trial of five Albanian ethnic Greeks was adjourned yesterday after the
prosecution dropped charges of treason against them, saying it could no
longer use the country's old penal code to interpret some activities. Greece
had alleged the trial would be unjust as the Albanian penal code was used by
the former Stalinist administration. The other charges against the five, of
military espionage for the Greek secret service and the illegal possession
of weapons, remained in force. The five accused, who have pleaded not
guilty, were arrested last April after a border incident in which two
Albanian conscripts were killed inside Albania. Albania accused Greece of
staging a cross-border raid, prompting angry denials from Athens.

An International Monetary Fund mission arrived in Ukraine yesterday to help

government pledged last month to work with the IMF over the next two months
to clear the way for Kiev to receive a Dollars 700m systemic transformation
facility, part of a special fund designed to speed the transition to
capitalism for the countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
The mission is the first to visit Ukraine with a mandate to negotiate a
programme. The Group of Seven industrialised nations last month promised
Ukraine Dollars 4bn in economic assistance - mostly from international
financial institutions  - if the country pushes ahead with serious reforms.

The environmental group Greenpeace said yesterday it had found Spanish
fishing boats in the Straits of Gibraltar using illegal drift nets of the
kind which have provoked the so-called 'tuna war' between Spain and France.
Greenpeace said its flagship Rainbow Warrior had found some 10 Spanish
vessels using drift nets, which have been banned by the Spanish government
since 1990, on Sunday night. Greenpeace volunteers managed to pull part of
one of the nets out of the water and escape with it. In the Bay of Biscay,
Spain's north coast fishing fleet, which uses traditional hook and line
techniques to catch tuna, has clashed several times with French, Irish and
British boats which it says use drift nets longer than permitted by the
European Union.

The Russian coastguard yesterday fired on two Japanese fishing boats in
waters off the disputed South Kurile islands, wounding one crew-member,
Russian officials said yesterday. The clash was the first time Russia, which
has often accused Japanese vessels of poaching in Russian waters, has fired
on a Japanese ship and could provoke a serious escalation in the dispute
between the two nations over the contested Kurile islands. Japan is trying
to reclaim the islands, seized by Soviet soldiers at the end of the second
world war and has refused to commit serious government or private funds to
Russia because of the dispute. Yesterday's incident, which Russian
coastguard officials described as 'necessary', suggests Moscow intends to
take a tougher line in enforcing its sovereignty. One Japanese boat is now
in Russian custody and the coastguard is searching for the second.

A quantity of weapons grade plutonium found on a Lufthansa flight to Munich
from Moscow last week threatened yesterday to provoke a serious row between
Germany and Russia. Moscow denied the plutonium was Russian, saying an
inventory of all its sources had discovered no loss or theft. German experts
said analysis could pinpoint the point of manufacture in Russia. According
to Munich police couriers detained arriving from Moscow had been carrying
300-350 grammes of plutonium 239  - a few millionths of a gramme of which
will kill - in a lead-lined steel case. It was the third seizure in four
months of weapons-grade material from the former Soviet bloc. A spokesman
from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party, claimed yesterday
there had been 267 cases of smuggling of radioactive material since the
Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Whiff of Greek sewage at the yacht club: Pressure is growing
on Greece to smarten up its act on waste disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An onshore breeze carries a whiff of sewage to wrinkle the noses of
shipowners lounging at the yacht club on the Greek island of Andros.
Andros town, the capital, boasts a main street paved with marble and a
renowned modern art museum, but it lacks a waste treatment plant. Some
Andriot mansions have cesspits, but an estimated 80 per cent of the town's
waste pours straight into the Aegean Sea.
This does not amount to much in winter, when the population shrinks to
around 2,000. But summer is a different matter, with more than 15,000
visitors and expatriate Andriots packing the beaches at weekends.
'The outlets aren't close to places where people swim. But a municipality on
a wealthy island ought to have a sewage treatment plant,' says Mr Leonidas
Voulgaris, the mayor.
It was only after Andros was included in a European Union environmental
programme last year that plans for a sewage treatment plant were approved by
the government. The town council had already paid Dr100m (Pounds 274,000) to
lay a network of pipes. The EU will cover the Dr200m cost of building the
plant.
However, the project is now delayed by a 'not-in-our-backyard' protest by a
village close to the proposed site for the plant.
'It won't be an eyesore, and the outfall pipe goes 200m out to sea to dump
the waste 30 metres deep. But they're still raising objections,' says Mr
Voulgaris.
Andros's sewage disposal problems are typical both of islands and large
Greek cities. It has taken more than 10 years to build a sewage treatment
plant for Athens on the deserted islet of Psyttaleia in the Saronic Gulf,
together with an undersea pipeline to carry waste from the city. It is due
to start operating this autumn.
About 700,000 tons of industrial and household waste are dumped untreated
into the Saronic every year.
Another 20,000 tons yearly of oily slops from ships also end up there,
according to figures published by Anakiklosi, a Greek ecological group
acting as a consultant for the environment ministry.
'For three to five kilometres each side of the main outfall, the sea can't
sustain life and the seabed is covered with a thick layer of sludge
containing heavy metals,' says Mr Philip Kerkitsos, an environmental
scientist at the University of the Aegean. 'After the treatment facility
starts up, it will take 10-15 years for the Saronic to recover.'
For a country that relies on sun-and-sea tourism for much of its foreign
exchange income, Greece has been slow to develop an awareness of
environmental cost. Tourism earnings are projected at Dollars 6bn this year,
equal to the total forecast value of Greek exports.
However, attitudes are starting to change. The tourism ministry has launched
a campaign to check up on whether large hotels have switched on the waste
treatment plants they are required by law to install. Several hotels on
Corfu, which attracts more than 700,000 tourists yearly, have been fined for
pumping raw sewage into the sea.
A sizeable percentage of Greece's Ecu2.6bn (Pounds 2.04bn) share of the EU's
new Cohesion Fund is being set aside to build waste disposal plants. By the
end of the 1990s every town with more than 20,000 residents, together with
islands that attract tourists in large numbers, should have a sewage
treatment facility.
Yet even if foreign tourists have abandoned the Saronic, bypassing Athens to
fly direct to the islands, Greeks have few qualms about swimming in it.
About 1.5m Athenians - more than one-third of the city's residents - go to
local beaches every Sunday in July and August, according to an environment
ministry study.
The ministry is criticised by environmental groups for not carrying out
regular water quality tests on beaches near Athens and publicising the
results. On the other hand, ecologists appear to agree that away from
harbours, swimming in the Saronic is not generally hazardous to health.
Keeping the beaches free of litter is this summer's priority. Greece's only
manufacturer of beach-cleaning equipment is working round the clock under a
Dr150m environment ministry project to sweep 135km of beaches around Athens
and on nearby islands at least twice a week.
The company, Ram Europe, undertakes to pick up what ordinary rubbish
collectors leave behind, including cigarette stubs, peach stones and canned
drink stoppers. Mr Theodoros Redzos, general manager, says he worked out a
set of ecological criteria with the environment ministry so that 'plants
aren't disturbed, sand is not removed and the machines leave the shape of
the shoreline intact.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A stash of weapons grade plutonium found on a Lufthansa flight to Munich
from Moscow last week threatened yesterday to provoke a serious diplomatic
row between Germany and Russia.
In Moscow the atomic energy ministry yesterday denied the plutonium was
Russian but German experts said its analysis could pinpoint the point of
manufacture in Russia.
Munich police said couriers they detained last week arriving on a flight
from Moscow had been carrying 300-350 grams of radioactive plutonium 239. It
was the third seizure in four months of weapons-grade material from the
former Soviet bloc. Moscow's atomic energy ministry spokesman, Mr Georgy
Kaurov, said Russia could account for all its plutonium but a German
government spokesman said this was not true.
Unlike uranium 235, the other material used for making bombs, plutonium 239
does not occur naturally and has to be produced at a nuclear plant.
'Statistically speaking, there must still be a high probability that it came
from here,' said a diplomat in Moscow.
Chancellery aide Mr Bernd Schmidbauer will take with him the analysis of the
latest consignment, currently being examined in a laboratory, when he goes
to Moscow in the next few days at Chancellor Helmut Kohl's request to
discuss nuclear smuggling.
Mr Kaurov said the Russian authorities had conducted an inventory of all
sources of plutonium 239 over the previous two weeks and had discovered no
thefts or losses.
Russian intelligence sources in Moscow claim the west is deliberately
exaggerating the drain of nuclear material from the country in an attempt to
force new controls on the domestic nuclear industry.
Mr Kaurov vigorously rejected suggestions that Mr Viktor Sidorenko, the
deputy atomic energy minister who was travelling on the same aircraft as the
plutonium, was in any way connected with the affair.' Our minister is a
deeply-respected academic. . . . he simply could not be involved in such a
business,' he said.
Ukraine, another part of the former Soviet Union capable of producing
nuclear materials, also denied any involvement in the affair.
Mr Anatoli Chernov, deputy head of the Ukrainian state atomic energy
commission, said: 'We are not physically or technically capable of producing
plutonium 239. This has to be from a country which produces and controls
nuclear weapons. It is exclusively a Russian affair. Let them figure it
out.'

FT  16 AUG 94 / Slower retail sales highlight patchy recovery: July high
street spending eases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The patchy nature of the pick-up in UK consumer spending is underlined today
in a business survey showing that the rate of growth in high street sales
slowed in July.
With the level of sales lower than businesses had expected, the results
suggest that retailers are seeing a steady, rather than a sharp, recovery in
the aftermath of April's tax increases.
The Confederation of British Industry's survey of distributive trades showed
that 40 per cent of UK retailers reported sales had increased in the year to
July. This result was less upbeat than in June, when 48 per cent of
retailers reported growth in sales volumes, and was also below retailers'
previous predictions.
However the CBI yesterday played down the figures and pointed out that the
underlying trend in retail sales remained upward. The monthly survey data
had been uneven since April's tax rises, and most sectors had reported a
growth in annual sales volumes, the CBI added.
Nevertheless, retailers had now scaled back down their expectations, the
survey suggested. The proportion of retailers expecting sales to pick up
this month fell in July, after the optimism seen in June. The level of
orders placed with suppliers remained broadly flat last month, and the
majority of retailers reported that their stocks remained adequate for the
levels of business expected in the coming months.
This pattern was reflected among the wholesalers. Although sales volumes
grew sharply in the year to July, the growth was slower than in June and
below expectations.
Wholesalers significantly scaled back their business expectations in July
with around three-quarters expecting no growth next month.
Sales levels among motor traders continued to fall for the fourth month in a
row, with sales at the lowest level since last December, the survey said.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Companies House to cut charges after EU court ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies House is to reduce by half the fees it charges for registering
British companies and for the annual submission of returns to avoid a legal
battle following a recent judgment in the European Court of Justice.
The decision, which will take effect on October 1, is expected to wipe out
the annual contribution made by Companies House - the official repository
for corporate financial information in England, Wales and Scotland - to the
Department of Trade and Industry, which last year stood at Pounds 17m.
Nearly 1m limited liability companies are registered with Companies House,
and last year 115,000 new companies were incorporated for the first time.
The move to cut the charges was taken by the DTI - for which Companies House
operates as an executive agency. It follows a European Court ruling,
involving an Italian company, which interpreted a 1969 Brussels directive to
mean that fees for registering a company must be restricted to
administration costs involved.
Search fees and fines levied on companies for filing their returns after the
due dates will not be affected by the changes. The halving in Companies
House fees - Pounds 50 for incorporation and Pounds 32 for filing annual
returns - coincides with a review of its activities by consultants appointed
by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
Stoy Hayward, the accountancy firm, came up with a list of options for
privatisation last year and is submitting a follow-up study to examine
proposals in more detail by the autumn. It is set to begin canvassing public
views over the next few weeks.
Mr Heseltine is keen to contract out most Companies House services, although
he has indicated that responsibility for the registrar's functions and
ownership of the register will remain with the DTI.
The option under Mr Heseltine's partial privatisation plans which seems most
likely to be favoured involves paying private sector contractors a
management fee akin to the way Companies House now operates, with an annual
target for reduction in costs. Officials have also been considering paying
contractors on the basis of net running costs, in proportion to the workload
handled each year.
The reduction in income brought about by halving fees in the wake of the
European Court ruling was anticipated in the run-up to commissioning the
privatisation studies and is considered unlikely to scupper Mr Heseltine's
plans.
The department said that the fees charged by Companies House have never been
tested legally but the DTI had decided not to challenge the European Court
ruling to avoid the possibility of a protracted legal action.
A DTI spokeswoman claimed that fees charged by Companies House were among
the lowest in Europe.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Carlos 'the Jackal' flown to Paris after Sudan arrest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Carlos 'the Jackal', the notorious terrorist and guerrilla, is being held in
Paris after being captured in Sudan.
Carlos, pictured above in Sudan before his arrest, is linked to many of the
world's bloodiest terrorist attacks over the past two decades, including the
1972 massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics, the 1974
takeover of the French embassy in the Hague, and the 1976 hijacking to
Entebbe, Uganda, of an Air France airliner.
He has eluded the authorities by moving from country to country, notably
Syria, Libya and Hungary, where he was given refuge by the former communist
regime in the late 1970s.
However, since the mid-1980s, with the collapse of communism and the
improvement of relations in the Middle East, Carlos has found refuge more
difficult, French officials said. Report, Page 16

FT  16 AUG 94 / Recession is over, says Bonn: Minister predicts German
economic growth may reach 2.5% by end of year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The west German recession was officially declared over yesterday by Mr
Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, who said unemployment was falling and
national economic growth could reach 2.5 per cent this year.
Reconstruction of the eastern economy was also progressing rapidly, he said.
Hinting at even more robust prospects for 1995, the minister, speaking in
Bonn, took the opportunity to goad opposition Social Democrats (SPD) already
discomfited by a further poll showing continued gains for the ruling
coalition.
Far from being frivolous and tainted by wishful thinking, as the SPD had
claimed, his new year forecasts of up to 1.5 per cent pan-German growth had
been shown to be 'extremely cautious', Mr Rexrodt claimed.
The economics ministry had also upgraded its earlier prediction of up to 8
per cent growth in the east to a maximum of 10 per cent his year.
'Unfortunate talk of de-industrialisation in east Germany is false,' Mr
Rexrodt said.
Although unemployment would be unacceptably high this year at just over
3.7m, the total would be less than his ministry had forecast earlier, and
'horror' scenarios of up to 4.5m unemployed had been proven far removed from
reality, he added.
Mr Rexrodt said real income cuts would have to be accepted temporarily in
the interests of improving labour market conditions, but employees could
count on real increases as productivity improved. But even then moderation
would be required.
This view was echoed in the Bundesbank's latest monthly report, published
yesterday, which said rises in hourly wages of more than 6 per cent in 1991
and 1992 were among the fundamental causes of last year's recession.
Between 1989 and 1993 real incomes had grown at more than double the rate
justified by economic performance, it said. The central bank has
consistently said that this year's 2 per cent pay increase in the west,
implying real cuts in purchasing power, was only the first step back to a
rational pay policy.
While not as enthusiastic as Mr Rexrodt, the bank also noted that west
German industrial production rose 3 per cent in the second quarter, while
manufacturing capacity utilisation was at levels last seen in the autumn of
1992. Latest data from the east showed a 27 per cent year-on-year rise in
industrial output, it said.
On Thursday, the Bundesbank council will meet to decide on interest rate
policy. European markets were yesterday cautious ahead of the meeting, the
first since since the summer holiday.
In an attempt to counter opposition proposals to redistribute tax burdens to
help lower income groups, Mr Rexrodt said research had shown 'room for
manoeuvre' on federal, state and local taxes. In his view, the basic minimum
income could be freed of tax by 1996.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Ex-head of Reed Elsevier to receive Pounds 2.02m pay-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Davis, former co-chairman of Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch
information and publishing group, is to receive one of the largest executive
pay-offs in Britain in recent years - a compensation package worth Pounds
2.02m.
Mr Davis, who resigned in June after a dispute over management
responsibilities, is to receive Pounds 652,000 in cash, Pounds 1.3m of
enhanced pension entitlements and up to Pounds 70,000 in fringe benefits,
including temporary use of an office suite in London's West End.
The deal, which was announced yesterday after protracted talks between Reed
Elsevier's lawyers and actuaries, is the third-largest disclosed by an FT-SE
250 company since June last year.
According to figures compiled by Pirc, the corporate governance consultancy,
Mr Davis's pay-off was outstripped only by the Pounds 3.1m package awarded
to Mr John Cahill, former chairman of British Aerospace, and a combined
Pounds 2.9m payment to two directors of Lasmo, the oil exploration company.
Reed Elsevier also disclosed that Mr Davis, who oversaw last year's merger
of Reed International and Elsevier, could receive a further payout under an
incentive scheme linked to growth in earnings per share.
However, the company played down the size of the settlement. It pointed out
that Mr Davis was receiving enhanced pension entitlements for only two years
of his three-year rolling contract and that the cash pay-off was not much
more than last year's salary and bonus payment of Pounds 636,592.
'Mr Davis forfeited the additional enhancement of his pension that would
have occurred had he worked for the balance of his notice period,' Reed
Elsevier added.
Nevertheless, the pay-off has raised concerns among a number of Reed's
institutional shareholders. Mr Michael Taylor, a fund manager at Royal
Insurance, said the package was 'excessive', while another fund manager said
he would be seeking clarification of the deal.
The announcement follows criticism of executive compensation by Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, at the weekend.
'I would personally like to see a much stronger role of share owners acting
to ensure these sort of practices are constrained,' Mr Heseltine said.
His concern was echoed by Ms Melanie Tether, employment partner at City
solicitors Norton Rose. 'Shareholders may think about exercising their
powers to ask companies to justify payments of this size,' she said
yesterday.

The company, which launched quarterly reporting earlier this year, swung
into a slim Fl 10m (Dollars 5.6m) profit in the first quarter from losses in
1993. The pace of recovery is expected to have accelerated in the second
quarter, thanks to strong growth in world trade flows and firmer shipping

FT  15 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): BCI poised for new capital-raising
issue - Other Companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Banca Commerciale Italiana, the Italian bank, plans on Thursday to launch
its first capital-raising exercise since privatisation - an issue of shares
and warrants which should raise L2,362bn (Dollars 1.51bn). In the last two
months, two Italian banks - Cariplo and Mediobanca - have been forced to
postpone share issues because of market turbulence. But the price of the BCI
issue has been set at a discount - L3,000 a share against a market price of
more than L4,400 - so should avoid the same fate, in spite of the turmoil in
Italian equities last week.
On the same day, shares in Telecom Italia, the new grouping of
state-controlled telecommunications operators, will start trading. Telecom
Italia was created in May from the fusion of five existing companies,
including Sip, the domestic telecoms operator, and became the sixth largest
telecoms group in the world. Following a complex share-swap, its shares will
replace those of Sip on the market, while shares in Italcable will be
delisted.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Indonesia spurns US pressure over workers' rights
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Indonesian police arrested the leader of the country's largest independent
trade union at the weekend only days after the US indicated it was likely to
delay a decision on whether to continue extending a trade privilege to
Jakarta that hinges on workers' rights.
Mr Muchtar Pakpahan, chairman of the independent Indonesian Welfare Labour
Union, was arrested in connection with violent labour demonstrations in the
North Sumatran town of Medan in April this year.
Police reports said Mr Pakpahan was arrested because he was engaging in
'criminal acts which were likely to lure other people into criminality'.
The government only recognises the SPSI, a union run by state bureaucrats
which tows the government line.
The issue of worker rights has been a thorn in Jakarta's relations with
Washington, which had already postponed by six months a decision due last
February on the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). On Tuesday, the US
said Indonesia needed to do more, despite recent progress on worker rights
but said it would delay a decision on renewing the country's GSP status.
The delay did not come as a surprise to Jakarta. It would have been awkward
for Washington to revoke Indonesia's GSP status three months before
President Clinton is due in Indonesia for the Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation summit which Indonesia's President Suharto is hosting.
Under GSP, Indonesian manufactured goods are allowed duty-free entry into
the US, helping textile and footwear exports in particular. However, the
value of exports benefiting from GSP status is small. Last year Dollars 600m
worth of Indonesian exports went to the US under GSP, which represented only
16 per cent of total Indonesian exports to the US. Economists say that if
Indonesia's GSP status was revoked between Dollars 60m and Dollars 70m worth
of trade would be lost.

The Dominican Republic's National Assembly voted yesterday to delay new
presidential elections intended to end the country's three-month leadership
crisis, Reuter reports from Santo Domingo.
The assembly voted to hold elections on May 16 1996, rejecting a pact agreed
last Wednesday between the Dominican president and the opposition leader to
hold the poll on November 16 1995.
Dominican politics have been locked in a crisis since allegations of fraud
surfaced during May's presidential elections. Incumbent President Mr Joaquin
Balaguer beat his closest competitor, Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez of the
Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD), by about 1 per cent, or 22,000, of
votes cast.
Mr Pena Gomez has charged that thousands of PRD members were illicitly
denied the ballot.
His charges have been echoed by international election observers who said
there was evidence of voting fraud. Dominican authorities agreed, but said
they could not determine which party benefited.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Berliners demand their homes back: Those who lost land when
the Berlin Wall went up think it is time to reclaim it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They had gathered on Saturday at the site of the former Berlin Wall in
Bernauer street, 33 years to the day after east German troops moved in with
bulldozers to divide the city.
About 100 people, many frail and elderly, stood on this long, narrow strip
of wasteland in east Berlin. It had been turned into mud by the torrential
rain but they had come determined not to celebrate the collapse of the wall
nearly five years ago, but to demand from the German government the right to
regain property which they had been forced to leave when east German troops
ordered them out of their homes to make way for the wall on the night of
August 13 1961.
'All we want is justice,' says Mr Wolf-Dietrich Golz, who two years ago
helped establish an association for those seeking compensation or
restitution.
'The German government refuses to return our property to us,' says Mr Golz.
'Their excuse is that since all property along the Berlin Wall belonged to
the former east German defence ministry, it should automatically be passed
under the control of the German state. But why? Why is it that those whose
property was confiscated by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945, or by the
communists between 1949 and 1990, can seek compensation or restitution, but
not us?'
The Berlin Wall ran like a snake along 165km of the city, cutting through
3,000 homes.
'I remember August 13 1961 very well,' says Mr Golz, 54. 'It was a warm,
quiet summer's night. We were living on Finkenkruger Street in Spandau, not
in the British zone, but in the eastern/Soviet zone. I had been writing a
love letter. Then I heard the dogs, the bulldozers, the soldiers. The next
morning, I looked out the window. Finkenkruger Street had been divided. We
were locked in.'
'Even before the wall had been built, it was sheer hell to live there. In
the late 1940s, when the Russians carved out their zone in east Berlin, life
became very difficult. We were surrounded by guards.'
Mr Golz's mother eventually moved to Bavaria, leaving the family house to
her son in her will. 'I was studying at the time in Dresden. I went back
from time to time to my home. Then in 1967, the home was flattened. I
received no notification. No compensation. Nothing.'
The wall along Finkenkruger Street has since been removed. All that remains
is a long avenue of overgrown grass and shrubs. East and West Berliners can
now see each other again. 'I want to return there and rebuild my house,'
says Mr Golz.
Over 1,400 Berliners who once lived on the site of the Berlin Wall want to
do the same, or else seek compensation. But Mr Gerhard Schiele, a Free
Democrat and member of Berlin's chamber of deputies, says the chances are
slim.
'Mr Theo Waigel (the finance minister) does not want to give the claimants
any compensation because it would cost too much money. And the justice
ministry, which used to be under Mr Klaus Kinkel (now the foreign minister),
and who helped draw up the unification treaty, is afraid that if the law is
amended it will create a precedent for other property claims. These are the
real reasons for the government holding onto their property, which by the
way, is very valuable.'
The dispute has not only pitted east Berliners against the German
government. It has caused a rift between the Berlin Senate and Bonn. 'The
Senate has repeatedly demanded a change in the law,' says Mr Klaus Kilian,
an official from the Senate's justice department. 'The Bundesrat (Upper
House) last June suggested some degree of restitution or compensation, but
the Bundestag (Lower House) will never agree. If it were allowed, it could
set a precedent for other claimants. These could include those whose land
was expropriated by the Soviet administration in eastern Germany between
1945 and 1949.'
Mr Kilian says the dispute is also delaying investment and planning in
Berlin. 'We cannot develop large sections of the former wall until this
matter is settled,' he says. 'Investors are very wary.'
In the meantime, former property owners along the Berlin Wall are determined
to continue their struggle. 'This is about justice,' says Ms Inge Bergk, a
veteran campaigner whose parents had lived on Bernauer Street. 'If East
Germany no longer exists, then the old law which placed all Berlin Wall
property under the communist defence ministry no longer exists as well. This
is our property and we want it back.'

MONDAY 15
Japan's war memories
Emperor Akihito and Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minister (left), attend
a service in Tokyo marking the 49th anniversary of the end of the Second
World War. Some 10 members of the Murayama cabinet may attend a more
controversial ceremony at the capital's Yasukuni Shrine to pay homage to
Japan's war dead - those buried there include war criminals. Last year, only
five members of the government of Morihiro Hosokawa visited the shrine.
Germany's economics minister, Gunter Rexrodt, is expected to present a
positive analysis of the German economy. With two months before the federal
elections, the governing coalition, now running nearly 8 points ahead of the
opposition Social democrats and Greens in opinion polls, is keen to use
encouraging economic indicators to help maintain its lead.
Pipeline talks open
Leaders from Russia, Turkey, Iran, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan meet in
Ashgabat to discuss the construction of a new gas pipeline to Europe. The
existing pipeline does not have enough capacity to meet the export ambitions
of Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, the main energy producers in the
former Soviet Union. Disputes between Russia and the two southern republics
about access to the pipeline have worried western investors.
Trial in Albania: Five members of Omonia, an ethnic Greek political
organisation in Albania, go on trial in the capital Tirana on charges of
treason and espionage. Greece has threatened to veto European Union
financial aid to Albania, claiming human rights abuses against the Greek
minority.
Holidays: Austria, Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, France, parts
of Germany, Greece, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Malta, Panama, Poland, Portugal,
Slovenia, Spain, Venezuela (Assumption).
Argentina, Costa Rica, India (Independence Day), Italy (Summer Bank
Holiday), Paraguay, S Korea (Independence Day).
TUESDAY 16
US rates poised to rise
The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy for the
Federal Reserve, is to meet in Washington. Most economists predict the Fed
will decide to raise short term interest rates to head off what it sees as
signs of incipient inflation.
Swedish inflation: The reasons for Sweden's surprise decision to lift
interest rates last week may become clearer today when the country's July
consumer price index is published.
The index, which rose from 1.8 per cent to 2.6 per cent between March and
June, is expected to have continued its upward trend. The median expectation
for July is 2.9 per cent.
Nigeria's high court in Abuja is to decide whether it can try Moshood
Abiola, the banned winner of last year's annulled presidential election, for
treason.
No decision about a prospective general strike by the Nigeria Labour
Congress will be taken before the hearing, except in Lagos where opposition
to the military government is strongest.
Oil workers' unions, however, say that they will stay on strike until the
military hand over power to civilians.
Sri Lanka holds a general election. It appears likely that the ruling United
National party, which has governed the country for 17 years, will lose to
the left-leaning People's Alliance, an eight-party coalition.
UK economy: The CBI distributive trades survey will be scanned for early
indications of an upturn in official figures for July retail sales, due on
Thursday.
Volume sales were unchanged between April and May, and up only 0.2 per cent
in June.
However, recent consumer credit data and a strong CBI survey last month
suggest that Britain's canny consumers were keen bargain-hunters in the
summer sales.
Ballet russe
An international ballet competition devised in honour of the Russian
ballerina Maya Plissetskaya begins in St Petersburg (to August 22).
Oz prey: The memoirs of Bob Hawke, the former Australian prime minister, are
due to published.
Mr Hawke quit in late-1991 after a bitter leadership struggle with Paul
Keating, the current PM, and the book is expected to provide insights into
the Labor Party conflicts of that time.
WEDNESDAY 17
Palestine progresses
Shimon Peres, (left) Israel's foreign minister, will meet Nabil Shaath,
senior Palestinian negotiator, in Cairo. They hope to speed implementation
of the extension of Palestinian self-rule across the West Bank. The two
sides will also begin discussions on the holding of national Palestinian
elections due in mid-December.
An agreement is near to transfer power in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
from Israeli to Palestinian hands in five areas: education, health, direct
taxation, tourism, and social welfare.
Differences have emerged, however, about Jerusalem, the release of
Palestinian prisoners, and the timing of elections.
Global population: The United Nations Population Fund, based in New York,
publishes the 1994 report on the State of the World's Population. The
65-page report describes sharp falls in developing country birth rates
during the past two decades, and advocates wider distribution of
contraceptives and better education for women in developing countries. It is
published only a month before the opening of the UN's conference on
population in Cairo. The Vatican has censured the US government's support
for contraception and its tolerance of homosexuality.
Musicians invade
Lucerne's International Music Festival begins, with two concerts a day for
more than three weeks (to Sep 10).
UK economy: Hopes are high that retail price inflation stayed subdued in
July. Summer sales began later this year than last, which may offset adverse
effects of less aggressive discounting. Economists are looking for a 0.2 per
cent drop in the RPI between June and July, with the year-on-year rate
unchanged at 2.6 per cent. The underlying rate, which excludes mortgage
interest payments, may nudge higher from 2.4 per cent to 2.5 per cent, the
middle of the government's target range.
Holidays: Indonesia (Independence Day).
THURSDAY 18
Mandela to outline policy
South Africa's president Nelson Mandela addresses parliament on his 100th
day in office. He is expected to flesh out the so-called Reconstruction and
Development Programme, his government's plan for social investment in areas
such as housing, electrification, education and health. The speech is an
important public relations effort aimed at meeting the demands of blacks for
government action on poverty.
Israel and Jordan wind up their first substantive bilateral talks on trade,
borders, water, tourism, finance and banking on the Israeli side of the Dead
Sea. They are expected to announce progress on demarcation of the disputed
border, sharing the waters of the Jordan and Yarmouk rivers, co-operation
and joint marketing in tourism, steps to link the two countries' electricity
grids, and transit of Jordanian goods through Israel's Mediterranean ports.
'A Level' results: Anxious UK parents and their teenage children will be put
out of their misery with the release of examination results that are vital
for university entrance.
Cricket: England meet South Africa for the third test at the Oval, London,
(to August 22).
Commonwealth Games begin in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada (to August
28).
Holidays: Bahrain, Lebanon.
FRIDAY 19
Swedish poll manifesto out
Sweden's opposition Social Democrats, hot favourites to win next month's
general election, present their manifesto with all eyes trained on their
economic policies.
With the fragile state of the economy dominating the campaign, the party is
under pressure to detail how it will deal with the big budget deficit,
fast-growing public debt, and rising interest rates.
So far, markets have been less than enthusiastic about the Social Democratic
emphasis on tax increases and unwillingness to be drawn on the need for deep
cuts in the welfare state.
UK economy: The forecast deterioration in the trade balance with non-EU
countries to a deficit of Pounds 600m in July, from Pounds 495m in June,
should cause little concern.
UK export volumes are rising, giving economists fewer worries about the 1994
current account outlook than three months ago.
US president Bill Clinton turns 48, but he may not have much to celebrate
unless Congress reverses its recent setback to the crime bill or acts to
advance healthcare reform. Even his planned holiday on Martha's Vineyard in
the run-up to the Labor Day holiday on September 5 threatens to be fraught
with Washington-related distractions.
Holidays: Abu Dhabi, Afghanistan (Independence Day), Kuwait, Morocco,
Tunisia.
WEEKEND 20-21
Mexican elections
Mexico goes to the polls on Sunday to elect a new president and Congress. Mr
Ernesto Zedillo of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party is strong
favourite to win the presidential race, while his party is expected to
maintain its control over Congress. The opposition and about 15,000 national
and several international observers will be watching for fraud.
Alpbach forum: Nine heads of state and the European Union Commission
president, Jacques Delors, will hold an informal meeting on Sunday within
the framework of the annual Alpbach forum in the Austrian Alps (to August
22). Topics will include questions of new neighbourly relations, security
problems and cultural ties in the light of the forthcoming enlargement of
the EU.
Chess: The Lloyds Bank's annual tournament starts at the Cumberland Hotel,
London (until 29 August). With more than 30 grandmasters competing, it is
Britain's strongest-ever open-to-all chess event. Winners qualify for the
Pounds 100,000 Intel Grand Prix and a chance to compete against Gary
Kasparov and Nigel Short.
Three Choirs Festival: Britain's oldest musical festival, going back to the
early 18th century, begins at Hereford on Sunday.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news

<TEXT>
Monday: US capacity utilisation figures could fuel speculation about higher
rates if, as economists expect, there is only a marginal drop between June
and July.
Wednesday: June average earnings and unit labour cost data form key points
of interest in the UK's mid-month 'super Wednesday' for economic releases.
Consensus forecasts from MMS International point to unchanged wage inflation
and a slight easing in the annual rate of unit wage cost inflation. July's
unemployment figures are expected to show a further fall of about 18,000
last month.
Thursday: The Bundesbank council meets for the first time after its summer
break. Few analysts expect a change in official interest rates.
Although UK markets are prepared for a rate rise later this year, the
expected rise in retail sales in July should not trigger action, provided
the picture is one of subdued inflation encouraging spending.
Analysts are not expecting any shocks from UK broad money and bank and
building society lending figures, which are forecast to show a modest
slowdown in growth in July compared with June.

With investors returning from their holidays around mid-week, brokers are
expected to start active stock promotion campaigns, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
'With trading volumes depressed for the past few months, the salesmen want
to pick things up before the September book closing to boost profits,' says
Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities.
The 21,000 level is likely to continue to be a technical resistance point.
However, brokers say that many banks and financial institutions are already
in their last stages of realising profits on their stock portfolios ahead of
September 30, and expect profit-taking to be light.

The Hong Kong stock market was bracing itself last week for a dose of bad
news from today's release of interim results at HSBC Holdings, the biggest
constituent stock in the benchmark Hang Seng Index. HSBC itself fell 4.4 per
cent over the full week , writes Louise Lucas in Hong Kong.
Analysts are looking at pre-tax profit rises of anywhere between 10 per cent
and 20 per cent for the banking group, but there are fears that even the
lowest projections may not be met following the lower than expected earnings
reported by Standard Asia's Hong Kong operations last Wednesday.

SBC joins the run of Swiss banking results tomorrow with analysts wondering
what to expect, after the 68 per cent drop in trading income at its
competitor, UBS. Forecasts last week ranged from SFr545m to SFr950m,
compared with SFr1.55bn for the first half of 1993.
The following day brings interims from CS Holding. Its principal operating
subsidiary, Credit Suisse, has already reported a 27 per cent decline in
gross profits before tax and provisions, notes Hoare Govett, which thinks
that a net profit of SFr700m for the group, against SFr882m previously,
would be a reasonable result.

Initial dealings in Telecom Italia are expected to begin on Thursday. This
is the successor company to Sip, Italcable, Telespazio, Iritel and SIRM, in
the final phase of the restructuring of the Italian telecoms sector. Sip
shareholders get a one-for-one share exchange, but Mr Evan Miller at Lehman
Brothers says the creation of Telecom Italia will immediately enhance
earnings per share prospects.
Telecom Italia will be the world's sixth largest telecommunications company,
with a turnover of L27,000bn and net profit of L1,025bn in 1993.

Shuddering after its own rate rises, Sweden should field half-year reports
from Electrolux tomorrow, and Ericsson on Thursday. UBS reckons that, for
the latter, analysts will focus on news of the order book.
For Electrolux, Unibors Securities says the group's two main US competitors
in the white goods manufacturing sector, Whirlpool and Maytag, have
respectively reported earnings up by 50 per cent, and operating profits up
by 300 per cent for the first half of 1994. Unibors is looking for a 40 per
cent growth in operating profit at Electrolux, and earnings to outpace this
over the full year due to greater production efficiency.

Market professionals have been looking forward eagerly to the second-quarter
reports from the 'big three' chemical groups, with BASF kicking off on
Thursday, and Bayer and Hoechst due next week. A Goldman Sachs report on the
sector notes that BASF's first-quarter pre-tax profit was 47 per cent ahead
of the year-earlier period, helped by 4 per cent volume growth. The
evidence, it says, is that recovery momentum in the industry gathered pace
in the second quarter.
On the same day, the Bundesbank holds its regular fortnightly meeting. For
most of last week, German and other banks were divided on the prospects for
a further interest rate cut. After Thursday's rate rises in Sweden, and
Italy, the question was whether other European countries would follow this
lead; but Merrill Lynch said that the next German interest rate rise could
be more than a year away.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Differing views on market influences -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The debate over the market influences of rising corporate earnings and
dividends as against the probability of higher interest rates has now moved
into closer focus. While the factors behind the moves last week to raise
rates in Italy and Sweden may have been largely domestic, there was no
gainsaying the warning delivered to the UK market.
Even after allowing for the widespread predictions of base rate rises
already circulating among London market analysts, there has been a rush to
reassess the situation. But, once the shock of the Swedish and Italian moves
had passed, opinions on the UK market outlook were by no means as black as
might have been expected.
The widely held perception that the UK market is particularly vulnerable
because the UK is at the head of the queue for a rate increase may not be
correct, according to Mr Albert Edwards at Kleinwort Benson Securities. He
comments that the latest survey of rate forecasts suggests that the threat
of higher rates will be much more of a shock to continental European markets
than to London.
It has been suggested that UK equities may suffer less than mainland
European shares, because of the relative ratings of the various equity
markets. UK markets have already enjoyed a year of rapid earnings growth,
while continental European markets are still at a much earlier stage of
recovery.
SG Warburg touches the same point but stresses that growth in continental
Europe is now accelerating and that this has brought 'significant upward
revisions' in gross domestic product forecasts for Germany and France.
For UK stocks, this throws even greater emphasis on those shares offering
exposure to European growth, a sector picked out earlier this year by BZW.
Some of these, especially the UK construction groups with interests in
Germany, have already moved strongly against the trends of the UK market.
However, their performance has in part reflected optimism for one last
easing in Bundesbank rates, and last week's interest rate developments may
restrain them for a while.
Of the European-influenced builders, Redland, with 65 per cent of operating
profits taken from mainland Europe, outperformed the market by 7.8 per cent
over the past three months but its lead all but vanished last month. RMC, 68
per cent influenced by continent Europe, has followed a similar pattern but
retains a 16.9 per cent outperformance over the 12 months.
Top of Warburg's list is Waste Management International, with 75 per cent of
operating profits from continental Europe. On this basis, the share has been
overlooked, lagging the market by 6.7 per cent over one month and 6.2 per
cent over 12 months.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Wall St braced for another tightening - New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<TEXT>
All eyes this week will be on the Federal Reserve as Wall Street braces
itself for another possible increase in interest rates.
Ever since the Fed first raised interest rates in early February, the market
has suffered attacks of nerves before each meeting of the central bank's
policy-making open market committee (FOMC).
Tomorrow, the FOMC meets to decide whether there is a need for a further
tightening of monetary policy to slow the economy and restrain inflation.
Wall Street's nerves will be on edge once again, primarily because interest
rates have been increased four times this year, and few believe that more
increases are not around the corner.
The stock market, now firmly entrenched in the midsummer doldrums, will be
waiting with baited breath for the FOMC's pronouncements.
Judging by the most recent economic data, the majority of analysts believe
the FOMC will signal an increase in interest rates this week.
If there is a broad consensus on Wall Street about the likelihood of a rate
increase, there is still considerable debate over which interest rate it
will put up, and by how much.
Some analysts, believing that the Fed remains cautious about stepping too
hard on the brakes, predict that the FOMC will tighten policy by raising its
target for the Federal funds rate by just 25 basis points, which would take
it to 4.5 per cent.
Others, however, feel differently. In light of recent comments by the Fed's
chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, the pessimists say the central bank is
increasingly concerned about the outlook for inflation, and predict that it
will not only raise the Fed funds target by 50 basis points, to 4.75 per
cent, but will also raise the discount rate, from 3.5 per cent to 4 per
cent.
The size and nature of any tightening is critical because it will determine
whether the financial markets, and the stock market in particular, will be
able to ride out a rate increase without incurring losses.
Because expectations of a rate increase have been building up on Wall Street
for weeks, a 25 basis point upward move in the Fed funds rate is already
priced into bonds and stocks. So, if the Fed does nudge rates higher, stock
and bond prices should hold their ground.
A 50 basis point increase, however, could unsettle shares, which have
slavishly followed the lead set by bond prices for the past few months. If
an unexpectedly large rate increase inflicts enough damage to investor
sentiment, the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which has climbed erratically
from around 3,650 in early July to over 3,770 - faces the prospect of
slipping back below the 3,700 level.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Paris fine-tunes timing for Renault
privatisation - International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As preparations for the privatisation of Renault gather momentum, share
analysts and investors are running their slide rules over the French
state-owned motor vehicle group.
For the most part, they like what they find. 'It is an attractive company,'
says Mr Eric Michelis, motor vehicles analyst at Kleinwort Benson in Paris.
He predicts strong interest in shares in the only significant public sector
vehicle group in the western world.
Before interest can be turned into equity, however, there remain a number of
important questions. Most obvious is the timing of any operation. The
political sensitivity involved in the sale of Renault, a symbol of state
ownership and an erstwhile union stronghold, means that the French
government is approaching the planned privatisation with great caution.
While officials at the economics ministry acknowledge that the preparations
are now in place for a privatisation this autumn, they say that no decision
has yet been taken, and point out that Assurances Generales de France, the
insurance group, is also prepared for sale.
A second uncertainty concerns the scale of the operation. The centre-right
government has given little indication concerning how much of its 80 per
cent stake it is seeking to sell, except to say that it will not reduce its
holding below a 34 per cent minority blocking stake.
The retention of a substantial stake by the French government is not
welcomed by some potential investors. 'Ideally, it is better for the
investment community if we see a total privatisation,' says one US fund
manager. He says that a complete sale of the state's holding would ease
concerns that the government might still seek to influence decisions at the
company, concerning, for example, the protection of jobs and industrial
alliances.
For most investors, however, the continued presence of the French government
on the shareholder register does little to dampen the attraction of
Renault's privatisation. This is partly because of the fundamental strengths
of the group, and also because of the present stage in the industry cycle.
In terms of financial results, the company has staged a remarkable turnround
since the mid-1980s, when a series of heavy losses earned it a reputation as
the sick man of the European industry. It was one of the few vehicle
manufacturers to remain profitable during the recession in the sector over
the past few years, and is expected to report a sharp increase this year on
the net profits of FFr1.1bn (Dollars 206m) achieved in 1993.
As a study by Lehman Brothers argues, the emerging recovery in the market
also makes a Renault sale an attractive proposition this year. This, and
Renault's relative diversification - unlike Volkswagen and Peugeot, it also
builds trucks - prompts Lehmans to value the company at between FFr55bn and
FFr60bn, above many earlier estimates.
The ultimate valuation decided by the French government, and hence the price
per share attached to the company, will clearly determine the attractiveness
of the investment. But the sensitivity of the sale, and the French
government's interest in gaining momentum for its programme to sell 21
state-owned groups, suggest an attractive price is likely.
'With the presidential elections looming and with harder privatisations to
come, this has to be a success,' says one analyst at a Paris-based merchant
bank. 'They won't be taking any chances with the pricing.'
As in some of the previous privatisation issues, however, the frustration
for foreign investors may be the limited tranche of shares for which they
may apply.

FT  15 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Australian sector braced for rate rise -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian government bond market is braced for a rise in interest rates
 -but then, it has been for the last four months, at least. However,
analysts argue that economic forces are now overwhelming any political
pressure to delay raising rates.
So far, the Australian authorities have been able to fend off pressure to
raise rates because the Australian economy has been relatively slow to pull
out of recession.
'The Reserve Bank of Australia has made it clear that it agrees with the
need to increase interest rates,' said Mr Michael Gallagher, director of
research at IDEA, the market analysis specialist, 'but has been concerned
about relatively modest growth in business investment.' In addition, high
unemployment and a depressed property market have helped fend off rate
increases.
However, economic growth has now accelerated: in fact, at an estimated 4.5
per cent in 1994, it has overtaken the US.
The latest employment data showed a jump of 90,000 jobs in July, compared
with an average increase of 17,000 a month over the last six months, and a
drop in the unemployment rate to 9 1/2 per cent from 10 per cent.
'We expect a 50 basis point rate hike towards the end of September,' says Mr
Paul Donovan, bond analyst at UBS. 'The Reserve Bank is not independent, and
politically there have been mixed pressures. It will probably come in
reaction to a US hike.'
Because the Australian dollar is closely tied to the US dollar, the
Australian bond market tends to track the US treasuries market. However,
despite a series of interest rate rises by the US authorities, the
Australian government bond market has substantially underperformed the US
market.
The yield differential between the two markets has widened from 80 basis
points at the beginning of April to its current level of more than 200 basis
points.
The Australian market has already discounted a series of rate increases.
Overnight cash rates, set by the authorities, are currently 4 3/4 per cent
while six-month bill rates have risen to 6.2 per cent.
So why is the market so bearish? The answer appears to be that inflationary
fears have taken hold, and the country's poor record on inflation has
undermined confidence in the bond market.
Certainly, with inflation at 1.7 per cent and 10-year bond yields at 9.5 per
cent, the market appears to offer attractively high real yields  - among the
highest of the developed markets.
Only Sweden and Canada offer higher real yields, but they both have high
debt to GDP ratios of more than 67 per cent, compared with only 33 per cent
for Australia, according to data compiled by Swiss Bank Corporation.
The high real yields for long-dated bonds in Australia suggest that the
market is expecting inflation to rise sharply.
Indeed, factors such as the recovery in the housing market and increases in
raw material prices could soon boost inflation, according to some analysts,
while the strength of the Australian dollar, supported by strong commodity
prices, could fuel imports.
However, according to analysts at SBC, wages remain the key to inflation and
'there are few signs of any significant inflation pressures in the economy.
The main concern is the legitimacy of the productivity offsets agreed
between unions and businesses to support wage increases (which are)
generally well above underlying inflation.'
For bond investors, most analysts continue to advise caution, in spite of
attractive real yields relative to other markets.
'Australia looks like a bear market and that is not going to change, but
there is some room to outperform other markets,' says Mr Donovan. 'A rate
hike could be supportive.'
Australian bonds are largely held by domestic investors, but because of the
relatively small size of the market, marginal foreign interest can have a
strong impact on prices.
One potential source of funds is Japan, where the weakened yen has led
Japanese investors to look again at the dollar bloc.
However, with the Australian market virtually insisting on a rate rise and
10-year bond yields apparently heading towards double-digit levels, most
investors are likely to hold off a while longer.
One danger is that they will instead choose the New Zealand market, which
has performed well until recent political worries.
According to some analysts, international investors may favour New Zealand
because of its highly independent central bank and the fact that it is an
improving credit, even though 10-year yields, at 8.33 per cent, are
substantially lower than in Australia.
The outlook for the New Zealand market largely depends on whether the
political situation stabilises after the weekend's Selwyn by-election.

The gilts market is facing this week in far better fettle than many analysts
thought possible in the aftermath of last Thursday's Italian and Swedish
interest rate rises.
A comparatively robust performance last Friday brought out buyers and there
is a general belief that this week's crop of economic figures should sound
no serious inflationary alarms. The market is more optimistic in spite of a
rise in 10-year benchmark bonds yields to 8.64 per cent late on Friday from
8.4 per cent the week before.
Mr Nigel Richardson, of Yamaichi International in London, expects the week
to be split into two.
The first half will be overshadowed by fears of higher US rates from
tomorrow's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.
Domestic issues will then take over, with Wednesday's retail price and
average earnings data and Thursday's retail sales figures expected to
provide further evidence of steady growth with low inflation.
Mr Simon Briscoe of S. G. Warburg believes the market could be thinking
about funding questions by the end of the week. He predicts a positive
reaction if the Bank of England decides against an August gilts auction, as
this would suggest the public sector borrowing requirement poses few
problems.

FT  15 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Turning point in Europe's monetary cycle
 -Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bond markets usually err on the side of pessimism, but they were not
prepared for what hit them last week: the start of the monetary tightening
cycle in Europe.
Just when it seemed that the worst had been discounted, Italy and Sweden
raised their short-term rates, fuelling fears that interest rates elsewhere
in Europe would soon start rising amid stronger than expected economic
growth.
For the last seven months, bond investors have taken an almost unremitting
pummeling: first by aggressive profit-taking after last year's sharp rally,
then by earlier than expected US monetary tightening, and now by the spectre
of rising European interest rates.
'We feel that these two rate rises, even though they reflect unique domestic
circumstances, represent the turning point in the European interest rate
cycle,' says Mr Kit Juckes, international economist at S. G. Warburg
Securities. 'Against this backdrop, bond market sentiment is likely to
deteriorate further and convergence is off the agenda for now.'
The markets' reaction to the interest rate rises 'suggests a continued
bloody environment for bond investors worldwide', agrees Mr Edmond Warner,
head of strategy and economics at Kleinwort Benson. 'This is unlikely to
clear up overnight.'
By Friday, the yield on the German 10-year benchmark bond had jumped to 7.20
per cent, from 6.75 per cent a week earlier.
In the UK, which is further ahead in the economic cycle and tipped as one of
the next tightening candidates, the 10-year yield rose to 8.60 per cent from
8.35 per cent.
Sweden's 10-year yield rose a whole percentage point from the previous week
to 11.57 per cent on Friday, while Italy's 10-year yield rose to 11.70 per
cent, from 10.80 per cent.
All eyes are now on the Bundesbank, which until recently had been widely
expected to cut its 4.5 per cent discount rate at least once more. Even
before the Italian and Swedish rate moves, however, strong economic data had
prompted a reassessment of German easing prospects.
With July M3 money supply growth still in double digits and inflation little
changed, many feel the Bundesbank lacks justification for a rate cut when it
returns from its summer break.
Later into the autumn, the October federal elections may further cramp the
room for manoeuvre for a central bank keen on preserving its reputation of
political independence.
'We would not rule out a technical  1/4 -point discount rate cut but to all
intents and purposes, money rates in Germany have reached the bottom,' says
Mr Juckes. Even if key rates were lowered again, that would do little to
boost markets, which will regard them as the last cuts in the cycle and will
start anticipating the inevitable rise in rates.
In this environment, bond investors will have to continue negotiating highly
volatile markets, where bearish sentiment may occasionally be interrupted by
violent bear squeezes.
Heavy issuance is also likely to weigh on sentiment. Germany, one of the
laggards on the funding front, still has some DM110bn of net public-sector
borrowing outstanding. This week alone will see new two- and five-year
supply in France, a sale of five-year notes in Germany and bond auctions in
Italy and Sweden.
In this context, some say it is best to lie low. 'In this environment you
have to be reactive - don't try to second-guess the market,' advises Mr Bob
Tyley, senior strategist at Paribas Capital Markets. 'Investors should let
the market calm down and then decide what offers value.'
Until then, some may wish to keep some of their funds in cash until the
outlook clears; indeed, investors whose priority has become capital
preservation have been building up cash holdings in recent months.
Many bond managers certainly appear to be playing safe. 'We're keeping very
cautious in this environment and are pursuing a defensive strategy,' says Mr
Heinz Fesser, head of fixed income at DWS, Deutsche Bank's investment
subsidiary.
This involves 'being partly hedged in our foreign currency exposure, holding
no extremely long-dated bonds and keeping a substantial percentage of our
funds in cash.' DWS has been building up its cash holdings in recent months,
he adds.
While the peripheral, high-yielding bond markets are likely to remain
volatile, many feel that German government bonds, traditionally a safe haven
in times of market turmoil, offer relative stability.
'Bunds are the best of a bad bunch,' says Warburg's Mr Juckes. While he says
10-year yields may spike close to 7.5 per cent, he expects other markets'
yield spreads over Germany to widen out even further, making Germany a safe
bet at least in relative terms.
An even better strategy, he suggests, may be to get out of Europe altogether
and head for the dollar bloc. 'The advantage of the dollar bloc is that
they're further through the rate rise cycle and have discounted much more.'

Uncertainty in European bond markets and profit-taking by domestic
institutions ahead of the September book closing are expected to weigh on
Japanese government bonds this week.
The higher yen supported bond prices last week on hopes of dampening
prospects of an economic recovery, but such expectations were dashed by
government comments that the economy was gradually pulling out of a slump.
Overall activity may be subdued as many investors are on their Obon holidays
until mid-week. But traders say more banks are shifting their Japanese
government bond portfolios into euroyen straight bond issues.
The moves come as the year's fall in government bond prices has left many
financial institutions with unrealised losses. A Tokyo Stock Exchange
disclosure rule requires listed companies to release unrealised losses on
listed securities portfolios if the figure is equal to or more than 30 per
cent of pre-tax or net profits.
Institutions reluctant to reveal their loss-making positions are switching
into unlisted euroyen straight bonds from government bonds. 'There is a big
switch going on as the supply and demand situation for various classes of
bonds are changing,' says Mr Marshall Gittler, bond analyst at Merrill Lynch
in Tokyo. He says the trend is raising yields in government bonds.

The Swedish Riksbank's justification of its surprise rates rise with a claim
that it had spotted four inflationary factors prompted a swift review in
Germany. A weakening currency, cited by the Swedes, is not a problem in the
federal republic.
Nor is the speedy global recovery causing concern. Dearer imports have
slowed the fall in German consumer prices, but other factors, such as
shrunken disposable incomes, are keeping inflation under control.
On the other hand, the Riksbank's identification of rising capacity
utilisation in industry rang some bells. As Mr Adolf Rosenstock, economist
at the Industrial Bank of Japan in Frankfurt, noted, this indicator is may
soon over-step its long-term average of 83 per cent.
With this and the turnround in unemployment in mind, he says the Bundesbank
will have to stay on guard. The IG Metall engineering union has already
started making ominous noises about the need for a clear improvement in real
pay.
While Mr Rosenstock marked last Thursday in his diary as the day Europe's
latest spell of monetary easing came to an end, there were still voices
suggesting the Bundesbank has further to go.
Optimists believe the central council will signal its attitude with a return
to variable rate repos at its first post-holiday meeting this Thursday.

Encouraging statistics showing that the consumer price index rose by only
0.3 per cent last month eased inflationary fears in the US at the end of
last week, giving bonds an unexpected shot in the arm.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond shot up by nearly  3/4 points, sending
the yield down from 7.65 per cent to 7.49 per cent.
Nevertheless, the market remains convinced that an increase in interest
rates is almost inevitable when the Federal Open Market Committee meets
tomorrow.
The reason is that, whatever the consumer price index may say, other
economic data continue to point to inflationary pressures further back in
the supply chain.
Many analysts believe that the Federal Reserve will feel compelled to choke
these pressures off before they feed through into rising prices.
How big the increase will be is another matter. Some analysts seem to think
that 25 basis points will be enough: but paradoxically, a 50 basis point
rise might prove better for bonds, at least at the long end of the market.
Normally, higher interest rates cause bond prices to fall, but in this
instance anything less than a 50 basis point increase might be seen as
insufficient to ensure that inflation had been stifled, posing the threat of
even higher interest rates to come.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Election clouds Mexican market - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a year remarkably short of good news, investors in Mexico's stock market
expect a change of luck next Sunday. They are betting heavily that Mr
Ernesto Zedillo of the governing party will win the presidential election,
and his triumph will be widely recognised as legitimate.
Since July 20 the main index has surged by 19.3 per cent, with investors
picking up stocks whose values had been depressed by pre-electoral nerves.
The market has now recovered all of its peso losses of the year, although it
is still down in dollar terms.
The gains have been so impressive that some reckon that a Zedillo victory
has now been fully discounted and that if it occurs investors will take
profits.
'After the build-up to the election, there could be a vacuum after a Zedillo
victory,' warns Mr Robert J Pelosky of Morgan Stanley in New York.
Before committing more money to the market, investors may wait to see how
the post-electoral situation evolves. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the
left-wing Party of Democratic Revolution has promised massive civil protests
if there is electoral fraud, and with a devoted following of about 2m
supporters, some fear he is a threat to political stability.
'There is a final hurdle - will the election be credible and accepted?' says
Mr Jorge Mariscal of Goldman Sachs. 'If that is cleared then there is a
basis for very strong capital inflows.'
Such inflows, if they materialise, should help reduce domestic interest
rates, perhaps to as low as 11 to 12 per cent by the end of the year.
Short-term interest rates fell last week to 15.15 per cent from 17.66 per
cent on July 20.
A further cloud over the market is the possibility of a rise in US interest
rates or long-term bond yields. The increase in US interest rates earlier
this year contributed to the sharp fall in the local equity market. If
international investors turned against emerging markets again, Mexico would
likely be the first to suffer.
Higher US interest rates could lead to speculation against the peso,
depending on the post-electoral situation. In spite of low economic growth,
Mexico is expected to run a current account deficit of about 7 per cent of
GDP this year.
Some economists believe that the government may decide in the post-electoral
period to accelerate the maximum rate of devaluation of the peso against the
dollar, from the current 5 per cent a year to as much as 10 per cent, in an
effort to make the peso more competitive over the long-term.
The recent increases in the market have not been all election-based. Second
quarter results turned out to be better than many expected. Baring
Securities calculates that operating profits of the 42 companies it tracks
grew by an average of 16 per cent in the second quarter against 12 per cent
in the first quarter. Real sales were up by 8 per cent in the second quarter
against 6 per cent in the first quarter.
The good second quarter numbers and growth of 3.1 per cent in industrial
production in May have been taken as evidence that the long-awaited economic
recovery is proving stronger than expected. Mexico's economy grew by just
0.5 per cent in the first quarter. But encouraged by the new figures for
industrial production, Mr Pedro Aspe, Mexico's finance minister, reckons the
economy will grow between 2 and 3 per cent this year.
While the good economic figures have been helpful, the election has been
uppermost in investor minds. In the view of many, Mr Zedillo offers the best
chance of political stability and a continuation of the pro-market economic
policies that have characterised the presidency of Mr Carlos Salinas. Many
fear that a victory by the opposition would bring a new and untried team to
government, which would find it difficult to govern a country that has been
accustomed to one-party rule for 65 years.
Mr Roberto Hernandez, the head of Banamex, Mexico's largest bank, caught the
prevailing mood when he recently said that Mr Zedillo was the only candidate
who could assure stability and bring interest rates down.
Lower interest rates are expected to benefit above all Mexico's banks, which
have been saddled with many non-performing loans as small and medium-sized
companies have been unable to meet growing debt-service payments.
The three largest banks are trading at an average of 10.3 times 1995
expected earnings compared to a market multiple of 13.3, according to Baring
Securities, with some analysts believing this discount will narrow as rates
come down and loan-growth picks up.
Infrastructure and construction stocks are tipped by others as likely
winners under a Zedillo presidency. These sectors have grown faster than the
economy this year, partly because of increased government investment, but
should benefit from lower interest rates. Mr Zedillo has promised a 25 per
cent increase in infrastructure spending if elected, which should give them
an additional boost.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Markets on interest rate alert -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Markets will be on an interest rate alert after a sharp wake-up call last
week from the Swedish and Italian central banks.
The combination of the Bundesbank council meeting again on Thursday, after a
four week recess, the FOMC meeting tomorrow, and nervousness in European
markets, makes for a potentially busy week.
The balance of opinion in the market favours a tightening of policy from the
Fed, while rate moves from the Bundesbank are also not ruled out, nor from
other European countries following the Italian and Swedish examples.
After a protracted spell of quiet, range-bound summer trading, Thursday and
Friday last week were two of the busiest trading days for some time. Traders
are expecting a continuation of more active trading conditions this week,
though trade may be more muted today with most European markets closed for
the Assumption Day holiday.
The initial focus will be on the lira and Swedish krona, both of which were
under speculative pressure last week as the market gave the thumbs-down to
higher rates. Most other currencies were also wilting under the weight of
the resurgent D-Mark - the beneficiary both of a flight to safety among
concerned investors, and an economic recovery whose vigour continues to
surprise investors.
While analysts agree that raising rates in order to defend the currency is
likely to be folly, they also stress that a repeat of 1992-93 ERM tensions
is unlikely. Then the markets judged that governments lacked the will to
impose high interest rates on economies mired in recession.
Now that economic growth has re-appeared, raising rates is less problematic.
The wider ERM bands also makes currencies less vulnerable to speculative
attack.
While many analysts still expect the Bundesbank to lower interest rates once
more, it may choose to wait until it has seen the latest M3 figures, which
are due for release at the end of the week.
In favour of an early move, however, is that the Bundesbank will probably
not want to adjust rates in the month preceding the federal elections in
October. The firmness of the D-Mark also strengthens the central bank's
hand.
The odds of the Fed lifting interest rates would seem to be better. But with
the D-Mark strong and President Clinton's political stature again in the
spotlight, the risks for the dollar are probably on the downside, despite
firmer rates.

Johannesburg's stock exchange announced moves to deregulate the market last
week. The measures include a timetable for removing those barriers which
have prevented banks and foreign companies from owning local brokers.
The JSE, which ranks as the 11th largest stock market in the world as
measured by market capitalisation, will be restructured to 'meet the needs
of the new South Africa', said Mr Roy Anderson, the president of the
exchange.
Banks and foreign companies will be able to take a 30 per cent stake in
local brokers as soon as legislative amendments have been passed by
parliament, with full ownership to be permitted 12 months later.
The South African Council of Banks has said that it will continue
investigations into prospects for a rival stock exchange, although it was
open to further talks with the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.

Bombay's stock exchange closed at an all-time closing high on Friday, and
many analysts expect the rally to continue this week. The market was
encouraged by an extension of the settlement period, the recent spate of
positive company results and the good monsoon rains.
Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets in London commented that fundamentals
continued to look good, helped by lower reported inflation, even though the
figure remained over 10 per cent - 'The government has announced further
increases in foreign exchange reserves and the finance minister has
announced plans to make the rupee fully convertible on the current account
by September'.

FT  15 AUG 94 / The Markets: Productivity and pay - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor of the exchequer does it; industrial leaders do it; even
striking signalmen do it. What do they do? They all argue that people should
be rewarded for increased productivity. Can they all be wrong? Yes, they
can.
Under Kenneth Clarke's pay policy for the public sector, pay can rise only
if financed by higher productivity. Now the British travelling public finds
itself deeply inconvenienced by arguments over what this means, with the
signalmen insisting that they are owed money for having accepted new
technology and working practices.
This consensus that pay should be linked to productivity is not a harmless
cliche. It is a damaging mistake.
Suppose an employer invests in a powerful new machine. Why should he pay
more merely because output per worker has risen? If he were to summon the
courage to lay off his redundant workers, why should he have to increase the
pay of those who stay? To do so is merely to reward workers for creating
inefficient work practices.
There is only one good reason for a company to reward higher productivity:
if the increased pay is both incentive and reward for more effort.
Otherwise, employers should pay people as market conditions dictate.
'Market, plus motivation' is the right slogan, not 'more productivity,
higher pay'.
Kind-hearted people will object that it would be unfair not to reward
workers for producing more. In fact, it would be quite unfair to do so.
Output per person in UK manufacturing rose by almost 70 per cent between
1979 and 1993 (see chart). But real wages in manufacturing rose 'only' 42
per cent. Meanwhile, output per person in the whole economy rose a little
less than 30 per cent, while real wages rose 36 per cent. Thus real wages in
manufacturing have lagged well behind increases in sectoral productivity,
overall real wages have risen a little more than overall productivity and
real wages in manufacturing have risen only a little faster than in the
whole economy.
Sectoral productivity has, it turns out, not been linked closely to sectoral
pay. Rightly so, since it would be ridiculous for the pay of electricians in
motor-car plants to rise faster than that of those in hospitals. People of a
given level of skill and motivation should be paid roughly the same,
wherever they work. The alternative would indeed be unfair. It would also be
inefficient, with too few people employed in dynamic, high-paying
industries.
Companies appear to have ignored the nonsense about linking pay to
productivity in each activity. Meanwhile, real earnings in the economy have
risen roughly in line with overall productivity, as they should. So is there
a problem? Unfortunately, there are two.
First, there have been large increases in pay inequality in the UK, as in
the US, during the 1980s. A recent report from the Institute for Fiscal
Studies notes that most of the increased inequality has reflected increased
variability in the wages of people with similar education and experience.*
The likely explanation is that workers have shared in the 'excess' profits
of more dynamic companies, at the expense of the shareholders of such
companies, and their growth.
Second, even if industry-specific productivity growth has not, in the event,
been matched by higher wages, the attempt to achieve this objective risks
higher inflation, higher unemployment, or both.
Suppose dynamic companies do share excess profits with their workers. Labour
market competition and bargaining over pay relativities will then induce
employers in less dynamic activities both to pay more and to employ fewer
people. If governments respond to higher unemployment with monetary laxity,
an inflationary spiral will ensue. If they respond to higher prices with
deflation, the result will be rising unemployment. This will cease only when
the pressure of the unemployed halts the undue rise in real wages.
In the long run, overall labour-productivity growth cannot be lower than
that of real wages, without there being a profits collapse. If
company-specific productivity bargaining does push up overall real wages,
productivity growth will tend to rise, as less productive workers are pushed
out of the labour force and more capital-intensive techniques are used. The
rate of productivity growth will then be too fast, a fact shown in rising
unemployment.
That is precisely what has been happening in the UK since the late-1970s.
Productivity has been growing too swiftly, largely in response to excessive
increases in real wages. Real wages have risen too fast partly because
employers who can afford to pay more have felt obliged to do so, while the
laggards have felt compelled to match them.
One answer is pay co-ordination around a 'going rate' that reflects an
inflation objective and the increase in real wages consistent with full
employment. The alternative is a truly competitive labour market. Employers
would then pay their workers no more than needed to keep and motivate them.
They would not lay off redundant workers and then pay those who remain more,
just because they are more 'productive'. They would, instead, lay off
redundant workers and refuse to pay those who remain any more. Thereupon, it
would become profitable for them to employ additional people.
British employers have, in short, failed to grind the faces of their
workers. They have been too soft, at the expense of the unemployed.

FT  15 AUG 94 / The Markets: Testing time for coffee market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Commodities
By Deborah Hargreaves and Kenneth Gooding
Traders in London will be eager for the opening of the coffee futures market
this morning as it will be the first opportunity to react to a report by the
US Department of Agriculture assessing the extent of frost damage to the
1995 Brazilian coffee crop.
The USDA report was released after the close of the London and New York
markets on Friday. It estimated that next year's Brazilian crop will reach
between 17m and 20m bags - a figure well within market expectations. Trading
at the London Commodity Exchange last week had been volatile and jittery as
the market awaited the outcome of the USDA report.
But brokers had expected the report to be more optimistic than Brazil's own
estimate of frost damage and for this reason pushed prices downwards last
week.
By close of trading on Friday, the November futures contract was some 10 per
cent lower than it had been the week before at Dollars 3,273 a tonne. It has
dropped from a peak of over Dollars 4,000 after the initial reports of the
frost damage.
Meanwhile, traders will be keeping a close watch on London Metal Exchange
lead stocks which, against all expectations, have been rising in recent
weeks. On Friday the LME reported lead stocks at a record 365,425 tonnes.
Unexpectedly large shipments from China are partly to blame - the official
China Daily reported exports of lead surged by 209 per cent to 124,300
tonnes in the first half of 1994. All of this metal was absorbed by the
booming markets of south-east Asia, but its presence in the market forced
other producers to deliver more to the LME.
Nevertheless, analysts remain bullish about lead's prospects. There are
serious shortages of concentrate (an intermediate material) because low
prices have forced many mines to close. This must soon have an impact on
western producers of refined lead and they will have to cut supply, analysts
suggest, even though demand remains robust.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
There should be limits to how much worry you can expend on something you
regard as a certainty. That is, however, not a principle which the US
markets appear to be recognising this week.
Despite rallying on Friday, the bond market remains nervous that the Federal
Reserve will use Tuesday's meeting of the open market committee to raise
short-term interest rates for the fifth time since February. The market's
worries virtually scuppered Thursday's Dollars 40bn auction of 30-year
bonds. But both bond and equity markets have now put themselves into a
no-win frame of mind, where none of the courses which the Fed might adopt
will prove reassuring.
True, some indecision is justified by the way that successive sets of
economic data alternate in suggesting strength and weakness in the economy.
Thursday's retail sales figures for July showed prices, excluding car sales,
rising by 0.4 per cent, slightly faster than Wall Street's expectations, but
Friday's consumer price index figures then showed a smaller rise than
analysts expected.
However, the markets have reckoned that this pot-pourri of data will
eventually throw up enough signs of capacity constraints to prompt the Fed
into raising rates. That is probably right, given Fed officials' touchiness
to the charge that they left rates too low for too long last year, and the
anecdotal evidence from the Fed's own survey of its 12 district banks which
suggests labour shortages and renewed consumer spending.
The bond market is now virtually discounting a 50-point rise this week.
Perversely, if that does not emerge, bonds may even slump on fears that the
Fed has not been tough enough, and the market might well continue to assume
a further rise by autumn.
If the bond market's jitters are not calmed, it will be hard for equities to
advance. But if there is a 50-point rise, equities may well take it badly;
despite the strength of second quarter corporate earnings, shareholders
remain nervous that the recovery is fragile and that profits could falter
just as interest rates rise. Tuesday's meeting is unlikely to deliver a
quick solution to that paralysis.
Takeover flurry
Among other reasons for fretting, Wall Street analysts have feared that a
rate rise could undermine the current wave of takeovers, particularly if
accompanied by a strengthening of the dollar. A survey of cross-border
mergers and acquisitions* published last week by KPMG Peat Marwick, the
international accountancy and consultancy firm, suggests that it would not.
The most striking feature of the report, a quarterly worldwide survey of
acquisitions, is that it confirms Wall Street's impression that much of the
impetus behind current takeovers is overseas capital.
In the past six months, according to KPMG, non-US companies spent more on
acquisitions, joint ventures and stakes in the US than US companies spent
abroad.
This reverses the pattern of the past two years, when US 'exports' of deal
capital outstripped imports.
The switch has occured despite the absence of the Japanese from the world's
takeover party. According to KPMG, the total value of Japanese acquisitions
and investments outside Japan fell from Dollars 6bn in the first half of
1993 to Dollars 1bn in the second half and to Dollars 2bn in the first half
of this year.
There are obvious dangers in over-interpreting such surveys, given the
lumpiness of the data, which is easily skewed by large deals. But the KPMG
report, which tracks all publicly-announced deals between companies from
different countries, numbering some 4,000 a year, does shed some light on
the phenomenon.
KPMG unsurprisingly attributes some of the inflow of foreign capital to the
US to the dollar's weakness. Now that earnings are picking up, US companies
look cheaper to foreign rivals than they have done for years. The survey
also suggests uncontroversially that the steady rise in the size of
acquisitions in the past few years - and in the frequency of 'mega-deals' -
represents corporate confidence that the capital markets are willing again
to fund rapid, large deals.
That confidence could increase if Japanese investors overcome their
nervousness about foreign exposure. Recent capital account figures suggest
that they might: in June, there was a net outflow of Dollars 7.7bn long-term
capital from Japan, including purchases of foreign bonds by Japanese
investors.
But you do not need to invoke the return of the Japanese to argue that high
levels of takeovers will continue. The survey shows that nearly a third of
all deals in the past 18 months in particular, measured by value, were
driven by the extensive restructuring under way in the world's
pharmaceutical, media and telecommunications industries.
The figures also throw up an apparent paradox: a surge in deal making
between companies across the 'Nafta' borders. In theory, last year's North
American Free Trade Agreement, which lowered trade barriers between the US,
Mexico and Canada, should reduce the need for a company to buy rivals across
those borders in order to serve its markets.
Yet companies spent Dollars 7bn on deals across Nafta borders in the first
half of 1994 alone, and Dollars 11.4bn last year, compared to only Dollars
2.5bn in 1991.
Mr Stephen Blum, a KPMG corporate finance director, suggests that the
activity represents a preliminary shuffling of the pack of mature businesses
such as food and textiles in anticipation of the growth in trade which will
follow from Nafta.
It also, he argues, reflects the 'creation of a seamless North American
infrastructure' in industries such as telecoms. For instance, Nextel, the US
telecoms group, is assembling a digital wireless network through a web of
stakes in Canadian and Mexican companies, while Mexican companies have
bought into satellite groups north of the border.
That amounts to a more complex picture than the bargain-hunting scramble,
prompted by the dollar's weakness, which some have portrayed. It suggests
too that Wall Street's takeover advisers have little to fear from the Fed
and the markets this week.

FT  15 AUG 94 / International Company News: Pakistan telecoms sale under way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The partial flotation of Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation, the
country's monopoly telephone service, gets under way today, with the
government offering Rs1bn (Dollars 33m) of PTC shares.
The sale represents less than 1 per cent of of the corporation's worth, but
the government plans to privatise a further 26 per cent next year, possibly
to a 'strategic investor', who would take over management of the concern.
Objections from the armed forces, who feared the sale would compromise
Pakistan's security, delayed the sale for some two years.
The government has since said that some of the money raised through the sale
will be used to set up a new telephone service for the armed forces.
Meanwhile, PTC unions said yesterday that they had called off a planned
strike in an agreement with the government over job security after
privatisation. The strike was to have begun today, but a union spokesman
said agreement had been reached on job security, pensions, gratuities and
bonuses.

FT  15 AUG 94 / International Company News: Craftsmen are put in the saddle
at Taiwan's Dahon - The world's biggest maker of foldable bicycles is aiming
to improve quality in its top-of-the-range models
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dahon, the world's biggest maker of foldable bicycles, is hoping to take a
leaf out of early manufacturers' books and introduce old-fashioned pride and
craftsmanship to at least some of its production.
The Taiwanese company recently opened a new facility whose production
methods are modelled on those of its Dutch subsidiary.
In Taiwan, Dahon bikes have until now been made on an assembly line, and for
a while at least, most will continue to be. However, Dahon is setting up a
smaller, parallel workshop for top-of-the-range models where one worker will
be responsible for building an entire bicycle.
'Compared with an optimised assembly line as developed by Henry Ford, it's
obviously not as efficient to have one person build an entire bike,' says Mr
Josh Hon, son of the company's founder, Mr David Hon. 'But the advantage is
that the quality is better, because each worker takes personal pride in the
bike. The workmanship is much more meticulous.'
Each bicycle made in the Dutch factory is sold with a sticker bearing the
name of the worker who assembled it.
The Netherlands facility was set up in early 1992 to improve service and
increase European sales. Perhaps surprisingly, labour costs in Europe are
not significantly higher than in Taiwan, Mr Hon says. Also, when one factors
in Taiwan's high employee turnover and the costs of recruiting and training
new workers, and the resulting impact on productivity and quality, one comes
out even, he says.
In a little more than a decade, Dahon has grown to a company with annual
revenues in excess of Dollars 10m and annual unit sales of between 90,000
and 100,000, accounting for more than half of the international market for
folding bicycles.
The story of Dahon is in many ways an archetypal tale of the Chinese
diaspora. The elder Mr Hon was born in Canton, grew up in Hong Kong and
attended university and graduate school in the US. During the energy crisis
in the mid-1970s, Mr Hon began tinkering with a prototype folding bicycle in
his garage while pursuing a career as a laser physicist at Hughes Aircraft
in Los Angeles.
The original idea was to create a bicycle which could be used by commuters
in cities such as Los Angeles where *something in here (HP) *
public transport is not particularly convenient. A commuter could cycle to
the nearest bus or train station, fold the machine and carry it, then ride
it to the office.
In 1983, Mr Hon quit Hughes Aircraft to launch his own company. He chose
Taiwan for its plentiful supply of skilled labour and flexibility in
sourcing components.
Dahon's corporate history has been chequered with challenges. These range
from the sharp appreciation of the Taiwan dollar in the late 1980s and a
subsequent jump in land and labour costs, to difficulties in training and
retaining skilled workers.
Until recently, Dahon dominated the market, but now it is struggling to fend
off a spate of competitors - some of whom are former employees who undercut
Dahon's market with cheaper copies. The new Dutch-style production facility
is just another bid to stay one step ahead of the competition.
Another way has been to invest in the research and development of new
models, including a selection of folding mountain bikes as well as city
bicycles. In addition to assembling bikes in the markets in which they will
be sold - thus avoiding import tariffs - Dahon is also beginning to source
components offshore in places such as China, although the engineering and
quality does not yet match Taiwan standards.
Mr Hon fears that given the higher retail cost of a Dahon bicycle - the
price is between 50 per cent and 100 per cent higher than a comparable
non-folding model - the market may be approaching saturation.
Without the capital to increase volume and thus achieve economies of scale,
the production costs will remain high. Dahon has been talking with potential
partners for several years, but no pact has been reached to date.
'Our dream is to get costs down to the point where the retail price is just
20 or 25 per cent higher than that of ordinary bikes,' explains Mr Hon. 'If
we can do that, we believe our market would expand dramatically. If you
could buy a bike which was just as good as a normal bike, but had the
advantage of being foldable, you'd probably be willing to pay a bit more.'
The single biggest obstacle to reducing costs is the stranglehold on the
world market in derailleur gear systems held by one Japanese company,
Shimano. For Taiwanese bike-makers, the derailleur alone accounts for about
half of the production cost of a bicycle, Mr Hon estimates.
Dahon's best market has historically been Japan, but the rest of Asia,
especially Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan, is growing quickly. The
younger Mr Hon believes this is due to the fact that there is such a premium
on space in crowded Asian countries. The US market is unlikely to see much
growth, he says, but Europe has much potential.

FT  15 AUG 94 / International Company News: BZ fund buys stake in Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Pharma Vision 2000, the activist investment fund controlled by Mr Martin
Ebner's BZ financial group, has acquired 5m shares in Glaxo, the world's
second largest pharmaceuticals group.
Pharma Vision, known for its large holdings in Roche, the Swiss healthcare
group, said Glaxo fitted well with its preference for companies that have a
research-intensive strategy.
'It has an even stronger focus on the development and manufacture of
pharmaceutical products than Roche. No other company devotes such large
financial and human resources to pharmaceutical research,' Mr Christoph
Blocher, chairman, said in his interim report published on Friday.
Mr Blocher noted that the patent situation on Glaxo's most successful
product - Zantac, an anti-ulcer drug - was unclear, but 'our assumption is
that revenues from the company's new products will, in the medium term, more
than offset the expected loss of income from Zantac'.
He hinted that Pharma Vision could well raise its Glaxo stake, valued at
SFr56.4m (Dollars 42.7m) at the end of June, once it had seen the impact of
recent management changes.
Meanwhile, Pharma Vision again raised its holdings of Roche securities in
the first half. At June 30, it held 200,000 bearer shares worth SFr2.54bn,
up from 135,000 at the end of 1993, and 160,000 dividend right certificates
worth SFr1.02bn, up from 155,000. Its total holdings in Roche, including
options, represented 91.7 per cent of its portfolio at the end of June.
It sold part of its holding in Ciba, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals
group, during the first half and said the rest would be sold during the
second half. Pharma Vision said in February that it did not agree with
Ciba's diversification strategy.
The fund's net asset value at the end of June stood at SFr3.47bn compared
with SFr2.86bn at the end of 1993, due mainly to the SFr530m proceeds of a
February rights issue.
The net asset value per share rose marginally to SFr4,653 from SFr4,606 over
the same period.

Charter, the UK industrial group, will today announce whether it is willing
to pay more for Esab, the world's largest supplier of welding equipment,
than the Pounds 260m (Dollars 402m) recommended bid rejected by an important
group of the Swedish company's institutional shareholders.
In spite of some bad blood engendered on both sides last week, it appeared
unlikely yesterday that the UK company would carry out a threat to 'walk
away' from Esab, which the terms of its original offer allowed it to do if
Charter failed - as it did - to win 90 per cent acceptances.
'Charter still thinks Esab is a great company. It really believes it can
bring something to the business,' said a source close to the deal, which
would more than double Charter in size and add a long-sought fourth arm to
its operations in building materials, coal and rail track equipment.
Most shareholders in Stockholm expect Charter will either raise its bid, or
hold for the time being to the majority of the voting capital it has already
won.
Charter was stunned last week when five Swedish institutions rebuffed its
offer of SKr345 a share after the share price had shot up to as high as
SKr365 since the bid was made in late June.
The UK company was already assured of 53 per cent of the voting capital,
mainly through the 48 per cent pledged by Esab's controlling shareholder,
Incentive, the industrial group, and may have received more by the last
Friday's deadline. But Charter had made the bid conditional on achieving a
complete takeover.
Esab shareholders insisted their objections to its bid were based solely on
the perception that it was underpriced. Even the biggest institutional
shareholder, the Fourth Fund, a state pension fund with trade union
representation on its board, rejected a campaign by trade unions within Esab
that argued Charter was a hostile foreign predator likely to run down its
Swedish operations.
'In fact, you can argue that Charter is good for the Swedish operations.
Charter has no existing overlapping business so it will not be looking for
rationalisations,' said a senior institutional director.
The main shareholder complaint is that the price of SKr345, which when the
offer was made represented a 20 per cent premium, no longer offers a premium
on an updated valuation of the company based on the share price and enhanced
earnings forecasts. 'That is a fact,' Mr Bengt Eskilsson, Esab's chairman,
acknowledged last week.
Esab, with annual turnover of SKr7bn (Dollars 900m), has recently surged
back into profit after a programme of heavy restructuring and is forecasting
greatly improved earnings as international demand picks up. Most of its
production and markets are outside Sweden.

FT  15 AUG 94 / International Company News: IBM rethinks plans for PowerPC
chips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines has backed away from plans for heavy
promotion of PowerPC microprocessor technology, developed with Apple
Computer and Motorola, as a replacement for the Intel chips that dominate
the personal computer industry.
The reversal raises questions about IBM's declared strategy to make PowerPC
standard architecture for a broad range of its products.
It may also be a setback for IBM's partners in the development of PowerPC
microprocessor chip. Intel, the world's largest chip maker, will in contrast
undoubtedly benefit from IBM's apparent reluctance to enter into a PC
technology marketing battle.
Rather than pushing customers to accept the new technology, the IBM PC
division will 'let the customer decide', said Mr Rick Thoman, IBM senior
vice-president and the new head of IBM's PC business.
Mr Thoman is a long-time colleague of Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman and
chief executive. The two worked together for 22 years, at American Express
and RJR Nabisco, prior to joining IBM.
'PowerPC technology has capabilities that don't exist in the current
technology in terms of speed,' said Mr Thoman. 'But there are obvious
negatives for PowerPC because it does not have an established base of
application software.'
Mr Thoman's public ambivalence toward PowerPC is in sharp contrast to the
heavy promotion of the technology by other divisions of IBM, including IBM
Microelectronics, the semiconductor division which manufactures PowerPC
chips.
His position also represents a change of strategy for the IBM PC division.
Last November, just before Mr Thoman joined the company, IBM's PC marketers
launched an unprecedented effort to promote PowerPC at Comdex, the biggest
PC industry trade show, but there are clearly advantages in avoiding a
marketing battle that could undermine sales of its Intel-based PCs.
Mr Thoman said PowerPC may have greater significance in the high-end and
mid-range systems parts of IBM 'which still generate the bulk of IBM's
revenues and profits'. But without a solid base in the personal computer
market, the future of PowerPC technology seems uncertain.

FT  15 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Reed Elsevier set to reveal Davis package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch information and publishing group, is today
expected to announce details of a compensation package for Mr Peter Davis,
its former co-chairman.
The announcement follows lengthy negotiations between the group's lawyers
and actuaries, who have been working on the package since Mr Davis resigned
in June over changes in management responsibilities.
Although Reed Elsevier declined to disclose the sums involved, city analysts
believe he could receive up to Pounds 800,000 in cash, along with lucrative
share options and pension benefits.
The company, however, described weekend reports valuing the final
compensation deal at more than Pounds 2m as 'pure speculation'.
Mr Ian Irvine, who replaced Mr Davis as co-chairman, said: 'The package is
well within the legal maximum that could have been paid under the terms of
his contract.'
His predecessor was on a three-year rolling contract and earned almost
Pounds 640,000 last year, including performance-related bonuses.
Speaking after the group announced its interim results last week, Mr Irvine
pointed out that the package had been adjusted for 'mitigation' - reflecting
the likelihood of Mr Davis securing another job.
Reed Elsevier decided to make a separate announcement on the compensation
because 'we felt it was much better to link the act as closely as possible
to the cost of the act', Mr Irvine added.
Mr Davis resigned after Reed Elsevier's executive committee decided that the
co-chairmen should concentrate on strategy, management development and
corporate communications - leaving responsibility for the operating business
to other committee members.

FT  15 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Winterflood enters gilts market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent rise in the number of marketmakers in UK government bonds could
be coming to an end with the entry into the market today of Winterflood
Securities, the smaller companies marketmaker owned by Close Brothers.
In the past year, Hoare Govett, the UK stockbroker which belongs to ABN
Amro, the Dutch bank, Merrill Lynch of the US and Yamaichi of Japan have
become gilt-edged marketmakers (Gemms), attracted by the improved
profitability in trading gilts.
Winterflood's entry brings the number of Gemms to 22, which rekindles
memories of the overcrowded and tough conditions of the late 1980s that
forced several participants to withdraw.
Unlike the larger Gemms which focus on large-volume trades, Winterflood will
concentrate on retail and smaller institutional investors. Therefore, it
will not be imposing a minimum size of trade.
'There is a reasonable amount of small business in gilts - trades of
anything up to Pounds 1m - which many people in the market are not
interested in doing,' said Mr Brian Winterflood, chairman and managing
director of Winterflood Securities. He added that there was potential for
the gilts market to be opened further to smaller investors, especially if
the government allowed gilts to be included in personal equity plans.
BZW Investment Management plans to capitalise on the renewed interest in
commodities by launching a closed-end commodities fund aimed at
institutional investors. The Jersey-based investment company will be
launched next month and is expected to attract up to Pounds 100m.
The benchmark for the fund's performance will be the Goldman Sachs Commodity
Index, which includes a wide range of commodities, including livestock,
agricultural products, energy and precious and base metals.

FT  15 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Spring Ram gears up for exports drive - The
new management team's recovery programme is under way.
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are signs not just of recovery but of expansion at Spring Ram, the
Yorkshire-based kitchen, bathrooms and furniture group where institutional
investors last year forced a boardroom shake-out.
The new management team led by Mr Roger Regan, the building industry veteran
who took over as executive chairman last July, is investing Pounds 5m to
start a new cabinets business. This follows the acquisition of a furniture
company from BTR in June and the launch of an export drive.
The new management's enthusiasm is scarcely reflected in Spring Ram's share
price, which has fallen sharply since the market became concerned about the
outlook for the building materials sector and the big DIY retail sheds which
Spring Ram supplies.
But analysts will be looking at the longer term outlook when the group
reports its half-year figures on August 31. Although they are forecasting
pre-tax profits of between Pounds 6m to Pounds 8m in the current year, they
believe that profits of more than Pounds 30m could be achieved by 1996,
depending on the progress of Mr Regan's recovery programme.
The cabinets business will use the increasingly popular foil technology,
developed in Japan, which allows cheaper chipboard and fibreboard furniture
to be covered with woodgrain and other decorative finishes, at a fraction of
the cost of wooden products.
It is due to start production in November, and will use a 97,000 sq ft
factory alongside the group's Regency Doors plant at Barnsley. The start-up
is being masterminded by Mr Hartley Moyes, who joined the group last October
as managing director of Regency Doors. He was previously managing director
of Homeworthy, the Silentnight business. The cabinets business has the
biggest share of the Pounds 150m UK market for foil-covered furniture, which
grew by 66 per cent between 1990-93.
A Pounds 42m rights issue in January has also given Mr Regan flexibility to
make bolt-on acquisitions. The issue bolstered the group's balance sheet
following last year's pre-tax losses of Pounds 36.4m - which included Pounds
30.2m of provisions and write-downs.
In June, Spring Ram's Stag Furniture subsidiary paid BTR Pounds 5m for the
Rest Assured group of companies, which make bedding, upholstery and
hand-crafted furniture. Mr Regan said this would allow Stag, which makes
bedroom and dining room furniture, to offer retailers an enlarged range.
Not all the news is positive. Artisan Tiles, the lossmaking Bradford plant
which has been making ceramic tiles since 1992, is 'still struggling'.
However, the group is more upbeat about Regency Doors which had also been
identified as a possible candidate for closure and lost Pounds 10m last
year. Mr Regan said there was now no question of closing the plant, which
employs nearly 300 people - most of them former miners.
Mr Regan said the group was on - or slightly ahead of - its plan for Regency
to return to profitability by 1996. Mr Moyes said this was despite an
'appalling inheritance' of ineffective management in key areas - in
particular the absence of production and material control systems, which led
to huge wastage.
A new management team at Regency brought in consultants to help introduce
control systems and a new sales team has been recruited. Stocks have been
cut, the cash outflow controlled and improved training has led to a sharp
increase in the output per trainee. New doors have been developed and the
latest catalogue shows more than 20 different designs.
Mr Regan reckons Regency needs only 15 per cent of the UK doors market,
which it estimates at Pounds 250m, but is also anxious not to provoke his
main rivals into a price war, which could hurt everyone. So the company has
launched an export drive, focusing on Europe, South Africa, the Middle East
and the US.
Exports are also a priority for Spring Ram's bathroom division which last
year lost money, in spite of having sales of Pounds 60m - nearly a third of
group turnover.
Ram Bathrooms, the world's largest manufacturer of acrylic baths, makes
money - as does the group's showers business. But these profits are wiped
out by losses at Spring Bathrooms, which makes high-volume sanitary ware.
Mr Regan has raised prices, partly to get rid of non-profitable business.
Output of cheaper bathroom units has been cut from 16,000 to 12,000 a week,
with the loss of about 80 jobs.
These are the only significant job cuts made by Mr Regan - not counting the
27 former Spring Ram directors who have now departed, including several who
became millionaires through share options.
The bathrooms market represents a particularly good export opportunity,
according to Mr Regan, who says that luxury homes on the Continent are
increasingly sold on the range and luxuriousness of their bathroom fittings.
The whole Spring Ram group exported only about Pounds 18m-worth of goods
last year, out of total sales of Pounds 240m. But Mr Regan believes that
overseas sales could be raised to Pounds 60m by 1996.
An important element in that exports drive will be the group's
ultra-successful kitchens business, which last year made operating profits
of Pounds 18.3m on sales of Pounds 109m. Mr Regan describes the kitchen
division, which accounts for 12 per cent of the total UK market, as a
'sleeping giant'.
He said: 'The Germans supply about 7 per cent of the UK kitchen market.
There's no reason why British kitchens should not supply a significant
proportion of the German and French markets. There will always be demand -
particularly for the English country kitchen style, using lots of wood.'
Analysts can be sure of a more considered presentation of the interim
figures from the new chairman than they were accustomed to from his
predecessor, Mr Bill Rooney, the co-founder of Spring Ram who was forced out
last year. The new team discovered that Mr Rooney had planned to build a
gantry over the M1, which adjoins Regency's Barnsley plant, emblazoned with
a sign welcoming motorists to Yorkshire and Spring Ram.
Mr Regan quickly shelved that idea, but jokes that he knows just what he
will do when the Regency plant, which is currently painted bright red, stops
losing money: 'I'll paint it black]'

FT  15 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Emap pays Pounds 11.25m for three golf
magazine titles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emap's golf handicap improved substantially as the media group struck a deal
with The New York Times to buy three of the sport's best known UK magazine
titles for Pounds 11.25m cash.
Emap is buying Golf World, Golf Weekly and the trade magazine Golf Industry
News, as well as the rights to re-publish articles from the US company's
Golf Digest title.
The UK company already owns Today's Golfer, described as a magazine for the
player with a handicap of 16 or more, and Fore], which is aimed at helping
the frustrated golfer improve his or her game. It also owns two golfing
titles in France as a result of the recent Pounds 108m purchase of Editions
Mondiales.
Mr Barry Dennis, managing director of Emap Pursuit, the sports publishing
arm, said the company was confident the golf market was set for continued
growth. 'It's a little bit like trout fishing a few years ago. It was once
exclusive and now its available to everyone,' Mr Dennis said.
Golf World, a monthly and the largest of the three titles bought by Emap,
has a circulation of over 80,000. It reaches more than 700,000 golfers, with
almost nine people picking up each copy in clubs or shops.
The titles were marginally lossmaking last year on sales of Pounds 5.6m.
Emap said it expected the titles to be earnings enhancing in their first
full financial year.
IPC Magazines has agreed to buy five titles, including The Field and
Shooting Times, from the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust for an undisclosed sum.

FT  15 AUG 94 / BSkyB in OFT cable charges inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading is conducting preliminary inquiries into
satellite TV company BSkyB's position in the UK satellite and cable
television market.
The office wrote last month to nine cable companies asking whether they had
had problems obtaining programmes from BSkyB or other suppliers. It is
particularly interested in BSkyB's charges to cable operators.
If the OFT finds that there have been problems, it will launch a full
investigation.
The office yesterday said that it could not discuss the responses it had
received so far.
Many cable operators buy in BSkyB's most popular channels to supply them to
subscribers. But the cost of doing so has prompted some to attempt to reduce
their reliance on BSkyB by buying programming for their own cable-only
channels.
That, however, can lead to bidding wars which push up the price of
television rights to sporting events or films, for example.
News of the inquiries came as it emerged that several cable companies,
including Telecommunications Inc (TCI), the largest US cable operator, have
approached BSkyB over taking a stake in the satellite broadcaster.
TCI, which has large shareholdings in two UK cable companies, TeleWest and
Flextech, has held initial discussions with BSkyB on taking a stake, and the
two sides were reported yesterday to be due to meet again shortly.
Both BSkyB and TCI yesterday declined to comment on the reports.
The attraction of a link-up between a cable operator and BSkyB would be to
secure access to BSkyB channels and avoid bidding wars for programming.
There is also speculation that Mr Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation
owns 50 per cent of BSkyB, wants to increase his involvement in cable
tele-vision.
It is not clear, however, where scope for another investor in BSkyB would
come from.
The other main shareholders - Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, which
has 17.5 per cent, and Granada, with 12 per cent - are thought to be
unwilling to reduce their holdings.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): N America and cable TV send
optimistic signals - BICC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BICC, which along with Trafalgar House was one of the big losers of the
Malaysian government ban on awarding contracts to British companies, should
have some better news to report when it announces its interim results on
Wednesday.
BICC and Trafalgar were part of an Anglo-Japanese consortium expected to win
the main contract for a new Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.25bn) international
airport at Sepang near Kuala Lumpur when the ban was imposed in February.
The interim results, however, should show a further improvement in the
group's main UK and US cable markets, with pre-tax profits expected to nudge
above Pounds 60m for the six months to the end of June compared with a
restated Pounds 50m for the first half of 1993.
North America is thought to have moved back into the black for the first
time in three years, helped by the general improvement in the US economy and
a rationalisation of the company's North American business.
The cable television revolution in the UK should mean increased domestic
profits.
Cable television is providing good business for BICC, the country's biggest
producer of optic fibre cable which is increasing substantially its share of
the market. The company is also the biggest producer, outside of the US, of
optical fibre used in the manufacture of the cable.
Markets in continental Europe have been less good although overall European
profits should be higher.
Balfour Beatty, the company's construction subsidiary, has continued to
increase profits throughout the recession. It is thought to have made
another useful contribution in the first half.
Earnings should be sufficient to cover a maintained dividend but increased
payments to shareholders are still some way off.

On Wednesday the life insurance company will announce its results for the
first half of the year. Like other life companies, it is not required to
release interim profits figures, so attention will focus on the interim
dividend.
Last summer, the interim rose to 3.85p, against 3.433p. Analysts' forecasts
for the interim dividend this year are round 4.2p or 4.3p - an increase of 9
or 10 per cent.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Great expectations for Swedish
giants - Electrolux/Ericsson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's interim reporting season will get under way this week when two
manufacturing heavyweights, Electrolux and Ericsson, present first-half
figures.
Electrolux, the world's leading manufacturer of household appliances, is
first out of the trap and its results tomorrow are expected to show a
doubling of profits from last year's SKr763m level. The company is
benefiting from a combination of stronger-than-expected recovery in Europe,
healthy sales in the US, and cost-cutting.
The average market forecast is for half-year profits of SKr1.52bn and
full-year profits of SKr2.9bn (Pounds 245m) excluding capital gains.
Ericsson's first-half figures, due on Thursday, are also keenly anticipated,
with analysts looking for profits of between SKr1.8bn and SKr2.6bn compared
with SKr1.28bn a year ago. The performance will be driven by booming sales
of mobile phone systems, where the group has established itself as the clear
world leader.
James Capel in London forecasts an increase in full-year profits to
SKr5.05bn from SKr3.1bn in 1993.
The high expectations for both Electrolux and Ericsson reflect the wider
confidence that Sweden's big multinationals will be presenting exceptionally
strong half-year figures over the next three weeks.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Success that comes with a smaller role: US banks have made
hard reappraisals of their European operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recalling how many US banks used to operate in Europe, Mr Herb Aspbury
smiles. 'Colonial Bank of Waterbury, Connecticut was a Dollars 1bn asset
bank, and it had a London branch. It was insanity,' says the man who is
rebuilding Chemical Banking's European arm from the attrition it suffered in
the early 1990s.
There are many fewer US banks in Europe now, but those that remain earn far
more. As the big money centre banks such as Chase Manhattan, Citicorp and
Chemical have reported half-year results, they have shown the transformation
of European operations which used to be ill-focused and provide low returns.
It is not possible to tell the exact contribution of Europe to results such
as Chase's 32 per cent leap in second quarter post-tax profits to Dollars
307m. Most banks report their results for operations such as clearing and
settlement on a global basis. But Europe clearly gives more than adequate
returns.
Both Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover cut their European presences
during their years of crisis before they merged in 1991 to form Chemical
Banking. The combined bank's assets are 60 per cent of their peak; staff
numbers have fallen from 3,400 to 2,000 and European offices been reduced
from 42 to 23 since 1985.
Its return on capital employed in Europe is now above 50 per cent - more
than 10 times the 1985 figure. 'There used to be a tendency to be
everywhere, even if we were not sure what we were doing there,' says Mr
Aspbury. 'We discovered it was as important to define what we weren't, as
what we were.'
Other banks also made hard reappraisals at the turn of the decade, as US
operations were suffering from over-expansion in the 1980s. 'We had to face
painfully what we were good at, and how we could make our operations more
efficient,' says Mr Tom Swayne, Chase's area executive for Europe.
The result has been more than a recovery from lacklustre profits. Although
US banks have struggled to break into protected and profitable investment
banking activities in north Europe - such as advising companies and
underwriting equity issues - they now dominate some corporate banking
businesses.
The US banks have focused operations in several ways:
Only Citicorp retains ambitions in retail banking - with 304 branches in its
largest operation in Germany - in spite of having cut costs by an estimated
Dollars 300m. Chase sold its 16 branches in Spain in 1991 and closed a UK
credit card operation, while Chemical sold its UK mortgage arm in 1988.
They have scaled down in countries where they were weak. Mr Swayne says
Chase is active in south European capital markets and project finance, and
needs outlets in countries such as Spain and Italy. But it is more selective
in northern Europe, relying more on distributing products from London.
They have concentrated on a few industries. Citicorp opted to focus on
financial institutions such as merchant banks and insurers. It decided that
it had more opportunities there, because cross-border financial flows were
becoming far bigger than output and trade in individual countries.
'Financial flows are 50 times gross domestic product. The margins are lower,
but the volume is tremendous,' says Mr Ian Cormack, Citicorp's managing
director. The bank now provides services such as securities settlement and
clearing, and foreign exchange to 1,900 financial institutions.
They have cut the number of corporate customers and tried to sell more
complex products and services to the remaining ones. Mr Swayne says Chase's
return on equity from companies that regard it as one of their leading banks
is three times the level of cases where it only sells one product.
They have built on their strength in services where European banks have been
weak. An example is clearing and settlement of cash and securities, which US
banks have tended to centralise at UK centres. Chase spends Dollars 45m a
year on software upgrades for its Infoserve operation in Bournemouth.
The US banks gain advantages of scale because they can cut costs, and so
prices. They can also control operational risks better. Finally, by
tailoring transactions services for their customers, they can create what Mr
Cormack calls 'a series of webs' that make it harder for them to switch
banks.
Yet in spite of their successes in the past three years, the US banks still
have some way to go. One thing that has held them back is the fall in credit
ratings which made some companies reluctant to buy services from them. The
problem is now easing as their earnings recover and they are upgraded.
A greater difficulty is that the US banks have relatively poor contact with
institutional investors in Europe. They have made private debt placements
for European companies in the US, but would find it hard to replicate the
feat in reverse. This restricts their role as financial intermediaries.
Building their profits in more sophisticated financial markets in northern
Europe will require them to make deeper inroads into securities. For the
moment, even the achievements of the past few years may not be enough for
head offices to view Europe as a growth region to rival Asia.
'If I went back to New York now, and said I want Dollars 100m of equity to
invest in a product line, it would probably not be top of the list,' says Mr
Aspbury. Even with Europe once again making decent profits, the days when
all US banks had to have a branch in London or Paris are unlikely to return.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Companies will live with derivative risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just over half of finance directors at the UK's top companies regard
derivatives as a possible systemic risk to financial systems while 16 per
cent see them as a definite risk, according to a survey conducted by Record
Treasury Management, the Windsor-based currency hedging specialists.
However most believe that derivatives play an important, even essential role
in the management of risk, says the survey which drew responses from 81
companies with a total market capitalisation of Pounds 182bn.
A vast majority - 93 per cent - expect their use of interest rate
derivatives to rise or stay the same and 84 per cent also expect their use
of currency derivatives to stay the same or increase. The dominant types of
derivative products are swaps and forwards or futures, although 18 per cent
of respondents use specially designed derivatives.
Almost all respondents believe that disclosure is relevant but only 27 per
cent believe that this should be extended to detailed reporting. Two-thirds
favour reporting their use of derivatives in strategic terms only.
But respondents said derivatives should be used only as a tool to manage a
real business risk and never as a means of speculation. They add that while
the instruments are not a problem in themselves, they can give rise to
problems when they are insufficiently understood or when their associated
risks are inadequately communicated.
In the view of finance directors, the principal concerns in using
derivatives are control of risk and the complexity of many derivative
contracts. As a result, 89 per cent of respondents use their own treasury
teams to determine the suitability of the products and 45 per cent do their
own research.
A central bank watchdog is the preferred way to supervise the use of
derivatives (55 per cent), followed by self-regulation (34 per cent). But
only 6 per cent are in favour of specific legislation.

FT  15 AUG 94 / World Cup proves a winner with wide range of companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
While this year's World Cup may be only a fading memory for football fans,
the tournament continues to provide a warm glow for many companies which
were involved behind the scenes.
A string of international businesses from airlines and hoteliers to
television manufacturers and brewers has begun to disclose the profits they
made from the competition, held in the US.
The main British winner appears to be Guinness. The drinks group, which was
the official brewer to the Irish World Cup team, believes there was a
fivefold increase in its beer sales during last month's competition.
Brewers were also among the main beneficiaries in the US. According to
retailers in Orlando, where Ireland played two of their four games, local
sales of imported beer jumped 365 per cent in June, with the Dutch brand
Heineken leading the pack.
Airlines operating out of principal European centres also fared well.
British Airways, which last week reported a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits for the first quarter of 1994, said the good performance continued
through the weeks preceding and during the World Cup.
American Airlines, the official carrier for the competition, said that
compared with the year before it carried an extra 70,000 people across the
Atlantic in June, followed by an additional 59,000 in July.
Virgin Atlantic, the airline owned by Mr Richard Branson, reported excellent
business in June and July, already one of its busiest periods. It said its
aircraft into Florida had been 'absolutely packed'.
Despite these increased passenger loads, the US business bonanza predicted
by the World Cup's organisers did not materialise. However the tournament
did produce its share of US winners off the field.
Nike said retailers were reporting strong interest in its soccer boots
during and after the tournament.
Another clear winner was W H Smith, the UK newsagency group which operates
airport and hotel gift stores across the US. Buoyed by demand for World Cup
merchandise from visiting fans, sales at the stores were Dollars 3m (Pounds
1.9m) during the World Cup, three times the average for the Super Bowl
championship of American football, said W H Smith.
For the television broadcasters, the 52 World Cup games were a success by
the standards of previous viewing figures for soccer in the US, but the two
networks which showed the tournament - ABC and ESPN - were unable to profit
from the better-than-expected ratings because all the advertising time was
sold before the World Cup began. The US Spanish-language television network
Univision, however, did say it earned about Dollars 24m in advertising
revenues during the US World Cup compared with just Dollars 10m from the
Italy World Cup in 1990.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Nato hopes to avoid row in search for new leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nato will this week start the difficult task of finding a secretary-general
to replace Mr Manfred Worner, who died on Saturday, with leaders of the
alliance desperate to avoid the kind of public arguments which dogged the
succession to Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission.
The two names most frequently suggested as possible replacements are Mr
Thorvald Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian foreign minister and currently UN
peace mediator in former Yugoslavia, and Mr Giuliano Amato, the former
Italian prime minister.
Nato's involvement in former Yugoslavia means that Mr Stoltenberg's
experience would be useful, and Norway has never held the top Nato job.
Italy has held the post just once and Mr Amato has avoided the corruption
scandals which have felled many Italian politicians.
Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime minister who was a candidate to
replace Mr Delors, has also been mentioned for the Nato job, but his private
office said that he was unlikely to be a candidate. Mr Sergio Balanzino, the
deputy secretary-general, will head the alliance until a successor is found.
Nato is no stranger to disputes over who should be secretary-general. A
bitter row broke out when Mr Worner was appointed to the job in 1988.
The task is complicated because the change comes at a critical time for the
alliance. The prospects for peace in Bosnia are deteriorating and the
relationship between Nato and its old Warsaw Pact adversaries is evolving
rapidly. Finding a candidate quickly with sufficient standing to guide Nato
through these changes will be difficult.
However, officials in Brussels are keen to act fast. 'Nato has seen what the
Commission went through and will want to avoid a repetition,' said one
diplomat. With most politicians and Nato ambassadors on holiday, a meeting
to discuss a successor cannot be organised before September.
As Nato officials pondered possible successors, tributes to Mr Worner flowed
in. President Bill Clinton described him as a 'true and loyal friend' of
America. Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, said: 'He was one of
the greatest (personalities) of German and international politics.' Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, said he was 'a great servant of
Nato'.
Early indications were that a successor was unlikely to be German since Nato
has traditionally rotated its top job among member countries. For the same
reason, Britain is unlikely to provide a candidate as Lord Carrington was Mr
Worner's predecessor.
Whoever is chosen will have to deal with the issues of Nato membership for
eastern European countries. Nato is also likely to be involved in rapid
reaction forces outside its traditional areas of operations in Europe and
this will need delicate diplomacy.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Tory health plans under attack over talks with US group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's health plans yesterday came under renewed attack after Mr
Tom Sackville, the health minister, said he had held discussions with a US
healthcare group on the provision of services to the National Health
Service.
Labour accused the government of attempting to sell off the NHS to companies
'seeking to escape (US president) Bill Clinton's efforts at cost-cutting'.
Conservative backbenchers also expressed deep unease at the unpopular
decisions which the government may be forced to take by rising health costs.
Mr Sackville said he had held discussions in June with Salick Healthcare,
which was 'one of a number of American companies who are trying to gain a
foothold in the UK'.
However, he insisted that he had told the company, which specialises in
diagnostic and therapeutic services for patients suffering from cancer and
kidney failure, that his department was 'neutral' in any decisions taken by
NHS trusts or fund-holding general practitioners to buy services from
external sources. He said he merely encouraged the health service to
co-operate with the private sector.
The Department of Health denied any health service hospitals had been put on
sale. It said: 'The NHS is not for sale, and neither are any NHS hospitals.'
US healthcare companies are active in the UK, with the Boston-based
Healthcare International recently opening a 260-bed private hospital in
Clydebank, Scotland, aimed mainly at overseas patients. But they have not
bought existing NHS hospitals.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's health spokesman, said the US companies were
'seeking to soak the British taxpayer with the aid and approval of
government ministers'. He added: 'We must have become a soft touch for easy
profits in health care if the Americans are seeking to escape Bill Clinton's
efforts at cost-cutting and increased efficiency.'
A senior member of the Tory backbench 1922 committee said the debate
underlined the problem of rising healthcare costs. 'No one seriously wants a
US-style healthcare system. But if the government can't afford to pay, it
will increasingly be forced to take up other options, some of which may be
very unpopular.'
Sir Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend East, said: 'This will send shivers
down the spine of those who feel the NHS is moving towards a capitalist
system. The US involvement creates a special horror because of the
persistent stories of American healthcare excluded from those of limited
income.'

FT  15 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Small companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly four months ago the Stock Exchange came up with the idea of replacing
the doomed USM with a new smaller companies market based around the 200-odd
shares currently traded under Stock Exchange Rule 4.2 (Rule 535 (2) as was).
The exchange does not like to rush things, particularly when it comes to
junior markets. There is still no date for the promised consultation
document and it looks increasingly unlikely that the market could be up and
running by the end of the year when the USM closes its doors to new
admissions.
But enthusiasts are confident the exchange is at least on the right track -
towards a screen-based market, still lightly regulated but with much higher
disclosure requirements - and they are not waiting. Rutherford Asset
Management has just raised Pounds 19m for a new trust specialising in Rule
4.2 companies and at least one other such trust is thought to be on the way.
The managers argue that the Rule 4.2 world is attractive already. Originally
operated on the basis of matched bargains there is now growing involvement
by marketmakers. Trading volumes are running at a fifth of USM levels, and
rising. If the proposed changes attract more interest from specialist fund
managers it might at last provide an easy and cheap route for small
companies to raise modest amounts of equity. There is certainly a demand.
The queue of companies waiting to join suggests that, after relations became
so strained during the recession, small companies are loath to rely on banks
in the recovery.

FT  15 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Swiss banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Swiss bank reporting season, which continues this week with first half
results from Swiss Bank Corporation and CS Holding, remains under the shadow
of the near 70 per cent fall in dealing profits announced earlier this month
by UBS. The other two banks should also report lower dealing income. Indeed
Credit Suisse, which is the main bank within the CS group has already
announced a 35 per cent drop. To some extent such a development is
inevitable since the big Swiss banks are actively involved in the bond
market and carry large holdings on their balance sheets. But the Credit
Suisse figures suggest UBS will stand out for the size of its decline.
While the reason for this is obscure, the SFr1bn fall in UBS's first half
trading income reveals a volatility in its earnings stream which gives pause
for thought about its traditional premium rating to the sector. Through the
recession UBS was helped by a relatively sound loan book and diversified
sources of income. But this is a doubled-edged sword as there is now less
room for bad debt provisions to fall. Lower spreads on international credits
may also make it harder to boost its net interest income with the high
quality lending which provided such a bulwark in the past.
In the second half, CS Holding and Swiss Bank Corporation could reap further
advantage from falling provisions. At both banks last year's provisions were
more heavily weighted to the second half than those at UBS. Their greater
leeway to compensate for shrinking dealing income may give their shares a
relative edge.

FT  15 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Charter/Esab
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is some comfort that the Swedish institutions holding out against
Charter's offer for Esab object to the price rather than the principle.
There is no parallel with the Renault/Volvo affair. Assuming that the level
of acceptances due to be announced today falls short of its 90 per cent
target, Charter must simply decide whether to increase its SKr345 a share
offer. While anything over two-thirds ownership would give Charter full
control under Swedish law, mopping up any sizeable minority could be less
trouble in the long run.
Last week's tumble in the Stockholm market should put paid to the more
outlandish assessments of Esab's worth. But the company's half-year figures
were undeniably impressive. If Esab's revised full-year profits forecast is
right, Charter would have to raise its bid by 20 per cent to pay the same
exit multiple envisaged when the bid was announced. A deal on these terms
would still enhance earnings.
Yet it is not clear that Esab is intrinsically more profitable than
previously thought. If economic recovery is simply coming sooner than
expected, a lower exit multiple should apply. Besides, trade union
statements during the bid suggest that Esab could be more difficult to
manage than Charter expected. A modest increase in the offer to acknowledge
Esab's improved performance and try to satisfy the recalcitrant institutions
could therefore be the best way forward. Since Charter's shares are 12 per
cent higher than before the bid was announced, the cost to its own
shareholders of walking away would be high.

FT  15 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Breaking the link
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the last time UK equity yields fell below those on index-linked gilts
was before the 1987 crash, it is not surprising that the current 10 basis
point premium enjoyed by the latter is attracting attention. But direct
comparisons are risky. The premium is smaller than it was in 1987 when
equities looked seriously overvalued on other yardsticks too. The
index-linked market, which is tiny in proportion to equities, is also
notoriously lacking in liquidity. Though real yields of close to 4 per cent
look cheap, they may not in practice have much room to fall.
Marketmakers report a modest shift into index-linked paper by UK
institutions anxious to match long-term assets with liabilities. But this
demand has been readily matched with supply from the Bank of England. If it
believes in its own inflation forecasts, index-linked gilts are obviously a
cheap means of funding. They are also an alternative to the fixed-rate
market where borrowing conditions remain difficult. Also it would not be
surprising to see additional index-linked borrowing from utilities like
water companies, which have high capital spending requirements and revenues
linked to the retail price index.
Pressure of supply may thus be forcing the index-linked market to decouple
from equities. The pace of economic recovery also points to upward pressure
on real interest rates. That need not worry equities as long as earnings
growth is fast enough to allow dividends to rise in real terms. If that
prospect were undermined, for example by higher base rates, it would be much
harder for equities to out perform.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Wise-eyed and legless: Peter Norman says the UK Treasury's
independent economic panel is eminently disposable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK Treasury's panel of independent forecasters was probably doomed to
ignominy the moment some bright spark dubbed its members the 'wise men'.
But not even the most hard-boiled cynic, versed in the ways of economists
and government, could have supposed that this group would so quickly lose
all influence over UK economic policymaking.
True, the group added fleetingly to the gaiety of the nation last summer,
when one of its number - Professor Tim Congdon - triggered an unseemly
squabble among its members about who produced the best forecasts. Since
then, however, the wise men's panel has become something that would be best
forgotten.
This is not to denigrate its individual members. All of the original seven -
Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research; Congdon, managing director of Lombard Street Research; David
Currie, the head of economic forecasting at the London Business School;
Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist for Goldman Sachs in London; Wynne Godley,
professor of applied economics at Cambridge; Patrick Minford, professor of
applied economics at Liverpool; and Andrew Sentance, economics director of
the Confederation of British Industry - have their merits and have, over the
years, contributed to the diversity of economic debate in the UK. This
observation is just as true since the panel has shrunk to six from seven,
following the departure of Sentance to work with Currie at the LBS last
December.
But the experiment of putting a mixed bag of economists together with the
Treasury's forecasters three times a year to prepare reports on the current
position and future prospects of the UK economy has added little to the sum
of human knowledge. If anything, it has curbed economic debate by turning
true iconoclasts such as the monetarists Congdon and Minford and the
neo-Keynesian Godley into halfway establishment figures.
This, no doubt, was at the back of the mind of former chancellor Norman
Lamont when he created the group in late 1992, as part of the moves to patch
up an economic policy for Britain after the fiasco of sterling's exit from
the European Monetary System. At that time, the Treasury's reputation for
policymaking was at an all-time low, and that of its forecasters little
better.
The idea of the forecasting panel was a minor stroke of genius. The
panellists could be flattered by being told that they would provide policy
recommendations: they never were to meet Lamont but have met Kenneth Clarke
twice, although to what effect no one knows. The innovation could be sold to
the public as an example of government openness. But most attractive of all,
the panel's forecasts could be shown to be as fallible as the government's.
The press played along with the wheeze. 'Treasury calls in a clutch of
flamboyant forecasters' was the breathless headline in the Financial Times
on the day after Lamont's announcement. For a while, no piece of economic
news could be complete without one or the other - or preferably all seven -
adding their two penn'orth of comment.
Such celebrity would have been difficult to sustain at the best of times.
But the decline of the group's influence has undoubtedly been hastened by
the intervention of the unknown scribe who coined the phrase 'wise men'.
This was bound to lead to a slow seepage of authority and prestige in a
country so hostile to intellectuals as Britain.
The idea of 'wise men' also had a faintly Teutonic air. And, indeed, Germany
has a panel of 'wise men' who produce a report on the economy for the
government once a year. But at least they have a role to play in the
carefully choreographed creation of a national consensus on wage setting and
the state of the economy.
The routine is that Germany's leading economic research institutes produce a
forecast for the following year in October. Their wise men follow up with a
thicker tome in November which usually echoes the points raised in the
institutes' report. All other forecasters then fall into line. By the time
the government produces its annual report on the economy early in the new
year, wage bargainers know how much pay increases should be.
The contribution of Germany's wise men to the nation's welfare is not great,
but it is significant. It is certainly more than the Treasury's panel can
hope to achieve.
The only consolation to UK taxpayers from present arrangements is that they
will not break the budget. The panellists each receive Pounds 125 plus
expenses for attending meetings. If nothing else, the 'wise men' come cheap
in a Whitehall riddled with highly paid consultants.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Just winning is not good enough: Damian Fraser says the
political system, as well as the candidates, are under scrutiny in Mexico's
elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's governing Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) has won 10
consecutive presidential elections since it was founded in 1929, making it
the longest continuous-ruling party in the world. On Sunday, it is expected
to win an 11th - extending its run in power until the next century.
The opposition still cherishes hopes of a last-minute victory. But the PRI's
lead is so great in national opinion polls that its supporters are more
worried about the size of presidential candidate Mr Ernesto Zedillo's
victory, the threat of protests over the result, and whether - once in
office - Mr Zedillo, a former central bank official and budget minister
committed to pro-market economic policies, can tackle Mexico's pressing
political and economic problems.
Ms Nancy Belden, a respected US pollster who has just completed a survey
that puts the PRI 27 percentage points ahead, says: 'The lead is so
commanding that it would take a rather large turn of events to see someone
else come ahead.' Unless that happens in the next few days, the PRI will win
more than half the seats in the House of Deputies, the lower house, and
three-quarters of those in the Senate.
The PRI has won popularity despite growing economic and social unrest. Ms
Belden's poll shows widespread voter dissatisfaction with the economy, and a
general conviction that poverty, pollution, crime and corruption are
stagnant or worsening. But voters do not believe that the opposition is
better placed to resolve these problems than the governing party.
Such views reflect poorly on the campaigns of the main opposition parties.
Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, of the centre-right National Action party
(PAN), at one point looked to be seriously challenging the PRI after a
strong performance in a television debate with Mr Zedillo. But soon
afterwards, he almost disappeared from public view for nearly a month - the
official explanation was that he was briefing himself - and his party has
been criticised for not publishing a detailed platform, preferring to
concentrate on a few broad themes and attacks on the government. Support for
the leftwing Party of Democratic Revolution, led by Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas,
has remained weak.
The electorate may be sticking with the PRI in part because of the political
turbulence this year, which appears to be making voters more, rather than
less, afraid of change. At the beginning of the year, a Zapatista peasant
revolt in Chiapas, ostensibly seeking the overthrow of the current
president, Mr Carlos Salinas, was controlled easily by government troops.
But it highlighted the extreme poverty in which many Mexicans live and the
authoritarian nature of PRI rule.
In March, the assassination of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo
Colosio heightened political tensions still further and led to divisions
within the ruling party over the nomination of Mr Zedillo.
More significant reasons why the PRI is apparently defying political gravity
are its organisation (which is far superior to rivals'), seemingly unlimited
campaign resources (much of it from business) and favourable television and
radio coverage (much of which is owned by PRI supporters). Although this
campaign is more equitable than previous contests, the PRI is set to spend
more than Dollars 200m on the presidential and congressional races - far
more than all the opposition parties combined.
While such advantages are expected to enable the PRI to win the election,
party officials admit that victory will not be enough: the voters, and at
the very least the centre-right PAN, will have to be convinced that the
election is fair. Otherwise the opposition will almost certainly organise
street protests as it did after the 1988 presidential elections, threatening
the stability of the political system.
'We are at a turning point in Mexico's future. We either have to have
democracy or there will be civil conflict,' says Mr Javier Estrada, a
34-year-old teacher and delegate at a Zapatista-organised conference on
democracy in Chiapas last week.
Winning legitimacy will not be easy. The memory of the 1988 election - when
computers processing the results mysteriously broke down with the opposition
ahead on early returns - still haunts the country. According to the Belden
poll, 30 per cent of Mexicans believe there will be 'considerable' or a
'great deal' of fraud on Sunday.
The PRI and many independent observers (including from the UN) counter that
the electoral system has been completely reformed since 1988. The government
has handed over its supervision to six independent scrutineers, approved by
all the main political parties. These will be complemented by about 30,000
independent observers, including some from overseas. Exit polls and results
from a representative sample of early returns will be released to reduce
further the scope for fraud. Mr Enrique Calderon, a senior observer, says:
'Every step in the election process is now very explicit. We can detect if
there is any rigging.'
Nevertheless, problems may remain in rural areas where there is a tradition
of ballot-rigging and, if previous elections are a guide, there will be much
debate over whether irregularities that are found are mistakes or
fraudulently intended.
An election that was considered fair at home as well as internationally
would, however, greatly help Mr Zedillo in his efforts to maintain political
stability. He could claim, unlike President Salinas, who was elected in
1988, that he had a democratic mandate for his policies, and argue that the
PRI had made a decisive step from being the electoral arm of an
authoritarian state towards being a democratic party.
But a clean election may not be enough to win over the growing number of
dissident political organisations opposed to the PRI and, more importantly,
the political system that the party dominates. As last week's
Zapatista-organised convention indicated, the left wing in Mexico, though a
small minority, is willing to use public protests as a weapon against the
government.
'There are too many signs that the political modus operandi that maintained
stability in Mexico from 1929 no longer works,' says Mr Guillermo Valdez,
political analyst with the Mexico City-based consultancy, GEA. 'You have
more and more political forces not controlled by the PRI that are looking
for political power.'
Mr Zedillo has indicated that he will respond to the new political pressures
by pushing through further democratic reforms. He has promised to
decentralise power to the regions, to give the judiciary more independence
from the executive and to let Congress have more influence in drawing up
legislation. Mr Zedillo also says he would seek to put the PRI on a par with
other political parties by distancing himself from its internal affairs and
encouraging it to choose candidates for elective office democratically.
If implemented, such changes would open up more opportunities for Mexicans
to participate in politics. But they could also weaken the power of Mr
Zedillo: the predictability of Mexican politics in the past has depended on
a president's commands being put into practice.
Mr Zedillo could strengthen his hand, however, if he could engineer a return
to strong economic growth and provide jobs for the approximately 2m Mexicans
who enter the workforce every year. Over the past couple of years, Mexico's
economy has been stagnant, as domestic industries have suffered from
international competition and high interest rates, pushed up by recent
political uncertainty.
Mr Zedillo has vowed to raise infrastructure spending by 25 per cent to
increase economic growth. He and his advisers are confident that capital
inflows brought in by the North American Free Trade Agreement will boost
growth over the long term.
But the effect of Nafta is double-edged: it is leading to a process of
economic restructuring, with inefficient companies closing, but the lost
jobs are not yet being absorbed by new arrivals. And a continuation of
pro-market economic policies is unlikely in the medium term to improve
Mexico's uneven distribution of income.
Mr Zedillo is likely to have a difficult task steering Mexico towards the
status he covets for the country - to be a successful part of the
industrialised world - even if he wins Sunday's election cleanly and
legitimately.

Goodbye, Chicken Kiev. Hello, mushy peas. For the next seven days Ukrainians
will be able to pay Dollars 50 a head to be subjected to the best of British
cooking at Kiev's new Red Fort restaurant (old apparatchiks welcome).
When it comes to promoting British exports to Ukraine, Britain's
'outstanding cuisine' is hardly the number one target. High-tech engineering
gadgets, and British literature, yes. But British food? Not only can most
Ukrainians not afford British prices, but food is one of the few commodities
that Ukraine is rather good at exporting.
Quite why Britain's diplomatic machine feels it is worth promoting British
food exports to one of the world's richest agricultural countries is a bit
of a mystery. However, a BBC TV chef, Colin Capon, plus a plane load of
'ecologically clean' English food have been flown in, with Tesco's Ukraine
distributor picking up the bill. However, the Foreign Office's 'duty to
promote every aspect of British life' in its bid to win over Ukrainian
tummies did not extend to the wine on offer at last weekend's launch. It was
French.

Bill Foggitt, the Thirsk weather sage whose accuracy at forecasting easily
outshines that of Punxsutawney Phil, the Pennsylvania groundhog, is basking
in the prediction he made of Britain's hot summer.
After the hottest July since 1983, he said, the rest of August would produce
a mixed bag of rain, sun and thunderstorms. Thirsk has had two thunderstorms
in the past fortnight and more are on the way, said Foggitt, a thunderstorm
enthusiast. He can recall one storm on August 29 1930, the day Princess
Margaret was born, that lasted the whole night.
While that was the longest, the most violent he can remember was in
September 1965, when a flash of lightning put his telephone out of order. 'I
would have been killed if I'd been there at the time,' he said. Was that a
rumbling in the distance? No answer. Foggitt had hung up.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'As global as business itself' gushed a recent corporate ad for UBS,
Switzerland's largest bank. Not so, according to Len Harwood, who resigned
as head of debt capital markets at UBS in London last month.
Indeed, Harwood blames his departure on UBS's lack of global presence. 'The
big ticket deals these days go to firms with a global set-up,' claims
Harwood in the latest issue of Euromoney magazine. 'I didn't see UBS
becoming a global player.' Tough news for one of the few banks in the world
still sporting a triple A credit rating.
Then again, Harwood's view of UBS may have been coloured by the arrival from
Bankers Trust, in December, of John Gianotti, who was appointed over his
head to run origination and derivatives.
Whatever the reason for his exit, the man once dubbed the 'Billy Graham of
the euro-commercial paper market' doesn't expect to be out of work for long.
His passion for the medium-term note market, in particular, remains
undiminished judging by his personalised car number plate - A1 MTN.

There is something rather reassuring about the sight of 59-year-old Barry
Pearl leading Winterflood Securities into the gilt-edged market this
morning.
After all, Pearl was the last gilts jobber to quit the floor of the stock
exchange after Big Bang. Pearl soldiered on alone, making prices at his
podium by telephone or face-to-face with the occasional broker who wandered
by, long after his competitors had departed the stock exchange floor for
their high-tech skyscrapers. But in 1988 a storm cut off all lines of
communication, forcing him to retreat up into the office and take his place
in front of a screen. Since then, he has never looked back.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Observer: Unison on stage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's trade unions are not normally fertile sources for stories of sex,
money and the media which is probably why Unison, the public services union,
has decided to sponsor one instead.
The union has given Pounds 15,000 to back Abducting Diana, a satirical play
by Dario Fo about a woman millionairess media tycoon who has a penchant for
picking up young men for afternoon sex.
In the past Unison has concentrated more on sponsoring high-class 'agit
prop' - that's agitational propaganda to you and me. However, it is keen to
move away from 'overt socialist themes' and in March tried to sponsor a
football game between Plymouth Argyle and Barnet.
Abducting Diana, which opens at the Edinburgh festival tomorrow, seems
assured of more success. But in case Unison members find it too heavy going
they can reserve a place for themselves at the highlight of the summer
season - the annual TUC conference, which starts a short run at Blackpool's
Winter Gardens three weeks later.

FT  15 AUG 94 / The deciding factors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It may, so far, be a voteless UK recovery, but it has certainly not been
without profit. The healthy earnings figures seen in this reporting season
will not excite the electorate, but they highlight the unusually buoyant
state of the UK company sector. Given what came before, the divergence
between public and corporate sentiment is somewhat to be expected. Whether
it continues will depend less on how much cash companies have and rather
more on how they decide to spend it.
The UK corporate sector's record cash surplus in the first quarter of 1994
crowned a rapid turnround in company balance sheets since the recovery
began. This was achieved largely through heavy repayment of debt, made
possible, in turn, by the prior resilience of profits. Non-oil profits,
currently 28 per cent of on-shore gross domestic product, never fell below
25 per cent in the 1990-92 downturn compared with troughs of about 18 per
cent in 1974-75 and 1980-81.
How was this achieved? Companies reacted unusually quickly to the onset of
recession, running down stocks and labour so as to maintain profit margins,
which were given support anyway by the relatively shallow slump in output.
As a result, sterling unit labour costs rose by a total of only 12 per cent
over the 1990-91 period compared with a cumulative rise of one-third and 57
per cent respectively at a comparable stage in the past two downturns.
Continued falls in manufacturing employment and subdued wage growth have
helped build profits further as the economy has picked up, though they have
done little to raise consumer spirits.
High margins
Those at the receiving end of that disquiet, notably retailers, have found
their profit margins under pressure. But for the economy as a whole margins
are high by historical standards. This is one reason why the fear that
companies will make up for rising commodity prices by raising prices might
be misplaced. Another is that the cost of such materials accounts for a mere
8 per cent of UK companies' direct costs. If companies choose to raise
prices nonetheless, that would strengthen the case for reining in the
recovery with a rise in interest rates. But its long-term sustainability
will depend just as critically on how companies decide to spend the cash
they already have.
Cash-rich companies can do any (or all) of three things: raise dividends,
engage in mergers or take-overs, or invest in real assets.
Dividend growth
As noted in the latest Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, a higher
percentage of companies were willing to reduce dividends to pay off debt in
the past recession. Nevertheless, this had little impact on overall company
sector dividend payments, which were at a 20-year high of 3.6 per cent of
GDP in 1993. The financial markets seem to expect even higher payouts in
future. Gallup's latest institutional investors' survey reports expected
all-share dividend growth of 8.5 per cent in 1994 and 8 per cent next year,
compared with the 6 per cent expected for both years when January's poll was
taken.
Mergers and acquisitions have picked up somewhat over the past year. But,
while a new takeover boom would distract companies' attention from investing
in higher capacity, it need not prevent it. A more important barrier, some
argue, is the high rates of return which companies demand of their
investment projects. Investment has yet to rise significantly in this
recovery: manufacturing investment was 3.7 per cent lower in the first
quarter of 1994 than it was in 1993. As a percentage of GDP, investment may
appear to have held up better during this recession than at the start of the
1980s, but the recent sharp fall in the price of investment goods makes it
more difficult to find a clear contrast. Certainly, other investment
expectations are as subdued as they were in the middle of 1983, at precisely
the same stage in that recovery.
Conditions then were ripe for the seven-year upturn in investment which
began a few months later. With company profitability much higher now than in
the early 1980s, it is difficult to believe that the same factors favouring
investment will not reassert themselves. In the meantime, the chancellor
must focus on ensuring that the factors favouring inflationary growth do
not.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Case for trials of Aids vaccines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As researchers, epidemiologists, and patients returned this weekend from the
10th international Aids conference in Yokohama, the mood could not have been
gloomier. The disease is spreading; none of the available drugs has proved
particularly effective; and prospects for a vaccine, uncertain at best, have
been put back by US unwillingness to initiate trials of those that have been
developed.
The most disheartening news is the epidemic's continuing rapid acceleration
in Africa, home to 60 per cent of all people infected with HIV, the virus
which causes Aids, as well as in Asia. Three million more people have been
infected over the last 12 months, making a conservative total of 17m. In
parts of Uganda, Aids-related diseases account for half of all deaths.
Infections have tripled in India since 1992 and risen tenfold in Thailand
since 1990.
Meanwhile, the ability of doctors to deal with the virus appears to be
deteriorating. At Yokohama, clinical data were put forward on treatments
that might help against the opportunistic infections that afflict Aids
patients. But the confirmation that the drug AZT is incapable of slowing
progress to death in non-symptomatic, HIV-positive patients means there is
no proven effective treatment for such people.
Little is in the pipeline to take AZT's place. Without new medicines to
test, patients are being urged to combine the existing ones. Whether these
will be effective or practical is open to doubt. In any case, most patients
in industrialised countries already have difficulties paying for treatments
which are individually expensive. Taken simultaneously, they would be
exorbitant.
Developing countries
If such drugs are too dear for patients in rich countries, they are well
beyond the means of most HIV-positive and Aids patients - those in
developing countries. A year's treatment with AZT costs about Dollars 2,500.
Many African countries spend less than Dollars 10 a head on health. Public
health campaigns involving greater use of condoms, clinics for
sexually-transmitted diseases, education and counselling are also beyond the
means of most African nations.
While efforts to boost condom use and public education must be stepped up
and given greater support by aid donors, they can only provide a partial
answer. The best solution in the long term will be a vaccine. Experimental
injectable versions are available. The only way of testing to see if they
work and are safe is through large-scale trials. Delegates, particularly
from Africa, pleaded last week for such studies to be started. Yet the
vaccines they want to test have just been rejected in the US. The American
authorities were unconvinced the vaccines could outwit HIV, and believed the
risks involved outweighed the benefits. These risks are considerable:
volunteers could adopt more risky behaviour in the mistaken belief they were
protected from HIV; they could even be infected by the vaccine itself.
Desperate dilemma
The American decision set back Aids vaccine development in the US, possibly
by three years. This poses a desperate dilemma for the World Health
Organisation, which had been planning to co-ordinate vaccine trials in
Brazil, Thailand and Uganda.
The simple case for proceeding with trials in developing countries is that
this would be in the best interests of their people. The cost and
impracticality of likely alternatives makes a vaccine the only realistic
solution. While it would be desirable if the US authorities overcame their
objections to the vaccines in question, there can be no denying that the
risk-reward equation is different in America. Not only is the incidence of
the disease lower than in many developing countries, but drugs companies
might come up with a way of controlling it through medicines that would
never be affordable in the poorest countries.
It would be out of the question to contemplate a standard sequence for
trials of new drugs that started with animals and moved on to Africans,
before finishing with Americans. But by virtue of its incidence, Aids is a
special case. Individual participants in any trials must be fully informed
of the risks. This said, the threat faced by the people of developing
countries makes those risks worth running.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Roles that World Bank and IMF must
give up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DOUG HELLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Coinciding with the recent 50th anniversary of the Bretton Woods
conference, some 70 citizens' organisations in the US launched the '50 years
is enough' campaign to hold the World Bank and International Monetary Fund
accountable to people whose lives they affect across the developing world.
The campaign is working with similar coalitions around the globe.
Unfortunately, both John Williamson ('Rules needed for a new age', July 8)
and Michael Prowse ('Private view of a public motivator', July 18) have
mischaracterised the US campaign and misrepresented its positions. We are
not calling for the abolition of the Bank, as they suggest. We do strongly
recommend cutting its resources and responsibilities so as to reduce its
power and the damage it causes. The campaign also agrees with many analysts
that the IMF should get out of determining development policy.
Furthermore, Williamson suggests that the members of our campaign are not
dedicated to 'helping poor countries catch up with rich ones and assisting
former centrally planned economies to make the transition to a market
economy', two supposed goals of the Bretton Woods institutions. Quite the
contrary.
It is World Bank and IMF adjustment programmes that have led to increased
poverty, widened the gap between the rich and the poor, gutted local
productive capacity and accelerated environmental degradation in most of the
some 75 countries in which they have been imposed. We say there must be a
better way. We believe that economic policy reforms must support the
productive activities of the poor (particularly women), stimulate greater
local self-reliance, increase workers' rights and wages, and enhance
broad-based sustainable food production. Our platform, which apparently
neither Williamson nor Prowse has read, also calls for a shift away from
large-scale infrastructure projects that displace millions of people in
favour of smaller, resource-conserving investments.
But, more importantly, the road of change must be paved by the people
themselves, who should be left to determine the direction and pace of their
own economic future. If these are 'strident' demands, as Prowse suggests, so
be it.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN BERTRAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest articles on payments and settlement systems by
Peter Norman and John Gapper (Economics Notebook, August 8; 'What to do when
Chaps can't cope', August 9). Reading Chapter VIII of the BIS's recent
annual report would show that increasing volumes and values in the
international payment systems are coming from banks of all sizes, not just
leading clearing banks in the various markets.
One of the primary reasons Royal Bank of Scotland and Banco Santander
created IBOS (InterBank On-Line System), the cross-border payments and
banking system, was to address the lack of direct account-to-account
processing for all banks, not just clearers. Providing such efficient
services greatly reduces any likelihood of systematic failure.
Industry initiatives along the lines of IBOS are representative of the type
of response the banking industry should advance and embrace, and mitigate
the need for regulatory action. As virtually everything today is tradeable,
delivery v payment is the backbone of non-cash settlement. This is well
covered by the Group of 30 recommendations. Cash should be similarly
treated. By being able constantly to check to ensure funds are available and
accounted for at the time of trade, the financial world would be safer than
at present.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Risen from the electronic ether: Philips has still to show
that it can make it in the multimedia big league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has clearly survived the traumas of
the early 1990s, when heavy losses and hefty debts nearly caused its
collapse. Having pulled through the crisis, Philips must now show that it
can marshal its resources and develop a product range with which to compete
in the multimedia age.
Last week, the company managed to close two painful episodes. First, on
Wednesday, it announced plans to spend Fl 500m (Dollars 275m) to boost
capacity at its semiconductor plant in the Dutch town of Nijmegen. The move
is significant. Not only is it the biggest single investment in new plant
since the dark days of the early 1990s; the equipment will also fill a
symbolic 'hole' in the Nijmegen factory caused by the painful decision in
1990 to pull back from commercial production of static random-access memory
(S-Ram) chips. Philips had hoped to break into the market for these advanced
chips - a market dominated by Japanese manufacturers.
The surprise cancellation of the S-Ram project was the first wrenching step
taken by Mr Jan Timmer when he became Philips' president. Under his crusade
to shake up corporate culture, Operation Centurion, he forced the company to
emphasise profits and productivity over job security and scientific
prestige. His scrapping of the project left part of the Nijmegen plant
empty, and this is the space that will be filled by equipment to produce
Philips' new generation of submicron integrated circuits. These are the
miniaturised, energy-efficient 'brains' of cellular telephones and other
portable electronics products.
Second, on Thursday last week, Philips announced a 244 per cent increase in
second-quarter profits, the biggest gain so far in the 1990s. What confirmed
Philips' rehabilitation was not so much the rise itself, though this
exceeded forecasts, but the fact that nobody seemed particularly worried
ahead of the results or relieved afterwards. There was none of the
hand-wringing and doom-saying that accompanied other quarterly reports in
the Netherlands in recent years.
Philips, in short, has become a 'normal' company again, treated little
differently from other blue-chip Dutch groups that have reported results
over the past two weeks: its survival is no longer in doubt.
Mr Dudley Eustace, Philips' finance director since 1992, confirms the
company is ready to move from cost-cutting to 'revitalisation'. But does
Philips, just back in good financial health with a balance sheet that is
finally lightened of debt, have deep enough pockets to compete in the
expensive world of multimedia deals?
The company clearly has the resources to invest and the ability to borrow,
having secured a Dollars 2.5bn stand-by credit facility in June from a
consortium of international banks led by CS First Boston. But observers do
not expect it to embark on big acquisitions or lavish investment spending.
The Fl 500m to pay for the new section of the Nijmegen plant will come out
of the semiconductor division's own cash flow. The investment is one that
the division has earned: 'They cut back early, and they've become fit and
ready,' says Mr Eustace.
Earlier this year, Mr Eustace said Philips might consider a share issue if
the right acquisition arose in the field of 'software'. In the new jargon of
multimedia that term now encompasses the music, films and information
systems that run on the industry's 'hardware', such as video recorders and
interactive compact disc players. But Philips does not intend to go on a
spending spree. 'We have so recently come down from a very highly indebted
level that I have no desire to leave the impression with the investment
community at large that all of a sudden we've forgotten our past,' Mr
Eustace says.
The company's statements bring to mind its strategy in the early 1990s when
PolyGram, its majority-owned entertainment company, decided to move into
films by acquiring small production companies, one of which produced the hit
film Four Weddings and a Funeral.
This low-key, low-cost approach contrasted sharply with the billion-dollar
acquisitions of big Hollywood studios by Philips' richer Japanese rivals.
Sony acquired Columbia Pictures and Matsushita bought MCA, owner of
Universal Pictures.
Mr Eustace acknowledges a similarity between Philips' careful involvement in
film and its overall investment plans. 'I think we're still a pretty
cautious Dutch company, and we're not likely suddenly to go and enter the
race to buy CBS or something like that,' he says. 'Prudence will dictate
that we take bite-sized moves into this area, rather than trying to swallow
a giant. That would be very foolish.'
Still, Philips is gearing up for higher investments at a time when it has
yet to recoup the money it has put into its three latest
consumer-electronics products - high-definition television (HDTV), compact
disc-interactive (CD-I) and digital compact cassette (DCC).
HDTV's birth has been hampered by competing ideas on standards in Europe,
Japan and the US, and it has yet to be launched on the mass market.
By contrast, CD-I and DCC have both been brought fully to market, and there
is no disguising that sales of players for DCC - Philips' successor to the
analogue audio cassette - have been disappointing. The company is now
narrowing down its initial European marketing focus to the UK and parts of
the Continent, but it is clear that DCC has not yet emerged as a 'must-have'
product.
CD-I sales have been more encouraging, but Philips has not succeeded in
making the interactive CD player - capable of teaching people to play
musical instruments or to access a 'living' encyclopedia from the television
sets in their living rooms - the industry-wide vehicle for multimedia
entertainment and education.
Philips protests that its three latest consumer-electronics products always
come under media scrutiny, to the exclusion of other innovations, ranging
from medical scanners to car headlights. It adds that all three predated the
Centurion shake-up and were launched, almost simultaneously, in the middle
of a recession.
This will not, however, be a credible excuse for any market failure by the
products of any new investment programmes. How these products fare will be
an important test not only of the company's new-found financial health but
of its ability to shake off its sluggish, paternalistic past and to create a
growth-orientated, entrepreneurial organisation.
Philips acknowledged early on under Mr Timmer that it needed to tap outside
expertise. Indeed, one of the visible signs of the changes at Philips is the
number of Americans, Britons and Scandinavians now in charge of product
divisions. Of the 13 members of the group management committee, the
company's main operational forum, just five are Dutchmen, a reversal of the
situation before 1990 when Dutch executives, usually life-long Philips
veterans, filled the top rank.
In keeping with the new pattern, Philips Media, the New York-based outpost
of the group's multimedia ambitions, is now run by Mr Scott Marden, a US
investment banker with experience of the publishing, cable and
communications industries. At the very highest level, Mr Frank Carrubba was
brought on to the five-member Philips management board from Hewlett-Packard
to look after technology.
The fact that Mr Eustace, an Englishman and former finance director of
British Aerospace, sits down in Eindhoven every quarter to present the
company's results - in English - is an indication of just how far Philips
has come from its days as the most insular of Dutch multinationals.
This imported talent, which includes a number of Dutch newcomers, now fills
many of the crucial positions in the company and exercises considerable
influence over a venerable member of the corporate establishment. In the end
Philips' capacity for innovation, likely to be generated by this talent, as
well as the quality of its product range will be as important in determining
its future as the breadth of its financial resources.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: No evidence of a credit crunch in
Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN ROSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While the FT deserves praise for its excellent coverage of the Japanese
economy, your report, 'Japan's credit crunch threatens anaemic recovery'
(August 12), misses the mark. Although lending by the banks included in the
Bank of Japan's statistics is indeed falling, there is no evidence that this
is the result of a 'severe credit crunch'. If a US-style credit crunch
(which, by the way, did not prove fatal to the economic recovery there) did
indeed exist, we would expect the gap between banks' cost of funds and their
lending rates to widen, as well as a surge in their holdings of government
bonds.
In fact, these figures have shown little change. Most complaints about
banks' reluctance to lend have come from small business owners, many of whom
face negative cash flows and are trying to borrow in order to stave off
bankruptcy. This is not the type of borrower most banks seek out even in the
best of times. These borrowers seem to be showing up not in the Bank of
Japan's statistics but in the National Tax Agency's. Some of the top income
tax payers in Japan last year were owners of financing companies
specialising in high-risk loans, at interest rates often exceeding 20 per
cent a year.
We should also not forget the important role in credit creation of
government financial institutions during the current recession. In 1993,
they increased their total loans and discounts outstanding by Y11,800bn
(about USDollars 118bn). If we add in the Y3,700bn increase in corporate
straight and convertible bonds outstanding, it becomes clear that bank
lending is not the only means of credit creation in Japan.

Inflation Report. Yet nowhere in the report itself did these words appear.
Its conclusion was: 'If official interest rates were to remain unchanged
over the next two years, then it is probable that inflation would gradually
rise to a level above the mid-point of the target range' (my italics again).
Which has the more authoritative status, the text of the Inflation Report,
or the warning given to the press interpreting it? The Bank of England risks
creating confusion in financial markets by giving an interpretation to its
own words which goes well beyond their meaning as written. It would have
been helpful had your reporters at least drawn attention to the written
conclusion of the Inflation Report, so that readers could have drawn their
own conclusions from the contrast between the two.
If the Bank's 'warning' was to be taken seriously, it should surely have
been written into the Inflation Report conclusion. If the Bank does not
recommend a rise in rates within the next few months, it can point to the
written text; if it does, it can point to the warning. It is a bit too like
the old system of nods and winks which was supposed to have been replaced by
the 'new policy of openness', with the report at the centre of it.

FT  15 AUG 94 / A cure to relieve 'derivatives angst'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM J MCDONOUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent well-publicised losses in the market for de-rivatives have
intensified public discussion of these complex instruments whose value is
based in part on some underlying financial market. A recurring theme has
been the call for increased scrutiny of derivatives activities and
legislative action to relieve what can be called 'derivatives angst'.
What is derivatives angst? It is the feeling that these new instruments are
so volatile, and their volume and use growing so fast, that they could
overwhelm the financial system. We need to be vigilant about systemic risk,
but the visions of melt-down are overblown.
The focus of any efforts, at this point, should be the marketplace, not
legislation. Aggressive action by private-sector participants, combined with
increased co-operation among regulators and supervisors, will go far in
alleviating derivatives angst.
Our objective is simple: to make sure that these instruments, which serve a
necessary and constructive purpose in helping to manage risk, are used
safely and soundly by all, in a way that increases stability and confidence
in the financial markets globally.
There is a clear need for private-sector action on at least three fronts:
improving disclosure standards and designing a new framework for tracking
capital flows;
ensuring high-quality and independent risk assessment capabilities at each
user firm;
and reducing, if not eliminating, settlement risks.
The type and quantity of information available to market participants is
insufficient. The current framework of financial disclosure does not suffice
to analyse risk when firms can so quickly transform their risk profiles with
derivative instruments. All market participants must have adequate
information to make informed, rational decisions, as a matter of efficiency
and equity. Knowing a firm's appetite for taking risk and its ability to
control that risk are essential for any shareholder, creditor or
counterparty.
To narrow the information gap, individual market participants must develop
bold and ambitious disclosure standards that go well beyond the traditional
balance sheet and income statement. Comprehensive disclosure of both risk
positions and risk management practices would also enhance the discipline of
the marketplace.
Moreover, enhanced disclosure would serve to heighten directors' and senior
managers' awareness of the dimension and the risks of derivatives and other
capital markets transactions.
Beyond financial disclosure, an information gap also exists regarding the
size and direction of capital flows within markets and around the globe.
Here, too, derivatives and related market innovations have reduced our
ability to discern the distribution of risks across capital markets. It
would take a great deal of ingenuity to design a comprehensive system to
measure capital flows, but it is worth the effort. The necessary first step
is to compile the main questions such capital flow data should help answer,
and we are ready to work with market participants to get the effort going.
A second priority that market participants must embrace is establishing
independent risk-management staffs and developing rigorous measurement and
analytical capabilities. While there has been progress on these fronts, more
needs to be done, particularly in ensuring a strong internal control
environment.
It is essential that skilled personnel are hired, with equal status, not
only for the trading floors and risk management staffs, but also for
back-office and internal audit functions.
Given that virtually all of the most significant trading-related losses have
involved internal control breakdowns, I am convinced that a substantial
commitment of monetary and human resources to internal controls earns a high
rate of return for dealers and end-users alike.
An important next step is to develop and implement sophisticated
stress-testing regimes. A firm needs to be satisfied that its resources are
sufficient to buffer it from a broad range of low-probability, extraordinary
events involving the various components of market, credit, liquidity and
operational risks. One of the most important functions of stress testing is
to identify unrecognised vulnerabilities, often the result of hidden
assumptions, and make clear to trading managers and senior management the
consequences of being wrong about their assumptions.
Finally, there is a critical need to take immediate action to eliminate what
we call 'Herstatt risk' - the risk of settlement failure in foreign
exchange. Several initiatives currently under way, including the development
of netting agreements in foreign exchange and efforts to create a foreign
exchange clearing house, are constructive and important. But additional
substantial progress must still be made before we can eliminate - or nearly
eliminate - Herstatt risk.
If we do not act with an aggressive agenda, the grip of derivatives angst
will be unrelieved. Derivatives are a positive force for the market, and we
must ensure that market practices inspire confidence in all participants,
private and public, dealers and end-users.
For our part, I recognise that we, the regulators and supervisors, must
acknowledge our collective responsibility for ensuring the success of our
primary mission: the preservation of a sound and resilient global financial
marketplace.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Arts: Prurience or the pursuit of truth? - Biography is one
of the most popular literary forms. But, says Jackie Wullschlager, its days
may be numbered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WH Auden thought it should never have been written. The critic Dame Helen
Gardener called it 'a directory for consenting adults.' From the liberal
Bloomsbury Set came calls for wholesale suppression. But thousands of
readers lapped up its story of homosexual love and intrigue, and it changed
the face of post-war British biography.
The book was Michael Holroyd's life of Lytton Strachey, first published in
1967 and re-issued, with much new material, next week. It is still a
marvellous read, and its fresh crop of sexual details - chiefly about the
amorous triangle of Strachey and artists Dora Carrington and Mark Gertler -
continue to interest. But this time round Holroyd's revelation will barely
raise an eyebrow, because the liberal biographical climate which the book
engendered in the 1960s has now become the norm.
No book since Strachey's own Eminent Victorians in 1918 has had a greater
effect on the way we interpret and reconstruct past lives, and to trace the
joint influence of Strachey and Holroyd on modern biography is to trace a
revolution both in our attitudes to sex and to art, as in our growing
fixation on the private lives of public figures. Is the tradition they began
still a liberating force in British culture, or has it now gone too far?
In 1918 Strachey blew the whistle on the earnest, tip-toeing Victorian style
of biography with his sarcastic account of 19th century icons such as
Florence Nightingale and General Gordon. Half a century on, Holroyd's
biography of Strachey turned the tables on the Bloomsbury writer, bringing
to the surface methods of interpretation which Strachey's malicious purring
had only implied. Discussing Strachey's affair with Duncan Grant, the madcap
proposal to Virginia Woolf - 'I was in terror lest she should kiss me' - and
the effect of schoolboy crushes on his neurotic experiences, Holroyd showed
that a full picture of an individual could only be drawn if it included
intimate details, the inner life as well as the output achievement. 'Rather
wonderful and terrible how all that can now be said,' wrote Nancy Mitford of
the book.
Modern literary publishing for good and ill, has never looked back. On the
one hand, Holroyd's spirit of openness and his elegant novelistic style,
burst the floodgates of biographical restraint and made biography a popular,
best-selling genre. Its highlights include some of the best books of the
last 30 years, such as Richard Ellmann's life of Oscar Wilde, Victoria
Glendinning's Trollope, Lyndall Gordon's Charlotte Bronte - all exquisite
accounts of the personal lives of writers within the context of their work
and times.
On the other hand, many recent books suggest that the post 1960s tradition
of tolerant, revealing biography is entering a last, decadent phase in which
all that matters is an artist's sex life. Extended speculation on the sexual
habits of Hardy and his second wife, for example, made Martin Seymour
Smith's massive scholarly biography of the writer, published this year, a
joke. Recent lives of Picasso and Brecht chronicled their lovers rather than
their work. And as new biographical subjects run out, lives of wives and
girlfriends - Lawrence's women, Madox Ford's lover, Flaubert's mistress -
replaced them, licensing pages of dull pillow talk. Where Holroyd or Ellmann
made biography an art form, the tail end of their tradition is degenerating
into vulgar tittle-tattle.
It is no coincidence that Holroyd and Ellmann's masterpieces are both about
homosexual satirists, Strachey and Wilde, who spent their lives trying to
change social and sexual attitudes. Strachey and Wilde's homosexual affairs,
outre poses, the flirtation with scandal marked them as outsiders and were
bound up with the mockery of repressive convention in their works such as
Eminent Victorians and The Importance of Being Earnest. As sexual pioneers,
their biographies cried out for a link between life, art and the wider
social panorama, and it is this which makes Holroyd's Strachey and Ellmann's
Wilde so entertaining and significant.
But take away this dimension, and catalogue Florence Hardy's efforts to
stimulate her ageing husband, or Picasso's pick-ups, and you are left with a
dull quasi-pornographic record masquerading as a serious book. For what
makes sex on the page subversive and interesting is social context. FR
Leavis used to tell his students that Strachey was responsible for the
outbreak of the second world war; Paul Johnson has argued that by destroying
patriotism, Strachey created a national emptiness which became the
homosexual recruiting ground at Cambridge for Soviet espionage.
It was these sort of links between culture and sexuality that made Holroyd's
1967 biography so inflammatory. In 1994, Holroyd's new material centres on
Dora Carrington, Strachey's adoring companion, and the second half of the
book is now also a biography of her. She attracted to their home the sort of
virile, charismatic young men that Strachey loved and married one of them to
ensure that their menage continued. Eventually, she wrote, a lesbian affair
'killed my desires for Les Jeunes Garcons pretty completely,' and when
Strachey died, she shot herself.
This tumultous tale has much gloss and few social reverberations, and is the
weakest part of the book. But so fashionable have flamboyant private lives
like Carrington's become for their own sake, that this new section has
immediately been seized upon to enter 1990s mainstream culture; a film,
Carrington, directed by Christopher Hampton, starring Emma Thompson and
Jonathan Pryce, is to be made of it and will open next spring. Nothing shows
more clearly the revolution in our attitude to private lives that Strachey's
and Holroyd's work has effected this century.
Strachey first weaved sex into cultural criticism - of Virginia Woolf's To
the Lighthouse, he complained that 'It is the lack of copulation that
worries me' - at a time when it was radical and provocative to do so. Now
the pendulum has swung the other way, and our culture goes so far as to
judge public or artistic achievement by private affairs, hence the
biographies which dismiss Picasso's painting or Brecht's plays because their
creators were irresponsible in bed, or the lives of Flaubert's and Madox
Ford's lovers, which accord their subjects artistic status because they
slept with great writers.
Since Lytton Strachey appeared in 1967, there have always been those keen to
curb this prurient interest - from a Spectator article in 1968, warning that
fears of Stracheyesque indiscretion would lead potential biographical
subjects to destroy letters and journals, to the Lord Chancellor's 1993
consultation paper on The Infringement of Privacy, which recommended
restriction of published material causing 'substantial stress, to relatives
or descendants'.
For the biographer, this form of censorship would be disastrous. But
contemporary biography is more endangered by its own decadent trends towards
sex'n'shopping lives than by outside restrictions. The new edition of
Holroyd's classic biography (Chatto Pounds 25, 780 pages) looks as bright
and undated as if it were written this morning - a tribute to its style and
insight, but also a comment on the fact that no new biographical tradition
has emerged since the 1960s. Where is the Michael Holroyd, or indeed the
Lytton Strachey, for the 21st century?

The Lucerne Festival has broken off some of the shackles of convention since
Matthias Bamert became director in 1992. This year's programme, starting on
Wednesday, includes a 70th birthday tribute to avant-garde Swiss composer
Klaus Huber, a street-music festival and a series of events breaking the
rules of traditional concert form. But the festival's main attraction - next
to its beautiful lakeside setting - continues to be its enviable line-up of
front-rank orchestras, conductors and soloists.

This is Brian McMaster's third year in change of the annual three-week
Edinburgh Festival, which opened yesterday. Several of the artists appearing
in this first week are returning after their successes in one or both of his
two previous festivals: Charles Mackerras (again conducting a Mozart opera
in concert while preparing it for a recording), the mezzo Olga Borodina (in
recital), the soprano Galina Gorchakova, the theatre directors Robert Lepage
and Peter Stein.
The fine Miami Ballet performs an all-Balanchine programme at the cavernous
Playhouse Theatre, until August 20. Then on August 20 and 21, Mark Morris
presents his masterpiece, 'L'Allegro' at the re-furbished and excellent
Festival Theatre: absolutely not to be missed.
Having chosen Beethoven as one of this year's featured composers, Edinburgh
has nominated Wednesday as 'Fidelio' day. The difficult gestation of
Beethoven's only opera will be examined through lectures and concerts,
including a performance of 'Leonore'. In the evening the programme
culminates with 'Fidelio' itself in Scottish Opera's new production,
directed by Tim Albery.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Arts: Under Their Hats - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Under Their Hats, a compilation of pieces by Flanders and Swann at the
King's Head, Islington, deviser Alan Strachan has been rash enough to
include a spoof on the old D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.
Why does Gilbert and Sullivan still have bite while much of Flanders and
Swann is inoffensive? Perhaps because the Victorians were on the attack,
even though they knew their targets were in the stalls. Flanders and Swann
look on the audience as their accomplices and a cosy conspiracy results. At
its worst it includes whimsy. It can patronise the safely non-theatre-going
classes ('The Gasman Cometh'). The double bluff of the 'Song of Patriotic
Prejudice' bespeaks the true complacency of nationalism by apparently
laughing at it. And a certain philistinism is taken for granted in the
audience, even in the 'Guide to Britten' despite its neat turns of phrase
('Albert Herring was pickled and cured').
Yet just when you are damning the entertainment as irredeemably middle-class
and hopelessly English up pops something extraordinary: a song prompted by
the announcement that the result of stockpiling nuclear arms was a total of
'twenty tons of TNT' for every human being in the world. The song is
magnificent in its controlled anger and urgency; as scathingly deadpan as
anything by Brecht.
In Wendy Toye's production two women and four men mix biographical detail
with the comedy. There emerges a gentle idealism. This is less apparent in
the innocent political mockery of 'There's a hole in my budget' than the
ironic self-congratulation of countryside polluters ('The Bedstead Men') and
the exhaustingly dedicated modishness of 'Design for Living' ('We're
terribly House and Garden').
Above all, there are the animals. The well-loved hippo of 'Mud' and the gnu
of course, but more interestingly the wistful, the lonely and the yearning.
Susie Blake adds a Chekhovian dimension to her musings on what she might
have done if she hadn't been a sloth, hanging upside-down. And I had
forgotten the extraordinary, sad surrealism of 'The Armadillo', a fey
tragi-comedy worthy of Edward Lear.
Of the big set pieces, Stefan Bednarczyk displays extraordinary
breath-control in the famous Mozartian 'Ill Wind' ('I bought a French horn .
. .'); and in 'Los Olvidados' Moray Watson describes the olive-stuffing
festival in terms of the bull-fight with a serious sense of the ridiculous
that almost disguises its contempt for the corrida. You realise that quite a
lot of satirical edge can be blunted by cheerful humour. Perhaps Flanders
and Swann were too nice.

It is some indication of the credulousness of the human race that a man
should be selected as the subject of a half hour programme because he does
not believe in the supernatural. Richard Dawkins, follower of Darwin and
author of 'The Selfish Gene' and 'The Blind Watchmaker", is interviewed by
Sheena McDonald in The Vision Thing (8.00 C4). It is widely agreed that
religious beliefs should be respected and never attacked or ridiculed, but
Dawkins is not only an atheist, he also regards religion as downright
dangerous; hardly a surprising attitude when you consider the results of
religious fervour from Palestine to Pakistan, from Christianity's
Inquisition to Islam's fatwah on Salman Rushdie. It sounds as though Frank
Stubbs is becoming remarkably politically correct in the last episode of the
present series (9.00 ITV). He sets up a campaign to save a young Chinese
girl from deportation and, when she is threatened by racists, turns them
against the Home Office official. Panorama investigates the way in which
people are now obliged to resort to private landlords (9.30 BBC1).

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Albert Dunlap, turnround expert and long-time associate of Sir James
Goldsmith, is anything but a paper tiger, writes Laurie Morse. A qualified
paratrooper trained at the US Military Academy at West Point, Dunlap has
made a career out of setting companies right, regardless of the waste laid
round him in terms of jobs lost and divisions decimated.
He has been described most clearly as a shark, and was once quoted in an
interview as saying emotions have no place in business. His dispassionate
hand is credited with pulling Lily-Tulip from the brink of collapse, and was
employed by Sir James in the turnround of Diamond International and
Crown-Zellerbach. He remains on the board of Sir James' General Oriental
Investments, and recently returned to the US from Australia, where he was
ceo of Consolidated Press Holdings.
In April, Dunlap landed in the chairman's seat of Philadelphia-based Scott
Paper, where he is already ripping away at the soft underbelly of its tissue
paper business. When he arrived, Scott was embarking on an aggressive
restructuring that would have cut 8,300 jobs over a period of two to three
years. Dunlap quickly modified that plan, boosting the job cuts to 10,500 -
or about one-third of Scott's worldwide total - and accelerating it so as to
complete it by the end of this year. The restructuring is expected to net
Scott benefits in excess of Dollars 400m.

FT  15 AUG 94 / People (Names in the News): Pascale's rapid rise up the line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent reshuffle at Italy's state holding companies has seen Ernesto
Pascale promoted to the post of managing director of Stet, the
telecommunications holding company which should be privatised within the
next year, writes Andrew Hill.
Only three months ago, Pascale, 59, was named chairman and managing director
of Telecom Italia, the newly formed Stet subsidiary which groups together
all Italy's telecoms operating companies, including Sip, the domestic
operator where he had been chairman for the previous three years.
But then last month, Michele Tedeschi, Stet's managing director, was asked
to take over as chairman of Iri, the state holding company which is Stet's
parent. Pascale (below) has now stepped into Tedeschi's shoes, and will play
an important role - in tandem with Tedeschi - in the co-ordination of what
some analysts refer to as 'the mother of all Italian privatisations'.
Only the timing of Pascale's move was unexpected; otherwise the promotion
was in line with his steady rise through the Italian telecoms sector.
Pascale joined Stet in 1956 straight from university in Rome. He transferred
to Sip in 1977, and also worked for more than seven years as managing
director of Italcable - the telecoms company now part of Telecom Italia.
His combined chairman/managing director job at Telecom Italia has been split
between Umberto Silvestri, who took over as chairman earlier this month, and
Francesco Chirichigno, who has become managing director.

good

When the Prince of Wales, the heir to the British throne, holds his next
business leaders forum in Los Angeles in November, check who is at his
elbow, writes William Hall. Tucked away alongside the great and the good
from US blue chips such as American Express, Coca-Cola and Atlantic
Richfield is likely to be the relatively unknown heir to a family fortune
which is said to be many times bigger than that of Britain's royal family.
Ross Perot Jnr, 34, the only son of the self-made Texan billionaire who
spent Dollars 60m on running for US president in 1992, has joined the board
of the Prince's four-year-old Business Leaders Forum. Its mission is to
promote the practice of good corporate citizenship and sustainable
development internationally, as a natural part of successful business
operations.
Ross Perot Jnr's background is very different from that of his 64-year-old
father, who was the son of an East Texas horse-trader and started out as a
humble IBM computer salesman after he left the US Navy. He formed Electronic
Data Systems in 1962 and sold it to General Motors in 1984 for Dollars 1bn.
Perot Snr, said to be worth Dollars 2.4bn, remains one of the most colourful
business tycoons in the US.
His son, by contrast, has a much more conventional background. After leaving
the US Air Force, he joined the family business and now owns and runs the
Dallas-based Hillwood Development Corporation. It develops and manages
mixed-use residential and commercial real estate in 15 US cities and has
23,000 acres under development. It has also worked with 20 or so big
corporations on infrastructure projects to revitalise South Dallas.
The Prince's advisers hope that Perot Jnr will use his experience to help
champion sustainable development in urban areas which might be relevant on a
wider scale in countries like China.
Perot's involvement with the Prince of Wales's Business Leaders Forum is yet
another sign that he is starting to make his own mark in business. Last
year, he acquired another status symbol when he bought the Circle T ranch,
once the weekend retreat of Nelson Bunker Hunt, the fallen oil and silver
billionaire.
As the late Armand Hammer, the founder of Occidental Petroleum, realised,
being seen rubbing shoulders with the future King of England is good for
business.

FT  15 AUG 94 / People: The colonial comes home - The challenge facing Nigel
Rich at Trafalgar House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES and LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Nigel Rich arrives at his desk as chief executive of Trafalgar House
this morning he will be facing the greatest challenge of his career.
It is not the most obvious promotion to move from the helm of Jardine
Matheson, the Hong-Kong conglomerate with a market capitalisation of Pounds
3.92bn a year, to run Trafalgar House, an ailing British group with a market
value of Pounds 1.5bn.
Jardine Matheson enjoyed five years of profits growth under his leadership.
But running Jardine is a very different task from turning Trafalgar round.
Jardine's main difficulties during his reign centred on the uncertainty
created by the transfer of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The
group's own politics are dictated by the London-based Keswick family, which
exerts a control over the group belied by its stake of less than 10 per
cent.
Jardine controls a myriad of South East Asian businesses, but the Keswicks
have long been concerned about the political risks inherent in the 1997
hand-over of Hong Kong.
In 1984 they took the highly controversial step of moving Jardine's domicile
from Hong Kong to Bermuda, and ten years later the company decided to move
its stock market listing to London.
The purchase of an initial 15 per cent stake in Trafalgar in October 1992
was another step in the group's perceived move away from the colony.
Hongkong Land, the Jardine property arm, now owns 29.6 per cent of
Trafalgar, and has invested more than Pounds 300m to buy the stake.
Trafalgar was intended as a route by which Hong Kong profits could be
channelled into a troubled conglomerate which it was intended would recover
with the turn in the British economic cycle.
Early hopes have not been fulfilled. Trafalgar's problems have been far
worse than the Keswicks expected and Rich is being asked not only to restore
the group's profitability but also the family's reputation. For Rich, thus
far, has been very much the Keswicks' man.
The switch will be a culture shock for him. He is leaving the cosy club
atmosphere of Hong Kong's business community, where he sat at the helm of
two of the colony's three most powerful institutions - Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai
Bank, where he was a director, and the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club, where he
served on the board of stewards.
He will also have to give up the Hong Kong races, a central feature of the
colony's corporate life. Together with Paul Selway-Swift, a friend and
director of Hongkong Bank, he owns a horse called Rock'n'Reel and has
ambitions to own more.
But in fulfilling a long-standing desire to return to the UK he is set to
become a member of an even more exclusive club, the Jardine group's UK-based
strategic core. This comprises brothers Simon and Henry Keswick, who
alternate as Jardine Chairman, and Rodney Leach, a long time adviser and
fellow director who is a former Rothschild's banker.
Born in Somerset, but a self-avowed Scotsman, Rich, now 49, went to Sedbergh
School and New College, Oxford, before training as an accountant.
He joined Jardine in 1974, aged 29. Armed with his Scottish background -
Scottish culture is a strong feature of corporate Hong Kong - he spent 20
years as the archetypal colonial corporate man, operating from the various
outposts of Jardine's Asian empire.
He ran the group's businesses in the Philippines, the majority of which were
acquired in the early 1970s through the takeover of Theo H. Davies, the
sugar and trading group previously owned by the family of his wife Cynthia.
He first rose to prominence within Jardine in 1983 when he became finance
director of Hongkong Land, the colony's leading property investment and
development company, which was then teetering on the brink of collapse.
There he cemented his relationship with Simon Keswick, for whom he had
already worked as an assistant. Keswick had been rushed back to Hong Kong as
a hands-on non-executive chairman to protect the family interests in
Hongkong Land which had massively over-extended itself with HKDollars 13.5bn
of debt by the end of 1983 when property prices plummeted.
Rich's relationship with Simon flourished with the recovery of Hongkong
Land, which involved substantial lay-offs, asset disposals and refinancing,
masterminded by Rich and David Davies, the managing director. Rich's reward
was the post of chief executive three years later.
In 1989 he rose to the pin-nacle of the Jardine Matheson group as 'taipan'
where he became immersed in the political controversy which has dogged the
group since it decided to move to Bermuda. Since it had been the first
trading house formed in Hong Kong, the change of domicile by the so-called
'princely hong' drew harsh criticism from almost every quarter in the
colony.
During Rich's reign, the criticism escalated with Jardine's campaign to move
its primary listing to London, which culminated in the decision earlier this
year to quit the Hong Kong exchange altogether. All this and the Keswick
family's support of Governor Chris Patten's political reform plans, led to
Chinese accusations that Jardine was undermining the stability of the
colony.
Rich endeavoured to keep out of politics, and was seen as a strong business
manager, well respected by the senior management team in Jardine's broad
spread of businesses.
At Trafalgar, he will at least be able to focus entirely on business, but he
is certainly arriving at a time of crisis.
In May last year, Hongkong Land completed a boardroom purge with the removal
of Trafalgar's remaining old guard: Sir Nigel Broackes, the group's founder
and chairman, and Sir Eric Parker, the chief executive.
Insiders say it has lacked a sense of direction since. The company stated
that it wanted to focus on engineering and construction - businesses where
it is a world leader - but it failed to get acceptable prices for the hotel
and cruise line businesses it had wanted to sell.
A stated aim of winding down the group's property development and investment
businesses has also diminished. The recruitment of one of the city's leading
property men, Alan Winter, suggests that property will remain a focus.
Meanwhile, the economic recovery is yet to feed through to Trafalgar's
engineering arm, which made a further Pounds 15m of provisions last month,
in addition to the Pounds 397.3m exceptional losses taken by the group late
last year.
Rich will be expected to develop and communicate a new strategy and focus to
the somewhat demoralised employees. Already, analysts are increasingly
confident that profit margins in its construction and engineering division
have bottomed out following substantial cost-cutting and job losses.
However, the share price has scarcely risen above the 85p level at which
Hongkong Land launched its 'dawn raid' back in October 1992.
There must be those within the Jardine camp who would question the wisdom of
this investment. Rich has been brought in by the Keswicks to prove them
wrong.
He is not one to shirk a challenge. Last year he took part in one of Hong
Kong's more bizarre rituals, the annual MacLehose Trial, which involves
walking 100km of mountainous trails. The trail ahead with Trafalgar will be
equally arduous.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Media Futures: Banking on the multi-class of 94 - Victoria
Griffith explains why companies are making an interactive push into US
classrooms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US elementary and high schools are turning into key testing grounds for
multimedia products, as companies woo the young people they believe will one
day be their most important customers.
'The eight-year-olds of today are our future market,' says George
Schlukbier, director of new media for the News &amp; Observer Publishing
Company, which runs an on-line service to schools in North Carolina. 'The
information highway will come into full force a decade from now, when those
eight-year-olds will be entering the consumer market.'
Examples of this trend are many. Nynex, the telecommunications company,
offers an interactive voice and video hook-up which allows students to take
classes with a teacher in another school. Via computer, students in various
locations can be called on to answer questions. AT&amp;T is connecting high
schools with colleges interactively.
The publishing industry is also throwing its weight into the classroom. For
instance, Primis, a subsidiary of McGraw-Hill, is making custom-designed
textbooks via high-speed printing. Voyager has put out CD-Rom versions of
Shakespeare's Macbeth and other books, complete with text, video, and
annotations.
The media sector has also been especially active in the schools. Whittle
Communications runs a computer-linked cable news network to schools in the
US and hopes to move into the UK market soon. Newspapers like the San Jose
Mercury News, the Chicago Tribune, and the News &amp; Observer Company, which
publishes the Raleigh News &amp; Observer, all run on-line services to schools.
Meanwhile, Reuters, the UK-based wire service, has just launched Ingenius, a
joint venture with Liberty Media Corp, to provide a multimedia smorgasbord
of voice overs, photographs, videos, articles and interactive lesson plans.
Today's adults, many believe, are too set in their ways to become major
consumers of high-technology multimedia products. 'Older people will
probably stick to traditional sources like newspapers and nightly news
broadcasts for information, although they may dabble in multimedia,' says
Lewis Friedland, professor in journalism at the University of Wisconsin,
Madison. 'The market will be shaped by the kids who grow up using this
stuff.'
Linking up with schools to ensure a future customer base is not a new idea.
Apple Computer used the same strategy two decades ago when it handed out
thousands of computers to classrooms around the US.
Results, however, were mixed. Young adults today are far more
computer-literate than their elders, but that is probably more due to
contact they had with computers at home and work than at school. In many
cases, the computers Apple provided sat idle for years as teachers tried to
figure out how to use them, and how to incorporate them into their
curriculum.
'We won't have that problem, because programmes are getting easier to use,'
says Gerald Bennington, chief executive officer of Ingenius. Yet teacher
training remains a concern, and Ingenius has established a training
programme in Denver to encourage use of its product.
Ironically, the free Apples which brought schools into the computer age may
now slow the growth of multimedia in the classrooms. Most of the computers
in schools today are too basic, for instance, to run sophisticated on-line
programmes. 'Most schools are pretty out-dated,' says Schlukbier. 'Some
don't even include the Vietnam war in their textbooks. You have to work with
what you have, but it means we can't provide much in the way of CD-Rom film
for the computer and other new technologies.'
Companies are also struggling with pricing issues. The News &amp; Observer, for
instance, provides services at no charge in the hope of a long-term pay-off.
Whittle's Channel One is also free, but runs commercials on its network to
garner revenues. Nynex and Reuters, on the other hand, believe schools will
pay for a high-quality product. 'It's a myth that theschools don't have any
money,' says Bennington of Ingenius. 'It's one of the biggest budget items
in any state in the country.'
Once they get access to the classroom, multimedia news providers have to
grapple with the challenge of how to present violent stories to children. 'I
think the trick is to present a story like OJ Simpson (in which the
ex-football star is accused of murdering his ex-wife and her friend) in a
straightforward, non-sensationalist manner, then tie it to real life through
a discussion of domestic violence or learning activities, such as the study
of the US judicial system,' says Katherine King, editor-in-chief of
Ingenius.
Multimedia companies may also face opposition from educators who doubt the
value of the products. 'The studies we've done show that children don't
learn any more when they're connected to computers and multimedia products
than they do through traditional methods,' says Alex Molnar, professor of
education at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. 'There's also the
question of how to pay for it. US schools don't have lots of money, and if
they pay for these products, they have to cut down in other areas. And if
it's for free, like Channel One, but kids are subjected to advertisements,
that raises all sorts of questions about commercialising our classrooms.'
Despite the challenges, companies believe that a presence in the schools
today is essential to tap the future multimedia market.
For that reason, US classrooms are turning into one of the most important
laboratories for the industry.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Architecture: Sense and sensuality - Italian designer Ettore
Sottsass
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ettore Sottsass started at the sight of a woman walking by in a pretty pink
slip of a summer dress. 'Aaaaargh]' cried the septuagenarian designer with
an animalistic groan. 'Look at that girl] Just look at her] She's almost
naked]'
It is a testimony to how charming Sottsass can be that he can utter such an
unashamedly sexist remark without making you hate him. But Ettore Sottsass
has a great deal of charm indeed. At 76 he has the serene, sunny air of a
man who has spent his life doing, well, probably exactly what he wanted:
first as one of the bright young designers and architects who made waves in
post-war Italy and latterly as a grand old man of European design.
He has just arrived in Paris in his grandee guise to open a retrospective of
his work at the Pompidou Centre. He plays the role to perfection.
He stood smiling at his opening party, looking like a sci-fi sorcerer, with
his tightly-plaited ponytail, blowing air kisses at some guests and
autographing catalogues for others. Now he is sipping a chilled beer on a
cafe terrace opposite the Pompidou, ogling the Parisiennes as they saunter
into his show.
'It's strange to have a retrospective of your work while you're still
alive,' he says. 'At first I didn't like the idea at all. It made me feel
old and empty. It was as if I was dead and people were peering into my
grave.' How does he feel about it now? 'Sad, very sad. It's such a big
exhibition. So full of things. I look at it all and think what a waste. Why
did I spend so much time working? I should have spent more time living.'
Sottsass is not at all convincing when casting himself as a repentant
workaholic: particularly as he goes on to rattle off a list of the Chinese
houses, Sevre vases and other projects vying for space on his drawing board.
But the scale of his retrospective is undeniably impressive. It fills two
floors of the Pompidou Centre, covering his entire career from the workers'
houses he designed with Ettore Sottsass Snr, his architect father, in the
late 1940s, to the post-modernist playpens he has been creating for his
wealthy Japanese clients in the early 1990s.
The exhibition might begin and end with his buildings, but Sottsass has been
most influential as an industrial designer and it is his designs that steal
the show. He dabbled in fine art and architecture during the late 1940s when
he returned to Italy from the Sarajevo prison camp where he spent most of
the War. But his interest in design was kindled by a 1956 trip to the US,
where he worked with George Nelson, one of the most innovative furniture
designers of the era.
Sottsass's timing was perfect. The Italian companies of the 1950s saw design
as an essential tool with which to establish themselves in the international
market. They were eager to tap the talents of Sottsass and his fellow
designers - Vico Magistretti, Marco Zanuso and the Castigilioni brothers.
Sottsass was snapped up in 1958 by Olivetti, the electronics giant, to work
as artistic director alongside Roberto Olivetti, the founder's son.
Olivetti was then making the transition from mechanics to electronics. 'It
was an era of great change,' says Sottsass. 'Some people in the company
tried to resist those changes and mistakes were made. But it was an exciting
time.' It was also a period that produced some of his best work, when he
reinterpreted the ideas of the 1960s pop artists - Roy Lichtenstein and Andy
Warhol, whom he had befriended on his trips back to the US - into
typewriters and calculators.
One of his most popular products for Olivetti was the Valentine, a pretty
red portable typewriter that he designed in 1969. Sottsass now says that he
never really liked it. 'It's too obvious,' he pouts. 'It's a bit like a girl
wearing a very short skirt and too much make-up. It's a perfect piece of
marketing. After the Valentine I told Roberto that I'd only do office
machines.'
He feels happier about another high-profile project - Memphis, the group of
furniture designers, including Michele de Lucchi and Robert Graves, with
which he collaborated in the early-1980s. Memphis shared the same bright
colours and bold forms as Sottsass's 1960s and 1970s furniture. But he was
then seen as something of an iconoclast, whereas Memphis was absolutely in
tune with its time. It provided the media with a very photogenic form of the
post-modernist theories, then fashionable in academic circles. 'Memphis
really meant something,' says Sottsass. 'It was clear and uncompromising.
That's why it was important at the time and why it still pleases me today.'
Memphis was also one of the clearest expressions of Sottsass's own ideology.
He owes his importance as a designer partly to his direct influence over
younger collaborators and partly to his indirect influence over others,
notably Philippe Starck, as one of the intellectual 'guerrillas', whose
ideas helped liberate post-war design from the tyranny of Bauhaus austerity.
'When I was young all we ever heard about was functionalism, functionalism,
functionalism,' he says. 'It's not enough. Design should also be sensual and
exciting: something that is really challenging.'
The least successful aspect of the Pompidou retrospective is its attempt to
express the theoretical side of Sottsass's work by displaying his
photographs with accompanying essays. Some of the photography works, such as
the 'Design for the Rights of Man' series of still lives that he took in the
early 1970s and which even today are scathing satires on conspicuous
consumption.
Yet the random snaps of trees or doors are of no more than passing interest.
And the entire exhibition would be better off without the post-coital shots
of hotel beds recently rumpled by the great designer. 'I really wish I
hadn't looked at those pictures now,' winced one young visitor after reading
the explanatory text. Perhaps she should have taken heed of the title
Sottsass had given to one of his latest glass pieces - the Naomi Campbell.
The Ettore Sottsass retrospective is on show at the Georges Pompidou Centre,
Paris until September 5.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Media Futures: Indonesia's fixed cellular revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A revolution waiting to happen in the telecommunications industry is the
development of radio-based local networks able fully to replace the fixed
wire. When it happens, the cost of building and maintaining local
connections could plummet, with incalculable consequences for competition
and the extension of telecoms in developing countries.
Like many revolutions, it is unlikely to happen overnight. Radio technology
is already integral to telecoms, notably in cellular mobile telephony.
Imminent is the development of local radio networks for 'fixed' telephones,
which are price competitive with existing wireline networks.
In the developed world, such networks are likely to be feature mainly in
niche markets. Telia, Sweden's state telecoms company, already provides many
of its remote rural subscribers with cellular phones instead of 'wireline'
connections. Ionica, a private UK operator, plans to launch a nationwide
service next year to closely targetted markets.
Indonesia, however, may offer a significant pointer for the developing
world. Indonesia boasts 16 telephone lines per 1,000 people, compared with
460 per 1,000 in the UK. This puts it towards the bottom of the telephony
league, even in the Asia-Pacific region. To help achieve rapid line growth
the Indonesian government has licensed a company to build a 'fixed cellular'
network in urban areas.
The network is for fixed phones serviced by radio base stations. Connection
and call charges will be the same as for conventional fixed-line phones, but
the monthly rental will be at a premium to reflect the shorter waiting
period for connection. It currently takes about two years to get a phone
line: Ratelindo, the new fixed cellular operator, claims it will be able to
meet demand within months.
Ratelindo, a joint venture between Indonesia's state-owned telecoms operator
and Bakrie Electronics, a private company, is licensed to provide 280,000
fixed cellular connections - 250,000 in Jakarta and 30,000 in West Java. In
effect it is competing with the state operator, and hopes to have made
50,000 connections by the end of the year.
Ratelindo's fixed cellular system - supplied by Hughes, a US manufacturer -
is a flexible overlay network based on the TDMA system. Ratelindo claims
that it provides a voice quality equal to that of a fixed-wire phone.
Hardianto Kamarga, president-director of Ratelindo, hails the Hughes system
as a breakthrough. He claims it is 'the most spectrum efficient digital
cellular technology commercially available today,' with about three times
the capacity - that is subscribers per base station - of GSM, the digital
cellular mobile system used in Europe.
'The fixed cellular system has a subscriber capacity equal to between 10 and
20 per cent of the fixed network,' says Kamarga. As for the cost: 'land-line
telephones are inherently less expensive than comparable wireless systems
for the same traffic capacity, but in the operating environment we have in
Indonesia the balance can swing in favour of wireless.'
Put bluntly, that means a price-competitive service can be provided because
of the inefficiency of the existing state operator. Yet the same is likely
to be true across the developing world.
For 280,000 Indonesians, the immediate choice is a fixed cellular phone or
nothing. Faced with the same choice, millions on waiting lists across Asia,
Africa and Latin America may embrace fixed cellular phones with alacrity.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Media Futures: System to block fraud on stolen mobile phones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hot weather invites open car windows and sunroofs. Sadly, natural
ventilation also makes it simple for the thief to make off with the car
owner's mobile phone.
When other kinds of portable phone thefts are added in, the numbers become
startling; the Federation of Communication Services estimates around 15,000
phones are stolen each month in the UK alone.
The Metropolitan Police has set up a special unit to tackle the problem.
Portable phones can be 'hot' in more than one way, however. More insidious
than the hand through the sunroof is electronic fiddling with the phone's
identity, making it possible for a fraudster to run up huge telephone bills
which are then charged to somebody else's account. The phone does not have
to be stolen; a legally purchased phone can be altered so that calls made on
it are charged elsewhere.
Called 'rechipping', changing the electrical identity of a cellular phone is
not illegal in the UK, although the FCS is calling for urgent changes in the
law to act as a deterrent.
The problem is more acute for earlier analogue phones than the more recent
digital versions. Now the Dutch telephone authority has developed a
technology which it suggests is one way to solve the problem. The Anglo
Dutch computer services company CMG has recently installed the system in
Scandinavia where the mobile phone systems are linked. In the UK and
Scandinavia, it seems that mobile phones are recognised by a registration
number rather than an electronic identity check.
The essential difficulty is that there are perfectly good reasons why a
mobile phone may need to be programmed with a new registration so the
manufacturers leave open an electronic channel to the heart of the system.
Fraudsters take advantage of this channel to create 'clones' of existing
phones. The genuine subscriber only realises what is going on when a huge
bill arrives.
The operator closes down both genuine phone and clone but by then, of
course, the fraudster has moved on. The Dutch solution makes use of secret
keys stored both in the phone - either a microchip or smart card - and in
the local exchange. A system of linked computers manages the distribution of
the keys. If an exchange identifies a phone as genuine, it allows the call;
otherwise use of the phone is blocked. If the subscriber is 'roaming' or
using the phone outside the local exchange area, key information is
transmitted over the network to identify the phone.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Cancellations at Glasgow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There has been bad news for users of transatlantic air services from
Scotland in the past few weeks. First, American Airlines announced that its
daily service from Glasgow to Chicago would in future only operate in the
summer. Flights would finish this year on November 2.
Next, Northwest Airlines said it was ending its daily Glasgow-Boston service
altogether on October 25, after flying from Scotland for 14 years.
These decisions reverse the gradual expansion of transatlantic services from
Glasgow that began in 1990, when the government stopped forcing
intercontinental flights to use Prestwick airport, 30 miles south-east of
Glasgow. At that time, American Airlines and British Airways, which had
refused to use Prestwick, launched services from Glasgow, with American
flying daily to Chicago and BA three times a week to New York. Northwest and
Air Canada moved to Glasgow from Prestwick, and last year United Airlines
began flying daily from Washington DC.
Aviation specialists believe the latest decisions to cancel flights reflect
airlines' determination to improve returns on their assets rather than seek
market share. American Airlines complained that, while summer holiday
traffic was good, there were not enough year-round business travellers to
give a satisfactory yield per seat and make the service profitable overall.
Northwest also blamed low yields, and claimed there was excess capacity on
transatlantic routes from Glasgow.
One difficulty is that business or first-class passengers do not necessarily
want to fly from their local airport. The convenience is offset by the fact
that there are a much greater number of transatlantic services from London's
Heathrow and Gatwick airports, giving passengers a range of options in case
of delay or cancellation. And many of these flights go direct to the
traveller's ultimate North American destination.
Mr Bob Buntin, Northwest's general manager for Scotland, says that its
Glasgow flights have had good capacity utilisation, but claims this is only
because fares are low. 'We have been trapped for some time at the low end of
the market,' he says.
BAA, which runs Glasgow airport, hopes to persuade the remaining year-round
transatlantic carriers, United, Air Canada and British Airways, to increase
their services to take up any slack. British Airways says it will increase
its frequency to New York from four flights a week to five, probably from
January.

At least 15 people were killed and 30 injured when a passenger train crashed
into a stationary freight train just outside the Georgian capital, Tbilisi,
after a signalling error, railway officials said yesterday.
Guguly Mayduradze, deputy director of the Georgian railways, said the likely
cause of the accident was a mistake by station staff who failed to check
whether the track was free before allowing the passenger train to proceed.

Audrey Coutinho, 34, said she would file a suit against the airline

A flight attendant who gives birth to a third child must resign under the

FT  15 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Suite-talking the guests - A type of US
hotel that offers more space
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Travellers to the US who need their hotel rooms to double as offices or
showrooms, but who do not want to pay an excessive price for the privilege,
are increasingly checking into all-suite hotels.
Launched in the US 10 years ago, these hotels typically offer a sitting room
as well as a bedroom, and usually include full breakfast in the price. The
price of a suite is generally only slightly above that of standard rooms in
comparable hotels in the same neighbourhood.
Average daily rates for a suite in an upmarket hotel were about Dollars 97
in the first quarter of this year, according to Ernst &amp; Young, the
consultancy. For an extended stay, the average rate falls to about Dollars
75 a day.
'Suites give travellers a bigger space for about the same price,' says Mr
Steve Porter, marketing manager for Promus Corp's Embassy Suites, the
largest all-suite hotel chain in the US. Not only are the rooms larger, the
hotels are generally smaller, and built around a courtyard or atrium to give
guests a more relaxed, residential atmosphere, Mr Porter says.
There are 16 major all-suite hotel chains in the US, many of them operated
by well-known hoteliers, such as Marriott, Promus Corp and Radisson. While
US hotel construction has stagnated recently for lack of financing,
all-suite properties are expanding, particularly hotels catering to the
needs of travellers who stay four nights or more.
These hotels often offer laundry and shopping services, and suites are
equipped with small but functional kitchens. At the best chains, a guest
enjoys the equivalent of a well-equipped, one-bedroom apartment for less
than Dollars 100 a night.
Marriott operates Residence Inns, the largest and most successful
extended-stay chain in the US. Homewood Suites, run by Promus Corp, won top
billing for overall customer satisfaction in a recent all-suites hotel
survey by Consumer Reports Magazine.
Experienced travellers say that, in addition to more space and a convenient
breakfast, the all-suites hotels have two other winning features: location
and consistently good quality. Because they tend to be newer properties,
they are usually in better shape and have more modern equipment than older,
full-service hotels.
Built with business travellers in mind, all-suite properties are usually
located in suburban areas near interstate highways or big airports.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Flights to the land of Nod - Rival
airlines' sleeper services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE BEVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It almost seems a shame to go to sleep if your company has forked out for
you to fly first class. There are fine wines, good food and all the latest
movies to be sampled.
But many people find the best preparation for a business trip is a good
sleep on the aircraft - so British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have launched
rival sleeper services.
British Airways began what it calls its 'dream service' for first-class
passengers on some overnight flights last year. It has since expanded the
service to the Middle East and some destinations in Africa, as well as
transatlantic routes from the US east coast and Toronto, Canada.
Virgin Atlantic launched its 'Snoozzone' on flights from the US and to Hong
Kong and Tokyo from London.
The two services are similar in concept. On some flights passengers have a
choice of a meal at the airport - the best are in New York - or a light meal
on the flight. Once on board, passengers are given a cotton tracksuit and
the seats are made up into the closest thing to a bed the airlines can
manage, with a duvet and pillow. BA's final touch is a mug of hot chocolate
and cookies before all the cabin lights are turned out.
The main difference is in price. The British Airways one-way fare of Pounds
1,974 from New York's John F Kennedy airport to London compares with
Virgin's one-way weekday fare of Pounds 1,082 from New York. Virgin's price
is lower mainly because it has done away with the first-class/business-class
distinction in favour of what it calls Upper Class.
BA's first-class cabin is smaller and quieter than Virgin's. BA sleeps 16 in
first class on a 747 and 10 in a 767, while Virgin has 28 Upper Class seats
on A340 aircraft and 30 on its 747 fleet. On Virgin, dinner carts serving
non-snoozing passengers may clatter around for a while after take-off.
Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong carrier, also offers a sleeper service in
business class three times a week. After a meal before take-off, passengers
are given a kimono-style dressing gown, blankets and pillows. Cathay tries
to split those who opt for full service from those who want to sleep.
Even people who find it difficult to sleep in aircraft should manage a bit
more than 40 winks on such sleeper flights. The only thing missing, as one
passenger said on a flight from Washington DC to London, is a teddy bear.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Working Life: Dentist in the house - Health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Going to the dentist is probably on most people's list of least favourite
things to do. The thought of giving up as much as a day's work to commute to
a dental surgery, on top of hated drillings and fluoride treatments, means
many employees may never make it to get their teeth cleaned by a dentist.
The cumulative cost of their eventual visits to the dentist can be very
large.
To encourage employees to keep up their dental health, about 30 large
companies in the UK, including Glaxo, Marks and Spencer, ICI and National
Power - as well as the Bank of England - now provide dental services for
their staff.
These services range from contracts with National Health Service dentists to
comprehensive in-house programmes with independent dental surgeons.
According to Leslie Kaye, dental surgeon for Glaxo Research and Development
and Glaxo Holdings, the company's in-house dental service saves up to 2,000
days of work because employees do not need to take time off to travel to see
a dentist.
At Glaxo R &amp; D's site in Greenford, Middlesex, Kaye, a hygienist and two
dental surgery assistants regularly see 1,600 patients from the company's
staff. They also provide services to 800 more employees from Glaxo's site in
Ware. About 60 per cent of Glaxo R &amp; D and Glaxo Holdings' staff use the
on-site dental surgery.
Kaye is a NHS dentist, although Glaxo is considering moving the dental
practice into the private sector. About 75 per cent of dentists working in
industry are still in the NHS, though Jo Freeman, senior dental surgeon at
Glaxo Pharmaceuticals in Stockley Park and president elect of the
Association of Industrial Dental Surgeons, says more companies are moving in
the direction of independent dental services.
At Glaxo R &amp; D and Holdings, the government pays for 20 per cent of any
dental service while each patient pays for 80 per cent. However, because the
company pays for its dental staff's salary, Kaye says he can spend more time
with each patient as he is not working for a fee. While the average
non-industry NHS dentist books about 40 appointments a day, Kaye only puts
about ten to 15 patients into the dental chair each day.
Glaxo subsidises the more expensive services, such as crowns and bridgework.
which an increasing number of NHS dentists do not provide. The dental
surgery also checks employees for oral cancer as part of the company's
general health screening programme.
Kaye says that setting up an in-house service requires a relatively small
capital investment for ultimately high savings for the company. He estimated
that most of the necessary equipment for a dental surgery could be purchased
for about Pounds 25,000.
It is not just the large companies which can benefit from dental services.
He says dental programmes become cost effective once a company has 700
employees or more. Smaller companies in office blocks can combine to hire
one dentist.
A company interested in the upkeep of its staff's teeth should hire a
dentist who is willing to set up the service, rather than trying to
establish the service before bringing in a dentist to run it.
'Any time an opening comes up in industry, there is a very high demand for
the job,' says Kaye. 'Many dentists want to leave general practice. They
want to get out of the rat race.'

Downsizing joined the language as a management term in 1987, 20 years after
the related word downscale (and upscale) made its debut in advertising.
While downscale had to do with a reduction of inanimate things (operations,
fees), downsize is all about getting rid of people.
An organisation is downsized when it sheds employees. Middle management  -
by definition most managers - has suffered in the 1990s from delayering and
flattening, a vertical image of organisational structure which makes the
redundancies seem scientifically inevitable.
This is a less organic outlook than the 'leaner and fitter' images of the
1980s, or the less appealing pastoral image of 'dead wood' from the 1970s.
However, downsize is busy finding new employment for itself, trying out new
usages. It need not be about shrinking a workforce. It can mean shrinking a
company by getting rid of its workers, or reducing its technical
requirements: 'As they try to 'downsize' their computer systems from
mainframes to networks of PCs and high-powered computer workstations,
Japanese companies are desperate for advice.' (Economist, September 1993).
Managers can downsize their perks: 'Mercedes-Benz and BMW survived because
chairmen could 'downsize' to a 3-series or a 190.' (Times, April 1994).
Then in the 1990s came the PC term - in both senses - rightsizing, with a
ring of political correctness but which in computer terminology means
matching the solution to the job: 'Firms are embarked on a process the IT
industry calls 'downsizing' or 'rightsizing', shifting traditional IT tasks
away from yesterday's creaking leviathans on to the new, faster and cheaper
networks of modern computers.' (Sunday Times, February 94). Rightsizing with
personnel has an air of rectitude about it: a slim workforce rather than
slim workers.
The irony at the root of the -sizing words is that size comes from assize, a
13th century English word for the ordinance for payment of tax; in the 14th
century it became a fixed standard of food, and so sizeable was born and the
idea of quantity stayed with the word. Downsizing and rightsizing return to
the roots of the word size because they are bound up with cost.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Sport: Kick off kicks out summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the end of last week I opened a newspaper for a lazy, crickety read about
the possible recall of Mike Gatting for the Oval test. I found instead a
frantic, footballian debate about the resignation of Billy Bonds from the
manager's job at West Ham. I am not exaggerating when I say that this
depressed me a good deal. Surely, I found myself thinking, August is summer
and summer is cricket and, with all due respect, Billy Bonds is not somebody
that I want inside my head for at least another month.
Last weekend I had sat like a lotus-eater amid the desultory crowd at the
Headingley test match, steeped in the syrup of sloth. A bare week later I
find that the world has changed completely. It has become alert and brisk
and energetic, as if already trying to stave off the chill of winter.
Cricket, of course, is still with us. But its time has gone: really it is
already dead, a mere flicker of white ghosts upon a mirage of green,
trampled down into the memory by the great size 12 boots of football. It is
impossible, somehow, to give cricket the slow attention it deserves when one
is being harried and worried about whether or not Alan Shearer has
hepatitis. I know that darkness has begun to encroach upon summer evenings
and that the still air of July has been blown through with autumn. But do we
have to succumb so early? Must we relinquish so suddenly those gorgeous
images of sunlit grass to those of mud and grime?
I feel this strongly because I have, to paraphrase T S Eliot, measured up my
life in sporting events. At the merest mention of the boat race, for
example, I sense a fresh spring wind upon my face; the sight of those hefty
blazered boys tripping down to the river causes my year to flower. By the
day of the FA Cup final I am primed for summer, which is heralded by Derby
Day at Epsom and which seems to ripen, to burgeon with riches, as the
sporting occasions accumulate within it: Ascot, Wimbledon, Henley, Goodwood,
the Greyhound Derby, the test matches.
An ineffable melancholy attends the end of each of these events. Unlike the
football season, which seems to go on forever and then, having stopped at
last, seems to start again almost immediately, the summer sporting occasions
are essentially finite, fleeting things. Because of this, however bored I
might be by them when they're actually happening, I can never bear to lose
them.
I find myself enjoying those twinkly resume films, in which tennis players
hug line judges to the tune of 'Always look on the bright side of life.' I
watch the final trophy presentations with pleading eyes, as if silently
begging the protagonists not to leave me. After the World Cup Final I sat in
front of the rolling list of credits, staring stupefied and almost tearful
at the names of sound men and floor managers.
Ten years ago I would not have behaved in this way. Then I was of an age to
take delight in the reassuring recurrence of sporting events, without
feeling the need to slow down the inexorable cycle that they rode. Now,
however, I feel that, although the occasions are rolling around the same as
ever, I am growing a year older as they do so.
Because of this, a moment like Martina Navratilova's last exit from the
Centre Court takes on great poignancy. When she first appeared at Wimbledon,
I was a child; I have grown up in the years that she played there; now she
has gone, and she has taken my past with her.
Identifying thus strongly with the landmarks of the sporting year, it is
hardly surprising that I feel a pang when the football season starts, as if
a door has been closed upon the summer. With the World Cup barely over, this
season seems especially premature. Get that manly cabal of commentators, who
only last month were sweltering and pontificating their way across America,
off my screen. Give me Tony Lewis and Richie Benaud and the sense that the
year is eternally suspended at its still centre.
The worst thing of all is that I know how easily I shall give way, despite
having so far ignored every thing to do with football, even the signing of
bete blond Jurgen Klinsmann. I know that, like those women who stuff their
Christmas turkeys on the day they return from their summer holidays, I too
shall soon start wishing my year away, setting my face against the fading
sun and immersing myself in the twilight comfort of the Classified Football
Results.
The start of the football season implies an imminent relapse into a
different, winter life. After the sun and glamour-drenched theatricals of
summer, it feels like returning to Nescafe after a few brief weeks of Douwe
Egberts. It also feels inevitable. Football is reliably disappointing and
disappointingly reliable but, because of this, it has a substance, a proper
place in everyday life. I believe in it far more strongly than in those
precious summer events which, like many lovely things, live more in the
memory than in the reality.
Perhaps that is the true reason why I dread the start of the football
season: not because it says that the year is coming to an end, but because
it says that the year - by which I mean the real year, the tough cold
repetitive ordinary year - is about to begin.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Working Life: Paretsky fires a blank - Reading Matter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sara Paretsky is attempting to create a new genre of detective fiction: the
politically correct murder story.
Paretsky burst into the world of detective writing in the early 1980s with a
striking innovation - VI Warshawski - a hardened, likable woman private
detective tramping around Chicago.
In the early novels, Bitter Medicine, Deadlock and Burn Marks, Warshawski
was charming and credible, the plots were dense with detail and red
herrings.
But with her latest book, Tunnel Vision, something awful has happened to VI
Warshawski: she has become more important than the murder she is
investigating.
The point of the latest, very long book is the detective herself, not the
plot of murder, money laundering and political corruption she uncovers.
And that is not the only problem: the heroine's character has become
increasingly unappealing. VI Warshawski now seems to be shaped by what
appear to be Paretsky's political preferences rather than her reflections
upon Chicago life.
The book reeks of political correctness: there are women's building
co-operatives, exploited Romanian construction workers, a token black
boyfriend, child abuse, and homelessness.
Warshawski's behaviour is increasingly preposterous and many of the exploits
in which she displays her miraculous powers are incidental to the plot - a
thinly-built tale of a senator's company making illegal grain sales to Iraq
and laundering the proceeds through a local bank which some friends have
just bought.
Paretsky's decline is all the more striking when compared with the brooding
power of White Butterfly, the latest book from Walter Mosely, the rising
star of US detective fiction.
Tunnel Vision's self indulgence is capped with a sickly surprise birthday
party at which Warshawski is surrounded by droves of adoring friends, many
of them saved and reformed by their contact with the saintly detective.
The only absentee is the long-suffering black boyfriend Conrad. Earlier in
the story he gives Warshawski the elbow. On this showing readers should
probably follow suit.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Working Life: Both sides of using credit cards on holiday -
Finance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are yet to go on holiday and convenience is your byword, then a
credit card is the handiest way of taking cash abroad.
Apart from being easy to slip into a pocket, credit cards score because they
are usually better value than the alternatives. You should be able to buy
more goods and services using a credit card than other type of holiday
money.
Although the commission on credit card transactions tends to be heftier,
particularly for drawing cash, it is usually offset by a more favourable
exchange rate. The worst value is usually cash, which tends to have the most
unfavourable exchange rates, while travellers cheques and Eurocheques rate
roughly equally in terms of value.
However, depending on a single credit card as holiday cash can be unwise.
To begin with, credit cards are only readily acceptable in some countries in
Europe and the US.
You may find that although it is easy enough to pay a hotel or restaurant
bill in large cities, elsewhere smaller towns or shops may not accept them.
Even in continental Europe there may be problems. Germany prefers its own
bank cards. Different technology incorporated to beat fraud in cards issued
in France, means that British travellers may find their Visa cards rejected
or even swallowed by cash dispensers, automatic vending machines and stores.
Fraud can also be a nasty problem, as unscrupulous shop keepers or
restaurateurs can run off extra vouchers.
Before you leave home, make the supreme effort of finding and noting down
the issuer's emergency telephone number, along with your card number and
expiry date.
Most card issuers limit a customer's liability to Pounds 50 - the amount set
by the Consumer Credit Act.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Working Life: Customer service pitched just right - Eating
Out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the reasons why I decided not to go into the wine and restaurant
trade, after doing much of the early training, was a reaction to keeping up
the pretence that the customer is always right. The customer is quite often
wrong, as you will know if you have been a wine waiter and seen perfectly
decent wine turned back in order to show off, or had coffee rejected because
it is not decaffeinated, then returned to be congratulated for the speed of
the switch while bringing exactly the same coffee back.
There are two answers. One is to avoid restaurants whenever possible, except
on holiday. The other is never complain: if something is wrong, say nothing,
but don't go back. Above all, beware of familiarity. If the waiters start
fawning to you, it is time to move on. For the mark of a really good
restaurant is that you can drop in anonymously, even though it might be wise
to book.
Chez Gerard in London's Chancery Lane is a test case. It is one of the few
decent places conveniently situated between the City and Westminster and
takes in the lawyers on its doorstep. It has a reputation for being slightly
aloof; several women have told me that it does not take kindly to female
bookings. On the other hand, it has some of the best frites in London.
Last Thursday - the day after the night of the London rain - was a testing
time. Wet umbrellas and all, the place was packed even by the standards of
Chez Gerard.
The initial service was understandably slower than usual. Courteous French
efficiency, however, soon resumed. Fizzy water was quickly and quietly
exchanged for still. We learned in passing from a waiter - and without
interruption to the service - that the only place in London to go for
Belgian frites (which are the best of the lot) is a restaurant in Chalk
Farm.
The first courses - pate and cold duck - were excellent, and decently small.
Yet not everything was perfect. My colleague ordered steak tartare. This
really is a test case for a restaurant, but if the restaurant puts it on, it
must expect to be tested.
When it arrived, it looked a bit large to me, but my colleague demurred and
gamely set about it. She did not get through to the end but, having the
right instincts, would not have dreamed of complaining. She said merely to
me - and even then only when asked - that it was 'a bit chewy'.
A senior waiter noticed. He came to see if anything was wrong. The word
'chewy' was whispered. The waiter took away the steak tartare, returned to
say that he had had it examined in the kitchen, found that it was not up the
restaurant's best standards, and apologised. My colleague was offered
another course or a deduction from the bill. All that was done with the
minimum of fuss and without sycophancy.
We concluded that on a difficult day Chez Gerard had passed all the tests
without even knowing it was being tested. As London restaurants go, it is
not particularly expensive. You can eat well with wine for two for just
under Pounds 50, and if you take the fixed price menu the cost is lower
still.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Management: Desert island manager - Nick Temple
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nick Temple, 46, chairman of International Business Machines (UK) was its
chief executive from early 1992 until the middle of this year. It was the
computer giant's most troubled subsidiary. Temple lived up to his reputation
as a no-nonsense bruiser with a precision intellect, and turned the company
around. Rewarded with a bigger job - European general manager for the
finance industry - he thinks he would welcome a spell off the treadmill.
You are allowed one piece of equipment.
I would take my notebook computer. I use it all the time to write up notes,
briefings and ideas I have while I'm flying across the Atlantic on business
trips. It's also got games on it, like chess and backgammon, so that even if
I was on my own, I would be able to play.
How would you take to a solitary life?
I don't think I'd enjoy being on a desert island. I'm very much a social
animal and I like people around me.
What would you miss most?
I love the telephone. It keeps me in touch with what everyone else is doing,
and I can talk to people wherever and whenever. My mother - she's 90 - can't
quite grasp the idea that I don't have to be at a particular place to phone
me, but she's getting used to the idea.
And least?
I'd miss the television least. I rarely watch it. It just blasts away, and I
usually switch it off.
Could you operate as a long-distance manager?
I wouldn't find it difficult to manage my business remotely. I would
delegate to people I can trust. I have learnt the value of having people
around who I can rely on and who intuitively know what I would do in a given
situation.
You can take one film.
I'd like Hopscotch, a thriller-comedy starring Walter Matthau. I'm a great
fan of Matthau's and I enjoy a film with a few surprises that makes me
laugh. I like A Fish Called Wanda for the same reasons.
And one book.
I'd take Mad White Giant by the explorer and adventurer Benedict Allen. I
heard him speak at IBM's business convention in France last year, and have
great admiration for his courage. He is totally unconventional and an
entertaining speaker.
What would you eat and drink?
I'd eat fish, which I assume I'd have to catch myself. As I'm not terribly
good at fishing, perhaps I'd be allowed a stick of dynamite or two. I'd
drink Bourgogne - it's light, fruity and adaptable for all sorts of meals
and would be just right for the turbot I'd like to catch. A lot of my best
ideas are the result of a glass or two of Bourgogne.
Alas, no rescue in sight. What would be your epitaph?
I'd like to be remembered as a man who made things happen, who took little
notice of red tape and who brought enthusiasm and excitement into work. I'd
like to think I'd never be remembered as being boring.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Management: Dragon boats in contract race - Taiwan's ancient
sport has acquired a special dimension for civil engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sculpted ice model of a dragon-shaped boat dripped water from its
nostrils under the heat of spotlights at the Taipei Bankers Club.
The occasion was a reception held by Nuclear Electric, the UK's state-owned
nuclear power company, which had gathered its team of local contractors for
a progress report on what may be one of Britain's most lucrative civil
engineering exports - the construction of a Pounds 1.4bn nuclear power
station in Taiwan.
The reception and the model had been arranged around the Nuclear Electric
team's visit to compete in Taiwan's annual dragon boat races a few weeks
ago.
The roots of this sport, in which large canoe-like boats sprint frantically
against each other over a few hundred metres, go back to ancient China.
Today it is part of the sporting calendar in Taiwan, China and Hong Kong. In
India and Bangladesh, the vessels are called peacock boats, in Japan perion
boats.
Since the annual Hong Kong dragon boat festival introduced international
races in 1976, corporate teams and rowing clubs have developed the sport
across the globe; it is proving increasingly popular because of its
team-building qualities and the scope for sponsorship.
Nuclear Electric has advanced the concept, using its dragon boat team as
ambassadors for the company, both in the field of nuclear politics and in
the more subtle art of securing business in East Asia.
It was no coincidence that the dragon boat was in Taipei at the same time
that Taipower, the potential customer, was considering sealed bids for the
Lungmen Island nuclear power plant project at Yenliao, 40 miles north of
Taipei.
The British company crew could not directly influence the bid - one of three
submitted by worldwide consortia - but the feeling was that by demonstrating
its interest in Taiwanese sport, Nuclear Electric was helping to make its
presence felt more acutely in a difficult market for British companies.
The impact of dragon boat racing in East Asia should not be underestimated.
According to figures supplied by the British Dragon Boat Racing Association,
the sport has grown so large in China that 20m Chinese now compete.
Grandstands and a four-star hotel are being constructed at Yueyang, in
Hunan, the spiritual home of the sport and the site of its first official
world championships in June next year.
In the contract bidding, one of Nuclear Electric's problems has been that
nominally it is merely the principal sub-contractor in a bid headed by
Westinghouse, the US conglomerate. According to executives, Taipower was
against the submission of joint bids.
So the challenge has been to ensure that the Taiwanese are fully aware of
its contribution to what it considers is as much a European as a US bid,
while not disturbing its relationship with Westinghouse or its growing
understanding with Taipower. Rival consortia are led by Combustion
Engineering, a US subsidiary of ABB, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group,
and Framatome, of France.
Guy Stanton, a commercial services executive and, until a few weeks ago,
Nuclear Electric's only representative in Taiwan, is the man charged with
leading the delicate negotiations.
'My role has been to raise the profile of Nuclear Electric in a country that
had neither heard of the company nor of Sizewell B, the pressure water
reactor that we designed (in the UK) and which forms the basis of this bid,'
he explains.
'In Taiwanese eyes, we are a contractor, but it's critical that we have a
presence since it's our design that we are selling, and we have as big an
interest as Westinghouse in the project.'
While local contractors would be involved in much of the construction, the
deal, to build a power plant that, like Sizewell C, is double the capacity
of Sizewell B, would be worth Pounds 700m and 5,000 jobs for UK exporters,
almost equal to the whole of UK exports to the country in 1993. But the
British company is up against a French design, older but almost certainly
cheaper, and a US bid which is state of the art.
In commercial terms, the biggest obstacle may prove to be price, even
allowing for the series of industrial incentives for Taiwan built into the
Westinghouse/Nuclear Electric proposal.
Politics is also bound to play a part, however, since none of the nations
bidding for contracts officially recognises Taiwan. Each treads a diplomatic
tightrope.
Philip Morrice, director of the British Trade and Cultural Office, which has
a significant but discreet Foreign Office involvement, is the nearest the UK
has to an ambassador in Taipei.
He has only now succeeded in calming tensions caused by political
reservations and adverse UK press reactions to the Pounds 157m Hualon
textile group investment in Northern Ireland, supported by a Pounds 61m
grant from the UK public purse.
One of his chief roles is to promote the Westinghouse-Nuclear Electric power
station bid. One way to do so is to highlight the difficulties that have
emerged in Taiwan's biggest transport project, the French-built Mass Rapid
Transit System, still unfinished after problems with an untried rail car.
'It's the most expensive transport system in the world, with no passengers
as yet,' he says disparagingly.
The hope of the US-British team is that this will work to
Westinghouse-Nuclear Electric's advantage when the bidders stress the merits
of what they claim is a 'proven' power station design.
Perhaps the most complex area of all in a project of this size in Taiwan is
assessing the importance of guanxi, roughly translated as 'connections'.
'You cannot overestimate the significance of the political massaging that
goes on,' says one British businessman with years of experience in the
island.
In a country where the politics are anathema to the British way of business,
that may prove too great an obstacle. 'They tend to want visits by royalty
and recognition; the sort of things that, because of the political
situation, we cannot provide,' says one observer.
As one member of the Nuclear Electric party put it: 'If Britain was to
recognise Taiwan tomorrow the contract would be ours, but that is not going
to happen.'
Europeans who work in Taipei consider the tight-knit local business
community enormously difficult to penetrate.
Politically, the country remains sensitive to western opinion but it is
anxious to take advantage of the emerging economic strength of south Asia in
forging new business deals with the west.
In response to these challenges, Taiwan is working hard to shake off its
reputation for turning out cheap down-market products and its government has
been taking a tough line on counterfeiting.
Nor can business visitors avoid the political inertia that has developed
since the end of martial law in 1987. Getting things done is proving more
difficult.
In the midst of this political climate - the freer society has also led to
western-style anti-nuclear protests - the public relations value to Nuclear
Electric of spending Pounds 40,000 to send a 21-strong dragon boat team to
Taiwan is hard to gauge.
The event was certainly covered in newspapers and on television, which will
have taken the company's name into Taiwanese homes - especially since the
boat came fifth out of a field of more than 50.
The crew is philosophical about its impact on the power station bidding.
Most of its members would agree with the sentiments of Morrice, who said he
could not put his hand on his heart and declare that the Hartlepool crew
would win the contract for Nuclear Electric. But, as he said: 'It's a nice
gesture and certainly does no harm.'

FT  15 AUG 94 / Management: An arena for identifying team leaders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dragon boat racing is more than merely an East Asian promotional tool for
Nuclear Electric.
The crew's success has helped maintain morale in a company engaged in the
painful transition from the public to the private sector, while the sport
provides an opportunity for management to spot potential leaders.
Take Dave Price, the crew's captain, who is part of a change support team
which has been established to introduce new working practices at the
company's Hartlepool plant.
Chosen partly for his organisational abilities that emerged in the way he
ran a company football team, and most recently the dragon boat, he said:
'The management wanted people who were good at pulling teams together.'
Bill Shirra, formerly the Hartlepool plant's human resources manager and now
the company's career development manager at its Gloucester headquarters,
emphasises the team-building benefits of the sport.
'There was a time when people were expected to hang up their brains as they
walked through the door. That's all changed now. People are expected to
think about their jobs and take decisions for themselves.'
The foreman's job has been changed to that of team leader and the teams are
expected to be more self sufficient in areas such as budgets and personnel
decisions. Part of the changes, he said, had been to introduce skills
broadening, which entails training people to do 10 per cent of someone
else's. 'The idea, in its simplest terms, is that you should no longer need
to get an electrician to put a plug on,' he said.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Management: Lemmings leap to adopt 'just in time'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The pattern is always the same. Somebody comes up with a management idea. A
few companies try it out, and great claims are made for it. Packed
conferences are held and consultancies multiply and prosper. More companies
follow until everyone is doing it and swearing by it. Then some clever dick
does research showing this marvellous practice is not delivering the goods.
The believers behave as if an act of sacrilege has been committed, yet the
fall from grace has begun. A new idea soon comes along to renew the process.
We saw it with total quality management. Now we are seeing it with Japanese
lean production techniques such as 'just in time'.
Last week academics at Cambridge University published a shock-horror study
suggesting that lean production can damage a company's financial health. Now
Britain's JIT fanatics are all angrily defending themselves.
The cycles are inevitable because companies behave like lemmings. Each new
idea - TQM, JIT and all the rest - has some intrinsic worth. Yet managers
apply these systems willy nilly to their operations, urged on by their peers
and by greedy consultants.
To judge by the JIT cycle, about four years is par for the course between
mass adoption and doubts setting in. In another year or so, re-engineering
and benchmarking - which all but the very smartest and the very dumbest
companies now espouse - will take their turn.
Looking through the papers for bargain flights, my eye was caught by some
remarkably cheap deals: Hong Kong for only Pounds 250, Panama for only
Pounds 265. On closer inspection I found I was looking at offshore company
bucket shops noisily comparing prices for buying companies in tax-free
paradise.
Curious, I sent off for the details and received what looked like holiday
brochures, full of photos of traditional Chinese junks, the Rock of
Gibraltar and - less enticing - of Belize's Philip SW Goldston airport.
As there is no question of the clients actually visiting any of these
places, it is hard to see why the companies bother with pictures. For about
Pounds 500 a year, the offshore specialists will supply names of directors,
phone numbers, addresses and anything else to create the veneer of a company
that doesn't exist.
What surprised me about the brochures is how simple the business of tax
avoidance is. All you need is to fill in a form (slightly shorter than the
one I have just completed to join my local library), choose a country, pick
a company from off the shelf, supply your credit card number and you are
ready to go. It is easier than booking a holiday - and marginally cheaper,
too.
What does it mean for a company to have a woman on its board? Does it mean
it is a forward-looking non-discriminatory employer? Possibly. More
certainly it means the company is statistically less likely to go bust than
those where the board is entirely male.
CCN Business Information, the credit analysis company, has found that women
are more unlikely to be involved in companies that fail and 50 per cent less
likely to have a disgraceful string of corporate disasters behind them. That
was only as I had suspected: women are simply the more honest and have
superior judgment, too.
Unfortunately, the real explanation seems to be otherwise. Nearly one third
of the 1m directors of British companies are women, but most of these are
the wives of men who have started their own business. Usually a second
mortgage on the house is part of the package, and these sorts of family
businesses are usually not those that are going to be involved in the latest
fraudulent scam.
A few months ago my one-year-old daughter received a letter claiming that a
fine collection of books could be hers. All she need do was send a book to
the child named in the letter, copy the letter and send it on to six of her
friends. In due course she would be sent six lovely packages containing
books.
I was reminded of this letter as I read about the pyramid schemes that have
been causing investors so much grief from Russia to Japan to the UK.
The popular belief is that the poor suckers involved are either new to
capitalism or pathetically naive.
My daughter's chain letter suggests otherwise. It came from a financially
sophisticated acquaintance who has enough money to buy her son a whole
library of books.
She knew, and the parents of all the recipients would have known, that chain
letters and pyramid schemes are a con. Yet she was prepared to excuse
herself with a lot of middle-class claptrap about promoting reading. The
idea of something for nothing seems to be deeply rooted, and people who
should know better are not only espousing it but passing it on to their
children.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Banks 'see value of private investors'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Extensive branch networks are contributing to retail banks' ability to
benefit from the increase in the number of private individuals with large
amounts of money to invest, says a study by Datamonitor, the market research
group.
In an increasingly competitive market, Barclays, National Westminster -
which owns Coutts - Midland and Lloyds between them accounted for more than
one-fifth of the Pounds 66bn of high net worth liquid assets managed last
year.
The report says that in a market where the types of product available are
beginning to polarise between high and low levels of client involvement, the
high-street banks are able to offer both options, where others, such as
merchant banks or stockbrokers, have narrower capacities.
The banks' extensive branch networks and traditional expertise mean that
they are suited to offering both 'deposit account' services and
'stockbroker' style facilities, the report says.
Although the number of 'high net worth individuals' - classified for this
report as people with more than Pounds 50,000 in liquid assets - is rising,
the main result of the growing number of products on offer has been that
competition has intensified.
Lloyds Bank has had a private banking arm since 1985, but other large banks
took longer to enter the market. Midland, the most recent arrival, joined
earlier this year.
The report says the number of high net worth individuals is estimated at
1.2m and is increasing by about 5.5 per cent each year.
It divides them into four main groups: expatriates and entrepreneurs, who
are more likely to want the cheaper services in which they have greater
involvement, and people who are elderly or who have inherited money, who are
likely to prefer the fuller but more expensive services.
The first two types are experiencing high rates of growth in total value,
while the group of older people is so large that it accounts for 45 per cent
of all the Pounds 136bn in liquid assets held by high net worth individuals
in the UK.
Datamonitor estimates that of the Pounds 136bn, Pounds 53bn was held by
individuals with liquid assets of Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 100,000.
Some of these would generally fall outside the criteria for private banking
facilities offered by some institutions, but the banks are increasingly
conscious of the benefits of generating fee income from wealthier clients.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Police give last-minute go-ahead to Ulster march
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A republican demonstration in Belfast to mark the 25th anniversary of the
deployment of British troops in Ulster passed off without incident yesterday
after police took a last-minute decision to allow it to go ahead in spite of
fears of clashes with loyalist supporters.
Thousands of republicans converged on City Hall where Mr Gerry Adams,
president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, said he remained
confident that a peace settlement was attainable, although he warned that
the next steps would be 'difficult and dangerous'. He refused to be drawn on
the possibility of an autumn ceasefire by the IRA but said he was serving
the security forces with 'redundancy notices'.
He appealed to unionist leaders to enter negotiations for a political
settlement 'which would have the allegiance and consent of all'.
A Protestant gospel meeting at the City Hall at the same time was called off
after the Royal Ulster Constabulary refused to allow the two meetings to
take place simultaneously.
The annual march by the Protestant Apprentice Boys in Derry on Saturday also
passed off without incident. It was this march 25 years ago which triggered
two days of riots which brought about the deployment of troops.
Police allowed the marchers to walk along a section of the city's ancient
walls for the first time in 25 years.
Yesterday's republican marches also marked the 23rd anniversary of the
introduction of internment without trial in August 1971.
IRA units marked the anniversaries by planting two bombs in holiday resorts
in the south of England. One bomb exploded in the shopping centre of Bognor
Regis, West Sussex, on Saturday evening. A second bomb found under a pier at
Brighton, East Sussex, was defused.
No casualties were reported but considerable damage was done to shopfronts
in Bognor Regis.
The bombs were hidden in panniers on mountain bikes - the first time on the
mainland that bicycles have been used to conceal bombs, both of which were
'big enough to maim and kill', police said.
Police said they hoped holidaymakers taking photographs or videos might be
able to help their search with footage of the bombs being planted on
Saturday.
Police also checked security videos from shops in Bognor Regis town centre
and appealed for help from companies hiring bicycles.
Numbers painted on both bicycles and the locks were 'similar to those which
would be issued by bicycle hire companies,' police added.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Spot lights way to futures: Deborah Hargreaves looks at
prospects for the development of a gas contract on the London commodity
exchanges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The creation of a gas spot market in the UK could be the forerunner of a
futures contract on one of the London commodity exchanges. It would be
traded in the same way as natural gas futures in New York, where gas
distribution was deregulated more than 10 years ago.
Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank which has proposed a structure for a
wide-ranging daily spot market, set up Natural Gas Clearing House in the US
10 years ago. Natural Gas Clearing House, in which British Gas owns a 30 per
cent stake, has evolved into the largest independent gas trader in the US.
A spot market could be organised by Natural Gas Clearing House or another
market operator such as London's International Petroleum Exchange. Once the
market structure was agreed the industry would put out to tender a contract
for running the market.
The reason for setting up a daily market is the need to ensure that gas
supplies in the national pipelines network are balanced each day when
British Gas loses its monopoly over household supply in April 1996.
Temporary imbalances in the pipeline system can arise suddenly when the
weather turns colder and the pipelines operator needs to find supplies at
several hours' notice. If no supply was found householders could see their
gas cut off.
Morgan Stanley envisages its market operating as a forum for shippers buying
and selling gas to each other on a daily basis as they try to balance supply
and demand.
British Gas's pipelines division, TransCo, will be able to come to the
market if it needs emergency supplies. At the end of the day, the market
operator will calculate a weighted average price which can be used by the
industry as a market reference price.
TransCo would be able to use the pricing structure if it needed to buy gas
on behalf of shippers that were temporarily short of supplies. If a shipper
failed to provide enough gas to fill the needs of its customers, TransCo
would need to buy gas to balance the system.
The pipelines operator could then use the daily price set by a spot market
to charge the shipper for the gas purchased.
Mr Mark Higson, director of network operations at Ofgas, the industry
regulator, said: 'The advantage of developing a liquid and transparent
market is of key importance for attracting competition to the gas business.
Without a market like this there is a danger that trading could be dominated
by one or two large players.'
A daily spot market could evolve into a market for next-day or month-ahead
supplies as traders became accustomed to using it. Once its liquidity became
established it would be likely to attract brokers not involved in the gas
market.

FT  15 AUG 94 / European recovery 'set to strengthen export growth'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's exports are set for strong growth as the rest of Europe moves into
economic recovery, according to two reports published today.
The Lloyds Bank Quarterly Economic Bulletin says falling relative labour
costs mean UK companies are well placed to take advantage of stronger
European Union markets.
Mr Trevor Williams, Lloyds' senior economist, says: 'Prospects for UK export
growth seem to be the best for a decade.
'Relative unit labour costs improved by about 15 per cent in 1993, a much
better gain than for the 1980s. After jumping 10 per cent last year, export
price growth is expected to be barely positive in the next two years, helped
by low domestic inflation.'
This optimism, ahead of Friday's trade figures, is shared by Professor
Douglas McWilliams in the quarterly economic report of the Chartered
Institute of Marketing.
He says: 'Surveys show a powerful growth in export orders and it would be
reasonable to expect continued sales growth as the world's economic revival
spreads.'
The report forecasts the UK current account falling from a deficit of more
than Pounds 11bn this year to Pounds 5.6bn in three years.
Prof McWilliams is more cautious on interest rates and investment.
He forecasts a 'substantial' rise in world short-term interest rates next
year to 8 per cent or 9 per cent in the US. Prospects for UK investment are
'mixed'.
Mr Roderick Wilkes, the institute's chairman, says in the same report that
the longer hours worked in Asia mean companies there are more profitable and
therefore invest more.
Both reports say that domestic growth will remain relatively weak.
Prof McWilliams says inflationary pressures as a result of rising commodity
prices are 'relatively modest'.
Mr Williams says that industries with the lowest wage inflation, such as
aerospace, pharmaceuticals, drink and tobacco, are those with the highest
trade surpluses.
Motor vehicle manufacturing, wood, paper, printing and publishing have the
potential 'to perform better than at any time since the early 1980s,' he
argues.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Edinburgh poised for biggest festival yet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The largest annual cultural gathering in the world opened last night at the
Edinburgh International Festival with a performance at the Usher Hall of
Mahler's 8th Symphony by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra.
For the next three weeks Edinburgh plays host to four major festivals as
well as the Military Tattoo. In addition to the International Arts Festival
there is the Fringe, the Film Festival, and a Jazz Festival. At the end of
the month the television world gathers for its annual conference.
This year's International Festival, directed for the third time by Mr Brian
McMaster, promises to be the most successful for many years. The box office
has already taken Pounds 1.5m towards its Pounds 2m target and, for the
first time, the new Festival Theatre will be open to take large-scale opera
productions.
Beethoven and the 19th-century French composer Chabrier are featured
prominently in the music programme, with Scottish Opera performing
Beethoven's only opera Fidelio at the Festival Theatre.
Three of Chabrier's five operas are to be performed to mark the centenary of
his death. The Australian Opera will appear in Benjamin Britten's A
Midsummer Night's Dream.
Among dance troupes in Edinburgh are Miami City Ballet, the Mark Morris
Dance Group and Merce Cunningham, while the highlights of an impressive
drama programme are the world premiere of Canadian director Robert Lepage's
The Seven Streams of the River Ota and the return of German director Peter
Stein with a performance in Russian of the Oresteia lasting more than seven
hours.
Last year's Edinburgh Festival made a small profit. With local authorities
contributing more than Pounds 1m in subsidy and corporate sponsorship almost
as much, this year's festival should also end up in the black - in spite of
the need to sell 20 per cent more tickets with the opening of the Festival
Theatre.
The festival closes on Saturday September 3 with Elgar's Dream of Gerontius
performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and conducted by Sir
Charles Mackerras.
The festival brings more than Pounds 30m to Edinburgh's economy. Its main
competitor for custom is the Fringe, with 9,000 performers from 36
countries, who have scheduled 13,415 performances of 1,275 shows at 184
venues, including church halls, Masonic temples, a delicatessen, a swimming
pool, and a bus running around Edinburgh.
The Fringe has been criticised in the past for its preponderance of comedy
but this year the number of comedy shows has fallen from 209 to 167. There
is also a reduction in the number of Shakespeare productions  - just eight,
a record low.
The Scottish National party yesterday attacked the festival over its lack of
Scottish plays, music and dance in the programme. Mr Paul Scott, the party's
arts spokesman, said the festival could be 'in Edgbaston rather than
Edinburgh' as far as recognition of Scotland's heritage and creativity went.
In a letter to Mr McMaster he says that there is no sign of the festival
director's 'stated aim to bring Scotland to the world as well as the world
to Scotland'.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Treasury could net Pounds 1bn from cable growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new wave of cable construction in the next decade is likely to make cable
services available to nine out of 10 households and could net the government
more than Pounds 1bn, according to the Cable Television Association.
The association, which represents the mainly US-owned companies building
cable television and telephone networks, believes as many as 100 new
licences are likely to be granted in the next three years as cable companies
seek to extend their networks to smaller towns and rural areas.
Existing cable licences cover about 14.5m homes, about 70 per cent of the UK
total, although fewer than 1m homes have been connected. Cable operators are
expected to spend more than Pounds 5bn in the next five years constructing
networks in the 130 areas already franchised.
Mr Richard Woollam, director-general of the Cable Television Association,
said: 'There is strong interest among operators in extending their networks,
perhaps by using radio technology to provide connections in less populous
areas.' He said this could lead to the granting of franchises for up to 4m
additional homes, putting cable in reach of about 90 per cent of the
population.
Licences to build cable systems are granted by the Independent Television
Commission under the 1990 Broadcasting Act. It awards them after an auction,
for areas containing up to about 500,000 people. The proceeds go to the
government.
The most recent licence to be awarded, covering west Kent, went to Eurobell,
a cable operator with franchises in the Crawley area of West Sussex and in
Devon. Eurobell will pay Pounds 1.6m initially, then 2 per cent of
television revenues after five years of operation.
The west Kent franchise - a mixture of urban, semi-rural and rural
communities - is typical of future franchise areas. More than two-thirds of
its 100,000 residents live in or near Tunbridge Wells and Sevenoaks.
Eurobell plans to build wire-based networks in those towns, but will pioneer
radio technology for the rest of the area.
The ITC has three licence applications pending - for the Blackpool area,
south-east Anglia, and parts of Derbyshire. A US regional telecoms operator
with extensive UK cable interests is believed to have bid Pounds 800,000 for
the Blackpool franchise.
The ITC said it expected an increase in demand for cable licences for areas
not already franchised. The largest franchise expected is for Belfast, which
could cover up to 500,000 homes if extended to the whole of Northern
Ireland.
A recent Commons trade and industry committee report on 'superhighways'
called for areas not yet franchised to be offered to operators by the end of
next year. That target is widely regarded as over-ambitious, but pressure on
the ITC to ensure that most of the UK has an operator able to offer cable
services is likely to grow.
According to the FT's New Media Markets newsletter the ITC has rejected a
proposal by Mercury, the main competitor to BT, which would have allowed the
telecoms operator to build a television microwave system across those parts
of the UK not already covered by cable franchises.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Engineers' chief to quit IoD in protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The controversy in the business community over the acceptable level of
government support for UK industry has been re-ignited with the protest
resignation from the Institute of Directors of Mr Noel Davies, president of
the Engineering Employers' Federation, Michael Cassell writes.
Mr Davies, who is also chief executive of VSEL, the submarine and
shipbuilding group, has told the IoD that he is leaving the organisation
because of its support for demands by Mr Michael Portillo to cut the level
of state aid given to industry. Mr Portillo, now the employment secretary,
made the demands when he was chief secretary to the Treasury.
The Confederation of British Industry has said it fully supports Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who is resisting calls for
reductions in his budget.
In a letter to Mr Tim Melville-Ross, who has just taken over as IoD director
general, Mr Davies says he will not renew his personal membership because of
remarks made recently by Mr Melville-Ross in which he endorsed Mr Portillo's
call for a fundamental review of public expenditure across all government
departments.
The IoD chief questioned the effectiveness of some state funding for
industry and said all government spending had to be scrutinised if taxes
were to be lowered.
Mr Davies says the IoD's views are contrary to those of others 'who I

The IoD said last night that the organisation had received critical letters
from only three of its 32,500 members.
Mr Melville-Ross said he was sorry Mr Davies had indicated his intention not
to renew his membership.
He added: 'I hope he will reconsider when he has had a chance to read my
explanation of the context in which I expressed the IoD's support for a full
review of public expenditure so that we can ultimately reach a point when
both the borrowing requirement and the burden of taxation can be reduced in
the interest of all businesses.'

FT  15 AUG 94 / Property heading up down by the river: Andrew Taylor reports
on signs of rising house prices and increased office lets in London's
Docklands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What have Texaco, the oil company, Thalgo, a beauty products maker, the
European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, and an unnamed
Hong Kong purchaser of 25 Barratt homes got in common?
The answer is that all four have decided in the past 18 months to occupy
commercial premises or invest in London's former docklands.
After more than four years of harsh recession the mood is sunnier in one of
Britain's hardest-hit property markets.
According to the London Docklands Development Corporation 800,000 sq ft of
office space was let in the 12 months to the end of March, the biggest
annual total since 1987 and 50 per cent more than the previous two years
combined.
Since January 500,000 sq ft has been let and there are firm inquiries for
another 1m sq ft. Mr Mike Bignell, head of property development at the
corporation, said: 'At this rate commercial lettings should top 1m sq ft
this (financial) year for the first time in Docklands' history.'
House sales and prices have also picked up. Barratt said it was selling
homes faster than it could complete them at its riverside Sovereign View
housing development next to the former Surrey Docks, where three-quarters of
the 300 homes planned have been sold. A single Hong Kong investor took 25
earlier this year.
Barratt is thought to have paid Pounds 1m an acre to acquire the adjacent
2.5-acre Pageant Steps site where it plans an Pounds 11m development of 83
luxury houses and apartments. Upriver at Bermondsey, Berkeley Group is
thought to have paid the equivalent of Pounds 2m an acre for a quarter-acre
riverside site where it plans to build 10 town houses.
Prices are still about 20 per cent below their late 1980s peak but demand
for Dockland property is rising, particularly from Far Eastern investors.
The corporation estimated that house prices, which fell 35 per cent to 40
per cent from their peak, had risen about 15 per cent since autumn 1992.
It said builders sold 700 new private-sector homes in the first six months
of this year, leaving just 31 new units unoccupied, compared with an unsold
stock of 1,500 new homes in 1988-89.
The stock of unoccupied offices will take much longer to disappear. The
corporation estimated that at the end of last month there was about 5m sq ft
of empty commercial space, representing a vacancy rate of 39 per cent.
Four-fifths of this empty space is on the Isle of Dogs, home of the massive
Canary Wharf development which came out of receivership last year and is now
owned by a group of banks.
Lettings have increased sharply, with Canary Wharf more than 50 per cent let
to tenants such as the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal
Products, London Underground, Mirror Group Newspapers, Credit Suisse First
Boston and Texaco.
Texaco moved last year from its former headquarters in Knightsbridge in
London's West End, where its lease had run out, to a new 250,000 sq ft air
conditioned building at Canary Wharf.
It said: 'We were looking for world-class office facilities where we could
house all of our 1,000 headquarters staff in a single building, which
Docklands could provide.
'There was some concern about transport when the decision to move was taken
in the late 1980s. In the event journey times for staff have been much less
than expected following the opening of the Limehouse Link road - which
provides a dual carriageway connection all the way into the City of London -
and an improvement in reliability of the Docklands Light Railway.'
Texaco has hired a Hovercraft to shuttle staff at peak travel times along
the Thames from Charing Cross pier to Canary Wharf - a journey of about nine
minutes.
A more recent arrival is Thalgo Cosmetic, the UK subsidiary of a French
beauty and health products group, which three weeks ago moved into offices
at Millharbour on the Isle of Dogs.
Miss Anna Doyle, UK operations controller said: 'We looked in the West End
and the City but felt that Docklands offered us a very high-quality for a
very competitive price. The proximity of London City Airport is an added
bonus for a company with a French parent which has executives travelling
back and forth.
'Road access to the City is now very good and the construction of the
Jubilee Underground line extension will further improve communications with
the City and West End.'
The corporation said initial rents averaged Pounds 10 a sq ft.
A good guide to the improvement in the market is a reduction in sales
incentives with the rent-free periods offered by developers falling from
three or four years to about a year to 18 months.
Mr Bignell said: 'We will know that we are really getting somewhere when
rent-free periods disappear altogether. This may not be too far away if
current trends persist.'

FT  15 AUG 94 / Knapp accuses Railtrack of bullying and misleading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jimmy Knapp, leader of the RMT transport union, yesterday accused
Railtrack of bullying and refusal to compromise as a further 48-hour strike
by signal workers started last night.
He also accused Railtrack of misleading the public with its Pounds 100,000
newspaper advertising campaign yesterday.
The company said its offer would mean an average of 7.2 per cent on earnings
between April and October, with a final agreement giving increases of up to
10 per cent on earnings.
Mr Knapp said average earnings under Railtrack's proposals would go up by
less than 4 per cent, 'but signalling grades have to give up a tremendous
amount for even this'.
He added: 'And if Railtrack are so confident about the fairness of the
package, why do they continue to refuse to tell the union how much they will
save?
'Personal contracts mean a worsening of conditions as Railtrack's
restructuring package shows. It is also an invitation for Railtrack to
continue their campaign of harassment and bullying.'
The union said the company's arguments in the advertisements had been
'dismissed by a sceptical public', and welcomed a MORI poll in the Mail on
Sunday showing that 56 per cent of the public believed signalling grades
should get more money, while only 20 per cent backed Railtrack.
A spokesman for the company rejected Mr Knapp's claims, saying it was the
union which was inflexible for insisting on an interim pay deal before it
would discuss restructuring.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said: 'The government has been
stringing out the strike because it thought it would be to their political
advantage, and people would turn against the signal workers.
'The MORI poll shows this is not happening. The government should cut its
losses and let the dispute be settled.'
The Department of Transport said Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport
secretary, had changed his holiday plans and was now spending two weeks
somewhere in the UK to keep in touch with developments.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Chambers call for reform of tax rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax rules should be reformed to cut the administrative burden on employers,
says the British Chambers of Commerce in its technical Budget submission to
the chancellor.
Businesses are spending too much time calculating whether the Pounds 50 tax
threshold on annual employee parties has been breached, or what proportion
of travel counts as expenses when an employee goes directly from home to an
off-site location, say the chambers.
The submission says: 'Current rules on Schedule E (PAYE) benefits and
expenses are needlessly complicated in relation to their yield,' It calls
for 'a simplified approach more in keeping with modern flexible labour
patterns'.
It says costs incurred by employers that bring no benefit to employees
should be excluded.
The submission argues that smaller businesses are disadvantaged by tax rules
on staff canteens and creches, especially in London where employees travel
long distances to work. The 15p a day tax-free part of luncheon vouchers
should be increased, it says, and the upper limit for benefits in kind
should be raised to match the higher tax threshold - Pounds 23,700 a year.
These recommendations come partly in response to a survey of small companies
in which 53 per cent of respondents said the regulatory burden on management
cut profitability. Ninety-two per cent complained of the time taken to
administer value added tax.
Other measures called for by the chambers include:
Indexation of capital gains and losses, with capital gains tax-exempt on
long-term investment plans;
Raising the exemption band for inheritance tax to Pounds 200,000 with a view
to abolishing it eventually;
Cutting excise duty on beer, wine and spirits to reduce the gap between the
UK and the rest of the EU;
Exclusion of diesel from the planned 5 per cent increase in fuel duty.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Probe starts into train accident
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An investigation into a crash involving an express train and a locomotive
without its driver, which injured more than 50 people, was being held last
night.
The driverless locomotive collided with the Newquay-Edinburgh InterCity at
Abbeyhill, a mile east of Edinburgh's Waverley station on Saturday night.
A Railtrack official said the InterCity driver received a warning from
signal workers two minutes before the collision and had time to stop his
train and get into the back of his cab. He was trapped in his cab for an
hour and had both legs injured.
Two passengers were detained in hospital last night and more than 50 others
were treated for cuts, bruises and shock after the crash.
Mr Paul Prescott, director of Railtrack Scotland, said the signalling system
operated perfectly and was not implicated in the accident. The inquiry would
concentrate on how the driverless locomotive came to leave its last stop.
He said: 'We will be looking particularly at whether the brakes were fully
applied and were fully functioning.
'Clearly at some stage between 6.30pm and 8.30pm the locomotive set off
under the force of gravity, ran through some points and eventually collided
with the high speed train, which was stationary at a signal.'
The locomotive driver has been suspended.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Tunnel link data to be issued soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Transport said yesterday that it would announce details of
the intermediate stations which will be needed on the Pounds 2.7bn Channel
tunnel rail link in the next two weeks.
Details of the stations for the 68-mile route, which will link London's St
Pancras station with the Channel tunnel, were originally expected by the end
of May.
A series of delays has prevented the department from providing the four
bidders for the project - which is regarded as a pilot scheme for the
government's private-finance initiative for infrastructure projects - with
the detailed specifications they need to prepare bids.
Once these are available the formal tendering process is set to take six
months. The government expects to introduce a bill authorising the project
in the next parliamentary session and aims to pass the legislation in 1996.
The rail link could then open in 2002.
The department yesterday defended itself against accusations that it was
taking too long to provide information to the four bidders. 'They are
complex tender documents and they've got to be absolutely right. Although
one or two people in the private sector may be thinking it's taking a long
time, these things do take a long time.'
Four consortia are bidding: Eurorail, including GEC, Trafalgar House and
BICC; London &amp; Continental; Hochtief of Germany; and a fourth including the
construction companies John Mowlem and Taylor Woodrow.
The three losers will each be paid compensation worth a third of the costs
of their bid, up to a maximum of Pounds 1.5m each. They had to inform the
government of their interest in April, and have assembled teams of expensive
professional advisers, who as yet have nothing to do.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Housing land prices up 35.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The price of land for residential building in England rose 35.3 per cent in
the year to June, says a survey of land values by Savills, the residential
research company.
Land prices have jumped 23 per cent in the first half of this year, with the
biggest increases concentrated in the south-east, south-west, East Anglia
and, most prominently, in the east Midlands.
Since June 1992 land values in England have risen 48 per cent, exceeding the
most optimistic Savills forecast. At the start of this year researchers
predicted prices would rise 20 per cent during the year.
This unexpected performance may be attributed to a recovery from previous
price falls. Residential land has been hit much harder by a decline in
property values than the housing market generally. From June 1989 to 1992
the price of edge-of-town and serviced land, as well as level sites with
outline planning permission for medium-density dwellings, fell an average of
52 per cent.
The Savills index of residential building land is 582.3. It is estimated
that prices will have to increase by a further 40 per cent for the index to
regain its 1989 peak of 817.2.

<TEXT>
Hairline cracks have been found in the wings of British Airway's seven
Concorde aircraft, the company has confirmed. 'We have repaired two of them
and are working to repair the others one by one,' BA said.
The Civil Aviation Authority said it had allowed the Concordes yet to be
repaired to remain in service if they were checked after every 10 flights.
The longest crack found was four inches and the others were about one inch.
It said the cracks did not affect airworthiness. They were not in a
high-tension area or one that had any bearing on safety. The cracks were
found during a routine inspection in May.
Last week the Department of Transport's Air Accident Investigation Branch
reported that two outer window panels had shattered during a flight causing
a Concorde to lose speed.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Devon wind farm plans rejected
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans for a wind farm in Devon have been rejected in spite of advice from a
government agency that the proposed site was one of the best in the county.
North Devon District Council turned down the scheme by West Coast Wind Farms
for 23 wind turbines on a 300-acre site near Barnstaple, even though the
site had no special landscape designation and the scheme was backed by Devon
County Council and the government-backed Energy Technology Support Unit.
An appeal against refusal was rejected by a planning inspector on the
grounds of visual intrusion and noise pollution.
Mr Michael Baker of West Coast Wind Farms, which wanted to develop the site,
said: 'This decision means no further wind energy projects will be approved
in Devon, one of Britain's windiest counties.'
He added that his lawyers would consider seeking a judicial review of the
decision, which he believed applied subjective judgment to an issue of
national importance.

The government has appointed Mr John Alexander, chairman of the corporate
recovery section at accountants Pannell Kerr Forster, to search for money
under the control of Mr Darius Guppy.
Mr Guppy was jailed for five years and fined Pounds 539,000 in March last
year after being convicted of a Pounds 1.8m insurance fraud.
With Mr Benedict Marsh, he arranged a bogus gems theft in a New York hotel,
then claimed Pounds 1.8m from Lloyd's, the London insurance market, to cover
the loss to their company, Inca Gemstones.
Mr Guppy's fine was later reduced to Pounds 227,000 and he was ordered to
reveal where the money was. He said he had entrusted it to an unnamed party
and had lost contact.
Mr Marsh has repaid Pounds 561,000 to Lloyd's.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Councils 'ignore care volunteers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authorities have ignored help from volunteer groups when implementing
community care, a report says today.
Community Service Volunteers, which co-ordinates voluntary groups, said that
only 28 per cent of councils in England and Wales had plans to use help from
the voluntary sector in community care for this year, while only one-third
had staff with specific responsibility for dealing with offers of voluntary
help.
It suggested that the government's controversial care in the community
programme could work better and more cheaply if councils took advantage of
help offered without charge by individuals. Although 93 per cent of councils
said they planned to work with voluntary organisations, far fewer actually
made use of help from volunteers.
Of a sample of 60 authorities contacted by the organisation, 45 per cent
said they made no use of volunteers.
Ms Elisabeth Hoodless, executive director of the group, said that councils
should be barred under the Citizen's Charter from ignoring offers of help.
She said: 'Volunteers have proved they are a vital force in lengthening and
strengthening our public services, but the majority of authorities still
deny them a chance to serve.'
CSV said its survey of plans showed that where volunteers were already
involved, councils were making increased use of them, mostly with a range of
client groups.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Tough start for Ernesto Samper: A week of graft, murder and
attacks in Colombia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Colombian President Ernesto Samper's presidency got off to an eventful
start. His first week in office included a political assassination, several
guerrilla attacks and a police emergency in Cali, where senior officers were
sacked or suspended for receiving money from the city's cocaine cartel.
The shooting of Mr Manuel Cepeda - the left wing Patriotic Union party's
only senator and a long-time member of the central committee of the
Colombian Communist party, sparked rioting, strikes and recriminations. Mr
Cepeda had been threatened a number of times and party militants immediately
attributed his killing to right-wing paramilitaries. His death is a serious
setback to the government's hopes of reviving a dialogue with the
guerrillas, not least because Mr Cepeda would have been a channel for
reaching the old style communist line Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC).
During his first week, the president also had to contend with a series of
corruption scandals among the police force in Cali. The scandals were so
extensive that the government called a 'disciplinary emergency' and
announced the creation of a special counter-intelligence brigade within the
police. More than 50 policemen, including 36 officers, were sacked for
accepting money from drug traffickers.
In an effort to make some sort of positive mark in his inaugural week, the
president announced a series of social and economic measures in line with
his campaign promises to increase social investment and speed up
devaluation.
Mr Samper launched a Dollars 4.6bn (Pounds 3bn) four-year social welfare
programme aimed initially at 3m of Colombia's 12m people living in poverty.
Most of the money will come from the national budget and foreign loans, but
the municipalities will have to provide over a quarter of the funds, a
figure which some analysts consider unrealistic even though transfers to
local government are increasing.
The two biggest items in the 'social welfare network' are food assistance
for mothers and small children and housing subsidies for half a million
families. The programme also includes employment schemes, training for young
people, subsidies for single mothers to ensure their children can go to
primary school and welfare provision for the elderly. Some of these schemes
are a continuation of programmes begun under the previous government but are
geared more specifically to the poorest sectors of the population.
The economic measures include restrictions on private foreign borrowing. Mr
Guillermo Perry, finance minister, says the government plans to prevent
further revaluation of the peso and wants to maintain a real exchange rate
reflecting the difference between internal and external inflation rates. One
of the main problems will be to manage steep increase in coffee and oil
income - Dollars 1.8bn in coffee earnings is forecast by the end of 1995 and
soon after Cusiana oil output is forecast to rise.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Israel and Palestinians settle customs accord
</HEADLINE>

Israel and the Palestinians agreed customs and indirect tax measures
yesterday and said they were close to finalising an accord on the next phase
of their peace process - transfer of administrative powers from Israeli to
Palestinian hands in the occupied West Bank.
The peace moves came as one Israeli was killed and six were hurt in two
separate ambushes in the Gaza Strip by gunmen of the Hamas Islamic
Resistance movement, which opposes the peace process between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organisation.
Israeli customs officials said they had completed customs and VAT agreements
with the PLO - a critical step in the delayed implementation of the
Israeli-PLO economic protocol. The move will ease the financial constraints
of the cash-strapped Palestinian treasury.
Next Sunday the Palestinians will establish their own customs and
immigration channels at the Rafah and Allenby bridge crossings into Gaza and
Jericho removing one of the soorest points of friction between the two
sides.
Under the economic accord Israel will collect customs on Palestinian imports
through Israeli ports, airports and land terminals and transfer the duties
to the Palestinian treasury. Ms Edit Lev, customs spokeswoman, said Israel
had paid the Palestinians Shk7m (Pounds 1.49m) in customs duties last week
and was preparing a further transfer of Shk6.5m in coming days.
In future, however, the customs transfer would be made on a day-to-day basis
rather than in irregular lump sum payments.
Mr Uri Savir, the head of Israel's foreign ministry, said Israel and the PLO
were close to concluding an agreement on 'early empowerment' - the transfer
of power from Israeli to Palestinian hands over West Bank education, health,
social welfare, direct taxation and tourism.
Mr Savir said the only big obstacle left for a flurry of intensive talks
starting today at the Israeli-Gaza border was direct taxation of the West
Bank's nearly 1m people.
Israel, which will keep troops in the West Bank until the eve of Palestinian
elections due in mid-December, fears that the Palestinians will ease tax
collection, causing a fall in the level of services and the possible
eruption of social discontent.
Mr Oded Eran, a senior foreign ministry official, said Israel and the PLO
were making a joint effort to raise money abroad to meet a possible gap in
revenue collection. The worst-case being discussed with donors involves
providing budgetary assistance of Dollars 9.5m (Pounds 6.1m) a month for six
months to bridge the expected shortfall.
Outraged PLO officials say Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin last week
demanded the PLO prove its revenue collection abilities as a pre-condition
for early empowerment - a condition not agreed in any accords. The
Palestinians dismiss Israeli concerns about tax collection, describing the
matter as an 'internal Palestinian issue'. They are also pressing to levy
direct taxation on the up to 120,000 Jewish settlers resident in the West
Bank - a move Israel firmly opposes.
Despite the differences substantial progress on early empowerment is
expected when Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister and Mr Nabil Shaath,
senior PLO negotiator, meet in Egypt on Wednesday. At the meeting the PLO
will also present its plans for elections and demand that Israeli troops in
the West Bank complete redeployment out of Palestinian population centres
several months before election day to allow a free election campaign.
Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO Chairman, is expected in Egypt today to brief
President Hosni Mubarak ahead of the talks.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Korean accord is only a first step: Optimism and worry in
the US pact with the North
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The framework agreement concluded between the US and North Korea on Friday
night amounts to a diplomatic roadmap for an eventual solution to the
dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear programme.
The essence of the accord is that the US promises to improve diplomatic and
economic relations with North Korea in return for Pyongyang's acceptance of
full nuclear inspections and restrictions on its ability to produce
plutonium, the core ingredient for nuclear weapons.
But analysts warn the deal could still come unstuck over technical details,
which will be the subject of negotiations beginning in late September.
The new accord contains many of the same elements in an US-North Korean
agreement reached in July 1993, but which subsequently unravelled over
disputes about how it would be implemented. It is also similar to the plan
outlined by former US President Jimmy Carter during his mediation mission to
North Korea in June.
The key difference between the new agreement and the July 1993 one is that
the US this time has made explicit promises to North Korea for its
compliance with international nuclear safeguards instead of offering vague
incentives as it did earlier.
The accord also helps resolve procedural issues on the implementation of any
agreement, which has been a main stumbling block to a solution.
The US has accepted North Korea's proposal for a package deal and abandoned
its step-by-step approach that would have forced Pyongyang to make
concessions first. This indicates there 'is an improvement in their mutual
trust,' said Mr Han Sung-joo, the South Korean foreign minister.
The preliminary agreement consists of four main steps:
North Korea will replace its plutonium-generating gas-cooled graphite
reactors with light-water reactors, which are safer, easier to inspect and
depend on imported enriched uranium for fuel.
It will halt the construction of two 50MW and 200MW reactors, which would
complement its current 5MW reactor. It also promises to forego the
reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel into plutonium, and seal its
'radiochemical laboratory', which is suspected to be a reprocessing plant.
The US, in turn, will arrange for the supply of light-water reactors, which
will be constructed in eight to 10 years and be capable of producing
2,000MW, which will significantly ease North Korea's energy shortage.
Financing for the estimated Dollars 2bn-Dollars 4bn project is expected to
be provided by Japan, while South Korea wants to supply the nuclear
reactors. In the meantime, the US will arrange for interim energy supplies,
such as oil shipments, while the light-water reactors are being built.
The US and North Korea will establish some form of diplomatic representation
in each other's capitals, possibly beginning with liaison offices, and
reduce barriers to trade and investment, including the possible lifting of
the US trade embargo against North Korea.
The US will offer assurances to North Korea banning the threat or use of
nuclear weapons if Pyongyang agrees to implement its 1991 non-nuclear pact
with South Korea, which includes mutual nuclear inspections.
North Korea will remain a party to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty
(NPT) and a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency. This would
oblige North Korea to accept special inspections of two nuclear waste dumps
to determine how much plutonium it has already produced for suspected
nuclear weapons.
The demand for special inspections by the IAEA triggered the nuclear dispute
in March 1993, with North Korea threatening to withdraw from the NPT.
Negotiations on the technical details of the accord will begin in Geneva on
September 23. In the meantime, North Korea has agreed not to reprocess spent
nuclear fuel rods recently withdrawn from its reactor.
But the future fate of the fuel rods, with the two sides disagreeing on
their disposal, indicates the complexity of the negotiations that lie ahead.
North Korea wants to bury them in concrete to prevent radiation leakage,
while the US wants to transfer them to a third country, possibly China, for
reprocessing to prevent Pyongyang from using them as a possible bargaining
chip.
The comprehensive breadth of the agreement, with its provisions interlinked,
could slow down future negotiations and any serious disputes could threaten
the implementation of the accord.
The issues to be tackled are difficult and their resolution must also be
co-ordinated with progress in inter-Korean relations, which recently have
hit a rough patch.
But the conclusion of the agreement may put pressure on South Korea to ease
its recent propaganda attacks on the North. Seoul cautiously welcomed the
agreement, explaining it 'made clear the principles to be followed by both
sides in their further efforts to find an ultimate solution to the nuclear
issue'.
Another cause of optimism is that the US-North Korean accord was concluded
after only a week of talks, indicating that North Korea's new leadership may
be ready to resolve the nuclear dispute in a first step to open the country
to foreign investment.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Brazil seeks aid for regional integration costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Brazilian government has proposed that new financing should be made
available to support regions hurt by the movement toward economic
integration in Latin America.
Mr Celso Amorim, foreign minister, said his government had suggested that
this and other proposals should be discussed at the summit of American
leaders called by US President Bill Clinton to take place in Miami in
December.
Mr Amorim told a small group of foreign journalists in Braslia that the
proposal was one of several made by Brazil which reflected its hope that the
summit 'will be more than a media event'.
The suggestion was that funds should be made available by the Inter-American
Development Bank to support the free trade effort in Latin America. The
money should 'not only support regional projects such as roads or
electricity generation, but also help economic adjustment in areas that are
affected by integration'. Integration was beneficial, 'but there are sectors
that suffer in the process,' he said.
Brazil has also proposed discussions on trade at the summit 'to find a
mechanism in which areas heavily protected by the US are open for
negotiation'. Protection of the US market was high in several sectors
important to Brazil. Orange juice carries a specific per litre tariff that
works out at 35-40 per cent, which Mr Amorim described as 'outrageous',
while protection of the footwear industry was another concern.
It was also seeking fuller discussions with the US on its anti-dumping rules
'that very often work in ways that we consider arbitrary'.
Braslia also backed a Venezuelan proposal to increase international
co-operation to tackle corruption in government. Such co-operation should
include the ability to gain evidence from examination of bank accounts in
other countries to help investigate corruption cases, he said.
Brazil had also proposed funds from the IADB or the Organisation of American
States for the creation of a special agency - 'a kind of UN Development
Programme' - to cover the issue of human rights.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Jungle convention takes centre stage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The most passionately held debate in Mexico's press last week was not, as
might have been expected, on next Sunday's presidential election, but on a
rebel-organised 'convention of democracy', held deep in the jungle in the
southern state of Chiapas.
The convention had been called by Subcomandante Marcos, the media-obsessed
rebel leader, after he rejected a government offer for peace in Chiapas in
June. Despite a lack of accommodation, water and electricity, and a 20-hour
bus journey from the nearest town, some 5,000 delegates, accompanied by
several hundred journalists, made the trip.
To Mexico's leftist and independent newspapers the convention was one of the
year's political highlights, a meeting in which the rebel Zapatista
movement's future might be determined. Exercising a freedom that only a few
years ago would have been unimaginable, a handful of newspapers devoted
dozens of generally favourable articles to the convention.
But to the right-wing, generally pro-government press, the convention either
hardly mattered, or was seen as an attempt by a group of armed men to
convert themselves into heads of a national revolutionary movement. In this
quarter of the press, the meeting was barely reported at all, or stridently
denounced.
Proceso, Mexico's main weekly news magazine, led the pro-convention wing of
the press, devoting two issues to the event before it began. The first
carried a long, fawning interview with Marcos, who is famous enough for the
cover photograph to feature just one of his eyes peering through his
trademark balaclava. Marcos claimed extravagantly that the convention was
the last hope of preventing Mexico slipping into civil war.
Its second convention issue began with Marcos's unsubstantiated claim that
the government has sought to buy him off with money.
Desperate not to be outdone, La Jornada, a daily read by Mexico City's
intellectual elite, sent one of the country's best-known writers, Eliana
Poniatowska, to interview Marcos for a three-part series. The paper
commissioned opinion pieces for and against the convention for the best part
of two weeks.
After the convention finally began, there was nothing to read about for two
days. Marcos had imposed a news black-out, supposedly to prevent competition
for scoops, but more likely to keep control on what was written. Journalists
had to promise not to bring satellite telephones into the jungle, nor to
smuggle stories out by messenger.
After the convention ended - a day early because torrential rain destroyed
the hand-made convention centre - La Jornada and a handful of others
reported in voluminous detail the delegates' promise to shut down Mexico if
there were fraud in the presidential election, along with Marcos's pledge to
submit to the orders of the convention leaders, and not to be the first to
take up arms.
La Jornada immediately described the meeting as a great success. In an
editorial, entitled 'Benefits of the Convention', the newspaper claimed the
meeting had a positive response from diverse groups of society. 'The
Convention was, more than an illegal assembly of guerrillas (as some
political leaders, businessmen and citizens pretend to see it), a reunion
where the search for political solutions instead of military short cuts
prevailed.'
Elsewhere the view could hardly have been more different. Marcos had banned
several newspapers and both Mexico's main television networks from the
convention, and all those not present fiercely attacked the rebel leader for
censoring the press.
Even La Jornada's correspondent seemed concerned when Marcos turned away the
correspondent from Univision, the US Spanish-language network, on the
grounds that Univision was controlled by Televisa, the Mexican television
station that never puts Marcos on the air.
La Prensa, a best-selling tabloid, attacked the convention through its main
columnist, Juan Bustillos. 'With zero representativeness, the Zapatista
convention was a democratic lie. For groups without national representation
to discuss national issues, as if this right belonged only to them, and
pretend their conclusions speak for the entire nation is madness or unreal,'
he concluded.
When the meeting finally ended, Marcos's pledge to submit the Zapatistas to
new civilian orders was ridiculed by the editor of Summa, a new business
daily with close links to Televisa. Summa had earlier in the year told its
readers in an exclusive that Marcos was a former Jesuit priest, who is now
suing the newspaper for libel, and has taken it upon itself to lead the
anti-Zapatista attack.
'The National Convention of Democracy was a total failure,' wrote Jose Perez
Stuart, Summa's editor. 'Independently of the weather, it collapsed.'

FT  15 AUG 94 / Telephone companies to fight Senate bill: Baby Bells to
press for more favourable rules on their access to cable television markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US local telephone companies still plan a fight over some portions of the
telecommunications bill now making its way towards the Senate floor, even
though they accepted a compromise on some of the conditions it would place
on their entry into the long distance telephone market.
The seven leading local telephone companies known as the Baby Bells, which
were set up by the court-ordered break-up of the AT&amp;T monopoly in 1984,
agreed to a compromise on the long distance market that allowed the
telecommunications bill to be approved by the Senate commerce committee last
week.
But Bell executives are still promising a battle over the bill's rules for
allowing them into the cable television market while cable companies are
allowed into the local telephone market.
'The key problem for us in the Senate bill right now is the sequencing and
timing on cable entry,' said Mr Robert Stewart of Pacific Telesis, the Baby
Bell that provides local telephone service in California and parts of
Nevada.
'The cable companies are basically allowed into our market after a year. The
regulatory barriers in place would probably keep us out of cable for three
or four or five years,' he added.
A similar telecommunications bill passed the full House of Representatives
with relatively little rancour in June. When the full Senate passes its
version, the two bills must still be reconciled before the measure can
become law. Some supporters of reform fear that Congress is running out of
time to complete this before it breaks up for November's elections.
The cable companies represent probably the most serious threat to the Bells'
monopoly over local telephone service.
While some long distance companies have used the argument that the Bells
face no competition in their core market during the debate over the bill, it
is not thought that many of them will want to go to the expense of running
wires into consumers' homes. Cable companies, however, already have a
network on which they might be able to carry telecommunications besides
their current television programming.
The Senate bill agreed by the commerce committee last week would allow the
cable companies to provide telephone service without restriction one year
after enactment. But Bell officials complain that they would have to wait
for the Federal Communications Commission to lay out new regulations for
universal service before they could enter the cable market, which could
delay them for years.
The commerce committee agreed, however, to an amendment that would prevent
the new telecommunications bill from overriding court decisions or state
laws that have already opened the door for Bell companies wishing to provide
video services.
This could have implications for Nynex, the New York and New England Bell,
which is already affected by New York state laws opening up competition, and
for Bell Atlantic and US West, two other regional Bells, which have won
court decisions in favour of their right to own cable companies.
Many senators feel, however, that they promised the cable industry a degree
of protection from the Bells when in earlier legislation they required cable
companies to carry certain types of programming.
'In the Cable Act we did assure the cable companies that because of the
extraordinary regulations imposed on them, we would protect them from the
intrusions of the telephone companies,' said Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii
during arguments over the telecommunications bill last week.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Callback services cut international call costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
They give a new twist to the phrase 'Don't call me, I'll call you'. The
'call-back' services mushrooming across the US now offer a way for
travellers abroad to avoid the high rates for international telephone calls
charged by many countries. But their huge popularity is attracting furious
opposition from telecommunications carriers, who are pressing for the
services to be made illegal.
Callback takes advantage of the fact that rates for international calls are
very low in the deregulated and intensely competitive US telecommunications
market, but are high in many other countries, particularly those where the
service is provided by a state-owned PTT. Japan, for example, despite recent
deregulation, still charges very high prices for international calls.
To use the service, a caller in Japan dials the number of one of the 100-odd
callback bureaux which have sprung up across the US. The caller hangs up
after a single ring, and a programmed switch in the bureau calls back with a
dial tone from a US carrier's line. The caller can then use that line to
call anywhere in the world - and will pay only US rates.
Mr Dennis Anderson, vice-president of Colorado-based International GeoTel,
estimates that his service halves the usual Dollars 2 per minute charge to
call from Tokyo to the US in peak time.
His company, which started late last year and already has more than a
thousand business customers, is targeting businesses in Latin America, the
Pacific rim, Italy, Spain, Greece and Eastern Europe, which have the most
expensive international calls. 'We could save a company based in Latin
America hundreds of thousands of dollars a year,' Mr Anderson says.
The callback operators see themselves as pioneers testing the technical and
legal frontiers of telephony. Their popularity with travellers and
businesses in Japan is all the sweeter because it occurs against a
background of rising tension between the US and Japan over Japan's alleged
failure to open its markets for telecoms equipment.
Callback operators point out that, even without the help of threats from the
US government, they have succeeded in exporting considerable slices of spare
US telephone capacity into the Japanese market.
The development of these services in the past year has been driven partly by
the invention of the programmable call-back switch. But explosive growth
this summer has followed a ruling in May by the US Federal Communications
Commission that such devices were not illegal, despite fierce opposition
from US carriers and some overseas PTTs.
The US carriers AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint argue that they are not recompensed for
the cost of the initial call to the US. 'Theft is theft,' says Mr Bob
Baulch, a manager of the AT&amp;T's global strategy division. The company is
determined to defend that principle, he says, even if the carriers gain
extra revenue from calls which would otherwise have been placed with foreign
PTTs.
In practice, however, if many people take advantage of the services, Mr
Baulch believes they 'will ultimately have downward pressure on other
countries' rates'.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Filipinos demonstrate against birth control
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hundreds of thousands of Filipinos (left) demonstrated yesterday against a
'deluge' of contraceptives in the Third World, Reuter reports from Manila.
The demonstrators, staging one of Manila's biggest protests since President
Ferdinand Marcos was ousted in 1986, gathered in response to a Roman
Catholic church call to oppose a government campaign to cut the country's
high population growth.
Cardinal Jaime Sin and former president Corazon Aquino led the protest by
burning sex magazines and a copy of a document expected to be presented at
next month's international meeting on population in Cairo which the church
said would promote contraception and abortion.
The Manila rally was a key part of the church's campaign to force the
government to retreat from its stance on birth control before the Cairo
conference.
Cardinal Sin accused a 'global dictatorship' of swamping the Philippines and
other developing countries with a 'deluge of contraceptive drugs and
instruments'.
Much of his anger was directed at President Fidel Ramos's government, which
has taken on the church in Asia's only Christian-majority nation by refusing
to back down on its campaign to promote population control.
The government, which has repeatedly rejected church accusations that it
favours abortion, tried to defuse the confrontation by urging people to take
part in the rally.
But Mr Ramos, the nation's first Protestant president, strongly supports
giving Filipinos the chance to limit their families by using contraceptives.
The Philippines has one of the highest population growth rates in the region
at 2.4 per cent a year.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Bank Negara signals end to tough battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Exhausted, bruised and battered, Bank Negara, Malaysia's central bank, has
hung up its gloves after a seven-month battle against currency speculators.
At the end of last week Bank Negara lifted all remaining restrictions which
have prevented foreigners holding short term money in ringgit, the Malaysian
dollar. The move applied to a range of monetary instruments, from private
debt securities to bankers acceptances, Malaysian government securities to
mortgage-backed bonds.
The restrictions were the last of a broad package of measures introduced at
the beginning of the year to mop up excess funds in the financial system and
prevent the build-up of inflationary pressures. Malaysia's buoyant economy
and a stock market which rose 98 per cent last year were partly responsible
for the big inflows of funds.
However, the catalyst for the imposition of restrictions was a sudden rush
into ringgit by the world's currency speculators. Ironically Bank Negara
itself was the main cause of the sudden appetite for the Malaysian currency.
'It's been a long and tough fight,' said one Kuala Lumpur money trader.
'Many speculators were badly burned when the restrictions came in. But Bank
Negara's reputation has taken a bad beating as well.'
The trouble began at the end of last year when the central bank bought in
large quantities of US dollars to revalue its reserves and reduce year-end
book losses caused by the bank's own multi-billion dollar speculation on the
foreign exchange markets. In 1992 Bank Negara lost MDollars 9bn (Pounds
2.27bn) in foreign exchange dealings. Forex market losses in 1993 were
officially put at MDollars 5.7bn.
Senior monetary officials now privately admit that the end-1993 manoeuvre
was a serious error. While it boosted the book value of Bank Negara's
foreign currency and gold reserves in ringgit terms, it also caused the
Malaysian currency to fall sharply - from an average of around 2.54 against
the US dollar for most of 1993 to 2.73 early in January.
The world's money traders were quick to see an opportunity. They realised
what Bank Negara had been doing and, judging that the ringgit was
considerably undervalued, waded into the Malaysian currency. As a result
Bank Negara faced trouble on two fronts. Not only was it having to mop up
yet more amounts of funds coming into the country: it was also in danger of
losing control over its own jealously guarded currency.
By mid-January Bank Negara was hitting back with the first of a series of
restrictions designed to defeat the speculators and 'capture all inflows of
funds from abroad.' These included imposing a negative interest rate on
foreign held ringgit accounts. The measures sent shockwaves through the
currency market with traders moving swiftly to offload ringgit positions.
Some were badly burned as they tried to take on Bank Negara.
For several weeks the ringgit stayed in the doldrums, only slowly gaining
strength on the US dollar. By early June the Malaysian currency had risen to
around 2.60 to the US dollar. After the lifting of the final restrictions
last Friday the ringgit was trading at around 2.56.
However, Bank Negara's victory against the speculators has only been
achieved at a considerable cost. The bank's international reputation had
received a severe battering due to the foreign exchange fiasco.
Imposition of the recent restrictions raised a few eyebrows in the
international banking community. Malaysia has prided itself on its liberal
and outward looking economic policies. Such restrictions were not seen to be
in keeping with worldwide moves towards a more liberal financial regime.
Within Malaysia, Bank Negara's moves were blamed for causing nervousness
among foreign fund managers. The flow of foreign funds into the Kuala Lumpur
market declined sharply in the first few months of this year.
Money market analysts say Bank Negara now feels that the currency whirlwind
has passed. US interest rates are rising but falling in Malaysia: there is
now less foreign demand for the ringgit.
'It's been a difficult time for Bank Negara,' said one Kuala Lumpur merchant
banker. 'But then its own actions were in many ways the cause of so many of
its problems. I'm sure a few lessons have been learned.'

FT  15 AUG 94 / Ruling party in Sri Lanka facespoll challenge

Sri Lanka's ruling United National Party, which has governed for 17 years,
faces its toughest-ever electoral test in tomorrow's general election.
The party is braced for losing considerable support to a nine-party alliance
led by Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the ageing former prime minister, and her
49-year-old daughter Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga, the alliance's candidate for
prime minister.
However, with opinion polls showing wildly differing results, it was not
clear yesterday whether the opposition could capture enough seats to take
power. In the last Parliament, the UNP had 125 out of 225 seats.
Mrs Kumaratunga has been attracting large crowds with her eloquence, energy
and populist promises of rises in welfare handouts. But even some supporters
are concerned at her reluctance to give details.
Nevertheless, many Sri Lankans believe change is in the air. At the central
bus station in Colombo yesterday hundreds of people were preparing to leave
to vote in their home towns and villages. Mr UN Dasantha, a fertiliser
salesman, said: 'People are cautious because they don't know Chandrika's
policies. But we think it's time for a change.'
The UNP has focused on the the economic policies of the Sri Lanka Freedom
Party, the leader of the opposition alliance, which promoted socialism with
disastrous results when it was last in power in the early 1970s. Pictures of
food queues adorn UNP posters, with a warning about the danger of voting
SLFP.
The opposition has found it hard to hit back directly. IMF-backed pro-market
reforms have brought sustained growth in output, exports and foreign
investment, with GDP up 5.7 per cent last year.
Mrs Kumaratunga says she will continue with reform but wants future
restructuring to have 'a human face.' She also wants to stop corruption,
which she says is widespread in the UNP.
The contestants have trod warily around the continuing civil war in the
north between the army and the Tamil Tigers fighting for a separate homeland
for the island's Tamil minority. Mr D B Wijetunga, the president, has taken
a tough line with the Tigers whereas Mrs Kumaratunga has called for a
compromise.

<TEXT>
New Zealand's National party government yesterday pledged to continue its
reform programme following its narrow victory over the left-wing Alliance
party in a weekend by-election.
A loss in the former National party stronghold of Selwyn would have cost the
government its one-seat majority, possibly forcing an early election.
The National party's candidate, Mr David Carter, won 8,621 votes against the
Alliance's Mr John Wright on 8,275.
The result means that the National party has 50 seats in parliament, Labour
45 and the Alliance and populist New Zealand First two each.
However, the government remains vulnerable to defections as the country
prepares to change to a proportional representation voting system. Several
MPs are expected to resign to form new right-wing or Christian
fundamentalist parties.
Acknowledging this likelihood, the prime minister, Mr Jim Bolger, said he
would be approaching right-wing Labour MPs in the coming week to secure
their agreement to support the government on crucial issues.
'I'm not asking them to form a coalition but to work to retain the stability
of the country,' Mr Bolger said. 'Any instability now would be very bad for
the economy.'
Mr Bolger made clear that the government intended to force further
controversial legislation through parliament.
This includes shipping deregulation to put New Zealand in the unusual
position of allowing international vessels to carry cargo between domestic
ports; further asset sales, which are required to meet the government's
budget surplus forecasts; and reforms of health and hospital care.
In the by-election, forced by the surprise resignation of the former finance
minister, Mrs Ruth Richardson, the National party increased its share of the
vote by one percentage point to 42.2 per cent, but saw its majority cut from
to 886 to 346. But support for Labour collapsed to only 10.3 per cent of the
vote, a distant third behind the left-wing Alliance party - a group of five
minor parties including the Greens - which won 40.5 per cent.
The Labour leader, Ms Helen Clark, said the drop in support reflected
tactical voting for the Alliance, which was seen to have the best chance of
ousting the National party.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A Japanese cabinet minister was forced to resign yesterday after saying that
the country did not intend to fight a war of aggression in the 1930s and
1940s and suggesting that the parts of Asia it occupied benefited from the
experience.
South Korea and China protested at the comments by Mr Shin Sakurai, director
general of the Environment Agency, which he made on Friday and withdrew the
same night. His political future became the subject of a weekend tussle
between the Liberal Democratic party and the Social Democratic party, the
dominant members of the three-party coalition that took power at the end of
June.
Mr Sakurai is the fourth Japanese cabinet member in eight years to be ousted
because of revulsion in the region over an attempt to put a better gloss on
Japan's wartime role.
His departure highlights the lack of contrition among right-leaning Japanese
over actions of the imperial army, as well as ideological strains in the
coalition of convenience grouping the conservative LDP, the left-wing and
traditionally pacifist SDP, and the reformist New Harbinger party.
LDP leaders, while disavowing Mr Sakurai's views, appear to have sought his
retention in cabinet after he apologised for having said the war led to
independence for Asian countries which had been under the European colonial
yoke, 'popularisation of education and increased literacy' in those nations,
and their subsequent economic success.
Eight to 10 government ministers, most if not all from the LDP, are expected
today - the 49th anniversary of Japan's surrender at the end of the second
world war - to pay homage at Tokyo's controversial Yasukuni shrine. The
shrine commemorates Japanese war dead and contains remains of a number whom
the western allies classified as war criminals.
The weekend episode precedes a South-East Asian tour later this month by Mr
Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister. It comes as Japan is debating a wider
international role for its Self-Defence Forces, which replaced the imperial
military after US post-war occupation of Japan.
A government advisory panel on Friday presented Mr Murayama with a report
recommending that the country 'should extricate itself from its security
policy of the past that was, if anything, passive, and henceforth play an
active role in shaping a new order' in the world. This would include
deploying weapons in United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The government, like its predecessors, is meanwhile agonising over whether
and how to compensate those forced to work for the imperial army in occupied
countries, including so-called comfort women required to provide sex for
troops.
According to one report, the administration is contemplating a Y100bn
(Pounds 646m) aid fund for the victims, about 50 of whom gathered in Tokyo
at the weekend to press their case.
Mr Murayama, the SDP leader, is a lifelong socialist who only on becoming
premier acknowledged the legitimacy of the Self-Defence Forces as part of a
policy compromise with the LDP. At 70 he is old enough to have had his
pacifism motivated by direct recollection of the war, and this weekend drew
the line at serving alongside Mr Sakurai, 61, whose stated impression of the
era was so different.
Mr Sakurai's comments, in answer to a question at a press conference, were
denounced by South Korea's ruling Democratic Liberal party as 'tantamount to
blasphemy against Asian countries subjected by Japan to numerous pains and
sacrifices' and by China as a distortion of history.
In May Mr Shigeto Nagano, justice minister in the then government of Mr
Tsutomu Hata, resigned after implying that the 1937 massacre of Chinese
civilians in Nanking by Japanese soldiers was a fabrication. Mr Nagano was
from Mr Hata's Japan Renewal party.

with the news that the number of salaried employees, rose by 60,000, or 0.4
per cent, to just over 9m in the second quarter of this year, according to
the Employment Ministry. This continues the upward trend of the first
quarter, when salaried employment rose by 0.2 per cent. It follows the news
that the overall level of unemployment experienced its biggest fall for four
years in June with the number of jobless dropping by 13,000 to 3.33m, or
12.6 per cent of the workforce. Economic growth in France during the first
quarter was higher than expected at 0.7 per cent rather than its original
estimate of 0.5 per cent.

General Alexander Lebed, the hardline commander of the Russian 14th army in
Moldova, yesterday denounced plans to pull his army back into Russia and
remove him from his post. He described last week's agreement between Russia
and Moldova on a three-year timetable for the withdrawal as 'a crime' and
said that he would not be 'an obedient performer' of Moscow's orders. Gen
Lebed's outburst, just a month after he described Russian President Boris
Yeltsin as 'a minus', poses an immediate threat to the delicate
rapprochement between Russia and Moldova and could further undermine
Moscow's control over the military, particularly units serving outside
Russia's borders. Some observers fear that the charismatic general could act
as a focal point for Russians who lament the collapse of the Soviet Union.

quite clear to my party and in public before the election that I want to run
again,' Mr Kohl, who has been chancellor since 1982, told German ZDF

<TEXT>
The Economics Ministry in the German state of Hesse has uncovered 179 cases
of a stock market phenomenon known as dividend-stripping, German newspapers
reported over the weekend. The reports, quoting the Czerwensky Intern
newsletter, said the transactions concerned had involved 5.9m shares with a
value of more than DM2bn (Pounds 826m) and were based on brokers' data from
1991. In dividend-stripping transactions, which fall into a legal grey area,
shares are exchanged between domestic and foreign shareholders just before a
dividend payout so the domestic operator holds the shares when the payment
is made. This means the domestic shareholder can take advantage of a tax
credit accompanying the cash dividend which is worthless to a foreign
investor. The shares are then sold back to the foreign party at a fixed
lower price, allowing the two parties to split the effective cash value of
the tax credit.

Chancellor Helmut Kohl will send a special envoy to Moscow to find out how
nuclear material is being smuggled into Germany after police in Bavaria last
week seized 50 grams of enriched plutonium carried on a recent Lufthansa
flight from Moscow to Munich. It was the third seizure in four months of
weapons-grade material from the former Soviet bloc and confirmed fears that
Germany has become the main transit route for such smuggling since the end
of the cold war opened a black market for nuclear contraband from the east.
Speaking on German television last night, Mr Kohl said he would also speak
to President Boris Yeltsin to seek help in tightening up security. 'Every
possible step must be taken to prevent such things from happening in the
future,' he said. At the same time, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister,
yesterday told Bild am Sonntag newspaper that a 'new control system for
plutonium' should be set up. 'Travelling salesmen with nuclear suitcases
pose a new atomic danger,' he said. Police told Der Spiegel magazine, which
broke the story, that the smuggling of weapons-grade nuclear materials could
have been organised by Libyan, Iranian, or Iraqi diplomats.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Dutch left and right unite to rule: Ronald van de Krol on
the 'purple' coalition which will bring together three unlikely allies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Netherlands is about to make first-hand acquaintance with the old adage
that politics makes strange bedfellows.
By the end of the month, the country will find itself governed by the first
left-right coalition in its history, bringing together three unlikely allies
 -the Labour party, the right-wing Liberals and the left-of-centre D66.
The unusual 'purple' coalition - so-called because of the mix between the
Labour 'reds' and the Tory 'blue' Liberals - will squeeze the centrist
Christian Democrats out of power for the first time in living memory, ending
their era as the natural party of government.
The odd grouping of parties in the new coalition is underlined by the
personalities of the main protagonists.
Mr Wim Kok, the Labour leader and the man destined to be prime minister, is
the son of a carpenter. He studied business but went on to become the leader
of the Dutch labour union federation before entering politics. His
counterpart in the Liberal party, Mr Frits Bolkestein, is a former Shell
executive with a posh accent and a fondness for tennis. Mr Hans van Mierlo,
D66 leader, is one of the few Dutch politicians who could be accused of
possessing charisma. A former journalist, he founded the D66 party in 1966
in an attempt to break the mould of Dutch politics.
The advent of a left-right cabinet will not, however, herald radical
changes. 'Left' and 'right' are relative terms in the Netherlands, and the
three coalition parties have not put forward a programme significantly
different from what the Christian Democrats would have tried to achieve.
Boosting employment will be the main goal of the new cabinet, which is to be
inaugurated before the end of the month with Mr Kok as prime minister.
Government spending is to be cut by Fl 18bn (Pounds 6.4bn), with about half
given back to households and the business community in the form of lower
taxes and social premiums. By reducing the cost of labour to companies, the
new government hopes to foster the creation of 125,000 jobs. In addition,
economic recovery should lead to 230,000 extra jobs in the government's
four-year term in office.
Social spending will be cut in some controversial areas, but the level of
unemployment and disability payments will not be lowered.
People covered by the national health scheme will be required to pay a
deductible of Fl 200 a year for medical treatment, as a way of both reducing
the cost of health care and discouraging unnecessary visits to doctors.
The wide-ranging government plan also covers topics from Amsterdam's
Schiphol Airport - night flights are to be curbed - to slightly more liberal
shop opening hours.
Indeed, it is the detail in the 69-page plan that explains, in part, why it
has taken the Netherlands more than 100 days to come up with a new
government since the May 3 general election.
But another factor is the sheer unfamiliarity of an attempt to bring
together parties from opposite sides of the narrow Dutch political spectrum.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Ethnic Greeks go on trial in Albania today
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The trial of five members of Albania's ethnic Greek minority on charges of
treason, espionage and illegal possession of weapons, opens today in Tirane
following several weeks of angry diplomatic exchanges between the two
neighbouring governments.
Greece is threatening to veto Ecu23m (Pounds 18m) in European Union
financial assistance to Albania because of the Albanian decision to go ahead
with the trial.
The EU has already tried to assuage Greek concern over the minority's
position by linking release of the aid to Albania's record on protecting
human rights.
However, the stand-off with Albania, together with Greece's six-month trade
blockade of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, underline the
continuing reluctance of Greek policymakers to try to reduce tension in the
Balkans.
The five defendants, all prominent members of Omonia, an ethnic Greek
political organisation, were arrested in April, shortly after an attack on a
military post close to the Greek border left two Albanian soldiers dead.
The incident caused a sharp deterioration in Greek-Albanian relations,
already uneasy because of complaints of discrimination against ethnic
Greeks, who claimed they were refused titles to land being privatised or
were unable to bid for small businesses being sold off by the state.
Greece rejected an Albanian accusation that the raid was carried out by
Greek commandos on orders from the government.
However, speculation persists in Athens that it was organised by a group of
dissident Greek soldiers, opposed to the Socialist administration's efforts
to improve ties with Tirane, in co-operation with hardline ethnic Greeks in
Albania.
The indictment claims the five ethnic Greeks were conspiring with
nationalist organisations in Greece to establish autonomy for Northern
Ipiros, the region adjoining the Greek border where the minority lives, and
eventually unite it with Greece.
The Greek government is also threatening to expel many of the estimated
150,000 Albanian immigrants working illegally in Greece and to block
remittances in drachmas to Albania.
However, there are fears that a wave of expulsions could bring retaliation
against the ethnic Greeks in southern Albania.
The dispute has already slowed down Greek investment in Albania, which has
been promoted in the past by the Greek government as the most effective way
of improving bilateral relations.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Greens show black flag at Monza grand prix: Cancellation of
Italian motor race to spare trees has upset the locals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frantic shuttle diplomacy, riot warnings, conspiracy theories, resignation
threats and emergency legislation: a normal holiday weekend in Italy.
The subject of all this frenzied activity was not last week's turmoil on the
bond, currency and stock markets, but Friday's decision by Fia, the world
motor sport authority, to cancel the 65th Italian Grand Prix.
The decision was supposed to end uncertainty caused by a row between
tree-hugging environmentalists and road-hogging Formula One drivers over
modifications to the venerable Monza circuit, set in an ancient royal park
near Milan. Instead it has set off a new wave of controversy.
Environmental groups are protesting against proposals to fell more than 100
trees and extend the gravel-filled safety lane at a fast right-hand bend of
the track for the September 11 race. Drivers called for the improvement
after the accident which killed Ayrton Senna at the San Marino grand prix
earlier this year.
Over several weeks, local and national authorities dithered about whether
trees or turbos should have precedence, until Friday when Fia decided it had
had enough.
Environmentalists - standing guard over the trees lest fanatical motor sport
'tifosi' decided to take an axe to them - seemed strangely subdued by the
decision. 'From the beginning we have always said that we are not against
this year's grand prix,' said Mr Matteo Barrattieri of the Worldwide Fund
for Nature on Friday, speaking from the other side of the fence erected by
the Monza authorities to mark out the felling area. 'We're against the fact
that instead of reducing the speed of the cars they want to damage the
park.'
While the greens are reluctant to declare victory, advocates of the grand
prix are certainly not going to concede defeat. Mr Aldo Moltifiori, mayor of
Monza, has resigned in protest, alleging, among other things, a conspiracy
between Ferrari and Fiat (which controls the sports car maker) to take the
grand prix to the company-owned track at Mugello in Tuscany. Other regional
politicians, all members of the populist Northern League, have also
threatened to step down.
On Saturday, a delegation headed by Mr Gianni Letta, chief of staff to Mr
Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, flew to Cannes to try to
persuade Fia to change its mind. Meanwhile, Mr Umberto Bossi, head of the
Northern League, emerged from his all-night summit with Mr Berlusconi
promising that an emergency decree would save the grand prix.
According to Mr Moltifiori, direct and indirect earnings from the grand prix
amount to L70bn (Pounds 29m) a year, with 100 jobs depending directly on the
race, and a further 1,400 temporary employees helping on race day itself.
He blames Mr Letta for ending Monza's hopes by asking Fia to agree to the
installation of a new chicane before the bend, an alternative which the
sport's authorities had already rejected. 'A government which can't manage
to stage a grand prix ought to give up and go home,' Mr Moltifiori said on
Friday. Fia has so far stood by its decision.
One of Mr Moltifiori's last acts as mayor was to warn the local prefect of
police that he could no longer be responsible for the actions of an angry
populace. This holiday weekend, however, Monza was completely closed and
almost deserted. A policeman on a bicycle, who was stopping cars from
entering the historic centre on Friday, said he was disappointed: 'After
all, Monza is known worldwide for its grand prix, not for its trees.' Only
the gatekeeper at the Monza circuit expressed anything like an inflammatory
reaction to the decision. 'There's only one thing for it now,' he said with
a shrug. 'Revolution.'

FT  15 AUG 94 / Berlusconi and Bossi kiss and make up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Feuding members of Italy's ruling coalition made a concerted effort over the
weekend to show they had patched up their differences at a secret summit
between Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, and Mr Umberto Bossi of
the Northern League.
Since the March general election, blunt-talking Mr Bossi has repeatedly
criticised Mr Berlusconi for political misjudgments, and fears of a split in
the coalition have contributed to tension on Italian financial markets in
the last fortnight.
But late on Friday, Mr Berlusconi and Mr Bossi met at Arcore, the prime
minister's villa near Milan, and - fuelled by dishes of pasta into the early
hours of Saturday - thrashed out an armistice.
The two smiling, shirt-sleeved leaders invited television cameras into the
grounds of the villa on Saturday afternoon for a session of back-slapping
and ribaldry aimed at demonstrating that they were now the best of friends.
'Today we've talked about serious things, about our commitments to
(government) programmes,' said Mr Bossi. 'This is certainly not the moment
to be rash. . . The government will last a long time, there's no doubt about
that.'
Mr Berlusconi added: 'The (solidity of the) government has really never been
in question; it's only considered unstable by outside observers.'
The government hopes that the soothing television interviews given by Mr
Berlusconi on Friday night and the friendly banter of Saturday will inspire
Italian markets when they reopen tomorrow after the holiday weekend. Last
Thursday's unexpected decision by the Italian central bank to raise interest
rates not only failed to strengthen the lira on Friday, but seemed to
contribute to further weakness on bond, currency and equity markets.
Italian observers seemed sceptical about the Bossi-Berlusconi ceasefire,
however. In an editorial yesterday in Il Giornale, the daily newspaper which
is part of Mr Berlusconi's business empire, Mr Vittorio Feltri warned that
the government had only maintained popular support so far because Italians
were terrified by the memory of the corrupt old political regime. 'But what
will happen the day those memories dim?' asked Mr Feltri. 'Take my advice,
Cavaliere (the nickname for Mr Berlusconi): instead of courting popularity,
try governing.'

FT  15 AUG 94 / Presiding over period of tumultuous change: Manfred Worner -
Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Manfred Worner, who died on Saturday aged 59, presided over the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation during the end of the cold war and the
beginning of its unpredictable aftermath. It has been a period of tumultuous
change, raising questions about the whole purpose and future of the
alliance. His recent claim that these uncertainties had been overcome was
not fully convincing. But there can be no doubt that his own stature
increased as the job of Nato secretary-general became ever more challenging.
It was unimaginable when he was appointed to the Brussels post in 1988 that
a Nato leader should come to spend much of his time visiting and receiving
visits from what was then the Warsaw Pact. It was equally inconceivable that
Nato - any more than its cold war adversary - should be thought of as a
suitable instrument for peacekeeping or peacemaking outside its frontiers.
The criticism now directed at Nato for the absence of decisive action in
Bosnia is a measure of how much has changed. A long debate about 'out of
area' action is now over. It has moved from being a virtually taboo subject
to the centre of Nato business, to the extent that the phrase 'out of area'
has fallen into disuse.
Worner felt strongly about the tragedy of former Yugoslavia but was
defensive about Nato's record there. He looked at it from the viewpoint of
Nato as an organisation, which indeed has performed all the tasks the UN has
asked of it, rather than as a collectivity of nations which between them
have much to answer for in the Bosnian catastrophe.
His appointment was controversial in the early stages, but he grew into the
job and proved equal to the momentous changes the alliance had to undergo.
Some found him brash and vain, but he earned their respect. At the Nato
summit last January President Bill Clinton paid him tribute as 'a genuine
statesman', praising his 'great vision and discipline'. Although he had
previously had a successful political career in Germany, his reputation was
higher outside his own country than within it.
Born near Stuttgart in 1934, Worner attended university at Heidelberg and
Paris and undertook further legal studies in Munich and Stuttgart, devoting
his doctoral thesis to defence relations between allied countries.
After working as an adviser to the Christian Democratic Union in
Baden-Wurttemberg, he was elected in 1965 to the Bundestag, where he became
chairman of the defence committee. From 1982 to 1988 he was minister of
defence, a period which included the launching of the Eurofighter project.
He is credited with coining the phrase Burger in Uniform, or
citizen-soldier, as the expression of the new face of the German military.
When he went to Nato in July 1988 he was not only, at 53, the youngest man
to do the job but also the first German. Germany was at the heart of Nato in
the military sense - on the front line and still with troops from five other
Nato countries on its territory - but was becoming a more awkward ally,
particularly over nuclear weapons policy.
Doubts were expressed whether this suave former fighter pilot in the German
air reserve had the political pull in Bonn, particularly vis-a-vis the then
foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, that other allies felt was badly
needed. He did not seem to have the clout of his predecessor Lord
Carrington.
One senior Nato diplomat commented at the time: 'It was right that it should
be a German. But the question is: was it the right German?'
However, his intelligence, honesty and sheer commitment shone through. At
the end of his four-year term, unable to agree on a successor, the allies
extended his tenure by another year and then by another three years.
Sadly, the principal candidate to take over from him, Norwegian foreign
minister Johan Jorgen Holst, died in January.
Worner knew in 1992 he had cancer of the colon and underwent a series of
operations, but was determined to complete the job of overseeing Nato's
transition and its moves towards incorporating the countries of eastern
Europe.
He referred only once in public to the disease, joking that he had become,
like Nato's much-reduced forces, 'leaner and meaner'.
On the eve of the January summit he told the allies he had been declared
free of cancer and intended to go on to the end of his term in mid-1996.
He was a distinctive figure, with a fixed stare, accentuated by his recent
gauntness, a sometimes ponderous manner and a penchant for hyperbole which
led him to describe almost any Nato gathering as 'historic'. But without his
passionate belief in the transatlantic alliance Nato would be in a worse
state than it is. Replacing him will not be easy.
His widow, Elfie Reinsch, was his second wife. He had a son by his first
marriage.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Sun Life to end commission-only pay for staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Direct sales forces paid entirely on commission seem increasingly likely to
become a thing of the past in the financial services industry, with Sun Life
about to join a growing band of companies paying a salary to sales staff.
The life assurance group, which is jointly owned by Transatlantic Holdings
and Union des Assurances de Paris, is set to move its 240 direct sales staff
to a new remuneration system under which they will be paid a salary as well
as commission on sales. They are currently paid on commission only.
In another move that reflects the growing pressure upon financial services
groups to reform their sales methods, Nationwide Building Society has
confirmed plans to cut the number of staff authorised to offer financial
services advice from 1,300 to 650.
The change in Sun Life's remuneration is partly to meet new industry
regulations, due to take effect in January, under which sales staff will
have to disclose to clients the charges and commission they earn.
Commission-only payment has also been criticised for inclining staff to use
high-pressure selling techniques, although this is disputed by some
companies.
Mr Colin Kelsey, Sun Life's director of training and management development,
said a change to salary plus commission would happen in the 'not too distant
future'. 'It is a positive way of doing business and there is definitely a
trend towards it,' he said.
Barclays Life, which was censured last month by the Securities and
Investments Board for shortcomings in training and managing its sales force,
has said that by next year it will include a salary in the pay package for
its 1,100 sales agents instead of paying them on commission only.
Allied Dunbar, one of the UK's biggest insurance companies is also moving
towards salaries, albeit on a limited scale. In May, it changed the
contracts of its 350 sales managers from mainly commission to a salary and
bonus system to encourage them to take greater responsibility for the
4,000-strong sales force, although sales agents will continue to be paid on
a commission-only basis.
Last month, Norwich Union, another large insurer, announced that as part of
a restructuring of its direct sales operation it would no longer pay its
sales agents on commission-only. In March, regulators forced it to suspend
its life and pensions sales force for a month of retraining.
Nationwide, the UK's second-largest building society, which has withdrawn
staff from offering financial services advice, has concluded that those who
give advice only part of the time - such as branch managers - should no
longer be authorised as sales staff.
The society, has implemented an extensive retraining programme for the 650
staff who will concentrate on selling regulated financial services products.
Nationwide is linked to Guardian Financial Services but is to launch its own
life subsidiary next year.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Clinton fights to rescue crime bill: Fate of reform agenda
hangs on crucial legislation winning approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US president Bill Clinton fought back yesterday to rescue his crime bill, a
key component of his domestic agenda that was blocked by the House of
Representatives last week in the most shattering defeat of his 18-month-old
presidency.
White House officials believe they can salvage victory from defeat by
launching a concerted attack on opponents of the measure, which is generally
popular.
Mr Clinton has signalled how much rides on the fate of the crime bill by
focusing on the issue almost exclusively since the vote last Thursday. The
fate of the crime bill and the president's healthcare reform programme is
widely seen as a defining test of whether Mr Clinton's agenda for domestic
reform can survive.
It would not be the first time that the Clinton team has recovered quickly
from apparent defeats. The president pulled off narrow victories on issues
such as the budget and the North American Free Trade Agreement after
last-minute campaigns of personal lobbying.
However, some administration officials are worried that they are having to
switch all their resources to pass the crime bill at a moment when Mr
Clinton's biggest objective, healthcare reform, is stalled in both the
Senate and the House.
At the same time, Mr Clinton continues to be hamstrung by the scandals and
distractions that have dogged his administration. Mr Roger Altman, the
deputy Treasury secretary, was reported at the weekend to be likely to step
down in the next fortnight after failing to convince senators that he had
not misled them in his testimony on Whitewater.
'It has been discussed, and the fundamental question is whether he can
re-establish the Senate's confidence,' Mr Leon Panetta, the White House
chief of staff, said yesterday.
With rare single-mindedness, Mr Clinton has spoken about nothing but crime
since Thursday's procedural vote in the House which blocked the bill.
After calling a press conference immediately after the vote, Mr Clinton then
hastily arranged to address the National Association of Police Organisations
in Minneapolis on Friday and on Saturday devoted his weekly radio address to
crime. Yesterday, he went to a Maryland church to sustain the barrage with
another speech on the same subject.
Some Democrats believe they have already wrong-footed the Republicans, who
urged the president to strip out the bill's ban on assault guns and put it
to a separate vote.
Republicans originally claimed they had voted to block the bill only because
it had too many social programmes which Mr Clinton has advocated 'to give
kids something to say yes to'.
Stripping out the ban on assault guns in order to rescue the bill is
unacceptable, senior Democrats insist. While in many parts of the US voters
want their members of Congress to vote against any form of gun control, a
ban that does not inconvenience hunters continues to command widespread
popular support, even among gun owners.
If the White House can turn the debate into a straightforward vote on gun
control, it stands a good chance of getting past last week's procedural
block and bringing the measure to a final vote it is confident of winning.
'If this bill comes to a vote it's going to pass. Everyone knows that,' Mr
Panetta said.
What worries Mr Clinton's supporters is whether the push on the crime bill
can be turned into a sustained improvement in the discipline and focus of
the administration - the sort of improvement that Mr Panetta's appointment
last month was intended to bring about.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Proposals drawn up for 'spot' market on gas prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gas industry regulator Ofgas is taking further steps towards creating a
US-style 'spot' market for setting daily prices when Britain's household
supply business is opened to competition in 1996.
Proposals for the system, which would operate on similar lines to the UK
electricity industry's pool, have been drawn up by Morgan Stanley, the US
investment bank, with the aim of ensuring balanced supplies when British Gas
loses its monopoly and broadening competition among suppliers.
Ofgas is keen to see the development of such a market and will issue a
consultation paper on the proposals by the end of this month. 'We'd like to
see the creation of a daily 'spot' market, but if it's to be successful it
must be what people want. We can't impose it on the industry,' said Mr Mark
Higson, director of network operations at Ofgas.
Morgan Stanley's proposal, which was formulated jointly with regional
electricity companies Eastern Electricity and ManWeb, both of which have gas
supply arms, would set up a daily commodity market for gas sales and
purchases.
Almost half the gas used in the US is traded on this daily spot basis
following the deregulation of gas distribution more than 10 years ago. A
natural gas futures contract also trades on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
Independent gas companies already trade small amounts of gas with each other
on the telephone, but once the household market is opened up, there will be
a need for larger quantities to change hands in a more formal marketplace.
By the end of this month, Ofgas will ask gas companies to give their views
on Morgan Stanley's proposal and how this would operate with British Gas's
suggestions on how to balance supply and demand on a daily basis. The need
for a daily spot market arises from the necessity to iron out fluctuations
in the amount of gas in the national pipelines network when British Gas's
monopoly over domestic supply is removed in April 1996.
If an imbalance is created by rival suppliers putting too much or too little
gas into the national network, households could find they are cut off. In
the worst case, an explosion could be caused. Since it is difficult for
suppliers to find out whether they are providing an adequate amount of gas
to the system each day, British Gas has suggested it makes emergency
purchases of gas and later charges those companies which were not balanced.
Morgan Stanley's approach envisages a much wider market where all
participants will be able to buy and sell gas at a centrally-cleared price.
'The advantage of this system is that it could provide a liquid market with
a transparent pricing structure,' said Mr Higson.
