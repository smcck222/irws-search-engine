FT  15 AUG 94 / Rival companies seek to buy remains of Canadian insurer

Rival North American insurance companies are already expressing interest in
buying elements of Confederation Life Insurance, Canada's fourth-largest
insurer, which was seized by financial regulators last week.
Their reaction comes against a background of concern about the longer-term
damage Confed's collapse will inflict on Canada's insurance market. With
assets of CDollars 19.2bn (Pounds 8.9bn), Confed is the largest insurance
company to fail in North America.
Ms Suzanne Labarge, Canada's acting superintendent of financial
institutions, said regulators would move quickly to sell assets before their
value was eroded.
Mr Paul Cantor, Confed chief executive, said negotiations announced last
week to sell the company's British operation to a financial services group
were continuing, and the sale should be announced 'very soon'.
The UK arm provides insurance to 250,000 policyholders and is one of the
biggest pooled pension providers to medium-sized British companies.
It is believed the buyer may be a Canadian insurer with UK operations,
suggesting Sun Life as a possible bidder because it has cash for
acquisitions.
The UK operation is estimated to be worth more than CDollars 350m, but Mr
Cantor has acknowledged that it will be much harder now to sell assets for
the price they would have realised before the regulators intervened.
Insurers that have expressed a public interest in acquiring parts of Confed
include Great-West Life Assurance, North American Life Assurance and Aetna
Canada.
Canadian regulators took control of 123-year-old Confed last Thursday to
prevent a run on its policies and deposits after the failure of long-running
efforts to bail it out. The mutual insurer had suffered a rapidly eroding
capital base leaving it unable to meet liabilities.
The regulators will apply today for a court order to wind up the company and
will order accountancy firm Peat Marwick Thorne, which is managing the
company for the regulator, to sell as many of Confed's assets as possible to
other insurers.
But the cheap buying opportunities for rival companies will be eclipsed by
the severe damage the Canadian industry will suffer for years, according to
the country's insurance officials.
The fund protecting policyholders, known as CompCorp, is fully
industry-sponsored, and analysts predict companies will be overburdened by
the contributions they will have to make.

<TEXT>
Yet another drama has unfolded at the scandal-scarred Opera Bastille in
Paris with the dismissal yesterday of Mr Myung Whun Chung, the acclaimed
South Korean conductor, as its artistic director only a month before the
start of its new season.
Mr Chung won praise at the Bastille for productions such as Shostakovitch's
Macbeth. However, his tenure in Paris has been clouded by the
highly-publicised problems of the Bastille.
It has been well attended but plagued by strikes and financial difficulties
since its glittering opening by President Francois Mitterrand as a
state-of-the-art 'people's opera' on the 200th anniversary of the 1789
French revolution.
The departure of Mr Chung, 41, who joined the Bastille five years ago
following the firing of Mr Daniel Barenboim, ends weeks of wrangling between
him and the Paris Opera's new management team led by Mr Hugues Gall. Mr Gall
is a former bureaucrat who was appointed director-designate last summer
after the election victory of Mr Edouard Balladur's centre-right government.
The battle between the two men came out into the open on Thursday when Le
Monde newspaper published an interview with Mr Chung.
The conductor claimed that the new management was trying to curb his
artistic freedom. Although Mr Chung said he would be willing to make 'a
significant financial sacrifice' to stay at the Bastille, he made it quite
clear that he was not willing to relinquish his power over the choice of
productions or artistes.
However, Mr Gall has made no secret of his intention to exercise full
authority over every aspect of the Paris Opera's activities.
The Opera yesterday issued a formal statement saying that it had terminated
Mr Chung's employment because he had rejected all its proposals to shorten
his contract.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Trade victory for embattled Clinton: Deal 'agreed' on
fast-track negotiating ability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The embattled White House yesterday scored a much needed success when it
reached agreement with House Republicans on a new trade negotiating
authority allowing it to pursue new trade pacts in Latin American and Asia.
The 'fast-track' negotiating authority enables the executive branch to
negotiate trade agreements which Congress promises not to amend. It is seen
as essential to President Clinton's credibility as he seeks trade
liberalisation pacts beyond the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
Uruguay Round and the North American Free Trade Agreement.
A senior administration official said last night that the two sides had also
resolved a big stumbling block to passage of the Uruguay Trade Round
implementing legislation by agreeing a Dollars 12bn-Dollars 14bn financing
package to compensate for lost tariff revenues. Under congressional budget
deficit reduction rules, all legislation which incurs costs must be paid for
when it is approved.
The fast-track authority will be included in the House ways and means
committee implementing legislation. The Senate finance committee has refused
to include it, but when the two committees meet to resolve their
differences, perhaps as early as next week, the administration believes the
Senate conferees will accept the deal worked out.
The senior official refused to give details of the deal. It is understood,
however, that the administration has been forced to give up efforts to
attach a provision which included environment and labour rules as
negotiating objectives. However, there is no provision actually prohibiting
such negotiations.
Many Democrats have said they will oppose granting a fast-track authority
without worker and environment rules. But the senior official said he
believed there would be majorities in both houses to pass the implementing
fast track legislation.
Fears have been expressed on the left and right of both parties that by
joining the World Trade Organisation, which will supersede Gatt, the US will
be giving up some of its sovereignty.
The administration is said to have agreed a provision allowing Congress to
vote to withdraw from the WTO at some time in the future. Analysts say this
is fairly meaningless, since the US constitution gives Congress authority
over trade, and it could withdraw from anything it wants.
The official said Mr Clinton's loss on the crime bill earlier this week
would help, rather than hurt the Uruguay Round vote. 'The president is going
to take the issue to the country. He will gain tremendous support and we
will have a crime bill,' the official said. 'It will help us. It will show
that this president has the ability to turn issues around.'

Iraq has expressed readiness to make peace with Israel, whose cities Baghdad
targeted with Scud missiles in the 1991 Gulf war, Israeli television
reported yesterday. No official comment was available on the surprise
report, broadcast to Israelis accustomed to perceiving Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's government as a hardline foe. The report carried by the
state-run TV organisation said Iraq had relayed a message through a third
party to Israel's ambassador at the UN three months ago, expressing
readiness to discuss peace. The message, written by a senior Iraqi official,
said Baghdad no longer had a dispute with Israel now that the Palestinian
problem was about to be resolved. However, Israel ignored the initiative on
US instructions, the report said.

data
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market staged a recovery yesterday afternoon as a rally in bond
prices followed the announcement of satisfactory US consumer price
statistics. Early trading had seen the FT-SE 100 Index down by more than 27
points, but there was little sign of the selling pressure feared in the wake
of Thursday's interest rate rises in Europe. At the close, the Footsie was
4.1 up on the day at 3,142.3. The index fell 25.2 over the week, with almost
all the loss coming in the wake of rate increases in Sweden and Italy.

FT  13 AUG 94 / As one chess player to another . . .: The lesson that Jeremy
Hanley has failed to grasp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One could not help but be touched by the puzzlement of Jeremy Hanley as,
last week, he gave his first interview as Conservative Party chairman. It
was published the day before a Gallup opinion poll showed that the Labour
Party had an unprecedented 33.3 per cent lead over the Conservatives.
While no one seems to believe that this result would pertain in a general
election it is, nevertheless, chilling for the Conservatives to be presented
with so graphic a premonition of their political annihilation.
Yet, as Hanley plaintively told the Sunday Telegraph, everything seems to be
going swimmingly with the economy.
Inflation and interest rates are at levels not enjoyed since the early 1960s
(when we had never had it so good, apparently). Unemployment is falling
sharply. And last week, the Confederation of British Industry, perpetual
moaners and complainers, reported that for the first time in a decade all of
their 11 regions, from Scotland to the south-west, were increasingly
optimistic about both output and new orders.
For Hanley, whom I know to be a chess player of iron logic, such an apparent
divergence between facts and opinion is genuinely paining, and not just
because his own seat is a bit marginal.
One of Hanley's colleagues, struggling to come up with an explanation, said
it was because the electorate was 'bored' with John Major and the
Conservatives.
The implication was that the nationwide enthusiasm for Anthony Blair, the
Labour leader, was merely a fashion, which had come, and would go, rather
like skateboarding or bungee-jumping.
This may, indeed, be part of the reason, and one must concede that Major's
appeal does not lie in the generation of excitement.
On the other hand, I have always thought that the British people do not want
to be excited by their politicians.
They rather like the idea of boring competence, a la Stanley Baldwin. But
the key word is competence.
And I would not be the first person to point out that the government's
reputation for competence, so assiduously cultivated by 'honest' John Major,
was shattered by Britain's humiliating exit two years ago from the Exchange
Rate Mechanism.
That traumatic event was the main reason why the British economy is now
growing faster than those of its European partners. But everyone realises
that it had been the government's sworn policy, on the political equivalent
of stacks of bibles, never to take the cut-and-run exit from the ERM, even
while a number of wise and experienced commentators had warned that such an
outcome was not only inevitable but desirable.
There is some political injustice in Blair benefiting from this debacle. He
and his wing of the Labour Party, 'the modernisers', had uncritically stood
four-square behind the government's ERM policy, and were as astonished as
anyone by the eventual result.
Indeed, the only Labour MP of any stature who warned of the consequences,
Bryan Gould, has sunk into political oblivion.
The government's big mistake was its brazen refusal to take any
responsibility for the debacle, to pretend, quite shamelessly that what had
happened was an accident that could not have been foreseen, and that its
economic policies remained a seamless web of consistency, rather like one of
Hanley's better games of chess.
It is true that politicians never apologise, and rarely explain, but the
government on this occasion underestimated the public's capacity for
outrage. Norman Lamont's singing in the bath and regretting nothing was
charmingly insouciant, but contrition was the order of the day.
Alas, Hanley does not yet seem to have grasped this lesson. In his interview
he seemed unable to express any genuine regret for the ERM fiasco, and
indeed hinted strongly that this was an experiment we might want to take
part in again.
As one chess player to another, I would implore Hanley to remember that it
is better to admit one's errors during the game, rather than try to justify
them after one has lost.

FT  13 AUG 94 / A harp, a wreath and a sentence in Siberia: Chrystia
Freeland's favourite aunt recounts how she survived a 'child's sentence' in
Stalin's labour camps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
My favourite great-aunt spent 10 years in Stalinist labour camps for two
crimes: buying a funeral wreath and playing the harp at a dinner party.
The funeral wreath was purchased in 1944, when Oleksandra Blavatska, my Aunt
Lesia, was 19 years old. She had pursued her childhood dream of becoming a
businesswoman by enrolling in the newly-established Soviet Trade Institute.
She had been studying for only a few months when Metropolitan Sheptytsky,
head of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, died. He was revered, Lesia says, as
'the holiest of holies' for his defiance of both the Nazis and the Soviets
during the Second World War. Raised in a patriotic and activist Ukrainian
household, Lesia's response was automatic: she called together her
classmates and collected money for a wreath.
'We bought a beautiful wreath with red linden at the centre, as was the
Ukrainian national custom,' Lesia recalls. With what is almost a girlish
giggle, my 69-year-old aunt explains why her funeral flowers were so
provocative: 'And on a black band draped across the wreath we wrote 'To the
unforgettable defender of Ukrainian youth from the students of the Soviet
Trade Institute.' The Bolsheviks - not known for their sense of humour -
could never forgive me for that.'
The day after the funeral, she was expelled from the institute and the
midnight interrogations at KGB headquarters, which began for Lesia as soon
as the Soviet army took over the western Ukrainian city of Lviv,
intensified. But a dinner party a few months later was the last straw. When
a delegation of Soviet Ukrainian writers came to Lviv they were entertained
by Lesia's mother, the city's most accomplished hostess in the old days of
Austro-Hungarian, and later Polish, rule. While Mrs Blavatska charmed the
writers by chatting in French, her daughter, the only harpist in the city
(the harp was a ploy to get Lesia into the conservatory after she had been
expelled from the trade institute) provided a musical accompaniment.
A few weeks later, Lesia was arrested on her way to the conservatory and she
began an education of a different sort. Over the next decade she progressed
from KGB interrogation cells to a tour of Soviet labour camps.
Along the way, she gave birth to my second favourite aunt, Vira, 'Faith',
who spent her early childhood separated from her mother in a Soviet
orphanage.
The only time Vira, now a professor of engineering, refers to her unorthodox
upbringing is in laughing apology for her preference for trousers over
skirts and lack of the culinary talent.
'I was raised by Soviet commandants, how could I be properly civilised?' she
tells me to excuse the store-bought cakes served with tea - a true crime in
a proper Lviv household, especially when the visitor is a relative from
Canada.
Lesia, a vigorous lady who upholds the family name by plying me with home
baking, is equally matter-of-fact in describing KGB interrogation tactics to
me, the sheltered Canadian granddaughter of her cousin (my grandfather) who
got away in 1939.
'The KGB cell had an open window and it was winter, so there was ice and
snow on the floor. It was full of rats. It was exactly seven steps wide: I
know because I paced back and forth all day and all night.' After 18 days in
the isolation cell, Lesia collapsed. 'I was young and I loved to dance but I
told myself that if I was ever again able to walk I would never dance. I've
kept that promise.'
Unconscious, Lesia was carried into a larger, crowded jail cell, where she
spent two months, and then she was sentenced. 'Because I was so young and
they really couldn't find anything at all to accuse me of I was given what
we called 'a child's sentence;'' just 10 years of hard labour and five years
of exile in Siberia.
The journeys between camps were the worst part. 'A hundred prisoners would
be herded into locked cattle cars with a hole in the middle to use as a
toilet. Every day we were given one slice of salted herring, a piece of
bread and a bottle of water,' Lesia says. 'I couldn't bring myself to eat
the herring and maybe that was what saved me.'
Early in her sentence, when she was in a labour camp in the Baltic state of
Estonia, Lesia was conned by more savvy inmates into selling part of her
food ration in exchange for promised assistance to escape. 'This was, of
course, very stupid, because no one ever escaped Stalin's camps. But I was
tricked and I sold them some of my food. My body began to decay and one day
the work captain said he would no longer accept me, so I got even less food.
Slowly, I began to die.'
Saved by a sympathetic doctor in the prison infirmary, Lesia recovered and
was sent to the labour camp in Mordova in northwestern Russia where she
would serve most of her sentence. Vira, born in the Estonian prison, was
initially kept together with other children in a camp adjacent to their
mothers but when the children were 18 months old they were sent to an
orphanage in Siberia.
'If the caretaker at the orphanage was very kind, once a year she would send
me a letter about my daughter. Three times the prison wardens called me and
asked me to give her up for adoption, but each time I refused and began a
hunger strike. Eventually, they gave up,' Lesia says.
While Vira grew up, her mother devoted herself to survival. 'It was a very
select camp: we had the prima ballerina of the Minsk ballet, Hitler's
private secretary, a few Parisians and some Moscow girls who had married
diplomats.'
The diplomats' wives, Lesia remembers, 'laughed at themselves. They used to
say, 'we are here because we had too great a weakness for stockings and
chocolate and so we married American men'.'
'There's no doubt about it, though, it is hard to get out of a labour camp
alive.'
Lesia preserved her body with a rapidly acquired public cunning - no more
selling her food to other inmates - and her soul with small acts of private
defiance. She proudly shows me the relic of one such gesture: a misshapen
gold wedding band, her mother's, which Lesia hid from the prison wardens
during a decade of body searches by wearing it under a dirt-encrusted
bandage on one of her toes.
'For 10 years I didn't take that bandage off. It was so dirty and disgusting
and rotten it made my skin crawl to look at it. But the guards couldn't bear
to examine it too closely either, so I still have my mother's wedding ring.
I think I might be one of the only people who ever managed to hide something
from Stalin's police.'
It is a struggle to reconcile this tough political prisoner, whose bald head
and emaciated body caused Vira, reunited with her mother after a seven-year
separation, to run away in terror, with my charming, very proper aunt, who
prefers Vienna - 'that is Europe, that is culture' she rhapsodises - to the
sky-scrapers and consumer paradise of my native Edmonton, Alberta, proud
home of the world's biggest shopping mall.
My cousin Lesyk, her grand-son, barges in to announce that the tea is
getting cold and the tortes will dry out. 'Don't be a Bolshevik,' Lesia
commands. 'Wait until the lady has finished speaking.'
With a guilty glance at my tattered jeans and bare feet, I realise that the
woman in question is me. I also realise that the old-fashioned politesse on
which my aunt Lesia so sternly insists is part of the defiance which brought
her out of the labour camps alive.
Much of Lviv still wears the grey, hang-dog expression which characterised
all Soviet cities, but in hercrammed flat, Lesia has preserved a bygone
corner of central Europe.
One last question: how did you survive?
'I'm not sure. We former political prisoners often tell each other that the
experience has warped us all somehow. That's probably true, but I think that
I still appear to be quite normal. Maybe it was because my mother was such a
strong disciplinarian and always insisted on good manners. Even in the
labour camps, I never learned to swear, although many did; I never learned
to smoke, although many did; and, unlike the more cosmopolitan girls from
the big cities, I never became a lesbian.'
I think guiltily of the cigarettes hidden in the bottom of my hand-bag and
vow to wear a dress the next time I visit. Perhaps I should even learn how
to bake.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Nice man - but he had to go: Truth of the Matter - Why the
vicar who only believed in 'God' was sacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH DICKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At one time we would have put the Rev Anthony Freeman, vicar of St Mark's
Church, Staplefield, in West Sussex, on the rack and then burned him to
death unless he recanted.
The formidable Dr Keating, of Eton college, had his methods too. A boy who
admitted he was having doubts about the Holy Trinity was told: 'Boy, you
will believe in the Holy Trinity by 3 o'clock this afternoon or I will beat
you until you do.'
In these milder times we just stop paying those accounted heretical. But is
it the monstrous attack on freedom of speech it has been made out to be?
What else can you do with an amiable parson who pops up in his pulpit one
Sunday and says to the faithful: 'Sorry, folks, um, I don't quite know how
to put this, but that He / She / It Out There to Whom we've been beaming our
prayers all these centuries, well, um, He? She? It? isn't out there after
all.
'It is just empty space. The only possible recipient of all that love and
adoration and all those fervid prayers is right here - yes, um, in our own
tummies.'
So he must go. His bishop has said so. But he is a lovely vicar. Paradigm
and paragon of Christian benevolence. Not a peep of criticism of Freeman or
his ministry has crept into the press, which generally salivates over
dismembered priests.
It is a crying shame. And it is not as if the Church is awash with cuddly
and innocent vicars. Cruel and tyrannical bishop, intolerant prelate come
forth]
Enter from the right, the Right (very Right) Reverend Eric Kemp, Bishop of
Chichester, now nearly 80, long past the age when more complacent bishops
have retired. He is the prime and unpopular mover (or remover) in this small
but intriguing ecclesiastical drama which has made headline news and
prime-time TV. Kemp has decided, as he is legally entitled to, that he will
not have parsons, however amiable, who happen not to believe in God.
But here the plot thickens. This thoroughly non-turbulent priest is not an
atheist - so he claims. He does believe in 'God' - the quotes are essential
if clarity is to be retained. But he has come to the conclusion, first
advocated by Don Cupitt, a fellow of a Cambridge College, that by 'God' we
are not referring to a supernatural transcendent Being other than ourselves,
but rather to all those human aspirations, ideals and moral values which are
in some sense 'higher' than ourselves.
'God' is a human construct. On to the blank screen of the universe we
project our own image of beauty, truth and goodness, the noblest image of
ourselves we can conceive. To speak of that image as an objective personal
Agency or autonomous Being is, and has been, a useful expedient in the early
ages of religion. But a more sophisticated age now realises that to believe
It really is 'out there', independently of the projection of the human mind,
is to treat a metaphor as literal fact.
If I say 'my love is a red rose', I will not take kindly to friends who give
me a greenfly spray as a wedding present. On this view 'God' is a
compendious metaphor for all the religious instincts of human beings. So
Freeman still believes in 'God' but not in God.
Bishop Kemp will have none of it. And, in spite of his chauvinist
intransigence over the ordination of women, I fear he is right in this case.
Don Cupitt and Freeman and the 'Sea of Faith' group have (in my view) sold
the pass, chucked out the baby with the bathwater and severed the spinal
cord of Christian faith. Those innocent little quotation marks are
profoundly important.
Their basic proposition is attractive to any thoughtful person trying to
make rational sense of religious belief. There is something hauntingly
incomprehensible about an invisible, intangible and ultimately unknowable
Transcendent Being. The paradoxes of human discourse about God present human
intelligence with almost intolerable perplexity.
St Augustine saw that 1,500 years ago. There can be no literal discourse
about God, only pointers towards Him. (Or Her or It.) Theologians use
analogue or metaphor, the mystics poetry and visionary language, knowing
perfectly well that it is not, and cannot be, literal.
But, unlike Freeman, traditional theology believes that these metaphors are
not mistakes but essential for any discourse about a Divine Being who in his
own inner essence is not part of the space-time continuum we inhabit.
So, if a meteorite were to hit this planet and reduce it and us to fizzing
gas 'God' would cease to exist; his light would go out with the destruction
of the human projector. But, on the other hand, if the whole cosmos got
folded up into a black hole and vanished up its own fundament, God would
still be God.
Why is the issue so important - important enough to sack a kind and popular
priest? Because the heart of authentic religious experience is at stake. The
central religious experience is an encounter with a Divine Being who is
Other.
It is possible to enter into a relationship with that Other which has two
centres. This Other is experienced by the human ego as One in whom reside
transcendent Beauty and Truth and the mysterious quality of the Holy. But
also the Other is another 'I' to whom I can say 'Thou' and who can address
me from his own autonomous personal Being with a responding 'thou'.
In the course of the transactions between these two personal foci a
relationship of intense exchange begins to take place. The strange visionary
poetry of the mystics is the only barely adequate language which begins to
describe this spiritual experience. But essential to it is this quality of
personal love and trust - a sense that there is One who makes a promise to
the human spirit.
Of all the issues at stake in this drama that seems to me to be one which is
of key significance. God is a God who makes promises to me and keeps them.
Nothing located inside me or inside the human community can serve that
purpose. A metaphor cannot make a promise.
But a lot of other orthodox Christian beliefs get scrubbed as well.
Creation, Redemption, Incarnation, Atonement, Resurrection and Eternal Life
get the chop. No institution committed to teaching and upholding those
doctrines can continue to employ a teacher who denies them all, or declares
them to be no more than significant fairy tales.
Now it is quite possible that Freeman is right and the tradition of catholic
Christianity is wrong. But he really should not feel aggrieved if the church
which is committed to those beliefs decides it can no longer employ him in
order to undermine its basic doctrines. The fact that a lot of his
congregation agree with him does not make it any better; it just proves he
is a charming and persuasive chap.
Underlying this rather sad story is a much deeper issue, of which Freeman
and his friends may be a symptom. There is no doubt that the formulations of
traditional Christian Doctrine do need radical restructuring. The New Age
cults are speaking to a widespread spiritual hunger which is not being
addressed by mainstream catholic or evangelical Christianity. They emphasise
the 'god within', the divine in nature, the earth mother, the organic
continuum from inanimate rocks to the highest spiritual being. They see
institutional Christianity as the enemy of that new mystical awareness.
The restructuring of Christian doctrine will have to respond to that hunger.
But it must also preserve a philosophical and intellectual rigour which
Freeman and the New Age cults both lack.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Sport: You must know the score - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK LAWRENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They are usually the size of a juggernaut and they are everywhere you look
at a major championship. Everywhere, that is, except where the modern player
looks. 'Scoreboard? What is a scoreboard?'
The one on the 18th hole at Southern Hills is particularly large but,
because of a row of giant oaks, has been positioned in such a way as to make
its contents unreadable to the players competing in this week's USPGA
championship until they reach the final green. But what does it matter
anyway when the top young players never seem to want to avail themselves of
the wisdom a scoreboard offers?
Consider what has happened at the last two major championships. First, we
reeled from Ernie Els's revelation that on the final hole at the US Open he
was about to attempt a death or glory blow from the trees without knowing
whether it was necessary or not.
Els was lucky. His caddy stopped him just before he was about to embark on
his reckless course of action, pointing out that a birdie three was not
necessary, the four would win him the tournament and a five would get him
into a play-off. Els settled upon the latter figure, won the play-off and is
now feted wherever he goes instead of being ridiculed, as he surely would
have been if left to his own devices. As he admitted, on a scale of one to
10, his chances of successfully completing the stroke were no more than one.
But that was as nothing compared to what happened at the Open. There Jesper
Parnevik was not nearly so fortunate. He came to the 18th hole leading by no
less than two strokes. Not that he knew. There might have been scoreboards
everywhere but Parnevik kept the blinkers on.
With his approach shot he went for the flag which was cut just above a sharp
incline, with anything falling short resulting in an almost certain bogey.
Parnevik fell short. A shot to the 'fat' of the green and two putts for a
par four would have got him into a play-off even accounting for Nick Price's
eagle three on the 17th. Parnevik took five. Only then did he look at the
scoreboard. As Price's heroics were recorded, he looked in disbelief.
What is it about this generation of players that they purposefully deprive
themselves of what seem to be vital pieces of knowledge?
Every journalist reports a tournament in the same way. Some might
concentrate on the personalities of the leading scorers and others write
about the golf. But everyone writes in some way about the leader, how he is
doing in relation to par, and how the other players are faring. This is
always in regard to how far they are behind the pace-setter.
There is hardly a young professional who approaches his round in this way.
So they have shot 72 in the first round? They see that they are on level
par. So the winning score in such-a-such a tournament is usually 12 under?
That means they have to shoot three 68s in the rounds that remain, or
variations on that theme.
They never consider themselves to be eight behind the player who has opened
with a 64: they are 12 behind their final target. History tells them that
the leader is going to endure a humbling last three days, so there is no
point worrying about his or her score.
Eight times out of 10 this logic serves them well, but on the final holes of
a major championship that theory is worthless.
'I don't think I could play the 18th hole of a major without knowing exactly
what I needed to score to win,' Greg Norman said this week.
Jack Nicklaus said: 'I agree with the philosophy of not worrying about what
anybody else is doing for the first 63 or so holes of a tournament. I never
looked at a scoreboard either. But I always kept a close eye on the
scoreboards over the closing holes because - and this depended on how I was
doing of course - it would dictate how I played certain shots.'
Arnold Palmer said that he always looked at scoreboards wherever they were
on a course, whether it was the first hole or the 72nd. He just liked to see
how everyone else was doing and whether he was playing as well or as badly
as he thought.
One thing is abundantly clear: it is experience of playing a game at this
level that teaches a golfer that scoreboards are not just things to keep
spectators up to date with what is going on.
It was unfortunate for Parnevik to discover the hard way. But tomorrow
evening the leader, after his drive on to the 18th fairway, will have to jog
up to the green to discover exactly what is required.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Sport: Struck out on the field of dreams - Patrick Harverson
says a players' strike is ludicrous and should be banned / Baseball
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Lexington Avenue express is not the only means of getting to Yankee
Stadium, but it is by far the most satisfying. The subway train rumbles
through Harlem and under the Bronx River to emerge blinking into the
sunlight alongside the great ballpark. As the train pulls into the 161st
Street station, the appetite is whetted by a tantalising glimpse between the
stands of the lush grass in rightfield.
As I stepped off the train last week, I experienced the familiar rush of
excitement as thousands of other baseball fans walked up River Avenue to
join the long lines at the ticket booths. The division-leading Yankees, who
this season have been playing their best baseball in 13 years, were at home
to the Cleveland Indians, and Yankee Stadium seemed the perfect place to be
in New York on a warm Saturday afternoon in mid-summer.
At Dollars 11.50 a seat, watching the Yankees is not cheap, but for that you
get an upper deck seat in the sun, three or more hours of major league
baseball, and a big, lovely slice of history.
Yankee Stadium is not just any old sports ground. It is known as 'The House
that Ruth Built', after the great Babe Ruth, whose exploits attracted the
huge crowds which ultimately paid for the stadium's construction. When it
opened in 1923, Yankee Stadium was the wonder of the sports world, with its
imposing entrance and spectacular two-tier stands. It remains so today, even
after a mid-1970s facelift that changed much of the way it looks but which,
thankfully, left history intact.
The seats high in the upper deck afforded a splendid view. As the Yankee
players jogged out for the opening inning against Cleveland, the bright
white of their uniforms sparkled against the green of the outfield and the
brown earth of the diamond-shaped basepaths. While the outfielders languidly
tossed balls around as they awaited the arrival of the Indians' first
batter, I bought a hot dog from one of the vendors who roam the stands
shouting 'Dawgs - Who Wants Dawgs?' in mustard-thick accents.
Yet my enjoyment of the game was marred by the certain knowledge that the
Yankees' great run of 1994 was heading for a premature end. This was not
because I had had some premonition that the team was going to stop playing
the smart, unfussy baseball that had taken it to the top of the table, but
because I knew the team was going to stop playing, full stop.
Just days before the Cleveland game, the players' union had announced plans
for an indefinite strike, starting on August 12, to protest against the
baseball owners insistence on including in the new labour contract a salary
cap - a limit on the total amount each team can pay its players.
The owners, who have been unable to agree among themselves on how to divide
baseball's revenues so that the clubs in smaller cities such as Milwaukee,
Pittsburgh and San Diego are not forced into extinction trying to compete
with the wealthy, big-spending clubs in cities such as New York, Chicago,
and Los Angeles, view the salary cap as a way of controlling their
rapidly-escalating costs. The players regard the cap as an infringement of
the free market and oppose pay limits.
Yesterday, the union made good on its threat, and the 1994 season - so far a
marvellous one, full of promise, not just for the Yankees but for other
teams, and for several players who are poised to break some of baseball's
oldest records - came to an inglorious halt.
The strike is maddening. Irrespective of the merits, or otherwise, of the
players' actions, there is something ludicrous about millionaire sportsmen
striking against multi-millionaire owners in an argument over money.
As anyone who watches a game or reads the sports pages knows, there is
plenty of money in baseball. The average salary for a player is Dollars 1.2m
(Pounds 770,000) a year. Revenues from attendance, television contracts and
merchandising total almost Dollars 2bn a year. And the 28 teams of Major
League Baseball are estimated to be worth a combined Dollars 2.5bn. With
that much money swilling around, it is remarkable that a way cannot be found
to share the bounty of America's national game.
Not only is the strike ludicrous, but there should be a law against it.
Indeed, were it any other US sport there would be: earlier this summer,
baseball managed to fight off an attempt in Congress to overturn its
precious, and unique, exemption from anti-trust laws. Both the owners and
the players have overlooked something important in their dispute: the fans.
It is they, after all, who pay everyone's wages.
This may be a cliche, but it is true. The players are not paid millions of
dollars because a home run, a strike, or a great catch are of themselves
valuable commodities. Gold, oil, copper - these are valuable commodities. A
home run is valuable because people are willing to pay to see it happen,
either in the flesh or on television. If people were not willing to pay to
watch big league baseball, players could hit all the home runs they wanted
but would still never earn a cent.
Everyone in the business of baseball is party to a three-sided contract
between the players, the owners, and the fans. The players have broken that
contract. The owners are equally culpable for having made such a hash of
their own affairs. The fans should sue.
If they do not sue (and this being America, someone probably will), fans
will be left to do what they spend much of the year doing anyway - moaning
about the greedy players and greedier owners. A few were energised enough
this week to plan a fans' strike, but little came of it. Why? Because fans -
the poor pathetic things they are - love baseball, even if baseball does not
love them. Thursday was the last chance to see a game before the shutters
came down, and hundreds of thousands paid to do just that.
Now the baseball bats are silent. Yankee Stadium should have been alive this
Saturday with the sound of 40,000 fans cheering on their team against the
world champions from Toronto. Instead, the great ballpark will be deserted.
And the Lexington express from Manhattan will rumble past almost empty. All
that will be on offer at Yankee Stadium is that inviting glimpse of the
lush, green grass in rightfield.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Motoring: A sporting treble from Honda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a scurrilous rumour, spread by young men whose favourite reading
matter is go-faster motoring magazines, that all Honda cars leave the
factory with an orange disabled parking sticker on the windscreen and a
Zimmer frame in the boot.
This is as untrue as it is unfair. Of course, people with the wisdom that
comes only with age do buy lots of Hondas. They know they are reliable, hold
their value, and combine the refinement of the Jaguars and large Rovers they
once drove with running costs a pensioner can afford. It would have been
amusing to have had a member of the 'Hondas are fit only for the well
over-60s' brigade sitting beside me for the last three weeks.
I have been enjoying entertaining (though safe and responsible) motoring in
a trio of Honda coupes. You might call them Honda's sporting treble.
First, the Civic Coupe. A cynic would dismiss this pretty, semi-sporting
four-seater with a realistic boot as a sheep in wolf's clothing but that is
to miss its point. A lot of people are buying cars mainly because they like
their looks and can afford the price.
The Civic coupe looks as if it would be a high performer. In fact, it goes
well, but no better than the Civic hatchback or saloon whose mechanical bits
and pieces (1.5-litre, 16-valve engine and five-speed manual or four-speed
automatic transmission) it shares. Power steering is standard.
Its suspension is reasonably taut and handling reactions agreeably quick. On
some road surfaces there is a surfeit of tyre noise but this little coupe -
made in Honda's US factory to traditional Japanese quality standards - is
really quite urbane in character. One could use it for commuting or shopping
in the week and head for the open road - should you be lucky enough to find
one - at the weekend. It would perform either role just as capably.
The price is the pleasantest surprise of all; from Pounds 10,900 (manual) or
Pounds 11,670 (automatic) and its fuel consumption up to 39mpg or 7.5
l/100km). Grandmas and women in their 20s alike fell for its charms while I
had it on test.
Next, I moved on to the latest Pounds 21,445 Honda Prelude with a 2.2-litre
V-TEC engine. V-TEC stands for variable valve timing and lift electronic
control. What it does is to endow an engine with a benign form of
schizophrenia. At low speeds it thinks it is a carthorse, at high speeds a
racehorse. The result is that you can drive the Prelude at 30mph in 5th gear
without a hint of protest. But floor the accelerator in second or third, see
the rev counter needle flick past 5,000rpm, and the engine totally changes
character. There is a musical rasp from the exhaust and the quiet,
easy-going plodder becomes a sprinter.
Honda claims a top speed of 140mph/225kph and 0-60mph (0-96kph) acceleration
in 7.1 seconds. In the real world of speed limits, it is the Prelude's other
virtues that impress. For example, the unique electronic all-wheel steering.
This makes it almost disconcertingly nimble in town traffic and takes the
threat of tail-wag out of emergency manoeuvres on wet roads.
This beautifully built four-seater (children fit better in the back than
adults) comes with air conditioning, anti-lock brakes, twin airbags and
powered sunroof. It will do around 31mpg (9.1 l/100km) - providing the V-TEC
engine is not in racehorse mode too often.
Finally, the NSX is a true supercar, in the same performance class as a
Ferrari. It is made almost entirely from aluminium alloys - the technology
is more aerospace than automotive - and the engine is a 270 horsepower V6
3-litre with V-TEC. I had driven it previously on the de-restricted German
autobahn and on the banked high-speed circle at Millbrook proving ground in
Bedfordshire. So I knew that the faster it went, the safer it felt and that
Honda's claimed 160mph/257kph maximum was attainable.
But this time I used it in the real world of main roads with speed cameras
and country lanes where a tractor and trailer or a child on a pony could be
round the next corner. It is incredibly easy to drive, with quite a light
clutch, precise gearshift, power steering with maximum assistance at low
speed, diminishing as you go faster, anti-lock brakes and electronic
traction control. I found the driving position perfect.
Just like the Prelude, it trickled down to my local supermarket in top, ran
with suppressed eagerness in the motorway pack and drifted unprotestingly
through the lanes of Kent and Sussex.
The ultra-squat and hugely grippy tyres thump a good deal and on
concrete-paved motorways their roar half-drowns the radio. At an angled
junction, visibility to the rear quarter is poor.
Driven like a normal car, the NSX will give about 26-27mpg (10.6 l/100km) on
a journey. Looked at with a cold and logical eye, it is a pure indulgence.
But what a wonderful toy. One final thought. If cars were watches, all
Hondas would be chronometers.

FT  13 AUG 94 / FT Ski Expedition: Golden triangle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are attempting to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They are currently in South America.
At 12,000ft up in the Andes, where the Incas once preserved the mummified
remains of their nobility, we found a golden triangle of ski resorts
glistening beneath the Chilean sun. Not long ago, the mummified body of an
Inca child was found on the lower slope of El Plomo (17,810ft).
Today, this peak towers above the twin valleys in which three of South
America's best ski resorts are found within a mile or so of each other: La
Parva, Valle Nevado and El Colorado. Each is a significant ski area in its
own right. Together, they form the biggest and most exciting ski area in
South America, less than 40 miles from Santiago.
They are very different in style and terrain. La Parva, where the well-to-do
of Santiago have second or even third homes, has some of the most
challenging and varied skiing. It has no hotel, but one is planned.
Valle Nevado is an upmarket, expensive French-owned resort with excellent
open-bowl skiing. The resort complex is built above the Valle del Cepo, a
vast snowy ravine, which is not part of the ski area. Nevertheless, skiers
occasionally stray into the valley by mistake, and the resort maintains a
refuge stocked with basic rations to provide shelter until a third party can
reach them.
El Colorado, arguably Chile's biggest ski area, mainly attracts
day-trippers. It has some sublime off-piste skiing, with the steep
powder-fields of Santa Teresita stretching more than two miles down to the
road that snakes its way up to Valle Nevado. But you need to arrange
transport back, and preferably a guide (ours was Orlando Diaz, head of the
ski patrol).
Between them the three areas have more than 100km of skiing and more than 40
lifts. They are linked but as yet do not have a simple Three-Valleys-style
lift ticket.
Although it is easy to ski from Valle Nevado - which attracts an
international clientele - to each of the other two, direct access between La
Parva and El Colorado is not so clear cut, partly because of rivalry: both
are vying for local skiers from Santiago.
No other capital city in the world has so much skiing on its doorstep as
Santiago. Not much further afield is Portillo right on the Argentine border
and the Trans-Andean (Uspallata) pass which provides access via Mendoza to
Las Lenas and some of the best skiing in Argentina.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Sport: Blame the weather - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Returning from an almost tropical holiday in France, I was not surprised to
find everyone in England talking about the hot and humid weather. Especially
cricket lovers, since cricket and weather are inseparable and should the
cricket fail, the hot weather is an inexhaustible culprit. Should the
cricket flourish, hot weather is almost too glorious for words.
Almost, but not quite. On June 16 1932, White Willow of the Daily Telegraph
reported the game between Essex and Yorkshire at Leyton in majestic style,
starting with the weather. 'Under the flaming skies of Leyton yesterday
Yorkshire's opening batsmen, Holmes and Sutcliffe, were kings of the match
from morn till evening, the Essex bowlers and fieldsmen being their abject
slaves in a bondage that is not yet ended.'
In the first day's sunshine Percy Holmes and Herbert Sutcliffe scored 423
runs. Before lunch on the second day they had scored 555, a world-record
first-wicket partnership, whereupon Sutcliffe got himself out. Yorkshire
declared at 555 for 1 and 'as Holmes and Sutcliffe stood in front of the
score-board waiting to be photographed, the figures were altered to 554]'
Spectators, telegrams and messages of protest quickly accumulated, the
scorers managed to find an overlooked no-ball and the record was confirmed.
This summer, with glory more elusive in English cricket, the heat was
assigned a grimmer role. Scores on the first day of the Hampshire v
Gloucestershire match at Portsmouth were in a lower league: Hampshire 192
all out; Gloucestershire 58 for 5. The Daily Telegraph began its report on
July 15 in angry style: 'When 15 wickets fall in a day, it is probably safe
to say that the two sides involved are not playing on a shirt front. For a
four-day match, this pitch is clearly too dry, having had 15 days with no
water whatsoever, either from the heavens or from the groundsmen, sprinkled
on it.'
Groundsmen, like the turf they tend, find hot weather troublesome. They can
always be held responsible for problems it produces on the field of play.
Little interference with nature is often seen as wilful neglect, as at
Portsmouth or at Edgbaston on May 25. There was no play between Warwickshire
and Kent in the Benson and Hedges Cup because the ground was too wet. The
cover-all Brumbrella had not been used in case it encouraged a fungal
infection that was damaging the grass. Kent lost the 'bowl-out' that
replaced the game. They were not amused.
On the other hand, interference with nature is often condemned as excessive.
Steve Wright, Leicestershire's assistant groundsman, drenched, rolled, then
kept dry the wicket at Grace Road ready for his county's game against South
Africa on July 30. The wicket was fast and the tourists' captain Kepler
Wessels was hit on his painful right arm by a shooter. The tourists' pacemen
were on the brink of finishing off Leicestershire's batting when a downpour
ended play before tea on the last day. Wessels declared: 'The pitch is
sub-standard.'
In July 1868 there was about an hour of abandoned play in the game between
Surrey and Lancashire at the Oval described in match reports as 'due to
excessive heat'. A helpful lady at the Oval said the only reference to
weather on her information machine was the break in play in the England v
Australia Oval Test a century later, when the crowd helped mop up the rain
after a savage cloudburst. It left Derek Underwood enough time to bowl the
Australians out and level the series. Not good summer weather, but useful
cricketing weather.
'I've got nothing else to say about the weather,' sighed the assistant
contentedly, 'except that everyone here is praying for rain.'
At Trent Bridge they were unsure how to apportion the blame between God and
rain when their Sunday game against Surrey on July 24 was 'typhooned off'.
The teams carried on playing when heavy rain fell, but gave up when fierce
lightning rent the sky. The crowd, I was told, went home wearing bin-liners,
but not before one of them had counted 120 flashes of lightning in five
minutes.
Storms always make good reading. At the start of June 1975, one official
from the Derbyshire weather centre, unwilling to shut out any possibility,
forecast: 'Sunny periods, scattered showers, sleet or snow on mountains;
winds northerly, fresh or strong.' Wise man. At Buxton on the first day,
Lancashire scored 477 for five declared. On the second day there was the
worst summer snow in Britain since 1888. On the third day, play resumed in
time for Derbyshire to be all out on a drying wicket, for 42 in the first
innings, then 87 in the second and lose by an innings and 348 runs.
Derbyshire's secretary told me that the recent hot spell had not really
effected them. They had only played at Derby when the heat-wave was gentle,
so there was never any question of 'sun stopped play' or 'good light stopped
play', which the Derby ground has suffered because its wicket faces
east-west, into the evening sun. You never know with Derbyshire. Or the
weather.

FT  13 AUG 94 / As They Say in Europe: Environmentally unsound news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A French holiday has revealed a flaw in this column. It is based on reading
newspapers in an environment for which they were not designed: a bit like
drinking Swiss wine in Swindon. This problem may seem obvious to a
non-journalist, but those in the trade would not laugh at those reading
Sud-Ouest in London rather than the Lot.
Over the past three weeks it emerged that Le Figaro makes far more sense
over a dish of saucisse-frites, at a lay-by on the RN20 outside Chateauroux,
than it ever did on the 8.20am into Waterloo. There are its marvellous
weather reports. There is news of the rich pickings to be found in new
discoveries about the work of the poet Arthur Rimbaud.
At such times the actual opinions of the newspaper in question are
irrelevant. The views of Sud-Ouest on Bosnia seem neither notably exotic nor
especially banal over a kir on the terrasse of one's gite.
It is one's own newspapers that suddenly seem odd or absurd. The Daily Mail
stood out on the news-stand with a lead story about a French air traffic
controllers' strike. An excited headline writer, dipping deep into his
treasure chest of original thought, shrieked: 'Britons in holiday flight
misery.'
One wonders what is most unattractive about this summary: is it the
concentration on one insular aspect of the affair, the use of the word
'Britons,' or the overtones of paranoia and chauvinism in the suggestion
that it was all a foreign plot aimed at the island race? It aroused the
feeling you get when catching sight of drunken fellow-countrymen in the
corner of some foreign bar that is forever England.
In France the papers seemed, by comparison, phlegmatic and reasonable.
Perhaps it was just because it was August and everyone was away, but even
the provocation of a commentary in the American magazine Forbes advising its
readers, composed exclusively of rich businessmen, to pull their money out
of France aroused little passion in the newspapers. (It did cause a bit of a
stir in financial circles, though.)
One of the writers of the column was Steve Hahnke, an American academic, the
other Sir Alan Walters, economic adviser to Margaret Thatcher when she was
prime minister. He continually upset Nigel Lawson, then chancellor, around
the turn of the decade. Lawson believed his position was being undermined by
the advice given by Sir Alan. In a typically British solution, both
resigned.
The issue was the European exchange rate mechanism, which Sir Alan deplored.
He said Britain should have no truck with it. He is now attacking the French
for sticking to an overvalued exchange rate against the D-Mark even though
the ERM itself has been shattered. In his column in Forbes he told the
French government it was 'too clever by half' - just one more reason to
avoid investing in the country. The others were a rigid labour market, slow
growth, which allegedly made official forecasts a joke, and corruption.
Whether by accident or design, Le Monde juxtaposed its report of the attack
with a long piece on the marvellous performance of French exports as
reflected in the latest trade figures. Many innocents might conclude that if
France suffers any economic problems an overvalued currency is not one of
them. Britain's pound has fallen in line with Sir Alan's recommendations and
yet delivers endless large trade deficits and inadequate investment.
A business daily, La Tribune, seemed to find the attack a bit of a joke.
'The impression grows: we upset our American friends.' It then referred to a
Newsweek report on 'France's faded glory' last May and the Wall Street
Journal's scarifying account of domestic corruption. 'In brief it seems our
beautiful country is at the edge of suffocation and American pension funds
would do better to go and have a look elsewhere . . . In Balladurian France,
where courtesy reigns, we have lost the habit of those lively
anti-government criticisms which flourished when the Socialists were in
charge.'
It then argued that American attacks were acceptable when they concerned
'socialist-communist power' but were out of place when targeted at a 'free
market power practising a rather orthodox monetary policy and showing
considerable calm in the face of social malaise.' It is nice to think of the
Forbes' columnists as a pair of lefties, unwilling to support a government
that puts anti-inflationary orthodoxy at the top of the economic agenda.
Misunderstandings abound, cross-border dialogue seems impossible, yet it all
goes down very well after a light lunch of confit de canard, cassoulet and a
bottle of rose. But the implications are frightful: does it mean that one
has to go to Frankfurt to appreciate its Allgemeine Zeitung?

FT  13 AUG 94 / Russia discovers the rape victim: Lori Cidylo looks at a
growing, and surprisingly frank, public debate on what has long been a
hidden crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LORI CIDYLO

<TEXT>
When Kira, a 17-year-old university student, was raped by a neighbour in a
rural village on the outskirts of Moscow, she agonised for months over
whether she should tell her parents. Terrified and ashamed, the young woman,
who had become pregnant as a result of the attack, decided to keep the
knowledge to herself.
But rumours of the incident spread through the small village. One night, a
young man beat her mercilessly, calling her a 'tramp'. When Kira staggered
through the door that evening, her father informed her that he 'could not
live in the same house with a whore', and cast her out. Her mother added:
'You have shamed us.'
A graphic account of Kira's rape, which appeared in the popular daily
Komsomolskaya Pravda - the first article on rape the newspaper has published
 -created shock waves in a country still reluctant to address crimes of
violence against women.
'The most important thing I want to say is that what happened is not your
fault,' Natasha Gaidarenko, a psychologist who has become a pioneer in rape
crisis counselling, wrote in the same issue. 'Even if a woman flirts with a
man . . . even if she lets him kiss her, it does not mean she has consented
to what followed . . . In every case, responsibility always lies with the
rapist . . . you are in no way responsible for the horrible things that
happened to you.'
That is a revolutionary notion in Russia, where many people still subscribe
to the myth that rape is a crime of passion and that women 'provoke' rapists
by dressing or behaving seductively.
Under glasnost many explosive issues burst on to the printed page. But rape
remained outside the selective sieve used by the communists to filter out
unpleasant realities.
Many Russians still believe that rape occurs rarely, if at all, in their
country, although experts say the crime is endemic. 'Russia is an incredibly
rape-prone society because of the high level of alcoholism and the low
status of women,' says Martina Vandenberg, who has counselled rape victims
in Britain and the US. Aleksei Ignatov, a lawyer who specialises in sexual
assault, says the number of rapes reported each year - 13,600 in 1992 -
represents about one-tenth the total actually committed.
But there are signs that ideas about rape are beginning to change. Once
regarded as a bourgeois crime that afflicted only the decadent west, rape
has suddenly become the focus of an unusually frank debate.
After Kira's story was published, Gaidarenko said she received more than 900
letters from women around the country who said that they, too, had been
raped. Most had suffered alone, in silence, sometimes for decades. The few
who dared to tell someone, usually a mother or a close friend, were often
ostracised. Many wrote that they felt deeply ashamed and suffered from
depression, insomnia and feelings of helplessness. Some said they had
attempted suicide.
'When a woman is raped, she is afraid to go to the police and she is afraid
of being judged by her family. Everyone turns away from her. She has nowhere
to go,' says Galina Chentsova, a psychiatrist in St Petersburg.
But Gaidarenko, who heads the Moscow Sexual Assault Recovery Centre,
Russia's first rape crisis centre, is hoping to change all that. At the
centre, which opened in April, women receive counselling and medical care
from psychologists and doctors who are sensitive to the special needs of
rape victims.
Most of the women feel isolated because they are unaware of how prevalent
rape is, Gaidarenko says. 'When we first bring a group of women together,
each one thinks that this is her own unique experience. When they discover
that they have all been through the same thing, they are in a state of
shock. They wonder, 'Can it be true that this pain is not mine alone?' Then
they start to talk about it and the healing process begins.'
Rape counsellors say it is crucial that those dealing with the victim, such
as police and doctors, understand her feelings of powerlessness and tendency
to blame herself and not compound those feelings.
But women who report that they were raped are often regarded by police with
hostility, scepticism, salaciousness, and even mockery. One woman, whose
boss forced her to perform fellatio, says that when she reported the
incident, the police laughed at her and told her that she had not been
raped. Doctors, too, are often insensitive and may adopt an accusatory tone.
One 15-year-old victim recalls being asked: 'Did he take your pants off or
did you take them off yourself?'
Lola Karim, a gynaecologist who works at the centre, said: 'We tried to open
the centre in a hospital, but all of the doctors we spoke to refused. They
said, 'But women bring it on themselves.' They felt that this was not an
important issue and that we were just a bunch of hysterical women.'
Karim says that hospital personnel often turn victims away. 'They tell her
to go to the police and file a report first, even if she is injured and
needs care.' The few hospitals which can do an evidentiary exam, a necessity
if the victim decides to prosecute, require a pass which only the police can
issue. But police often refuse to issue the pass because they do not believe
the victim or because they have been bribed by the rapist.
Although Gaidarenko estimates that 70 per cent of women who are raped are
raped by men they know, in Russia, acquaintance rape is largely ignored or
denied. Women who are raped by men they trust, and often like, such as
co-workers, friends or dates, often wonder whether they have 'really' been
raped.
Larissa Korneva, a psychologist at the Centre for Gender Studies in St
Petersburg, says she questioned the validity of her perceptions even as she
was struggling with a fellow student who tried to rape her on a beach. The
two had spent the day picnicking and swimming with friends and, she recalls,
she had felt attracted to him.
Some American researchers believe that acquaintance rape is facilitated by a
socialisation process which encourages sexually aggressive behaviour in men.
In a three-year study by psychologist Mary Koss, 53 per cent of US college
men admitted to kissing a woman against her will, 60 per cent admitted to
touching a woman's breast against her wishes, 37 per cent said they had
touched a woman's genitals without consent and 15 per cent admitted to
attempting or committing at least one rape. The most striking finding was
that 84 per cent of the men who had committed rape said that what they had
done was definitely not rape.
Although no comparable study has been done in Russia, many Russian experts
agree that socialisation plays a primary role in cases of acquaintance rape.
'The cultural message given to Russian boys is 'take, don't ask',' while
women are trained to submit, Korneva says.
Olga Zayarnaya, a psychologist in Ekaterinburg who has counselled rapists as
well as victims, says men often deceive themselves into thinking that
acceptance of some type of sexual foreplay, such as kissing, means a woman
is willing to have sex. Such men, she says, 'honestly do not believe that
they have raped anyone'.
Sasha, a 29-year-old translator, is a typical example of such a man.
Although Sasha admits that he sometimes uses 'forceful persuasion' with
women who are reluctant to have intercourse, he does not consider himself a
rapist.
While acquaintance rape is a serious and under-reported problem, some
researchers believe that marital rape may be the most prevalent type of
sexual assault because of prevailing social attitudes. When Marina Baskaova,
a sociologist at the Moscow Centre for Gender Studies, attempted to study
the issue, she discovered that her respondents 'didn't understand the
question. It never occurred to them that a husband could rape his own wife.'
Zayarnaya, who divorced her husband after he tried to rape her, recalls the
reaction of her friends. 'They said, 'so what? That's normal. He is your
husband. He doesn't do it every day. So he lost control once. What's the big
deal?''
Rape counsellors agree that perceptions about rape are unlikely to change
until attitudes towards the role of women change. 'Women must be equal
partners, not servants who clean the house and fulfil their husband's sexual
needs,' says Karim. 'Men - and women - must understand that every woman has
the right to decide, 'do I want to be intimate or not?' and that no one has
the right to invade her body and violate her soul.'

FT  13 AUG 94 / Baby boomers and the counter-culture: A Grateful Dead
concert took Barry D Wood's thoughts back to Woodstock. He asks why the
optimism vanished
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY D WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glenn and Ira Goldfarb were not yet five when I attended my first Grateful
Dead concert in Berkeley 24 years ago. Typical of new generation Dead-heads,
the Goldfarb brothers go to several of the band's concerts each year. Months
ago they identified two nights in Washington as the time to escape from
wives and children and commune with a past they have romanticised but never
experienced.
The brothers ordered concert tickets. When we met, Glenn and Ira were
already in the de rigueur brightly coloured tie-dyed T-shirts that hark back
to psychedelic Haight Ashbury, where the Grateful Dead were already a legend
by the late 1960s. Few would have guessed the Glenn is a chef and Ira a tax
accountant.
On a hot summer night, Jerry Garcia, Grateful Dead vocalist, guitarist and
song writer, wore purple shorts and T-shirt. He arrived back stage in a golf
cart, overweight, tired and looking older than his 51 years. His frizzy hair
is white. There were deep creases behind his dark glasses, a legacy of too
much hard living.
The band began to play. Any lingering reservations about whether I wanted to
be there disappeared.
The tilting country rock melodies invited movement and response. When Garcia
sang cheers welled up from the crowd of 60,000. 'Come hear Uncle John's
band, down by the river side, he's come to take his children home.'
The voice still projects the sweet, mournful high notes. It was like the old
days and remained so for two hours through a gentle rain willingly endured
by the young and not so young alike. Pipes were passed. The pungent aroma of
marijuana was pervasive. People swayed to the music.
Beautiful girls with long hair and flowing skirts danced in the stadium
corridors and sidelines just as their mothers may have done. I realised that
I am like the Goldfarbs, reaching out to connect with something authentic
that has been lost.
Garcia called the Grateful Dead performance at the original Woodstock in
1969 miserable. That is one reason these Bohemian troubadours were not
invited back for the 25th anniversary extravaganza Woodstock 94: 'Two More
Days of Peace and Music.' But they would not have gone anyway. 'You can't
put lightning in a bottle twice,' said Dennis McNally, a PhD in American
history and long-time Grateful Dead publicist.
The year 1969 stands out for two reasons: the landing on the moon and
Woodstock. The vision, ingenuity and tenacity that culminated in Apollo 11
have turned into indifference and cynicism towards space exploration.
Moonwalker Buzz Aldrin said on the 25th anniversary that 'an eerie apathy
now seems to inflict the very generation who witnessed and were inspired by'
the moon landing. But 'for one crowning moment,' said Aldrin, 'we were
creatures of the cosmic ocean, a moment that 1,000 years hence may be seen
as the signature of our century.'
They are words that might have been uttered at Woodstock. It was billed the
Woodstock Art and Music Festival. The promoters optimistically dreamt that
200,000 might attend. Twice that many appeared. Woodstock became a defining
moment, a generational conclave of music lovers, hippies and war protesters.
Few paid the Dollars 18 price of admission.
Now, 25 years later, the successors of the people Joni Mitchell called the
'children of God', have paid Dollars 135 (Pounds 87) to attend the bigger of
two planned rival Woodstock anniversary concerts. The smaller event was
cancelled earlier this month after poor ticket sales.
At the remaining event, the one that may have cost Dollars 100m, there is an
inter-active video theme park. Tickets were delivered by overnight express
to prevent counterfeiting. The event had big-company sponsors. There are
licensed T-shirts and logos. The music is available on pay-per-view cable
television.
The cancelled event, which would have been held 50 miles away in Bethel, New
York, had attracted fewer of the original performers, would have cost only
Dollars 95, and was to have taken place on the authentic sacred ground.
What used to be called the counter-culture has triumphed. Baby boomers live
in the White House. And yet the problems that that brash, over-confident
youth hoped to overcome have become more intractable and pervasive. Only on
the environment is there discernible progress. Smokers and polluters are on
the defensive. The concept that planet earth is something to be protected is
standard liturgy for school children everywhere.
While America is no longer polarised by Vietnam, civil rights, or
capitalism, the social contract is more frayed than ever. The optimism, joy
and vision of 1969 have vanished.
The American radicals of the late 1960s looked to rock music for salvation.
It was as if Grace Slick and street-fighting Mick Jagger would lead an
assault on the capital. These implausible heroes are as embarrassing from
the perspective of 1994 as Che Guevara or Ho Chi Minh.
The Grateful Dead survive and prosper 25 years later at least in part
because they resisted the temptation to be more than a band.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Gardening: Planning for perfection - Garden design / Bridget
Bloom peruses the latest crop of books dedicated to making your
horticultural efforts look better
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIDGET BLOOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To plan or not to plan? Do you mark, measure and draw up - almost certainly
on graph paper and to scale - the garden of your dreams? Or do you trust to
your eye and your spade and then dig, more or less as the spirit moves you?
Having succumbed to the latter form of garden 'design' in an acre of rough
grass a decade ago, I now adhere firmly to the planning school. If I had not
been so impatient and impulsive (I tell myself), I might now have a nicely
composed and characterful garden, with weed-free and well-drained borders.
Certainly, careful garden planning is now in fashion and anyone starting -
or altering - a garden can find in the bookshops a clutch of volumes to set
them off on a proper path. What has come my way to review this summer are a
fraction of those available, but they are a good start.
Top of the list is The Well Planned Garden, by Rupert Colby (Conran Octopus,
Pounds 15.99), the latest in a collection of nicely produced books from the
Royal Horticultural Society on different aspects of gardening.
'Planning a garden is in some respects like designing the interior of a
house - involving both structural divisions and decorations,' Colby says
'but there is one important difference: many of the components in the garden
are of living material which may not only increase in size but also undergo
a change of character as they mature.
'To allow for this, a well planned garden must have certain tolerances built
into its concept, with longer term plans as well as immediate solutions.'
That is a good statement of part of the problem but, to my mind, it does not
go far enough. It seems incomparably more difficult to design a garden than
to decorate and furnish a house.
The rooms of a house have walls and ceilings as a framework for furniture or
colour schemes. Rooms change very little with the seasons, so the
decorations you choose are there until you decide to change them.
In a garden, not only does what you plant grow and die but it changes all
the time. Crucially, too, a garden has only the sky at the top and, often,
only the crudest 'boundaries'. I reckon anyone can decorate a room, but to
get a garden looking good the year round is a real work of art.
Colby's work will not produce a work of art but, well illustrated and
written clearly, it is designed to take a relative beginner step by step
through the practical business of designing a garden.
John Patrick, author of Designing the Small Garden (Anaya, Pounds 14.99),
does much the same thing although his focus - confined to the urban or small
suburban garden - is more limited. Designing such a garden is certainly less
demanding, for its boundaries are set closely.
The Traditional Gardening Book (Dorling Kindersley, Pounds 12.99) is a
handsome paperback version of a work written by Graham Rose, in association
with The National Trust, in 1989. Rose covers many of the same areas as
Colby but from an historical - particularly Victorian - perspective.
It is a book in which to browse, its many illustrations including delightful
drawings of old tools and garden features, from rhubarb and sea kale forcers
and handlights for seedlings to a dozen varieties each of spouting fountain
heads, urns and arches. It will not greatly help you to plan, but will
certainly aid the furnishing.
A wild garden, you might think, is quintessentially unplanned, an antidote
to Victorian order. Not according to the experts. The Wild Flower Garden is
by Noel Kingsbury and part of the RHS series mentioned above (Conran
Octopus, Pounds 15.99).
Kingsbury explains that you cannot just leave a lawn and expect it to sprout
into a meadow. Much work is required, at least in the early stages, and much
care must be taken to plant the right sort of meadow for your soil and
situation.
Still on the general design front is something rather different. A Handbook
for Garden Designers (Ward Lock, Pounds 18.99) is exactly what it says.
Written by Rosemary Alexander, the principal of the English Gardening School
at the Chelsea Physic Gardens in London, with Karen Batstone, this would be
much too detailed and probably too technical for most amateurs, but no doubt
invaluable for anyone studying the subject
Water, virtually all garden designers seem to agree, is an essential element
of the well planned garden. According to Sue Fisher, author of The Complete
Book of Water Gardens (BBC Books, Pounds 9.99), water is 'the single most
attractive feature that can be added to any garden'.
After an introductory chapter of do's and don'ts, Fisher examines 10 DIY
water projects, from a wildlife pond to a basic fountain, concluding with
chapters on planting and problems of cleaning and maintenance. Quite
clearly, this is a useful book for beginners.
A similar, if rather more lavish, volume is Water Gardens, by Jacqueline
Heriteau and Charles Thomas. Published for the American market by Houghton
Mifflin of New York and Boston at Dollars 35, there are some aspects of the
book which will not be of great use to north European gardeners - raccoons
not being among their most feared predators of garden-pond fish, for
example. But there is much that would help, including a splendid, long and
well illustrated chapter on water lilies.
For rather more sophisticated planners, Waterside Planting, by Phillip
Swindells (Ward Lock, Pounds 8.99) is to be recommended. His initial chapter
describes the construction of bog - rather than water - gardens but the bulk
of the book is a compendium of moisture loving plants with concluding words
on their propagation and their predators.
Next: two books to aid the painterly aspect of garden design. Colour Your
Garden, by Mary Keen (Conran Octopus Pounds 9.99) is a recently published
paperback version of a 1991 hardback.
It is a splendid guide to which colour plants to put where, with a painter's
eye to the changes wrought by the seasons. Hear Keen on yellow: 'Blue cannot
always be relied upon to produce a feeling of well-being but it is rarely
disagreeable in a garden setting.
'Yellow can be horrible. The chief reason for this is the changing quality
of light in the garden which affects yellow more than any other colour.
'Under the watery suns of spring, yellows appear clear and fresh, but bright
summer sunlight turns all the gold to brass . . . then, later in the year as
the light loses its brilliance, yellow becomes acceptable again and the
muted sunlight of autumn afternoons mellows golden leaves or flowers.'
Well-illustrated, Keen offers planting plans in various colour modes and
includes a directory listing plants in colour sequences. (An additional
advantage is that, unlike many of the books reviewed here or in publishers'
lists, Keen's captions generally tell you in which garden the photographs
were taken).
The next book is the only one I have seen dedicated to variegated plants: it
covers a wide range of perennials, tender plants, annuals and biannuals, and
trees and shrubs. Variegated Plants is by Susan Conder, with handsome
photographs by Andrew Lawson (Cassell, Pounds 20). While the best part of
the book is an illustrated plant directory, there is a good introductory
chapter on using variegated plants through the seasons.
Less useful, to my mind, is a book on Clematis and the Ranunculaceae, by
Deborah Kellaway (Pounds 14.99, Pavilion). Buttercup, winter aconite, meadow
rue and clematis may all be from the same family but, from a gardener's
point of view, it is not terribly helpful to have them covered in one
volume.
Others may find Nigel Colborn's Annuals and Bedding Plants (Conran Octopus,
Pounds 12.99) fascinating. Perhaps bedding schemes will come back into
fashion but, for me, they spell municipal gardening.
As all these books show, there is no dearth of advice for the would-be
garden designer. The danger, of course, is that you can get so carried away
by reading and planning that you never get started in the garden itself.
Planning is certainly important - but so, too, is impulse.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Mediterranean Property, a Two-Part Series: From Tuscan
dreams to Spanish mills - Gerald Cadogan looks at three countries where
climate and the way of life continue to appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN

<TEXT>
Many Britons have either moved permanently to Italy, France and Spain or
bought holiday homes, and many more would if they could.
ITALY
Tuscany has long been the magnet for Britons, who have concentrated round
Siena and up towards Florence. But Steve Emmett, of agent Brian A. French,
says prices rose so much late in the 1980s that potential buyers moved to
Umbria (equally glorious country), where they also pushed up prices.
The next stage was the Marche on the east coast, easy to reach in summer by
Pescara, Ancona or Rimini airports but accessible only via Rome or Bologna
in winter.
Emmett says buyers now are 'less adventurous'. All want to be near Siena,
even if that means two rooms and a kitchen.
There is no interest in north Tuscany above Lucca - surely an excellent
reason for looking there - but plenty in all ranges in Umbria and for
cheaper houses in the Marche.
People also ask for the Ligurian Riviera and, occasionally, for Bologna
itself (the traditional food capital of Italy).
Suddenly, too, the island of Elba is in demand from both Italians and
foreigners, who must take the ferry from Piombino. Vendors in the Pounds
200,000 to Pounds 400,000 range are often wealthy British people who bought
in the 1950s and 1960s.
French has several farmhouses on Elba in this bracket and, for L566.5m, an
unusual flat in the fort of Portoferraio with terrace views over the town.
On the mainland, there are apartments in newly restored Tuscan farmhouses
between L180m and L450m, while a farm above Lake Trasimene in Umbria is just
L96m, although it needs work.
Grander is a pink, 18th century villa at Citta della Pieve for Pounds
700,000 (having been over Pounds 1m). The agent, Simply Italy, specialises
in north Tuscany and the Marche, with a wide selection of farmhouses and
cottages (and some townhouses).
Water can be a problem in many regions, however. If so, factor it into your
offer. If you are successful, you could have to dig a well or install a tank
to fill from lorries.
Information (all numbers London unless stated otherwise): Brian A. French,
071-284 0114; Simply Italy, 081-891 5277.
FRANCE
Pyrenees Orientales offers best value at the Spanish end of the French
Mediterranean coast, says Sarah Francis of Sifex (which offers a selection).
And now is the time.
The area is popular with Parisians, who buy for retirement and like the
skiing as well as the sea. The Paris property market is improving, which
will pull up local prices in 1995.
A sensible offer now could let you pay 10 per cent below the asking price -
some recompense for the decline in the pound/franc rate since September
1992.
Small village houses start at FFr300,000, while small villas cost around
FFr500,000-FFr800,000 and larger ones with pools around FFr1.2m.
Towards Italy, though, the vendors are usually very rich and can afford to
wait for the price they want. 'The Cote d'Azur is always expensive,' warns

SPAIN
Watch that the vendor has not inserted a clause by which the buyer becomes
responsible for all debts and taxes pertaining to a property. While such a
clause is not illegal, you do not want it.
Barry Randal-Williams, Hamptons' associate in the jet-set resort of
Marbella, says the property market in the area has recovered remarkably,
with twice as much business as elsewhere.
Why? Because Jesus Gil y Gil, the dynamic mayor, has cleaned up the town's
fast-fading image.
As a result, almost all the houses that had been on the market for several
years have sold in the past 12 months and stock is now short. For the first
time in four years, building is racing ahead.
When the new houses are ready, probably by this time next year,
Randal-Williams thinks prices may rise. Meanwhile, house-hunters - including
many British and Germans - are having to look inland.
Hamptons has gone into partnership with a firm in the ancient town of Ronda
(which boasts the country's oldest bull ring) to offer properties ranging
from a large hunting estate to a dilapidated mill at Pounds 75,000. All need
work.
Near Loja, Hamptons is selling Jardines de Narvaez, an 1844 house with an
important listed garden, for Pta235m. The same agent has a farm with 15
acres in the hills behind the Puente Romano development near Marbella.
Price: Pounds 975,000.
Near San Pedro, KFR offers Bosque de Mirlos, a 20-year-old villa, for Pounds
1.25m; while a 2,100-acre sporting estate in the oak forests of Andalucia
costs Pounds 3m. It has partridge, rabbit, duck, deer, boar and mouflon, as
well as fishing.
Information: Puente Romano, 081-754 8696; Hamptons and KFR, see France; B.
Randal-Williams, Marbella (34-52-861 909).

FT  13 AUG 94 / Arts: Rude health blossoms on the Edinburgh Fringe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Before the official festival starts with Mahler conducted by local son
Donald Runnicles, the Edinburgh theatre fringe has blossomed into rude,
sometimes very rude, health.
The usual strong transatlantic influence is evinced at the Traverse, a venue
so vital to Edinburgh in the festival and out of it that it seems anomalous
to classify it as fringe. Besides the Canadian Brad Fraser's rather
disappointing recycling of previous themes in Poor Super Man, reviewed last
month, two plays by Americans have already made their mark. Killer Joe is
part of what seems like this festival's trend towards the strong meat of
brutal sex and violence. Tracy Letts' play is performed superbly by the
Hired Gun Theater of Chicago.
This is Sam Shepard territory, a trailer park in Texas. Ansel (Marc A
Nelson, grossly beer-bellied over his Y-fronts) shares a mobile home with
his second wife Sharla who is in the habit of answering the door naked from
the waist down. The plot is less important than mood, but it centres on
killing Ansel's ex-wife for her life insurance. Also in the scheme are the
children of the first marriage, feckless Chris and the feyly virginal
Dottie.
The killer of the title is the hitman (Eric Winzenreid) who demands Dottie
as part of his fee, to the semi-articulate unhappiness of Chris who
obviously feels more than brotherly love for his sibling. Brilliant acting
(notably from Michael Shannon and Shawna Franks as the Siegmund and
Sieglinde of the caravan set) steers the characters clear of cliche and the
play is often funny as well as disturbing. Wilson Milam's direction explodes
into disconcertingly vivid violence which threatens to burst the bounds of a
claustrophobic set (designer: Luke Grimm). Killer Joe is an engrossing work
 -which incidentally depicts an act of sexual outrage on no-good Sharla
(Holly Wantuch) that should leave Kentucky Fried Chicken uncertain whether
to sue or use it as great publicity.
Another American play, Liberty Oregon, is presented by an English-based
group. The year-old Foothold Theatre Company has already given Steffen
Silvis' haunting ode to the casualties of a forgotten corner of history at
the Man in the Moon, Chelsea, but it deserves its festival showing.
Sometimes falling into the trap of self-conscious Fine Writing, the piece
nevertheless generates power in Natasha Carlish's confident production.
Here the presiding deity is John Steinbeck, with a dash of genuine loathing
for small-town redneck America that is all the author's own. We meet Nadia
Novitski as a young girl collecting shells on the beach, and her father, a
strike-leader at the local saw-mills. Nigel Hook's set drapes a tattered Old
Glory above the suggestion of a worm-eaten, splintered world that harbours
fundamentalist Christians beating the devil out of the rebellious girl,
racist authorities that intern Japanese American citizens after Pearl
Harbour, and inanely bright proprietors of burger chains, the new
carpet-baggers snapping up the internees' property.
We follow Nadia's quest to find out what happened to her father and the
other mill-hands after they were transported on a freight train, roped and
hooded, to oblivion, her father bearing a good-luck shell from the beach.
Silvis has a savage eye for his own new world: the religiosity and racism,
the corruption and inequity of the melting-pot that never melded, of new
Americans - German or Irish or whatever - 'driven by second-hand dreams of
how they once belonged somewhere else'; and the totemic nationalism of those
'ending up in some shotgun shack pledging allegiance to a rag'.
The play ends uncomfortably with the disappearance of Nadia as she nears the
revelation of what happened to her father. The radio news reports a woman
being picked up in the middle of nowhere carrying human bones and a
petrified shell. The item is dropped and then all traces of Nadia officially
disappear.
Uniformly well acted by an Anglo-American-Malay cast (David Gilliam's adept
doubling - vicious sheriff, all menacing rage, and alcoholic derelict - is
typical), the play is dominated by Sarah McVicar. She gives Nadia a
toughness that never becomes bitter, a weary hopefulness that casts a
radiance at the heart of the author's unforgiving vision.
I felt pretty unforgiving after an hour of Bow to the Beast, where the
audience is harangued by a bare-chested young man, apparently a serial
killer though this assumption of these particular sins could merely be part
of his messianic conviction that he is the 'psychopathic Christ' - no,
sorry, we are the psychopathic Christ. Though 'devised' by the company (the
usually accomplished Boilerhouse), the text is attributed to Barry Graham,
an angry young Scottish writer, ex-boxer and Zen Buddhist. Descriptions of
murder and necrophilia or choking a child to death on Smarties may pack a
certain shocking punch, but the conclusions are both banal and illogical,
the methods stale - TV interviews with Nazi camp officials and their
families: 'He was a good man, a good father, doing his job'. The moment of
truth comes fairly near the beginning when we are informed 'What I am going
to have to show you you will never understand'. Jan Knightley performs with
ferocious physical intensity.
Off the Royal Mile, The Pleasance's complex of performance spaces is already
humming with activity. A trifle tentatively in the case of Abducting Diana
which I saw early in its run before the company, Moving Theatre, had ironed
out technical problems. I would be more worried about injecting some thrust
into Susan Penhaligon's sleek dumpling performance of what should be a
cyanide souffle in the title-role. This British premiere of a 1986 Dario Fo
comedy is not about you-know-who. The original Francesca was a banker
kidnapped and held to ransom; in Jonathan Banatvala's production she is a
media tycoon, one Diana Forte-McKaye. Typically for Fo, farce is piled on
social comment, but the Italian fun fails to fizz in English. Everything is
too exaggerated. There are national styles in injustice, and this does not
quite gel, despite painstakingly interpolated British references to such
natural targets as Stringfellow's, Hello] and The Independent.
Some of the translation is doggedly facetious. Some is quite funny, but not
enough to clarify the tangled threads of this plot of bluff, double-bluff,
twist and turn. And writers of comedy should never tempt comparisons by
mentioning other comics. 'This is isn't Ray Cooney,' says someone sharply.
Alas no. Full marks to Clare Welch as Diana's mother for crisp comic style.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Arts: Scenes of infinite variety - Karen Fricker watches the
controversial director Robert Lepage at work on his new theatre piece
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A samurai sword, a guidebook to the Jewish museums of Prague, a folding
wooden measuring stick, the Maria Callas recording of Madama Butterfly, an
electric guitar, videotapes of The Seventh Seal and Hiroshima Mon Amour, a
script of Yukio Mishima's Madame de Sade, a six-pointed star made of yellow
cloth.
Scattered on a table in a Quebec City rehearsal room, these objects are the
physical resources for Robert Lepage's new theatre piece, The Seven Streams
of the River Ota; some are background materials, others props. As their
variety indicates, the cultural reference of The Seven Streams spans wide -
from the Nazi concentration camps in Czechoslovakia, to 1960s Paris, to '70s
New York, to post-war and contemporary Japan. The company is in its final
weeks of rehearsals before it takes the show to the Edinburgh Festival.
You would think, this late in the game, that there would be tension in the
room, but the atmosphere is remarkably low-key; Lepage has clearly learned
to keep the pressure at the door. And the pressure has been on: over the
past five years he has become one of the theatre's most in-demand artists,
directing at major venues including London's National Theatre where his
Midsummer Night's Dream, set in a mud pit, raised hackles and filled houses;
creating and touring a one-man show, Needles and Opium; running, for two
years, the French-language wing of the Canadian National Arts Centre;
directing pop star Peter Gabriel's world tour concert; and attracting the
attention of, among others, Al Pacino and Gerard Depardieu, both of whom
have approached the 37-year-old director about working with him.
But the jet setting took Lepage away from Quebec, the embattled province
that gives him his artistic and cultural identity, and now he is making a
conscious effort to redirect his focus homeward. He is negotiating a
long-term lease on an abandoned fire station in Quebec City's port district,
which he plans to convert into a multi-media arts centre. This summer he
directed his first feature film, Le Confessional, in Quebec City and
Montreal. And, with The Seven Streams, he has returned to the creative
method that first brought him fame: epic-scale collaborations created with a
troupe of from Quebec called the Ex Machina Project that is a regrouped
version of his first ensemble, Theatre Repere.
The genesis of The Seven Streams came during a visit to Japan last year. 'An
old Japanese scholar and his wife were giving me a car tour of Hiroshima,'
he says, 'and we drove across a set of two bridges across the River Ota
called the Yin and the Yang, which are very consciously constructed to
represent the male and female sexual organs. The old man explained to me
that after the bomb, the first thing that was reconstructed in the city were
these bridges - that since there was death all around they wanted life to
start up again, and to create life you need sex.
'I was stunned to see that in this area where the sense of death is so
present that suddenly there is this literal and figurative representation of
life and sexuality. I decided I wanted to do a piece about that - about sex
and death, sex and Hiroshima.'
In January, eight actors began work on the project. Several plot lines began
to take shape: an American navy photographer comes to Japan in 1946 to
photograph the aftermath of the bombing, and meets a Japanese woman
disfigured by radiation. A young Quebec man arrives in present-day Hiroshima
to study calligraphy, and takes a room with an older Czech woman, whose life
is replayed in picaresque flashback. Their lives become entangled with a
Quebec diplomat stationed in Japan and his bored, shrewish wife.
By June, the show's structure is set: seven sections, called boites (boxes),
played against a wall of seven sliding panels, designed by Lepage. No
script, per se, exists at this point - structure always precedes dialogue in
Lepage's process - but sheets of paper on the walls, constantly being
amended, diagram the order of scenes. Each actor plays multiple roles, and
casting is, to say the least, flexible: after one actor dropped from the
show late in the rehearsal process, some of his roles were farmed out and
others taken by the stage manager.
At each rehearsal session the company runs through a boite. Some go
smoothly; others are still raw, the actors improvising their way through
scenes, slowed at times by Francophone cast members who have difficulty
extemporising in English.
At the end of each session, the company sits down to talk. What worked? What
didn't? Is the section finished, or do they have to work through it again?
Most importantly, what did they learn about the characters and situations
that they did not know before? This notion, that they are discovering truth,
not inventing fiction, is at the heart of Lepage's aesthetic.
'Before we even start to write or explore a show, it exists,' he says. 'It
has a subconscious of its own, a content of its own. The actors, in their
improvisations, are digging in the piece, and they uncover things  -
objects, relationships, coincidences, facts. Then we have discussions to
figure out how we can connect these things we have discovered with the
things we already know.'
For the observer, despite the sometimes grinding pace, rehearsals are
studded with the intense moments of discovery and connection that typify
Lepage's work: the repetition of a prop, gesture, or line of dialogue
reveals a previously hidden relationship; with a lighting change, a set
piece takes on a new identity. Lepage has particular fun with the set's
opaque door panels, playing out scenes in silhouette against them, then
turning them into video screens; after this show audiences are unlikely to
look at train station photo booths the same way again.
After its initial British tour, The Seven Streams is booked at festivals and
venues throughout Western Europe and Quebec for the next three years;
several bookings in Japan are set to coincide with the 50th anniversary of
the bombing of Hiroshima. As the piece moves, it will grow from three to
seven hours long, not through the addition of new sections but through the
expansion of the segments already in place. Will it ever be finished? That,
for Lepage, is not the point:
'There is no recipe, no series of rules, no theory behind what we do. You
cannot put a Shakespeare play and a Tennessee Williams play in the same
microwave oven and expect them to be 'done.' How is this meal is going to be
cooked? We'll have to discover that as we go along.'
The Seven Streams of the River Ota plays at the Meadowbank Sports Centre in
Edinburgh from August 13-21; at the Tramway Theatre, Glasgow from October
6-8; at Manchester City of Drama from October 13-15; and at the Riverside
Studios in London from October 20 to November 5.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Arts: A blind case of self-parody - Alastair Macaulay
reviews Brian Friel's new play 'Molly Sweeney' in Dublin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Tale of Two Cities were a new play by Brian Friel, this is how it would
begin:
'I remember Ballybeg. It was the best of times, oh yes, the best. Oh hadn't
we the gaiety at Phil the Fluter's ball, hadn't we just - and what gaiety.
Joy, such joy. I remember dancing - dancing with no sense of time, no sense
of place, just dancing, liberated in the moment - and I remember thinking we
could never stop. And then I thought Phil was somehow less happy than he was
allowing us to see. Because, though it was the best of times, the best, it
was also the worst. Certainly for Phil, the worst. I remember saying 'You
were never lovelier' to him, and he said to me 'Your sense of reality is a
sense only of external reality.' Anyhow, anyhow . . .
I crib most of this parody from Friel's Molly Sweeney. Why? Because this new
play - which opened in Dublin's Gate Theatre on Tuesday - is mere
self-parody. Granted, the beloved author of Dancing at Lughnasa,
Translations, Philadelphia, Here We Come], and others, has turned to new
subject-matter here. In Molly Sweeney he gives us the case-study of a
contentedly blind married woman. When an operation partially restores her
sight, she cannot cope with her new plenitude of sensation. She withdraws
both from seeing and from consciously acknowledging the world around her.
Questions of inner v. external vision, specifically attached to Bishop
Berkeley's 1709 Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision, are raised. So what
does Friel do with all this new stuff? He trots out all his corniest old
tricks.
You may recall that one New York critic, unjustly but memorably, dubbed
Dancing at Lughnasa 'the memory play from hell'. Well, in Molly Sweeney
Friel has plunged many circles lower into the memory-play inferno.
For its first two hours and a half, all its three characters do is remember.
Molly, her ophthalmic surgeon Mr Rice, and her husband Frank tell us their
memories; and they digress plenty too. (Anyhow . . . ) They never converse
with each other. Then, in the final five minutes, Molly switches into the
present tense. At last] But then you realise that her continuous 'present'
is an inner world compiled from - guess what? - memories, memories we have
already heard.
It is astounding how sluggishly, and with what bathetic repetitions, Molly
Sweeney tells its tale. Its essential dilemma - a heroine confronted with an
uncomfortable new take on reality - is the same as addressed by Harold
Pinter with far more bite in his brief playlet A Kind of Alaska.
Friel adds a woolly sub-feminist filter; he shows us that Molly's doctor and
husband, less utterly interested in her than she supposes, are preoccupied
by other aspects of their own lives. All three characters were always stuck
in their own private worlds, you see, and Molly, retreating into memory, is
actually less selfish than the men.
I hope it is only by accident that Molly Sweeney in several features
resembles another Pinter play Landscape - which was revived with such
distinction in this very theatre in May. Here too the heroine speaks of
light and shade, of the shadow of a window, and of the direction from which
light is coming; here too her sensuous interest in the world is contrasted
with petty male power-games; here too she retreats into memory; here too
nothing happens except in the past.
Accident or not, Friel has stripped his play of drama (whereas Pinter's
plotlessness intensifies his drama). Other Friel plays have have created
stage events that haunt the beholder long afterwards, such as the great
ceilidh in Dancing at Lughnasa in which the sisters release their primitive
impulses, or the dialogue between English soldier and Irish girl in
Translations, speaking to each other in their own languages, never knowing
that they are voicing desires diametrically opposed.
Joe Vanek's set is most eloquent: it has a triangular front area where the
three characters sit (occasionally rising) and talk, a rear, petal-laden
area into which Molly finally withdraws, and a glowing, blurred garden view
that looks like Odilon Redon's idea of the garden at Argenteuil.
TP McKenna, the best of the three actors in the best role, makes the most of
Mr Rice's few ironic complexities. The role of Molly, however, contains
little but monochrome, lyrical, reflective charm: as Catherine Byrne's
performance reveals. As for Frank Sweeney, Mark Lambert carries on like a
cheap cartoon of misdirected energy; the role isn't much, but it is slightly
more human than this. Maybe we should blame the director: namely, Friel
himself.
In one passage, Molly recalls her utter pleasure in swimming when blind,
swimming in all its tactile and sensuous delight, swimming so fully enjoyed
in her sightlessness that she felt that the pleasure felt by swimmers with
vision must be a less complete pleasure. This might be a telling image, but
what it tells has been told by Friel before. Viz: all the benefits of
civilisation do nothing but educate us away from our most innocent and
fulfilling instincts.
Ballybeg - locale of so many Friel plays - may have had its troubles over
the centuries, but in each play it starts out as a carefree Garden of Eden.
Then the inhabitants of Ballybeg eat the fruit of the tree of progress. I
remember Ballybeg, oh yes; I remember the paradise I lost.
At the Gate Theatre, Dublin. It will transfer to the Almeida Theatre,
London.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Arts: The innovative spirit of Salzburg - Will Gerard
Mortier's reforms get the festival governors' seal of approval?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By the middle of next week, Gerard Mortier should know whether he has won or
lost his campaign to reform the Salzburg Festival. The festival's board of
governors, dominated by public funding bodies, will decide on Tuesday
whether there is enough money to cover Mortier's plans for next summer. If
he is forced to reduce his programme of 20th century music, Mortier will
probably leave when his contract as artistic director comes up for renewal
in 1997. If his plans are approved, he will know that the revolution he led
at Europe's premier festival is here to stay.
The decision hangs on a knife-edge. Although Austria has suffered less from
recession than neighbouring Germany, cultural subsidies have come under
pressure as politicians adopt a hard-nosed approach ahead of national
elections in the autumn. Mortier's reforms have not come cheap: this year's
Sch505m (Pounds 30m) budget is nearly 25 per cent higher than in 1990. But
self-generated income has climbed proportionately, and Mortier has always
argued that a revitalised festival would serve Salzburg better in the
long-term.
The irony of the situation is that this summer's festival, now at halfway
point, is one of the most successful ever. Despite a 20 per cent rise in
seat prices, many more people are buying tickets for modern works than could
have been predicted when Mortier arrived three years ago. The atmosphere is
livelier, more contemporary, less formal than it used to be. Salzburg has
regained the innovative spirit with which Max Reinhardt, Hugo von
Hofmannsthal and Richard Strauss launched the festival in the 1920s.
When Mortier's appointment was announced in 1989, Salzburg was still
recovering from the death of Herbert von Karajan. Under his tutelage, the
festival had become money-oriented, conservative and stagnant. Mortier's
arrival was like an explosion. He publicly criticised Salzburg's business
community, the record industry, the Vienna Philharmonic and major artists,
accusing them of milking the festival to line their own pockets. He said he
wanted a new public, more adventurous programming. Salzburgers raised their
arms in horror, fearing the Belgian incomer would chase away their rich
clientele.
The dust has finally begun to settle. Mortier is less outspoken, more
prepared to let his programme do the talking. 'People are starting to trust
him now,' says Elke Polzer, owner of Salzburg's busiest ticket agency. 'They
see there are just as many visitors as before. Any new intendant would have
found it hard to follow Karajan, but Mortier had it particularly tough
because he was so direct and provocative. Austrians prefer to speak in
roundabout ways.'
Behind the polemics, Mortier has kept much that is traditional. This
summer's operas include Don Giovanni and Boris Godunov: the most expensive
seats, priced Sch3,900 (Pounds 230), sold out when booking opened in
January. Der Rosenkavalier and La traviata follow next year - even though
Mortier believes repertory works are not a festival priority. He has kept
Mozart performances in the 2000-seat Grosses Festspielhaus, knowing they
would be better suited to smaller halls. The recital programme, headed by
Jessye Norman and Anne Sophie Mutter, is as glamorous as ever.
Mortier's most popular move has been to upgrade the drama programme,
increasing the festival's appeal to its native German-speaking constituency.
Drama now accounts for a quarter of seats sold, three times more than in the
Karajan era. Peter Stein's production of Antony and Cleopatra, with Edith
Clever as a middle-aged but charismatic Egyptian queen, has been one of this
summer's biggest box-office draws, despite a battering from the press.
Pirandello's The Mountain Giants, directed by Luca Ronconi, was both a
popular and critical success.
But the main battleground continues to be 20th century music. Here again,
Mortier has been remarkably adept at creating a new audience. Some visitors
have discovered they can only buy a ticket for Don Giovanni as part of a
subscription including less popular works like The Rake's Progress; many
ended up enjoying the lively Stravinsky staging more than the Mozart.
Mortier has also introduced a youth subscription scheme, subsidised by
Nestle and Asea Brown Boveri, which enables anyone under 30 to hear Boulez,
Stockhausen or Birtwistle at a fraction of the advertised price.
Mortier plans a new production of Lulu next summer and Moses und Aron in
1996. But these will be the first to disappear if money is tight. That is
why he needs the wholehearted endorsement of his paymasters if he is to stay
beyond 1997. 'He's proved that this repertoire is not a problem for the
public,' says a close Mortier associate. 'The problem is political. He will
not accept a situation where he is forced systematically to cut modern music
and keep Rosenkavalier. He needs to be able to take risks, to plan
adventurously. Otherwise the festival will be back where it was - little
more than a commercially successful tourist event.'
There are other unresolved problems. While Mortier has the support of most
artists (and has patched up his differences with Riccardo Muti), he has
reached only a temporary truce with the Vienna Philharmonic. The orchestra
has signed an agreement putting a ceiling on its fees for the next three
years, and guaranteeing stability of personnel from rehearsal to
performance.
But it remains extremely expensive, and Mortier has had no difficulty
finding acceptable alternatives. Nikolaus Harnoncourt's cycle of Beethoven
symphonies this summer, for example, was given by the Chamber Orchestra of
Europe - whose virtuoso vitality put their Viennese colleagues in the shade.
Although the Philharmonic has the powerful Viennese press on its side, it is
running short of bargaining chips. A Shostakovich programme two weeks ago
showed how ill-equipped it was to tackle 20th century music without lengthy
rehearsals. As resident orchestra at the Vienna State Opera during the
winter season, its players look forward to spending the summer in Salzburg,
and many have bought holiday houses there. A boycott of the festival would
upset their lifestyle.
Mortier's other bete noir is Claudio Abbado, artistic director of the Easter
Festival. The two seem unable to communicate or coordinate their plans.
There has been speculation that if Mortier resigns, the quiet-spoken,
politically astute Abbado would be first choice to take his place. That
would reunite Easter and Summer festivals under one all-powerful conductor.
It would restore the old axis between Salzburg and Berlin, where Abbado is
chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic. And - without ditching all of
Mortier's innovations - it would give Salzburg the chance to crown a new
king in the Karajan mould.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Arts: By the Grace of Getty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT

<TEXT>
The long running saga of the Three Graces took a new twist on Thursday night
when John Paul Getty II, the reclusive anglophile son of the oil
billionaire, phoned the new Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell and told him
that he would contribute Pounds 1m towards keeping Canova's neo-classical
statue of the daughters of Jove in the UK.
Getty's offer is a gigantic step in closing the gap between the Pounds 7.6m
that his father's museum in Malibu, California has offered for the Three
Graces and the Pounds 5.8m already raised by heritage bodies and museums in
the UK.
For Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries in Scotland, who
last weekend raised the banner to save the Three Graces from imminent
export, it is a dream come true.' National Gallery trustees and staff are
dancing with joy,' he said yesterday.' I'm sure even the Graces are now
wreathed with smiles'.
It was in 1982 that the Marquess of Tavistock first tried to dispose of the
statue which had lain unnoticed at Woburn Abbey for almost two centureis. An
ancestor, John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford, had spotted a version of the
Three Graces in Canova's studio while on the Grand Tour. It had been
commissioned by the Empress Josephine, wife of Napoleon.
The Duke wanted a copy and built a sculpture court at Woburn to house his
prize. But taste changed, and the fortunes of the Russells dwindled. By the
early 1980s the eldest son, the Marquess of Tavistock, approached the
Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and offered the statue for Pounds 1m.
The sum far exceeded the annual purchase grant of the the impoverished
museum and the Marquess was forced to look overseas for a buyer. In 1989,
the mysterious Fine Art Investment &amp; Display, a Cayman Islands registered
company which is believed to be linked to the Marquess, sold it to the Getty
Museum of Malibu California for Pounds 7.6m.
Immediately the national heritage lobby was in uproar and successive arts
and heritage ministers have delayed the export of the statue in the hope
that British galleries and museums could raise a matching sum. It should
have finally left Christie's warehouse (where it has languished for years)
last week, but the new Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell, in his first
important decision, delayed the export until November 5.
The Getty Museum was furious. 'Evidently the faith we have had in the
fairness of the British export licence system had been misplaced. Our
efforts have been blatantly frustrated by manipulations of the export
licence system', thundered its director John Walsh.
He will be even more peeved to hear of John Paul's intercession. Father and
son did not get on, and on previous occasions the Getty Museum, the best
endowed museum in the world with an annual expenditure of over Dollars 100m
a year, has been thwarted by J. Paul Getty II contributing to appeals to
keep works of art in the UK.
By throwing his weight behind Clifford he has created a formidable team. The
ebullient Clifford loves a crisis campaign and has waged many battles
against the Getty Museum, wining some (a Duccio painting and a Bernini
bust), losing others (a Mantegna and a Poussin). On both occasions John Paul
Getty II backed Clifford with cash.
Clifford was 'totally sanguine' about keeping the Three Graces before
Getty's intercession. He had secured Pounds 12,000 from Kwik-Fit, the
Edinburgh based company, to finance an appeals campaign and was already
leaning on whisky and North Sea oil companies and banks in Scotland to
contribute funds. Getty's Pounds 1m makes his chance of success very likely.
The aim is to share the statue between Edinburgh and the V&amp;A, which deserves
credit for keeping the campaign alive. The V&amp;A has pledged Pounds 1.1m
towards the price (as has the National Galleries of Scotland) while the
National Heritage Fund has weighed in with Pounds 3m and the National Art
Collections Fund with Pounds 500,000.
A public appeal was not a success: it attracted only Pounds 80,000. The
Three Graces has failed to touch a popular nerve. It is more loved by
connoisseurs who appreciate its artistic links back through the
neo-classical revival to the Renaissance, to Imperial Rome and 4th century
BC Athens. Before John Paul Getty's gesture there was much sympathy with the
Getty Musuem. It had been kept hanging on for years and in these days of
fast travel a sculpture on show at Malibu is likely to be seen by almost as
many British people as one in the UK. In the past the Getty has always
played the game. It has been reluctant to poach major national treasures. It
may now think its rectitude has been exploited.
Ironically, later in November the National Lottery comes on stream which
should ensure that in future nothing of any importance is ever lost. The
Heritage Lottery Fund will have at least Pounds 150m rising to over Pounds
300m a year with which to shore up the heritage. The Three Graces should be
the last fight to keep the UK chockful with treasures.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Arts: Rare outing for Purcell's Indian Queen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When they decided that the Glasgow International Early Music Festival would
be biennial, somebody omitted to count ahead and notice that there would be
no festival in 1995. That is the year of the Purcell tercentenary - well set
to be the biggest early music jamboree that Britain has ever seen.
Glasgow was not to be outdone. For the major attraction of the 1994
festival, it is ambitiously presenting a fully-staged production of The
Indian Queen, one of Purcell's musical works on - or around - a play by
Dryden. Is it an opera? Is it a play with incidental music? Even in
Purcell's day there was some indecision as to who these semi-operas were
intended for, so it is not surprising to find that they rarely get a
showing.
Unfortunately for Purcell enthusiasts, these scores contain some of the
composer's best music. The usual solution is to perform the music in concert
and leave the play as a synopsis in the programme. The commemoration of
Purcell's death next year, however, demands more serious treatment. And it
will get it: both the Royal Opera and ENO have new, fully-staged productions
of the two most famous of the semi-operas planned.
Their tributes will probably be more lavishly staged, better rehearsed and
sung than this Indian Queen (they had better be]) but they will do well to
be half as convincing. On the only other occasion that I have seen The
Indian Queen performed as intended with play and music together, the two
art-forms barely made contact, as though musicians and actors were not on
speaking terms. Kate Brown, the producer in Glasgow, achieves a far greater
unity than that.
Unlike The Fairy Queen or King Arthur, this work does draw music into the
heart of the drama. The key scene is the wicked queen's visit to the
sorcerer's cave, where Purcell devised sinister music of the supernatural to
create a world far removed from the earthly scenes of the rest of the play.
David Thomas was marvellous as the sorcerer Ismeron, growling in his deepest
bass tones for the spoken lines and slowly rousing himself into song.
Otherwise, Purcell mostly tried to elaborate general themes from the drama,
an exotic story set among Aztec warriors. There is not a lot else one could
do with the play, which rarely bothers itself with such disciplines as logic
or restraint. Triumphant generals regularly change sides at the drop of a
helmet and unconquerable tyrants are liable to be seen in chains in the next
scene for no apparent reason. Juliet Cadzow played the Indian Queen as a
cross between Boadicea and Cruella de Vil. Out of ludicrous material Matthew
Whittle and Dan Maxwell did well to create serious male leads.
The musicians have an easier time of it, as Purcell's score is overflowing
with songs and dance music that have brilliance of character already written
in. The soprano Tinuke Olafimihan stood out among the singers. Gregory
Squire conducted the Baroque Orchestra of the Scottish Early Music Consort
with more zest than tidiness. They should all thank Kate Brown for giving
them a production (designed by Louise Belson) which had wit and
effervescence. It is amazing what one can achieve with a tiny budget and a
big imagination.
Final performance at the Citizens' Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.

SHOW BUSINESS by Shashi Tharoor Picador Pounds 15.99, 304 pages
INSIDE THE HAVELI by Rama Mehta Women's Press Pounds 7.99, 208 pages
These absorbing novels are proof of the imaginative vigour with which Indian
novelists are exploring their infinitely varied country. Shashi Tharoor's
Show Business is an exuberant expose of India's film industry depicted
through the rise and fall of Ashok Banjara, superstar and hero of formulaic
song and dance 'masala movies'.
'Bollywood', as the biggest film industry in the world is affectionately
known, has always been ripe for parody. Although it has spawned hundreds of
artistically thrilling films, these are overshadowed by the mass produced
crowd-pleasers, featuring virginal heroines, (doe-eyed bosomy girls adept at
the come-hither-but-don't-touch smouldering glance), karate kicking heroes
(usually poor noble boys separated at birth from rich but obviously careless
families), moustache twirling villains (whose only words of English are
'Bloody Fool]' and 'Bloody Bastard]'). The accompanying songs feature lyrics
which would make a Song For Europe sound complex.
All these stock characters appear in Showbusiness as planets orbiting around
Ashok's sun. As we follow his rise from budding hopeful, whose father's
political connections get him his first minor role, to fully fledged
superstar with the obligatory leading actress-cum-mistress in tow, these
supporting players continually interrupt Ashok's telling of his own
fantastic story. Then something rather strange and wonderful begins to
happen; the supporting players begin to outgrow their roles and challenge
our hero's perceptions of himself, and of them.
Tharoor cleverly interweaves first person narrative with hilarious
reconstructions of the films and it soon becomes clear that not only are
these people more complex than their apparent roles (for example, the
leading film villain is the most decent man in the book), but that all of
them harbour painful secrets which reveal Ashok to be a sham.
Tharoor pulls focus constantly like a mischievous camera man, all the while
drawing parallels between this unique film culture and India herself. Are
these movies opiates for the masses, radical tracts which encourage the
dreamer to act, or as Tool, the guru, declares, perfect examples of the
Hindu notion of time, that is: 'endlessly repeated variations on a few basic
themes . . . ?'
Rama Mehta's Inside The Haveli is a reflective novel in which a newly-wed
bride, Geeta, educated and outgoing, arrives at her husband's ancient family
home, the haveli, and finds she is suddenly in purdah and forced to live
within the traditional confines of a 500-year-old joint family system. Women
must always be veiled and are not allowed to cross the courtyard into the
men's separate quarters.
Mehta's sensitive attention to detail pulls the reader in, reluctantly at
first maybe, until you realise with a shock that you are undergoing the very
process of adaptation which underlines the protagonist's journey. Geeta is
an outsider, the first wife not to have come from another haveli,
Bombay-educated, and therefore already marked by the other women as a
possible rebel who could undermine a way of life they have upheld for
generations. And the reader rebels with her at first, chafing at the
apparent banality of the servants' chatter and the rigid formality of
Geeta's interaction with her family, every liberal tendency yearning for her
escape. But as Mehta gradually creates a world which invests the smallest
detail with great emotional resonance, the nameless servants become rich and
rounded characters, and Geeta's in-laws change from rigid icons into
dignified, proud people whose traditions seem to offer protection and
continuation rather than subjugation.
By the time the two babies born at the beginning of the book have become
young women Geeta, like us, is not so sure that she wants to escape. Mehta
brings immense understanding to a way of life that we realise by the end of
the book is rapidly vanishing and her deceptively simple prose is invested
with such tenderness that the reader's initial knee-jerk reaction against
the haveli is replaced with something approaching admiration.
The novel is a poignant illustration of the complex struggle between
progress and continuity and of its painful cost in human terms. Rama Mehta
herself was the first woman to be appointed to India's foreign service, and
was forced to resign upon marriage.
Individually, these two novels trumpet talent; together, they are a
startling reminder of how progressive chic and urban corruption exist side
by side with unquestioned traditions, and how chasms separate the lives of
those individuals who share the label Indian.

TUNNEL VISION by Sarah Paretsky Hamish Hamilton Pounds 14.99, 483 pages
MALLORY'S ORACLE by Carol O'Connell Hutchinson Pounds 14.99, 282 pages
EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE by Michelle Spring Orion Pounds 14.99, 210 pages
CATNAP by Gillian Slovo Michael Joseph Pounds 9.99, 277 pages
Is it time to blow the whistle on the female private eye? Everyone has been
trying it and the books are not getting any better. There may be a message
in the TV moguls' recent decision to abandon the Anna Lee series based on
Liza Cody's tame and miniskirted English investigator.
A decade ago, Sarah Paretsky's creation of VI Warshawski summoned premature
and inaccurate comparisons with Runyon, even Chandler: the new genre was
evidently a part of the feminist agenda, and why not. The men fought back -
Leonard, Parker, Block, Hiaasen and the rest - and they did so by seeking
out new angles, new relevances, in their traditional male preserve.
Let the jury stay out for a few more years, but let us not abandon
standards. Paretsky's latest, Tunnel Vision, is a near-disaster. It is far
too long, it takes 100 pages to get going, the prose is flat to the point of
drab, utterly inadequate to cope with any drama, and the dialogue is
perfunctory. Much worse, her famous protagonist, Warshawski, is getting to
be a bore as she keeps on about her 40th birthday.
'VI', the tough Polish-Irish ex-cop in Chicago, is still the radical,
liberated, bolshie, private investigator who caused such an impact eight
books ago. Trouble is, she hasn't changed. She is as bossy as ever, she goes
on and on about her clothes and her cooking and her exercises, she worries
about Chicago's homeless families and abused children and battered women
and, not so surprisingly you might agree, she begins to fall out with her
black cop boyfriend.
She discovers big fraud and laundered money in Chicago's high society. Then
she plunges, literally, into the underworld of the city's flood tunnels in a
long, slow, procedural PI drama in which she takes an unbelievable amount of
physical punishment.
At least she vomits when she finds her friend's head mashed into her
personal computer - and, typically, Paretsky's pedestrian prose can make
nothing of the scene. This is a successful author on auto-pilot. Since the
comparisons have been made, it is necessary to say that Paretsky on present
form has nothing of the magic of the early masters of the trade.
Carol O'Connoll is apparently the big discovery of the season, with a
million dollars for her first novel, Mallory's Oracle. The gimmick - all
these books have to have one - is that the woman heroine-cop, Sergeant Kathy
Mallory, adopted daughter of a New York police officer, is a computer
whizzkid with the soul of a thief. Mallory is shown to be a deeply damaged
human being. It would be interesting to see how she might emerge from her
traumas in the course of her pursuit of the serial killer who is responsible
for her foster father's murder.
If this is the central theme, it is evaded because Ms O'Connell has so much
else to explain to us - lots of computer expertise, false leads and
old-fashioned research to do with elderly New York ladies who go to seances.
The dialogue is good; the rest of the prose is overwritten, without the
necessary pauses or periods of quietness: the interesting creation - Kathy -
is allowed to drift out of focus in the welter of surrounding detail. Ms
O'Connell needs a tough editor.
Back to Britain, and cosy Norfolk, with another debutante, Michelle Spring's
'Laura Principal', in Every Breath You Take. This is a spin-off from the
ancient English tradition of carefully-penned dramas of
varsity-dons-as-sleuths. Who kills Monica, the art lecturer who joins Laura
and Helen in their Country Life cottage? Why is the Provost such a shit?
Will Laura Principal survive to tell the tale? And do we care? The prose is
a genteel beta-plus, the plot an unadventurous and very English beta-minus.
All these books emphasise the 'psychological' angle - Chandler would have
choked on his martini - perhaps because this seems to offer a more
appropriate, or more credible, area of feminine wisdom. Or perhaps it is
more realistic, and interesting, than women performing physical violence on
villains who are usually male. Note too that all the women protagonists in
this batch are into middle age.
Gillian Slovo's Catnap is the most interested of the four in developing this
psychological angle. Her Kate Baier is yet another woman private detective,
though recently a foreign correspondent, operating in London's Dalston of
all places (talk about 'down those mean streets - ']). The plot, a slow and
not-at-all exciting drama about the looting of pension funds, is more
concerned with Kate's need to come to terms with the death of her lover five
years before. It is obsessive, worthy, under-powered, and it lingers in the
memory. She, like the others, needs to write with more pizazz if we are to
look forward to her next.

PRUSSIA: THE PERVERSION OF AN IDEA by Giles MacDonogh Sinclair-Stevenson
Pounds 20, 456 pages
Prussia and England have always seemed to me to have a great deal in common.
One chooses the words carefully: Prussia, not Germany; and England, not
Britain. Both have a desire for order and a love of institutions. Both have
been proud of their military. The term inneres Preussentum, used in this
book by Giles MacDonogh, might be loosely translated into English not as
'inner Prussianness', but as 'stiff upper lip'.
The two places, too, have had more than their share of eccentrics: mad
professors and scientists, liberals as well as conservatives. Perhaps above
all they were both colonising powers, not content to stay in their own
domain. Both could claim to have had a civilising influence.
The great difference between them was that Prussia was a land power and
England, as part of an island, was a sea power. For a time this did not
matter: they could go their separate ways. Yet, as Bismarck noted, one of
the seminal events in modern history was that it was the English who
initially colonised what became the United States. English was on the way to
becoming the international language, and a great alliance was born.
Twice this century the alliance stopped Germany in its tracks. But it was
worth noting that it was Germany that was stopped, not Prussia. For by 1870
Prussia had become part of a wider German state. It may have suited the
allies to say that the new Germany was typically Prussian, meaning
'militaristic', yet Prussia had other virtues as MacDonogh seeks to show,
and most of the worst German crimes under the third reich were not committed
by Prussians. He produces a curious statistic suggesting that of the 500
highest ranking Nazi officials, the Prussians made up only 17, or 3.4 per
cent.
In fact, the Prussians were twice put down themselves, the first time by
Napoleon and then by Hitler. When Napoleon defeated them in battle, the
Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 imposed terms quite as harsh and impossible to meet
as those imposed by the allies on Germany after the first world war. But
Prussia gradually recovered.
It did so partly through education and partly through developing its
military tradition. The two went together: a good soldier needs to be
educated. There was a tendency among the military to dismiss the parliament
as the Idiotenhaus (house of idiots), but Prussia was not on the whole
illiberal. Like England it encouraged elites. The chief of these was the
general staff. Built up by Moltke, this was like a school in itself, wearing
its own uniform. The French were nothing like as organised.
In 1870 the Prussians took
their revenge. Taking the long
view, however, the unification of Germany that resulted from the
Franco-Prussian war was not
the triumph of Prussia. Some Prussians would have preferred to have gone it
alone. Instead Prussia gradually became submerged in Germany.
True, the old traditions lingered on. The Prussians were prominent under
Kaiser Wilhelm, but the old Prussian state was not
much loved (or perhaps too much feared) by Hitler. Nazism
bloomed late there. In 1928 the party had only six members in
the regional parliament. Thus Hitler began his assault. By 1934
the separate Prussian institutions were abolished in the interest of a
'non-federal Germany'.
MacDonogh's book contains a nice quote from Hermann Goring, who was left in
charge of the
police: 'I've certainly mucked things up. How could I strengthen Prussia's
position when Hitler wants to do the very same to the Reich?' So Prussia
fell ultimately not to the French, but to the Germans.
There was one other great problem over the centuries. It
could not easily co-exist with Poland. In the end there had to be one
country or the other. It seems that Poland has finally won, but no-one
should think the Prussians were all demons and the Poles all saints.
MacDonogh's book is not the easiest to read. He shows an almost total lack
of interest in economic development (which surely must have something to do
with the rise of Germany) and some of the names are obscurely introduced.
But if anyone really did think that Prussia was simply a war machine, here
is a useful corrective.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Books: 'Sex for text' contracts - Did Brecht's lovers write
his plays?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER

<TEXT>
THE LIFE AND LIES OF BERTOLT BRECHT by John Fuegi HarperCollins Pounds 25,
732 pages
When Maxim Gorky toured one of the first Soviet concentration camps in the
1920s, the guards spruced up the camp, put flowers on the tables and, to
suggest a regime of intellectual freedom, added the latest newspapers. The
prisoners, too frightened to protest openly, decided to hold their
newspapers upside down as a kind of international distress signal. But Gorky
marched past unaware and wrote a glowing report of the camp. Almost all the
prisoners later died there.
This anecdote introduces the sensational argument which lies at the core of
John Fuegi's new biography of Brecht. According to Fuegi, not Brecht but
three actresses who were his lovers, wrote most of the works  - The
Threepenny Opera, Mother Courage, Galileo - on which Brecht's reputation
stands. Ignored and reviled, they spent a lifetime in silent protest,
metaphorically reading their newspapers upside down.
By contrast, Brecht, like his murderer-hero Mac the Knife, intoxicated
millions with his charisma and sexy lyrics while pursuing a career as thief,
woman-hater and political chameleon.
Is Brecht the latest victim of the politically-correct school of biography,
or are these serious allegations which should change our view of the Brecht
oeuvre? Either way, this book is compelling. First, its focus on the precise
moments of creation of Brecht plays, of who said or wrote what when,
illuminates those key movements in the revolution in 20th century theatre
which were Brecht's great achievement.
Second, its multiple biographies of the so-called 'real' authors of Brecht
plays give a vivid backcloth to the society and culture from which Brecht
came.
Third, it is a provocative detective story set, like the best of Le Carre,
in the shadow of the Nazis and the Cold War.
Brecht became famous at 30 when The Threepenny Opera opened in 1928; with
its ragtime beat, biting anti-capitalism and cast of crooks and tarts, it
remains the signature tune for 1920s Berlin.
Fuegi shows that a week before the first night, the work was half written
and the leading lady, certain it would flop, had signed to appear elsewhere.
There was some ugly exploitation - Brecht's besotted lover, Elizabeth
Hauptmann, wrote-in a 'sex for text' contract, which Brecht later repeated
with other women; when he married, Hauptmann attempted suicide. But mostly
the piece was just thrown together, as happens in the theatre, by Brecht,
Weill, Lotte Lenya and others, in a last-minute rush.
Lenya, who had been a teenage prostitute, gave life to the tarts' songs.
Hauptmann was behind the fantasy of female revenge in Pirate Jenny. Brecht
took inspiration for 'The Cannon Song' from his own homosexual lover and
from Kipling's 'Barrack Room Ballads'. When Harold Paulsen, Berlin's
crowd-pulling operetta star, spent all the budget on a ludicrously-slick
suit and spats for the criminal Mac, and threatened to give up the part
rather than the costume, Brecht was forced to write an introductory ballad
describing his crimes - thus, 'Mac the Knife', the most popular song in the
show.
Fuegi rightly points out that it is the disparate elements, especially the
contrast between the male and female dreams - mashing soldiers to beefsteak
tartare versus love in a shack by moonlight - that raises The Threepenny
Opera to mythic level.
He also offers evidence that two subsequent lovers - Grete Steffin, the
communist girl from the Berlin slums whom Brecht abandoned to die in Russia,
and Ruth Berlau, a Danish bourgeois revolutionary - provided some material
for the strong female roles in later pieces, such as Mother Courage. But to
accuse Brecht of plagiarising them is as absurd as suggesting Norah Joyce to
be the author of Ulysses because Joyce 'listened at the door of her heart'
to create the language for Molly Bloom.
As muses, Steffin and Berlau are significant; Fuegi's problem is that he
does not care about his subject's psyche or inspiration but only about
attributing blame. He calls Brecht a political turncoat for flirting with
right and left, with America and Russia, before settling in East Germany
while keeping his Swiss bank account. But Brecht was the quintessential
non-conforming artist who ended up in East Berlin because the GDR offered
him a theatre when neither West Germany nor America would let him within
their borders.
And, of course, he kept his bourgeois habits while satirising them on stage
 -his plays are rooted in his love-hate affair with the German bourgeoisie.
In Berlin, he juggled six girlfriends but would live only with the family
maid he had imported from Augsburg. Nevertheless, he found a tailor to equip
each lover with the white Mother Hubbard nightgowns his prim mother had worn
in Bavaria - and negotiated a discount for the bulk orders.
It seems perverse to write about Brecht, the socialist icon, if your only
interest is in his feet of clay. When Brecht visited Russia with Steffin in
1935, he turned down an invitation to stay because, he said, he could not
find enough sugar for his coffee. Does that mean he was an unprincipled
spoilt brat or that he cleverly hit on a metaphor for the lack of sweetness
in the political regime which would not offend his communist colleagues?
An in-depth study of Brecht must paint both aspects of the man: this book is
spirited and engaging but hopelessly lop-sided.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Travel: Cyprus: empires and civilisations slept here - J D F
Jones rediscovers the charms of the island's Greek south and Turkish north
but is left feeling a little sad and worried
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
I have a problem with Cyprus. I used to go there a lot, before the Turkish
invasion and after the Eoka business, when it was a lovely place. We would
arrive from the dangerous complexities of Beirut or Jerusalem or Damascus -
Cyprus used to be the transit stop for journalists covering the Middle East
 -and grab a couple of days on expenses, based at the late-lamented Ledra
Palace Hotel in Nicosia and usually wandering down to Paphos or Kyrenia for
a night. It was a modest, undemanding, friendly, beautiful, provincial
island.
Then it was divided by the 1974 invasion.
Today, there is something worrying about the place. A bit sad, perhaps.
Certainly there is something wrong in the north. As for the south, it has
changed almost beyond recognition. I revisited both the Greek south and the
Turkish-held north (on separate trips) and only slowly rediscovered the
island's charms.
Newcomers may not understand this. The British are particularly keen on
Cyprus once they have tried it: apparently no other holiday destination has
so high a proportion of 'return' bookings.
This is not surprising when you consider that this is the Mediterranean
island best suited to the less bold, less confident holidaymaker - everyone
is friendly and speaks English, you drive on the left, the food is
recognisable and unpretentious, culture is available but not overwhelming,
and of course the beaches are splendid, the landscape wonderful, the
mountains purple on the horizon, and there are frequent flights from UK
airports.
For a different sort of visitor, Cyprus has always stood at a crossroads
between Europe, the Levant and Africa. Empires and civilisations have passed
through Cyprus in unending procession, from Minoans and Mycenaeans to
Crusaders and Lusignans, Venetians and Turks, and - yes - the British.
But at a more individual level it has also been a stopping-off point, a
relaxing place to break a journey either before or after the rigours of
Arabia or Egypt.
Sir Samuel Butler took a break in Cyprus on his way to explore the Nile, and
found time to write a book about the island; Lawrence Durrell's memoir of
the 1950s shows a stream of visitors, such as Freya Stark and Harry Luke and
Rose Macaulay, all of them on their way to, or from, somewhere more serious.
Everyone loved Cyprus for its quiet and undemanding obscurity.
Durrell's friends would stay with him in Bellapais and drive up to the
Cyprus Museum in Nicosia. You can't do that any more. You have to choose
whether to take your holiday in the south or in the north. They are very
different places these days, although you will be looking at those same
mountains on the horizon.
To start with, the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus is recognised only by
the Turkish government in Ankara. The single inconvenience this entails is
that you cannot fly direct: you must break your journey on the mainland, if
only for a nominal 45 minutes before taking off again (in the same aircraft)
for Ercan. The larger snag is that the north is run-down, poor and much less
sophisticated than the south, which lies across the UN-supervised
front-line. Many roads are pot-holed, the villages are unkempt, hotels are
(literally) dusty, and the churches have been desecrated.
The other side of the coin is that life is remarkably cheap, you can always
find a room or a table, the food is much more interesting than in the south,
and the locals are extremely pleased to see you.
Slowly, the expatriates have been returning to their villas in the sun. But
there is very little sign that tourists are arriving in the numbers the
economy needs, despite the fact that north Cyprus surely presents one of the
few and best remaining chances to experience the unspoiled Mediterranean.
For example, immediately west of Kyrenia (sorry, Girne, as it is now called)
there is a 10-mile stretch of coast which, anywhere else in the Med, would
by now be a corniche lined solid with hotels, restaurants and swimming
beaches.
The narrow coastal plain rises through orchards and olive groves and
picture-book villages to the dramatic two-dimensional cut-out silhouette of
the Kyrenia range. The sea is very good indeed; Turkey lies in the distance.
Yet today, starting from Asil Nadir's glossy Jasmine Court complex on the
outskirts of Kyrenia, all you will find is a stutter of small groups of
hotels and apartment houses, often half-finished in the Middle East style of
sprouting spikes of reinforced concrete. Here and there you come to a
'casino', or a lonely bar like 'Rita on the Rocks', or a small German
restaurant set in a garden of flowers.
Across on the north-east coast, it is a similar story. Famagusta and its
tourist strip are still no-man's land. The Old Town of Famagusta is
accessible but stagnant, dead, behind its medieval walls.
Ten miles to the north is the island's most important - and largely undug -
archaeological site of ancient Salamis, scarcely disturbed by visitors. It
is extremely large and stands on a beautiful but surprisingly empty bay
which features half-a-dozen high-rise tourist hotels scattered a few miles
apart along a good road and incongruously set in a wasteland of flat,
drained marsh: rather spooky.
I stayed in the best-remembered of these hotels, the upmarket Park, and had
to move out because the dust seemed to date from 1974. To the north-east,
the Kyrenia range peters out into the Karpas 'panhandle', where few people
bother to venture any more and where the UN troops supply a handful of
stranded Greek villages.
A mile inland from Salamis is a rare curiosity, one of the few unvandalised
churches - the Monastery of the Apostle Barnabas, now restored and turned
into an unimportant icon museum but with attractive cloisters which have
become, thanks to sympathetic conversion, the best archaeological museum in
the north.
It has the usual range of good-quality pre-classical stuff, Mycenaean, etc,
but the stars of the show are a batch of Greek sculptures including Demeter
with a poppy, a sphinx, and a superb double-lion. At the bottom of the
garden is the alleged catacomb of St Barnabas himself, erstwhile companion
of St Paul. The whole operation is presided over by a carob tree and
friendly Turkish custodians. As so often in the Mediterranean, one suspects
that the site pre-dates both Christianity and Islam.
The shadow on this beautiful northern landscape is cast by the visitor's
suspicion that he is enjoying - or perhaps living in - occupied property:
not the territory so much as the actual house or plot.
The subject of land ownership since 1974 is immensely complicated, and not
to be discussed here. But walk through Bellapais, for instance - the most
thriving of the tourist venues of the north, the hillside village
immortalised by Lawrence Durrell in Bitter Lemons - and you find yourself
wondering who owns, or owned, what.
As the years go by and the reunification of the island refuses to grow
closer, these matters will perhaps become faits accomplis. For the record,
Bellapais is still beautiful, the abbey unchanged save for an in-house
restaurant, the Tree of Idleness there still (or perhaps it is a
descendant), and directly at the foot of the abbey cliff there is a new-ish
hotel set in handsome gardens.
To the sentimental and nostalgic visitor, Kyrenia looks just the same. It
was always a lovely, seductive place, and the old harbour is as photogenic
and pretty as ever, lined entirely with fish restaurants and open-air tables
and pleasure craft, the coloured lights at sunset falling down into the bay
like Christmas decorations. The castle still stands at one end, the Dome
Hotel at the other.
The Dome is one of the famous hotels of the Levant: it pushes its luck for
four stars - it is pretty tatty by the standards of the 1990s - but it has
character and remains the focal point of the little town, standing there on
the edge of the bay, extending these days into a sea-water swimming pool
built out into the rocks. A good spot for a brandy sour, that national drink
of Cyprus north as well as south.
Once upon a time we used to drive back - south - up the hill, past the
turn-off to St Hilarion Castle, through the bends where the UN ran convoys,
up and over the top and, suddenly, we would be looking down on the
sun-parched plain and the roofs of Nicosia in the distance. These days
Nicosia needs a separate trip, another flight.
I always think that Cyprus is culturally a part of Greece rather in the way
that Sicily is culturally a part of Italy: the two islands are different
from the mainland nation but are a part of the Greek-Italian experience.
South of the UN line, you immediately realise you have returned to
Byzantium, however cosmopolitan and English-speaking the place has become.
The south has none of the emptiness, the sense of undusted rooms, of the
north. On the contrary. Paphos, which used to be a friendly little fishing
village with a lovely archaeological site, is stacked and bursting with a
hundred tourist hotels; Nicosia for me has lost much of its special
character; the south coast, where Aphrodite was born out of the waves - and
if you visit her flower-like rock and are in the right frame of mind, you
can believe it - is lined with 'Real Estate For Sale' signs. You will find
'Aphrodite's Car Hire' and 'Aphrodite's Snacks' and 'Aphrodite's Gymnasium'
and so on, just as in Crete the name of Minos favours every take-away shack.
Other things have not changed. This is still a corner of a foreign field for
Britain's ministry of defence, notwithstanding the presence in Nicosia of a
'Museum for the National Struggle': the Akrotiri sovereign base still boasts
green-grass playing fields, RAF radio masts, reassuring signposts to squash
courts and regimental chapels and the 'Devonshire' and 'Kensington' and
'Londonderry' lines.
Much more interesting and important, the island still has its orange trees
and vineyards, its broom and anemones and wild irises. The Temple of Apollo,
not far from Paphos, is still one of the Mediterranean's most attractive
sites, looking out over the sea, and now it has been particularly well laid
out in extensive gardens, thanks to the Leventis Foundation.
The mosaics at Paphos are unspoiled and special, as are the catacombs
outside the town, and the Cypriots are friendlier than ever, and all speak
English. (Another distinction from the mainland is that Cyprus does not go
in for retsina.) And the big museum in Nicosia is still one of the
highlights, and surprises, of the Mediterranean.
Best of all, the Troodos mountains are still wonderful, all the more so
because they offer escape from the concrete coast. I suppose it was the
mountains that dissuaded me from an old hand's crotchety nostalgia. The
Ledra Palace may have gone, the UN may have settled in for ever, the divided
families will be for ever divided, their homes are not going to be
recovered, on either side, but Cyprus is still beautiful and the
environmentalists are fighting back against the developers and despoilers.
My single recommendation is to take a Land Rover trip up into the mountains
and your perspective on Cyprus will be quickly corrected. Then take the same
Land Rover out to the Akamas peninsula in the far west, and join the debate
about whether it should be 'developed' like the rest of the south.
Any travel agent can advise on a host of packages and flights to the south.
Holidays in the north can be extremely cheap and are best arranged through
agents who specialise in the area, such as Metak Travel (70 Welbeck Street,
London W1M 7HA; 071-224 4303) or any of the large number of Turkish
operations in London's Stoke Newington, best visited in person if you live
in London.
The season is very long - mid-March into November - but it can be extremely
hot in high summer.
The Rough Guide for Cyprus is probably the most useful and comprehensive
guidebook, covering both parts of the island.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Travel: A welcome for golfers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be nice to report that Ernie Els, South Africa's latest golfing
hero, learnt his golf at some historic course such as Durban Country Club or
Royal Johannesburg.
Alas, the truth is more mundane. Els - tall, blond and languid - learnt his
trade at Kempton Park, the unprepossessing home to Jan Smuts airport and the
World Trade Centre, the site of South Africa's historic constitutional
negotiations.
It is a relief all round that it is now both possible and legitimate to
worry more about Ernie Els's fortunes than the state of constitutional
talks.
It can only be a matter of time before golfers start visiting the country in
large numbers. The climate is ideal for playing golf and there are many fine
courses.
Equally important, there is an ever-growing array of independent country
hotels offering high-quality service.
A recent trip took me to some of South Africa's finer coastal golf courses.
First stop was Selborne, a tight setting in the rolling Natal sugarlands, 40
minutes south of Durban.
The course rewards cunning rather than brawn, and the wayward golfer will
soon be defeated by bush and water, which features on 15 of the 18 holes.
Overlooking the Indian ocean, Selborne Country Lodge, the Tudor-style
guest-house attached to the lodge, provides a comfortable and friendly base.
Resident professional is Trevor Wilkes, veteran of the professional circuit,
repository of much golfing wisdom, and one-time runner-up to Gary Player in
the South African Open.
Next stop was Fancourt, a grander establishment in George, a beautiful,
mountainous part of the southern Cape. It is the leading South African
lay-out, most reminiscent of US courses: perfectly manicured, with greens
fast and true. The practice facilities are probably without equal in South
Africa. The course is a regular tournament venue.
The hotel facilities are run to five-star standards by Orient-Express
Hotels, which manages some of the world's top hotel properties, including
the Mount Nelson in Cape Town, rated South Africa's finest.
From George, I travelled to Cape Town and stayed in the charming Constantia
Uitsig guest house on a wine-farm overlooking False Bay. Guests stay in
small, converted Cape Dutch cottages, and there is a popular restaurant on
site.
There are at least half-a-dozen good courses within easy reach. The two I
played were Clovelly and Milnerton. Clovelly is a tight, undulating course,
slightly inland but still susceptible to the wind like all Cape courses.
Milnerton is in a more challenging, links-style setting, situated on the
shores of Table Bay.
My final port of call was the Grand Roche hotel in Paarl, an ultra-luxurious
establishment in the heart of the winelands. The hotel is home to Bosmans
restaurant - reckoned by some to be South Africa's finest. The focus of the
development is a beautiful Cape Dutch building overlooking Paarl.
Grand Roche served as a base for playing two nearby parkland courses, Paarl
and Stellenbosch. Both are pleasant, the latter in better condition and site
of tournament golf in recent years.
There are many fine courses besides the ones I visited. Most of the large
cities have a number of courses, with Durban Country Club usually voted the
best in the country.
Best known is Sun City, venue for the annual Million Dollar classic, and a
very challenging lay-out. It now has a twin course - Lost City - replete
with grand architectural features and a water-hole that is home to dozens of
crocodiles. No golfer should resist the challenge of these courses and try,
if you can, tostay in the Palace hotel.
For those wanting to mix game-watching and golf, the Hans Merekensky course
in the mining town of Phalaborwa should not be missed. Not only is it close
to Kruger national park, the main public wildlife park, and luxury private
lodges, but there is a good chance of sharing the fairways with baboons and
wart hogs.
Zimbabwe also provides visitors with a regional dimension. Newly-developed
is the Leopard Rock course in the Eastern Highlands, and Elephant Hills near
Victoria Falls. In addition, there are established courses, such as Royal
Harare.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Rude food served here - Eating in Singapore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore is a peculiar place. It is in Asia, but it is not very Asian. If
it were not for the hawkers' stalls, and the occasional whiff of durians,
you might believe you were in some squeaky clean version of Chicago or
Frankfurt-am-Main, only populated almost entirely by Chinamen.
You get a better perspective if you cross to the seedy, scruffy little town
of Johore Bahru: this is Singapore without the polish. Singaporeans go there
in droves to buy cheap food and to chew gum. When they return on the bus and
cross the causeway to Singapore, they stick the gum to the backs of seats.
Singaporeans are rude. They were rude to me in the airport, even before I
had passed through immigration and they were especially rude at the
Boulevard Hotel. I thought that they would all be pig-rude until I met a
jolly taxi driver who was keen to fill me in on Singapore's latest murder
stories and who took me off to a more down-market hotel where the staff were
a little better behaved than they were at the Boulevard. The next night I
moved into the Oriental and all was sweetness and light.
I understand that businessmen go to Singapore, but I do not think anyone
goes there for pleasure. Japanese and Australians go to Singapore to shop,
even though the prices are not as keen as they once were. Cultural tourism
is a bit of a non-starter as there is precious little of old Singapore left
and what there is has been 'Disneyfied' in a thoroughly repulsive manner.
But, and here is a big but, you may eat well in Singapore.
The best way to eat is to go native. All over the island there are hawkers'
centres where the formerly mobile kitchens have been brought together.
Various Chinese cooking styles are in evidence: Malayan food; Indonesian
food; Indian food; and the Peranakan food of the native Straits Chinese.
You can have great fun at the hawkers' centres. Only you should avoid the
sanitised, perhaps 'pasteurised' is a better description, Telok Ayer Market
with its fried chicken and go instead to the big shed on the other side of
the main road which has yet to be faked. Similarly, you can do better than
the rather twee Satay Club on Connaught Drive.
The true gourmand revels in a Singaporean hawkers' centre. Duck and beef
porridge, Indonesian rice and noodles, mutton satay, lots of exciting
innards such as pigs' organ soup, pigs' ears, pigs' tails and bowls of beef
broth swimming with tripe.
You wander around the stalls picking what pleases you and then return to
your seat. Within seconds the plates are slammed down on the table and a
grasping paw is stretched out to the cry 'two dollars' (for that is all it
costs). If you are quick you can also catch the arm of the person carrying
bottles of the excellent local Tiger beer. Then your meal is complete.
It is far from being a relaxing way to eat. After a week of it you are ready
to concede that the French three-hour dinner is the greatest contribution to
civilisation the world has known. On the other hand, street food is
nourishing, and cheap.
There are also restaurants where you may eat in this basic way. Swee Kee, in
Middle Road, is almost next door to the Raffles Hotel. There, for about
Dollars 3, you are given - thrown is more like it - a big portion of boiled
chicken, chicken broth and rice. A dinner of this sort lasts at most 15
minutes.
In little India you get chiefly south Indian food as well as some local
specialities such as fish head curry - the eyes are said to be the best bit.
I prefer the cheeks. Vegetarian food can be good here. The paper masala
dosas, onion ottapams idlis and vadas were every bit as good as the ones I
had eaten in Calcutta.
Of course not everyone gets the chance to go native. If you are out on
business, you will probably eat in a posh restaurant or a hotel. The Raffles
Hotel has been reset in plastic and cloned to twice or three times its
original size. True to form, a shopping centre has been installed in the
wings.
You should have a Singapore gin sling there, because that is where it was
created.
You may eat well at the Raffles too, but the best meal I ate in a restaurant
was in Violet Oon's Kitchen. This is Peranakan or 'Nonya' cooking (a Nonya
is a native Chinese woman with an infusion of Malay blood). The food adapts
Chinese and Indian ideas and welds them to the local Malay diet. This is as
near as you will get to the real Singapore and Oon is as hospitable as one
could wish.
The rest of them should be packed off to charm school.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Herbs are the answer - Barbecuing / Some tips
for outdoor eating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During my first year as a restaurateur, I spent very little time in the
kitchen. This was partly because I was aware of the limitations of my
culinary knowledge and partly because there were more pressing problems -
mainly financial - to occupy me.
Business was improving by the second year, however, and having failed
miserably as a greeter, seater and waiter, I began to spend more time
watching the chefs, especially Martin Lam, now chef/proprietor at Ransome's
Dock in south-west London.
Lam was so confident of the culinary gulf that separated us that he knew I
would not interfere with his work and he was glad of an extra pair of
watchful eyes as his brigade grappled with the problems of feeding 200 in 90
minutes from a basement kitchen.
Later, to make myself useful during the lunch service, I worked as a grill
chef, an area of the kitchen that does not require years of training in
making sauces or stocks. There, I had a certain advantage because the cuts
of meat and fillets of fish were prepared professionally for me. It became
obvious quickly, though, that merely grilling meat or fish, however good the
quality, will give neither the chef nor the customer much satisfaction.
Lam believes passionately in the flavour-enhancing qualities of herbs. A
good handful of any fresh herb, mixed liberally with olive oil into a
marinade, can transform the main ingredient of a dish and convince the
customer that this is something for which he must come back.
Classic examples are fresh sage leaves with calf liver, rosemary with lamb,
and thyme with everything from chicken to fish and red meat. Forget the
lighter herbs, such as tarragon and chervil, but use plenty of marjoram and
oregano with chicken and oily fish such as bass or mackerel.
Shred basil on to meat or fish after it has been grilled. If you are
barbecuing tuna steaks, make a basil butter including salt and pepper. Throw
dried fennel stalks on to the fish on the barbecue at the last minute.
With duck, it is better to use spices rather than herbs to bring out the
flavours - rub on fivespice then marinade it in vegetable or sesame oil
before barbecuing.
It is through reading MFK Fisher, the American food writer, that I
discovered a marinade for beef that is as successful for roasts as for
grills. Marinate the beef in olive oil and rich soy sauce for 48 hours. Half
an hour before cooking wash off the marinade, pat dry, and let the meat rest
before it is cooked.
In Australia, I learnt that with even the very freshest fish and seafood -
possibly because it is so fresh - acidity is the key to the finest flavour.
Marinate squid, crayfish, prawns or octopus in plenty of lemon or lime
juice, crushed garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper and serve with a tomato
relish. Ensure that any drinks you serve to accompany the meal stay chilled.
In south-west France, I discovered what is, I believe, the finest medium for
the barbecue. These are souches - ancient, gnarled vine roots available when
vineyards are being replanted. They make wonderful, slow-burning firewood in
winter and impart an extra layer of flavour to your barbecued food in
summer.
For the barbecue chef, the cooking process, including preparation and
lighting, can be quite long. I have found the following recipe for potatoes,
roasted with olive oil, rosemary and garlic salt, useful as it can be cooked
in the oven while you are at the grill. It comes from The Classic Cuisine of
the Italian Jews by Edda Servi Machlin (Giro Press New York) and goes
wonderfully with grilled chicken, steak or fish.
OVEN-COOKED POTATOES
serves 6-8
Recipe: 8 large baking potatoes; 2 teaspoons fresh rosemary; 2 teaspoons
garlic salt; 4 tablespoons olive oil; black pepper.
Method: Peel the potatoes and cut lengthways into six pieces each. Place in
a bowl and mix with rosemary leaves, garlic salt, oil and half a teaspoon
black pepper, ensuring the potatoes are coated evenly.
Place in the oven at 450`F for 25 minutes and then lower the temperature to
350`F for 45-60 minutes.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A louse in the garden of Eden - Californian
wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until recently, the Napa Valley in northern California has seemed the wine
region closest to heaven. On a previous visit there, I seriously thought the
reason I was never troubled by a fly, wasp or mosquito was that insects did
not dare interfere in this perfect little bucolic kingdom of mammon.
How wrong I was. Today in the valley, and in much of Sonoma, its
long-overshadowed neighbour, the wine industry's financial viability -
already coming under severe scrutiny - has been gravely prejudiced by the
activities of two tiny insects.
The phylloxera louse, which threatened to destroy Europe's vineyards 100
years ago, has been steadily munching its way through thousands of acres of
northern California vineyard, while leaf hoppers, or sharpshooters, have
been busy transmitting the dreaded Pierce's disease, for which there is no
known cure.
The phylloxera-struck vineyards are being painstakingly ripped out, no
matter how young - and the usual productive life cycle of a vineyard is at
least 30 years - so that this beautiful wine valley, once a verdant sprawl
in high summer, is today a patchwork of plots which tell their own story.
Some owners just cannot summon up the cash or the will to renovate affected
vineyards, and their decrepit vines stare balefully at visitor and resident
alike, a constant reminder of the economic pressures which have squeezed so
much of the glamour out of the northern California wine scene in the past
few years.
Many have taken a deep breath and are replanting millions of vines each year
so that the symbol of the era has come to be not vines but the open-bottomed
milk cartons which are put around each tender new plant to protect it from
frosts and predators. (There is surely a market opportunity there for a more
aesthetically acceptable substitute.) And then there are those few growers
lucky or clever enough to have avoided the rootstock that has succumbed to
phylloxera.
But Californians are nothing if not optimistic. The official line is that
this vineyard devastation is a blessing in disguise. The enforced
replanting, they point out, is allowing them to improve, much earlier than
anticipated, their vineyard and vine design, and to choose more suitable
grape varieties for each site. Such spirit.
So what are they choosing to plant? Rich Kunde is California's most
influential vine nurseryman and, luckily for the rest of us, a keen record
keeper of the vines he grafts, three years ahead of their being able to
produce wine.
Well Chardonnay, the wine world's darling, would be expected to be
increasing its domination of California's vignoble, but Chardonnay grape
prices have been falling and, last year, Chardonnay cuttings were only just
more popular than Kunde's most sought-after red wine variety.
For some years now this has been not the expected Cabernet Sauvignon but the
softer Merlot - Cabernet without the pain.
Cabernet Sauvignon comes a poor third and there is clear evidence of a
new-found pride in California's 'own' Zinfandel, both in prices paid and
area planted. Red wine varieties have at long last become more popular than
white, largely thanks to their association with lower risks of heart
disease. The tonic factor.
But the really hot item is a white variety, Viognier. Although fewer than
200 acres were in production in time for the 1993 vintage, Kunde supplied
almost as much of this obscure north Rhone white grape variety this year as
he did of either Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Noir, two of the state's proven
vine variety classics.
California Viogniers tend to have more substance than their counterparts in
the south of France, which has also fallen victim to Viognier mania. The
most notable example of this weight is Calera's 1993, made from vines
planted in the relatively prehistoric early 1980s and notching up a hefty
14.5 per cent alcohol.
Kunde's own-label Viognier is, hardly surprisingly, considerably lighter,
while Joseph Phelps's would probably be the ideal choice for those seeking a
Condrieu substitute.
Red Rhone varieties have been equally popular. You can still charge a
Dollars 10 premium on any bottle carrying the magic words Syrah or
Mourvedre, and new Rhonish bottlings are sprouting up all over the state,
helped by California's considerable acreage of Grenache, and the discovery
that the ancient vines for long despised as Mataro are in fact none other
than Bandol's own Mourvedre.
Jade Mountain's examples are impressively exuberant, and Bonny Doon's (also
imported into the UK by Morris &amp; Verdin of London SW1) would be worth buying
for the labels alone.
But it looks as though California's vineyards for the next three decades
will reflect not just the current vogue for Rhone varieties, but also the
coming trend in favour of all things Italian. Sangiovese cuttings were in
huge demand this spring, and California's first attempt at the variety
disappeared off the shelves as soon it arrived.
The best example I have tasted is Villa Ragazzi, one of the many annoying
California wines made in tiny, almost uncommercial quantities - in this case
by Mondavi's winemaker Charles Thomas, from fruit grown by the Rodeno
family, associated with St Supery winery and a Napa law firm.
And the influential Robert Mondavi is said to be getting in on the Italian
act (as well it might, considering its origins), with the trend-setting
release next year of varietal whites labelled Tocai Friulano and Malvasia
Bianca.
Elsewhere, Ivan Tamas has even managed to make a creditable, full-flavoured
varietal Trebbiano, a variety that is regarded as a ubiquitous embarrassment
in central Italy.
It seems as though California's big re-plant may be being dictated less by
detailed site analysis and more, as usual, by the great god fashion.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Let's have fare play - As the English soccer
season opens, Peter Berlin looks at how fans are fed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the top of the away terracing at Brisbane Road, home of Leyton Orient, an
English second division soccer club, squats a hamburger shack. The terracing
is exposed to the elements. When the wind blows it wafts the foul smell of
greaseburgers and cooked canned onions down over the fans.
When the rain falls it forms brown puddles amid the discarded plastics
spoons, sugar, milk and tea spilt from the table next to the stand. The
shack is an institution. Its occupant is known with affection as the 'fat
frier'. Nowhere in England are travelling fans, usually regarded as
unwelcome guests, treated so well. Inexplicably, fans seem to like the fare
and, unusually, they can queue for, buy and eat their burgers without
missing any action.
Clubs know that catering can be lucrative. They offer spectators in the
executive boxes smart pre-match meat-and-two-veg meals.
They have restaurants and banqueting halls for pre and post-match meals. But
the average fan wants no more than a quick snack before kick-off and at
half-time. The result is an uneasy compromise: a limited menu of overpriced
and sweaty burgers, sausage rolls, pies, Kit Kats, fizzy drinks, instant
tea, Bovril and, when permitted, beer, with just about enough vending staff
to get everyone back into their seats by five minutes into the second half
if they spend the whole interval queuing.
Compare and contrast with the Ballpark at Arlington, a baseball stadium
opened this year, home of the Texas Rangers. A baseball crowd looks like an
ants' nest. Regardless of the state of play, lines of people scurry up and
own the aisles, ascending empty-handed, returning with laden cardboard
trays, dodging the mobile vendors who sell drinks, ice-creams, pop-corn, hot
dogs.
At Arlington every step has been taken to make sure that the fans spend the
entire three hours or more that a game lasts eating and drinking themselves
into a coma. There is an upmarket restaurant, the Diamond Club, for holders
of season tickets. This offers 'white tablecloth dining' in tiered seating
which allows you to scoff and watch.
There is a branch of TGI Friday's which also offers a view of the game. In
'preferred seating', ie ordinary seats that cost more, there is waiter
service. A friendly young man regularly comes round and pesters spectators.
Do they want even more nachos, burritos, hot dogs, beers, even Caesar salad?
He taps the order and seat number into a hand-held computer, transmits it
and seconds later another friendly young man appears with the food and the
bill.
Along the concourses behind and under the stands, the hot humid Texas air is
filled with the smell of burning meat. There are 102 concession stands, all
operated by Sportservice Corp of Buffalo New York. Some have droll baseball
names: Short-Stop, H R (home run) Bakery, R B Ice Cream (a pun on RBI for
run batted in) and Bambino's (which serves pizza and is named after Babe
Ruth). There are yoghurt stands, barbecue sandwich stands, Tex-Mex stands.
On the upper level there are four 'grilles', air-conditioned fast-food
havens that sell the full range of hot dogs and drinks, and hamburgers and
'carved sandwiches'. You can cool off, eat, and still watch the game through
the windows.
It is not gourmet food but it is tasty, varied and attractively presented.
The prices are not exorbitant and the queues are rarely long.
But there have been unexpected drawbacks. The detritus from the eatathon is
rinsed into the stadium's storm drains. There it has rotted in the humid
Texas heat. The stench is worst near the best seats. The club has taped over
drains and is planning to introduce machinery to blow the gases from the
drains.
The quality of food at Arlington is not unique. I visited the Olympic
Stadium in Montreal, a modern, covered arena where the Expos baseball team
plays. There are pizzas, burgers, hot dogs, croissants, salads and ice
creams there, as well as a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise.
The food court offers the atmosphere and variety and quality of catering of
British Rail's tarted-up London termini. There are also Montreal smoked meat
sandwiches (with a strong chemical taste of flavourings and preservatives)
and even poutine, a Quebecois dish of chips, gravy and cheese curd;
traditional but hardly a delicacy. This is children's food and at the
Olympic Stadium half the crowd seemed to be made up of delirious children in
a screaming sugar frenzy.
A few baseball stadiums, notably those in New York, share the British soccer
approach. Yankee Stadium has a 'food court' somewhere in the bowels of the
stand but it is hard to reach and queues are long. I went on opening day in
April. The fans in the cheap seats were happy with a steady diet of beer,
broken occasionally by a hot dog. The result, after three hours in the hot
sun, was more fist-fights than I saw in the whole of last season at English
soccer grounds.
For soccer fans who travelled to the World Cup dreaming of better snacks in
the land of fast food, the experience was more Orient than Arlington. This
was in part because the matches have, for the most part, been played in old,
or very basic American football stadiums.
At Giants Stadium in New Jersey, the most solid foods on offer were hot dogs
and dehydrated potato knishes sitting foil-wrapped in heated display
cabinets. The soft drinks were flavoured with chlorine by the ice cubes.
When Ireland played Italy there, in 90`F, the bars ran out of Evian water,
at Dollars 1.70 for a tiny bottle. The beer supplies held up - a reflection
of the appetites of the American Football fans who normally use the stadium.
Strangely, given soccer fans' immobility, there were few vendors walking the
aisles. In blazing Dallas they offered drinks. Small bottles of water 'ice
cold' at kick off, merely 'cold' by half time, cost Dollars 3.
There are pleasant surprises. The outdoor walkway around the Rose Bowl in
Pasadena is filled with food stands: there are churros (fried, sugar-dipped
ropes of dough), pizza and lots of ice creams and ice lollies as well as the
usual hot dogs. But at most of the other grounds, at least those not
surrounded by huge car parks, the best food is outside the stadium.
The ageing Dallas Cotton Bowl, just a few miles from Arlington, sits in Fair
Park, built to host fairs and exhibitions. There, the restaurants were open
and vendors had set up stalls. There were sausages on sticks and turkey legs
which looked as if they had come off ostriches and which British police
would view as a potential weapon.
On the shady approach to Stanford Stadium I had a burrito as big as a soccer
boot from a friendly family stand serving Mexican food. It was bland, as
Americanised Mexican food so often is and so stuffed with beans in a liquid
sauce that it was impossible to eat standing up.
But compared to anything on offer in Leyton on a Saturday afternoon, it
seemed wholesome, exotic, tasty and generous.

FT  13 AUG 94 / How to Spend It: Find an affordable slice of Africa on
darkest Regent St - An exhibition of artefacts which steers a careful line
between art and tat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most of the artefacts that come out of Africa fall into one of two
categories - they tend to be either old, rare and expensive or else
mass-produced, tatty and inexpensive. Liberty of Regent Street this week has
opened a selling exhibition of Africana which miraculously manages to fall
between the two schools - almost nothing is antique or rare but neither
could any of it fairly be dismissed as tourist tat.
Having been a modest collector of Africana for some time (the stars of my
collection probably being the little tortoise-shell and ostrich bead Bushman
powder puff or, then again, it could be the spear I bought straight from a
Masai warrior striding across the Serengeti) I know just how out of reach
the truly old and beautiful pieces of African art have become.
Picking out the one good mask from a load of tat turned out cynically for
the tourist market is not always as easy as it ought to be. And while nobody
minds if they like what they are buying and are being charged accordingly,
none of us likes being taken for a ride.
Here in the Liberty exhibition the buyer, Ron Stewart, is completely open
about what is on offer. 'Nothing here is truly old and rare but everything
here has appealed to me and captures something of the deep hold that Africa
exerts on almost everybody who visits it.'
He has managed to bridge the old and new worlds of Africa. Rooted in old
Africa are pieces of woven raffia cloth from Zaire, made today but according
to traditions that stretch back to long before the white man came. There are
brass sculptures from Benin, again contemporary, but part of a long
tradition of brass sculptures.
There are Ndebele aprons of fine beadwork on animal skins, nearly as nice as
the one I found in Johannesburg's city market some years ago. There were a
couple of truly rare leather Masai shopping bags (I say 'were' because I
have just bought one and you had better hurry if you want the second one),
chicer than anything from Hermes or Gucci, though to be truthful the smell
is rather more pungent than Shalimar.
From new Africa there are vital, colourful township art and artefacts.
Anybody who has been to an African township will know of the freshness of
their approach to even the most every-day things. In a poor, dusty village
in remote Botswana, I came upon one of the most desirable toys I have ever
seen - a push-along lorry fashioned with love and ingenuity out of old tins
and wire by a father for his son.
That same impulse can be seen in the wire bicycles on sale and in the huge
and wonderful tin and wire impression of a computer. The techniques used in
the colourful Imbenge baskets traditionally made by the Zulu night watchmen
out of old telephone wire have been deployed to make a wildly jazzy
walking-stick. Old petrol-cans are saved, beaten and joined together to
produce some of the jolliest lunch-boxes I have seen.
Radios (proper working models) are housed in wooden cases painted in
jazzed-up versions of traditional Ndebele paintings. Old enamelled tin mugs
are covered in colourful Zulu beadwork and papier-mache wastepaper baskets
covered in joyfully simple images painted in brilliant colours.
Then there are the pieces that veer more towards proper art - from South
Africa comes the most expensive piece on sale (Pounds 7,500), a vast
brilliantly painted sculpture of David and Goliath by the much-feted South
African artist, Johannes Maswanzany. From Zimbabwe there is a huge and
impressive metal eagle (Pounds 575) as well as some naif and charming
figures made by a religious group in Harare.
For those wondering how to incorporate some of the fabrics into what might
be a chintzy British home, I have draped some of the appliqueed raffia cloth
from Zaire very simply over a pole in our study and very splendid it looks,
too, while the square panels of patterned cloth can be framed and hung to
serve the function of a picture.
The exhibition at Liberty opened this week and is on until September 3.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Fashion:The Lady loves to shock - Jane Mulvagh asks Lady
Powell about her choice of clothes and gets a surprising answer / Me and My
Wardrobe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget propriety. Carla, Lady Powell, was wearing skin-tight, black,
cashmere leggings and a smile as bright as a Cadillac chrome fender. As she
greets you at the door, she exudes ebullient, recession-proof chutzpah.
Married at 19, Lady Powell, the 51-year-old Italian wife of the erstwhile
diplomat and Number 10 adviser, has spent the last 30 years escorting her
sage plenipotentiary through the corridors of power.
Ask her about her style and she answers with winning directness. 'Oh, it's
short and tarty, like Crystal in 'Dynasty'.'
What joy she must bring to all crusty mandarins - or 'old goats' as she
affectionately calls them - for she loves to shock in Atlantic-deep
decolletes, Kilimanjaro-high minis and dresses slashed from here to
eternity. 'I love big shoulders, low necks, tight waists and high heels.'
Whether she is hosting a private dinner for visiting dignitaries or
attending a Washington banquet, her dress teeters on the borders of a
diplomatic incident.
Lady Powell is a devotee of high-heeled court shoes. 'I'm tiny, a midget, so
I need heels, and then I feel, well . . .' she completes the picture with
Monroe-like gestures. Those heels are lined up like lethal weapons along 12
shelves, each bearing half a dozen pairs of 3in-high stilettoes but there
does not seem to be a single walking shoe or plimsoll among them nor even a
black, brown or navy court shoe with sensible heels.
Instead . . . puce, pea-green, lacquer-red, lambent patents, glittering
lurex and crushed velvets. And there, on the top shelf, standing alone, the
pride of her armoury, awaiting coquettish deployment, is another pair,
6in-heeled Vivienne Westwood platforms.
Some of this is a bit deceptive: Paul Johnson, the writer and her daily
walking companion, later tells me that she is a keen hill walker and rock
climber and three very professional-looking pairs of climbing boots lurk
somewhere in the house.
Lady Powell is a master of the Wildean art of how to flirt. 'I can get away
with it because of self-control,' she begins somewhat disarmingly. 'I'm very
earthy and I shock sometimes, but never too much. It's like drinking; you
have to know what you can get away with and you have to understand the
occasions when you can.'
Her style is carefully gauged to contrast her own ebullient personality with
her husband's academic and outwardly austere demeanour. She feels that 'by
marrying me he thinks it's this exotic thing that he can't control. The rest
of his life is so in control. You see he comes from a military family -
neat, tidy, organised - he even makes his own bed in the morning. He's
totally amused by the way I dress.'
State, and now private sector, matters prevent them from dressing for dinner
together and so Sir Charles never knows what his wife will turn up in next.
She loves to sail close to the wind, just to see her husband's face and
recalls her first invitation to a formal dinner at Number 10 Downing Street.
'Charles was really scared about that first dinner, what I'd wear. I was
advised by Robin Butler (head of the civil service) that I should dress
down. To Carla Powell that was as good as a challenge. 'I had the most
stunning dress you can imagine from Victor Edelstein. White, shoulders out
to here, very Dynasty, and totally proper in the front. I walked up to Mrs
Thatcher with Charles standing behind her, all proper.
'Then I turned and boom] It was backless down to There: I looked back over
my shoulder and, Oh] Charles's look was too wonderful] You see, what men
don't understand is that Mrs Thatcher, being a woman, would have loved all
that]'
Mary Henderson, wife of Sir Nicholas, guided the Powells through their early
years in the diplomatic service. Superficially the two women seem poles
apart; in fact they are close friends.
Lady Henderson seems to look on Lady Powell almost as a secret weapon. 'When
she was on our staff in Germany,' Mary Henderson recalls, 'whenever we had a
difficult dinner we'd always ask Carla. She'd sit cross-legged at the feet
of our important guest and he'd be completely bowled over by her and
everything went well. She dresses in a very sexy way and is full of
vitality. And being in the foreign service she's had to do it all on a very
tight budget.'
Lady Powell subscribes, out of necessity, to that long British tradition,
which makes the average Italian shudder, of 'make-do and mend'. Ripping the
black Chantilly lace from an old ball gown, she can turn it into a mini
pencil-skirt by adding elastic to the waist and then popping it over a
shiny, tar-black, Norma Komali body.
When her husband saw it he exclaimed, 'Oh God] How could you] It's
transparent]' But now he loves it, she says.
Lady Powell heartily defends the diplomatic wives, so often ridiculed for
their dowdy, home-made dresses. 'They have to dress for all sorts of
occasions with very little money and you should hear some of the tricks we
used.'
'You know about the Embassy Dress, of course? The black one with spots on it
 -very simple.'
This grand couture evening dress from Dior was made for Marina Berry in the
1960s. It was passed on to her sister-in-law, Harriet Berry, and eventually
on to Carla. It is still in circulation. 'We all had our best times in that
dress,' Lady Powell beams, 'and whoever had it we'd all ring up and ask if
we could borrow the dress for the night.'
While working for Hambros, Lady Powell was expected to look efficient and
business-like. But, instead of buying a navy suit at Jaeger, she stopped
over in Hong Kong and bought metres of washed silk in fuchsia, marrowfat
green and midnight blue. In China she bought floral-patterned cashmere,
lining it with matching silk: 'So much more glamorous than a winter coat,
don't you agree?' Three suits, three shawls, all for the price of one Armani
jacket.
Other tricks include Pounds 50 crochet dresses from Roman boutiques, old
ball dresses chopped into thigh-high minis and, her one extravagant buy, a
minuscule petrol-blue and black lace dress from a Saint Laurent sale in the
south of France.
And although her financial circumstances have changed, thanks to Sir
Charles's post at Jardine Matheson, she still prefers to shop in boutiques
and second-hand markets, although she admits to a weakness for Anouska
Hempel and Dior.
One cannot see Lady Powell submitting to middle age or sobriety no matter
what her husband's station. He may be proper in his grey flannels but she
continues to teeter alongside him cajoling, teasing and flirting in
Chantilly lace and impossible heels.
'We're complete opposites,' she beams. Last year the couple were announced
by a master of ceremonies at a dinner. He pronounced his name poshly, like
Disraeli's slippery pole; she pronounced it with the wide-mouthed 'o'. The
MC pronounced both and the room roared with laughter.

FT  13 AUG 94 / How to Spend It: In the Indian swing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you feel that this summer you did not get it quite right in your garden,
you might like to start planning now for next year's British heatwave.
My own tastes in garden furniture run to the plain and indubitably English.
But there is a place for exotica and furniture does not come more exotic
than Jeremy Lowe's Gujerati swing-seats.
Lowe originally came upon the seats when he was travelling in Rajasthan a
few years ago and realised that these traditional indigenous designs were
completely different from anything on the market in the UK. He decided to
investigate the possibilities of importing them and, after experimenting
with a few prototypes, has arranged for a small group of pieces to be made
by local craftsmen in a small village in Gujerat.
Not the least of the pleasures of the pieces is the fact that they involve
using long-established hand-crafting skills and that a whole previously
depressed village has a worthwhile project to work on.
There is a Maharaja and a Maharana's swing bed, an armchair, two-seater and
three-seater benches, tables and a deckchair. Made from Burmese teak there
are also canopies, bolsters, upholstered mattresses, loose cushions and
cushions covered in Indian cottons.
For those who are optimistic about more languid days next summer, now may be
the time to dream about lazy days in a Maharaja-style swing-bed. Jeremy
Lowe's company is called Benchmark. In his Oxfordshire workshops there are
prototypes which can be seen and ordered from but the earliest deliveries
will be in three months.
The Maharana's swing bed is the most expensive of all the items, costing
Pounds 1,795, while the Maharaja's for some reason is just Pounds 1,650. A
swing chair is Pounds 1,595, an armchair Pounds 245, and a carved deckchair
Pounds 95. A canopy with frame and poles is Pounds 300, bolsters Pounds 55,
loose cushions Pounds 25 and armchair and seat cushions Pounds 45.
Benchmark has an illustrated leaflet which it will send to those who are
interested. Write to Denman &amp; Lowe, The Studio, The Old School, Wheatley,
Oxford OX33 1UB. For appointments to view the prototypes telephone
0865-873868.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Loan stock and CGT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I understand that the capital gain/loss on index-linked investment trust
loan stock is exempt from CGT. I have difficulty in appreciating why a
financial instrument can behave like a share index and yet be treated
differently for tax purposes when compared with a balanced equity portfolio
(where CGT applies).
1. Is this because the capital uplift/fall is neither allowable/taxable in
the hands of the trust for corporation tax? (If so, it appears to me that,
in the long run, the ordinary shareholder will lose out as equity markets
outperform fixed interest investment).
2. Does the interest received come with a 25 or 20 per cent tax credit?
3. Where is the price of the loan stock quoted in the FT?
4. Why don't emerging market trusts issue this type of stock?
5. Why is there so little of this type of stock around?
6. Why should a discount imply a greater risk? After all most investment
trusts (and shares) trade without a discount and no one mentions risk (apart
from the usual market risk) there.
1. We do not believe that investment trust loan stock is exempt from capital
gains tax. If it was, there would certainly be a lot more trusts.
2. The interest received comes with a 20 per cent credit.
3. The price of the loan stock is not quoted in the FT. You will find it
only in the stock Exchange official list.
4. Emerging market trusts do not issue this type of stock because it is very
difficult to index emerging markets.
5. If these stocks are held to redemption, they are an effective method of
indexing both capital and income stocks. They are an interesting investment
from this point of view. But they are, in effect, a form of management
gearing and only the most efficient managers (those who beat the index
continually) can afford to take part. Otherwise, there would be a dilution
of the ordinary shares.
6. We would have thought this type of investment carried less risk than
ordinary investment trust shares.
One ought to mention, nevertheless, that there is a risk element because of
their poor marketability. (Answer by Murray Johnstone).
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: What to ask your adviser
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What qualifications should a client look for when choosing an adviser?
If a potential manager gives you satisfactory answers to these questions,
the chances are you will be happy.
1. What security do I get for my money? Ensure that the manager is a
well-established member of a regulatory body such Fimbra or Imro.
2. Is the service suitable for my individual needs? It is pointless paying
for an advisory and investment service you do not want or use. If, on the
other hand, you want a complete management package, then you should listen
carefully to what the potential manager asks you. He can create a proper
portfolio only through probing your personal aims and circumstances
thoroughly.
3. What is the likely performance of my funds going to be? You should get at
least an expected percentage of growth and level of income from an
investment house. In addition, check how much of your portfolio is likely to
go into the investment manager's own funds and what he might invest in
specialised markets.
4. How much is the whole service going to cost? Methods of charging vary
considerably, with everything from fixed management fees to percentage fees
and even fees linked to performance. Be on the look-out for extras such as
charges for tax computations, dealing costs and valuations.
6. What can you do that I cannot do myself by using a stockbroker? Ask about
the quantity and quality of the potential manager's sources and information.
7. Will you run my funds on a discretionary or an advice-only basis.
8. If using a discretionary service, will you keep me informed fully through
contract notes, valuations and regular personal contact.
9. Can I withdraw my funds if necessary? To be fair to both sides, you
should judge a reputable manager on a trial period of at least 15 to 18
months. It is crucial, however, that you can withdraw your own money as and
when you require.
10. What other services do you offer? The capacity to take over your tax
affairs, and perhaps offer guidance on insurance, school fees, banking
facilities and general estate planning, could be useful.
11. Can you give me advice on alternative forms of investment. It might be
rewarding for you, if required, to receive objective, informed counsel about
anything ranging from investment in forestry to enterprise zones.
The answers to all the above points and others, where appropriate, should be
set out in a written agreement. Be sure it suits your personal wishes and
circumstances. (Answer by Murray Johnstone Personal Asset Management).

FT  13 AUG 94 / Minding Your Own Business: And the miller told his tale . .
. - Clive Fewins hears Nigel Moon whistle for the wind
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oh damn] It's stopped] This plaintive cry is a normal part of daily
proceedings as Nigel Moon looks up at the stationary sails on his 60ft
windmill and whistles for the wind.
Downfield Mill, a brick-built, two-sailed, late-Victorian windmill in the
Cambridgeshire fen country at Soham, near Ely, has belonged to Moon for 20
years.
A graduate in history and archaeology, he always wanted to buy a windmill.
So, when the chance came to buy Downfield for Pounds 5,000 at the age of 22,
he left his job with the Leicestershire museum service and took a variety of
part-time jobs for the five years needed to restore the building to working
condition.
Moon has been a full-time miller since 1980, when the project was completed
(apart from an enforced break in 1986 when he spent a year re-building the
36ft sails). The time has gone quickly. On milling days, a flour-covered
Moon can be seen dashing frantically around the five floors, tools usually
in hand as he strives to keep all systems going.
On the days he is not milling, he is on the road delivering his organic
brown and white flour, milled oats, rye, maize and barley to whole-food
warehouses, bakers, and hotels all over the Midlands. 'Sadly, I spend far
too much time on the road. Travel is my Achilles heel as I live in
Leicester, 79 miles away from the mill.
'The reason I have not moved is mainly economic. Although I have tried, I
have been unable to develop new markets round the fens. All my selling is in
my native Midlands. To move to Soham would mean more, not less, time on the
road.'
Although it is an exhausting, seven-day-a-week occupation, Moon says he
would not do anything else. He last took a holiday 20 years ago.
'I certainly don't do this job for the money,' he said. 'Last year I turned
over Pounds 34,000, and after deducting all my overheads managed to pay
myself about Pounds 100 a week. Fortunately I am single. It would be
impossible to support a family on what I earn, and luckily I have the help
of my mother, who is 75 but still drives over to the mill with me and does
all sorts of jobs, including cutting the grass.'
If he was able to cope with one more large contract Moon reckons he could
raise turnover to Pounds 40,000. He had the chance to do this recently, but
had to turn it down. 'Physically I just couldn't manage all the extra work,'
he said.
Moon has reluctantly concluded that the only way to expand his business  -
and to cope more easily with the physical challenge of handling 10 tons of
machinery as a one-man operation - is to sell Downfield and buy a more
efficient mill.
'Even when there is no wind and the sails are down it is hard work because I
have a set of stones powered by a belt drive from an electric motor I
installed in an adjoining building,' Moon said.
'Working the mill this way is not as satisfying as when it is running on the
sails, but the two systems often run in concert and the electric system
helps to keep production going.
'I need to mill between 1 1/2 and two tonnes a week to fulfil my obligations
to my customers. It can be very hard if there is no wind. I often used to
get up at unbelievable hours and dash over to Soham if there was a good wind
blowing. But then I realised that this area has its own peculiar weather
system, so I just come when it suits me.
'Most weeks I can rely on sufficient wind to get by - but it is not always
on the days when I want to be here milling]
'Downfield is a lovely old smock mill, but when it was rebuilt in 1890 by a
local family they didn't use the latest internal design,' he said.
'Ideally you want a storage floor at the top with the millstones on the
floor below that, not on the first floor, as at Downfield. The real object
should be to achieve an on-line flow system using gravity all the time. At
Soham a lot of the processes move in reverse. It keeps me fit, but I have to
do a lot of charging around.'
Moon has his eye on another, technologically more sophisticated windmill
nearer his home.
'If I were to sell Downfield I reckon I would get more for the land around
it than for the mill itself,' Moon said. 'Two years after I bought the mill
for Pounds 5,000, provided by my late father, I was able to buy the
quarter-acre plot that goes with it. There is certainly room for a house
here. All I need to do now is to find someone mad enough to buy the mill]
'If I am able to buy the other windmill I have in mind, I reckon I could get
it going with a minimum of restoration. And because it is better laid out
than Downfield I am sure it would be more profitable. The books would
certainly benefit from my not having to spend so much time on the road and I
would be able to reduce my overdraft. I reckon transport costs me Pounds 100
a week, so I would be able to make big savings.
'Nevertheless, I am not really in this business for the money. There must be
thousands of easier ways of making a living]'

FT  13 AUG 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Games that build teams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH ROE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You could be forgiven for thinking that Guy Baker is an Australian beach bum
taking a short break from the stresses and strains of windsurfing.
But while this does number among his many hobbies, the sun-bleached hair and
tanned skin are deceptive. At 34, Baker is the managing director of Catalyst
Event Management, an unusual team-building company which has experienced
enormous growth over its near five-year existence.
Baker is a communication studies graduate with a PhD in recreational
management. He began work at the sports council in London. He moved from
there to Catalyst in the Lake District to run the outdoor team-building
project, Loophole, an adaptation of the BBC TV programme, Now Get Out of
That. At that time, there were many companies coming up to the Lakes to get
involved with similar projects with Catalyst's competitors.
'We thought that rather than the companies coming up here, we would go to
them,' says Baker. 'That way we could reach the people with bigger budgets,
such as the sales and marketing departments.'
Catalyst is based just outside Kendal in a large house. Sales director John
Bird has an office in the Midlands. There are also small franchises in
Washington and Cyprus. Catalyst has a staff of eight at Kendal but, for
large events, it recruits experts to teach specific skills needed in the
teambuilding activities. Events have been carried out in locations ranging
from Brighton and Nottingham to Slovakia and Cyprus.
The games include Fifteen Famous Minutes, where teams produce their own
Hollywood movie. Gone With the Wind and The Three Musketeers are two typical
examples for which the filming equipment, full costume, make-up and such
crucial accessories as Havana cigars, are provided to get into the spirit of
the game. A typical film would cost companies around Pounds 1,000 for a team
of 15. Other team-building skills might include conquering the wild west or
playing at being a hot-shot reporter.
Catalyst does run games that encompass the more traditional forms of
team-building, with an emphasis on physical competitiveness and stamina.
But, says Baker: 'We have steered away from anything traditional, which is
why clients find it fun. We help people to use the right-hand side of the
brain, the creative side, which is all too often untapped.'
Catalyst was started as a venture capital project in 1989 by Beacon
Broadcasting Communications. Beacon bore most of the start-up costs of about
Pounds 100,000, and not everything has been rosy. Turnover in the first year
was Pounds 80,000. It rose to Pounds 500,000 in 1992. Then Baker and fellow
team-builder Martin Ruby decided to go it alone. They raised Pounds 50,000
from shares and arranged a Pounds 10,000 overdraft facility from the bank.
It was not easy to convince the banks that an independent Catalyst would be
feasible.
Last year, their first since independence, turnover reached almost Pounds 1m
and profits were about Pounds 50,000.
But again, there have been setbacks. The company was surprised by a Pounds
12,000 tax bill. 'I've never been in a business before which made money so
it was a bit of a shock when we had to pay this much tax,' says Baker.
Cumbria is not the most fashionable location for a business dealing with
multi-national clients, but Baker is not deterred by what he calls the
company's geographical snob problem.
Expansion plans are constantly considered, but Guy is not too worried if
they do not come off in the end. 'There's no need for us to grow as long as
we maintain our present business,' he says.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Gilt deals in danger - A privatised
postal service could end them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheap dealing in gilts for personal investors could be under threat in the
privatisation of the postal brokerage service now run by National Savings.
Thirty companies had applied by the August 5 deadline to take part in the
tender, including Barclays, Lloyds, National Westminster and Sharelink.
Seven will be asked to bid in October in competition with National Savings'
in-house team.
As the table shows, the National Savings postal dealing service now has both
the lowest minimum charge and the lowest commission on deals worth up to
about Pounds 12,000.
In the year to April, National Savings handled 80,366 postal gilts
transactions, worth Pounds 378m, with purchases averaging Pounds 4,751 in
value and sales Pounds 4,627. During the bout of enthusiasm for gilts
brought on by falling interest rates in 1992/1993, it did 133,800 postal
deals worth Pounds 534m.
The cost to investors does not appear, however, to have been a prime
consideration for officials at the Department for National Savings who are
in charge of the tender, at least in the initial stages.
Nigel Bartram, Sharelink's marketing director, said National Savings had
approached his company some months before the tender was advertised, asking
if it would be interested in bidding.
'We had a request for a certain amount of information, none of which bears
on cost,' he said. The focus had been on quality of service, performance
measurement, and volumes and types of business.
Bartram said it was too early for Sharelink to judge if the gilts business
would be worth a bid if the company got on to the final list but the
charging structure looked unattractive.
'The charges levied by the National Savings stock register are very
significantly below those that obtain anywhere else,' he said. 'If anybody
is investing from time to time in gilts, that is the most cost-effective
way. But if you want real-time prices and instant dealing, you go to a
broker.'
Bartram added that the pricing of the National Savings gilts service was
based on promoting the sale of government debt rather than ensuring the
service provider could cover costs and make a margin.
Sharelink, mainly a telephone-based share-dealing service, handles about
Pounds 1.4bn worth of equities a year but only between Pounds 700,000 and
Pounds 1m a year in gilts deals. The firm says this reflects the low level
of private investor activity in the sector.
Although other potential bidders declined to comment in detail, they may
well share Bartram's sentiment: 'We would not be interested in running a
service at a loss on behalf of the government.'

FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: First with the latest - Joanna
Slaughter on investment managers / The Professionals, James Capel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At James Capel, the directors of the UK investment management division like
to boast that their private clients receive the latest market information
before the institutions. Certainly, Capel's independent research team is
both respected and admired, thanks to its habit of dominating the investment
analysis league tables.
The firm also believes it has an advantage as one of Britain's oldest
stockbrokers, and from safeguarding its independence while benefiting from
the resources of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation which
acquired Capel eight years ago.
Simon Corbett, the director in charge of the division, says: 'Stock
selection is what James Capel is very good at, and stock selection is the
edge that we have.
'We are big stockbrokers, and I think it is very important in managing
private client portfolios to continue to be involved with the market, minute
by minute.'
Capel is willing to construct a portfolio of equities for a private client
with Pounds 100,000 of assets, a relatively modest minimum figure in today's
market place. The house view is that each client needs at least 20 stocks
for spread and that Pounds 5,000 is the minimum working unit for a
shareholding.
The client's exposure to overseas markets is provided by collective funds
and, with Pounds 500m of private client money in unit trusts and investment
trusts, Capel devotes considerable research to these investment vehicles.
Andrew Withey, senior investment strategist, explains: 'We rate all the
major unit trusts, investment trusts and offshore funds on a scale of A to
E, and the James Capel trusts are assessed and rated like anyone else in the
market. We go through the performance and the portfolios and, in a lot of
cases, we will have the managers in.'
Although Capel is basically an equity house, the acquisition of Midland bank
by HSBC brought W. Greenwell into the fold. With Greenwell came a wealth of
gilts expertise, and Capel's directors argue that one of the firm's
strengths is the diversity of experience it can bring to private client
portfolio management.
Private investors are the firm's main pre-occupation, and Corbett points to
the large number of people there who are dedicated to the business of
running private client money. There are 59 private client fund managers, 40
of whom are front-line private client executives.
There are no formal white or black lists of shares to constrain the
managers, but Corbett says they would not buy shares in companies not
followed by James Capel and the other three investment houses from which it
takes research.
Each manager appears to have considerable freedom but there is no cover for
rogue elephants. The managers meet each morning, to discuss deals done the
previous day, and the purchase of a strange or wayward stock would be
exposed quickly.
The strategy committee confers monthly and provides the models around which
the investment managers work. Withey, who chairs the committee, says it
tries not to make dramatic overnight asset allocation shifts.
He adds: 'Back at the end of last year we were a bit nervous and raised
about 3 or 4 per cent in cash, but today we are all but fully invested.' The
framework asset allocation for equity portfolios reflects this view, with 99
per cent of the holding in shares and the 1 per cent balance in cash.
Four per cent of the equity portfolio is in emerging markets and Withey
says: 'Investment money follows growth. Most of the mature economies of the
world are struggling to grow at 2 or 3 per cent, but, if you look at
emerging markets, growth is 5 or 6 per cent.'
For balanced portfolios, the Capel breakdown is: UK equities, 61 per cent;
US, 5 per cent; Japan, 5 per cent; Europe, 3 per cent; Mature Pacific, 3 per
cent; Emerging Pacific, 1 per cent; other emerging markets, 2 per cent;
long-dated gilts, 13 per cent; short-dated gilts; 2 per cent; index-linked
gilts, 1 per cent; overseas bonds, 1 per cent; and cash, 1 per cent.
Sixty per cent of Capel's private client money is managed on an advisory
basis and, although the firm's preference is for discretionary money,
Corbett concedes: 'It is a very good discipline to have advisory clients.
You have got to sell advice to them, and that means you have to get your act
together.'
Unlike some leading private client stockbrokers, Capel has moved to
management fees on the ground that this is a 'much fairer way' to pay for
its services. But the strategy is to keep charges relatively low and
competitive: the minimum annual fee is Pounds 750. Discretionary clients
also receive a 40 per cent discount on transaction charges.
Capel sometimes advertises its private client services and it would be
strange if the directors had not cast a glance at the potential of Midland
bank to introduce new clients.
The most prolific source of new business is, however, the firm's existing
clients. 'They're the best sales force we have,' says Corbett.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Black horse looks a banker - Lloyds
likely to succeed in C&amp;G bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society is one of the UK's most
self-confident mortgage lenders. It does not usually cast itself in the role
of an organisation driven by events.
Yet, chief executive Andrew Longhurst could not emphasise strongly enough
this week that his board originally had intended all C&amp;G's members to make a
windfall gain in sharing out the Pounds 1.8bn cash takeover bid from Lloyds
Bank.
He stressed that the society had been forced to produce a more restricted
scheme for spreading the money among fewer members only because of a High
Court ruling.
Acknowledging that people now excluded from the payments - investors who
opened accounts after the end of 1992, and all borrowers - would be unhappy,
Longhurst sought to pre-empt criticism by saying C&amp;G had wanted to include
them.
'If they are to be described as victims,' he added, 'then they are the law's
victims or the government's victims - not C&amp;G's victims.'
Although borrowers will get no cash payments, they should benefit from the
more competitive rates expected to result from C&amp;G becoming part of the
Lloyds bank group.
Like C&amp;G investors, those in the former Heart of England building society,
the business of which was transferred to C&amp;G last October, will qualify for
payments if they opened investment accounts before the end of 1992.
All payments will be made soon after completion of the deal. This is now
expected next summer if it is approved by a special general meeting in
March.
Some C&amp;G members, however, are not convinced that C&amp;G had no choice but to
act as it has done. Their questions include:
Why was there no appeal against the High Court judgment restricting
payments?
Why did the society not simply set a different cut-off date for qualifying
investors to include more of them, even at the expense of extending the
timetable for the deal to proceed?
Longhurst said C&amp;G had not appealed because there was no guarantee the
appellate court would have ruled in the society's favour. In any case, he
added, such a move certainly would have involved another extension of the
original timetable.
The original deal was announced in April. C&amp;G feels renewed uncertainty over
its future would have a poor effect on both the society and the bank.
Those who see things differently include Paul Rivlin and Peter Nicholson,
who are organising members into a C&amp;G Alternatives Group, which intends to
call for a special general meeting in the autumn. It takes 100 members to
call for such a meet-ing.
Rivlin says there are three broad subjects which the group would like the
board to justify to members:
The decision to abandon mutual ownership;
Rejecting the idea of floating the society instead of simply transferring to
an existing organisation such as Lloyds;
Excluding other potential bidders for C&amp;G. (This would include discussing
the society's Pounds 1.8bn valuation.)
The deal with Lloyds depends on approval by C&amp;G's borrowers and investors in
two separate votes.
The society has 370,000 borrowers and a simple majority of their votes is
required. There is no minimum voting threshold for borrowers.
But the investors' resolution must be approved by at least 75 per cent of
those who vote. It must also be approved by at least half of the total
number of investors eligible to vote, or investors holding 90 per cent of
the total balances of those eligible to vote.
The recent history of building societies suggests the great majority of
members are content to accept the judgments of their boards about how they
should progress.
On that basis, even if the alternatives group gets its special general
meeting and despite the high levels of approval the Lloyds bid must win from
members, C&amp;G looks likely to team up with the black horse.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Winners and losers . . .
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The winners are qualifying investors who opened accounts before the end of
1992 (and maintain them until the completion date), children and trustees,
who had been excluded first time round.
Losers are borrowers and savers who opened accounts after 1992. Because far
fewer people qualify, they will receive more.
Investors - savers who are members of the society - will get, for each
account, around 13 per cent of the balance and, if they have more than
Pounds 100 at the end of December this year, a flat-rate payment of Pounds
500, up to a maximum of Pounds 13,500 for each account. Depositors will get
similar amounts.
The average payment to an individual will be about Pounds 2,000; payments
are expected to be taxed as capital gain.
If the balance on a share account was higher on April 20 than on March 31
this year, the percentage payout will be based on the lower balance of April
20 or completion day. Similarly, those who had a higher balance on March 31
will be paid 13 per cent on the lower balance of that day or completion day.
Those with joint share accounts will not qualify for payment if the sole or
first-named account holder died/dies between December 31 1992 and completion
day, unless the surviving account holder qualifies in their own right on
another account.
Holders of Pibs and C&amp;G Channel Island accounts will get Pounds 500 and the
13 per cent.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: The endowment trap - Surrender and
lose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cashing in an endowment mortgage within the first five years is likely to
lose you far more money than paying off a repayment mortgage early. But
endowments remain the best-selling type, mainly because commission-based
advisers make more from them.
Endowments comprise an interest-only loan and a stock market-linked savings
plan, with life insurance thrown in. If the savings plan grows in line with
expectations, it should pay off the capital sum at the end of the term; any
amount remaining can be taken as a tax-free lump sum. The borrower's monthly
payments are made up of the interest payable to the lender and premiums to
the life office.
Banks and building societies are paid commission for selling endowments but
not for the repayment type, which does not have a life insurance element.
Monthly instalments on a repayment mortgage cover interest and capital.
The Office of Fair Trading is expected to publish figures this autumn
showing that, if an endowment is surrendered at the end of the first year,
anyone paying Pounds 100 a month for a policy (equating roughly to a
mortgage of just over Pounds 80,000) would, on average, be Pounds 600-Pounds
800 worse off than if they had taken out a repayment mortgage.
If the surrender occurred at the end of the fifth year, then the relative
disadvantage would be Pounds 1,600-Pounds 1,800 on average. In the worst
cases, the disadvantage can be twice the average.
The main problem is surrender values. An OFT report in June found wide
disparities in the surrender values of life insurance policies after
surveying 60 of the UK's largest life insurers, and our table bears this
out. In all three cases, cashing in the repayment mortgage is a cheaper
option than an endowment.
You would, however, be far worse off with an endowment mortgage from Allied
Dunbar, if you redeemed it within five years, than from the other lenders.
This is because Allied Dunbar pays nothing for surrender in the first five
years, even though the customer would have paid in premiums of Pounds 4,266
by the end of the fifth year.
Allied Dunbar says: 'Our adaptable endowment plan is only offered to cover
mortgages where there is a client need for the product to be sustained to
cover the mortgage over its full period.'
Early surrender values are of particular concern to consumer groups.
Although an endowment mortgage ideally should be regarded as a long-term
savings plan, many people do surrender early. According to the OFT, figures
from one lender suggest about one-third of endowment policies are
surrendered in the first four to five years.
If you want to repay your mortgage early, it is a better idea to pay off the
capital but keep the endowment going as a separate savings plan.
Repayment mortgages have drawbacks, too. In the early years, for instance,
you pay more in interest than reducing capital. And, if you move often, you
will find you make little headway on paying off the capital.

Directors at Seton Healthcare have been selling to improve liquidity in
their stock. This happens quite often in companies where the shares are held
tightly but there is strong institutional demand for equity. By keeping the
stock too tightly, a false market can be created. To avoid this, corporate
brokers may advise a release of some shares.
Brandon Hire is involved in leasing all kinds of equipment including
marquees, furniture and power tools. It has been quoted on the Unlisted
Securities Market since late 1989 but, in the next few months, expects to
get a full stock market listing. In order to satisfy the criteria required
for this, chairman Brian Nathan and managing director Richard Bryan have
sold stock to diminish their personal stakes. Other members of the board
took the opportunity to acquire shares.
Barry Charles, chief executive of electronics company Electron House, sold
stock worth more than Pounds 161,000 during the week to fund the purchase of
a house. He retains 40,000 shares.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Good news for the few - Pibs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The good news is that owners of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's permanent
interest-bearing shares will be entitled to a flat-rate payout of Pounds 500
and about 13 per cent of the balance (subject to a maximum balance of Pounds
100,000).
The bad news is that very few private individuals hold C&amp;G Pibs, which were
issued in denominations of Pounds 50,000 in October 1992. In any case, to
qualify, you would need to have bought the Pibs before the end of December
1992 - and hold them to the day the proposed takeover of C&amp;G by Lloyds bank
takes place some time in the summer of 1995.
News of the restructured deal for C&amp;G customers on Thursday (see page V) had
little effect on the price of C&amp;G Pibs, according to Hoare Govett's Peter
Capel. He said the spread - the difference between buying and selling - of
C&amp;G Pibs had tightened recently in anticipation of the proposed merger.
Pibs are issued by building societies to raise capital. They have no
maturity date, so the investor's capital cannot be guaranteed. Since they
are irredeemable, investors can get back their money only by selling them on
the open market.
In theory, they pay a fixed rate of interest indefinitely, but missed
interest payments do not mount up for payment at a later date. Pib-holders
are last in line for repayment in the event of a wind-up and are not covered
by a compensation scheme.
But even though the market is relatively small and illiquid - the sort of
market in which institutions rather than individuals are more usually to be
found - private investors have been attracted to Pibs because of their
relatively high yields, as the table shows.
These yields are, generally, linked to the gilts market; but, since building
societies are considered a less reliable issuer than the government, the
Pibs yields are relatively higher.
'The steepness of the yield curve means that Pibs continue to offer yields
in excess of 10 per cent,' said Capel. 'This compares very favourably with
the most recent Bank of England inflation report, which forecast that the
underlying rate of inflation will peak between 3-4 per cent in the first
quarter of 1995.'
Variations in the price differentials between different Pibs are due to
building society factors. Those that are regarded as a better credit risk
tend to have lower yields than others.
If the C&amp;G/Lloyds merger goes through, prices for Pibs of other building
societies - particularly those deemed merger candidates - are expected to
benefit. These include Bristol &amp; West, Coventry, Skipton, Leeds &amp; Holbeck,
and Cheshire.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Last of the banks - The week ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors will be watching for shocks at HSBC Holdings as it concludes the
interim results season for UK banks. Shares have already fallen sharply this
year on worries over Asia-Pacific growth, and its exposure to financial
markets trading.
On Monday, the bank, now the parent of Midland bank, is expected to report
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 1.3bn, compared with Pounds 1.17bn. Earnings
per share are expected to rise by 5 per cent to about 34p and the dividend
to be increased 14 per cent to 8p.
Argos, the catalogue retailer, is forecast on Monday to announce an increase
in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 13.2m to about Pounds 15m. The
company said at its annual meeting that like-for-like sales - which exclude
new stores - had increased 9 per cent in the first four months of the year,
although they had slowed since then. Margins are thought to have held
steady.
Kalon, the paints group, is expected to report increased first-half profits
of Pounds 10m (Pounds 8.73m) on Tuesday following improved contributions
from Novodec - the French paint maker acquired for Pounds 22m last year -
and Vallance, the specialist products business which cost Pounds 6.2m. It
has also enjoyed some organic growth in the trade paints business, and is
likely to recommend a 1.5p (1.3p) interim dividend.
Continued rate competition in the US insurance market could hold back profit
growth at Sedgwick, the insurance broker, which reports its interim results
on Tuesday. Analysts expect pre-tax profits for the six months to be between
Pounds 55m and Pounds 64m, against Pounds 54.1m.
Britannic Assurance, the life insurance company, will on Wednesday announce
its results for the first half of the year. Like other life companies, it is
not required to release interim profits figures, so attention will focus on
the interim dividend.
Last summer, the interim rose to 3.85p, against 3.433p. Analysts' forecasts
for the interim dividend this year are round 4.2p or 4.3p - an increase of 9
or 10 per cent.
BICC, the cables and construction company, reports its interim results on
Wednesday. The results should show a further improvement in the group's main
UK and US cable markets with pre-tax profits expected to nudge above Pounds
60m for the six months to the end of June, against a re-stated Pounds 50m.
Earnings should be sufficient to cover a maintained dividend but increased
payments to shareholders are some way off.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Life company hits trouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whenever an organisation says 'business as usual', the immediate reaction is
that if this really were the position, there would be no call to say so,
write Alison Smith and Tracy Corrigan.
Even with that caution, the statement yesterday from Confederation Life in
the UK that it was carrying on as normal, despite the intervention by
Canadian regulators in its Toronto-based parent company, does contain some
information to comfort UK customers.
First, there is the knowledge that most of the 250,000 UK policyholders come
under the control of the British operation. This is ring-fenced from
whatever happens to the Canadian company.
Then, there is the prospect that the UK operation is about to be sold to
what Confederation Life describes as a 'large financial services company of
significant financial strength'. That announcement was made earlier last
week, although negotiations began a few months ago.
The talks, which are now in the hands of the Canadian regulators, are
expected to be concluded very soon.
There are, however, about 35,000 people who took out policies from the UK
branch when it was still part of the Canadian operation, before 1990. While
they fall within the ambit of the parent company, the Canadian regulators
intend to include this group as part of the sale of the UK subsidiary.
Both the Department of Trade and Industry and the Bank of England have been
kept informed about the progress of disposing of the UK operation, which
includes Confederation Bank. This offers residential mortgage loans and
deposit account facilities.
While the bank has often featured in our Highest Rates table, the life
operation has been one of those named by the Office of Fair Trading as
giving poor values to customers who give up long-term savings policies at a
very early stage.
The main focus of its business is pensions and it is one of the leading
providers of pooled pension products for medium-sized companies. It made
pre-tax profits in 1993 of Pounds 27.9m against Pounds 14.2m in 1992.
If the worst were to happen and the UK company failed, the policyholders'
protection scheme - set up in 1975 as a safety net for customers - would
come into play and the priority would be to transfer the business on a
working basis. It would be wound up only as a last resort.
Bondholders have also been left in a state of uncertainty. Dealers yesterday
stopped making prices in Confederation Life bonds, which means that
investors are unable to sell bonds at any price.
In the sterling market, the group has a Pounds 100m issue of 9 1/2 per cent
notes due 1997, arranged by SG Warburg, and a Pounds 100m issue of
subordinated bonds due 2003, arranged by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Some
dealers said yesterday that the subordinated bonds are being viewed as
worthless, as they will rank below other types of debt when any pay-out is
made.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Power to the people - and profits,
too - Now that the industry's regulator has delivered his judgment, Michael
Smith analyses the prospects of the regional companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in the regional electricity companies in England and Wales are
used to good times. But, even by their standards, this has been a very good
week. Following the industry regulator's Thursday announcement on what the
market views as generous price controls, shares in the 12 companies rose in
value by more than Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 15.9bn. There could be more to
come - possibly much more.
Even if the companies were simply to stand still and get on with the
efficiency savings which the regulator assumes they are capable of
achieving, most analysts believe that at least some of them remain
under-valued and that the sector will continue to outperform the market for
months, perhaps years.
The companies are not about to stand still, though. They have a heavy agenda
for the next year and most of it seems likely to enhance the value of their
shares. Top of the list is the likely flotation of the National Grid, the
transmission company owned by the regional companies and which is worth at
least Pounds 4bn.
One option is for shareholders to be issued with shares in the grid. Another
would be to distribute money raised through the flotation to shareholders
through a special dividend. Either way, they would benefit. A decision is
likely in the autumn, with the flotation following next spring.
Long before that, though, at least some of the companies will have followed
the lead of Eastern Electricity in buying back its own shares to cancel
them. With nearly all of the companies cash-positive already - and most,
possibly all, expected to increase their cash piles after the review comes
into force - buy-backs may enable companies to boost both earnings per share
and the amount of money they can pay out in dividends.
There is also the possibility of take-overs and mergers, both of and by the
companies. But the City will be wary of any acquisitions the companies make
outside the sector, given the patchy acquisitions record of other utilities.
It would be more likely to welcome mergers between regional power companies,
given the potential for economies. There is also a possibility of them
attracting the attention of a conglomerate or an overseas utility company.
The decisions of Professor Stephen Littlechild, the regulator, on Thursday
probably will have more effect than any other single factor on the companies
this decade. The distribution businesses on which he has imposed price
controls contribute about 80 per cent of the regional companies' profits,
and the review lasts for five years.
There was no disguising the relief felt by regional company executives. In
spite of public statements about the toughness of the regime, it was nowhere
near as onerous as they had feared.
Some analysts had, until recently, predicted cuts in distribution prices
next April of up to 30 per cent, and increases thereafter limited to
inflation minus 4 per cent in subsequent years. But the outcome was 11 to 17
per cent coupled with inflation minus only 2 per cent.
As a result, virtually all City analysts were upgrading their forecasts for
the amount by which companies can increase their dividends over the next
five years.
Since the yield of utility shares is one of their main attractions, dividend
growth is a key indicator for investors. Estimates for real annual increases
in dividends vary from 6 to 10 per cent for the sector as a whole, way above
the stock market average. Average earnings per share, after an initial drop
next year, should grow by at least 2 to 3 percentage points above inflation.
That, then, is the broad picture. But what are the prospects for the
individual companies?
Although they were classified as three groups in the review, with different
levels of price-cutting resulting, City views on how they fared do not
necessarily relate to the group in which they appeared. This is because the
price cuts take into account a number of factors, including capital spending
requirements and treatment under the previous regime.
Eastern Electricity's shares reached a record high on Thursday as analysts
welcomed the regulator's decision to place the company in the group of three
which must cut allowed prices by 11 per cent. After a poor start in the
City's eyes following privatisation, Eastern's management under chief
executive John Devaney is considered one of the best bets to cut costs and
is on several brokers' buy lists.
East Midlands Electricity was another in the 11 per cent group; this,
according to one analyst, was 'the first good news they have had for two
years'. Following problems over early acquisitions, the company has
installed a new management which has rectified previous mistakes. But it
needs some high capital spending; this was one reason for inclusion in its
group.
London Electricity had the biggest share rise amid relief that the regulator
had, apparently, accepted its argument that its high cost base was justified
by the difficulties of servicing the capital. The shares had been hit before
Thursday because it was thought the company could have to cut prices by more
than most.
Manweb is one of three companies in the group which, on the face of it,
fared worst because they must cut allowable prices by 17 per cent. But it
argues that the review is less severe than it seems, partly because the
company's prices are lower than permitted and partly because of the benefits
accruing from the previous pricing regime.
Although traditionally rated highly, analysts are divided as to Manweb's
merits. Some say it can still reduce costs but others claim it is missing
out by not diversifying.
Midlands Electricity was in the middle group which must cut allowable prices
by 14 per cent. Several brokers, including SG Warburg, say it is a buy, in
part because of the number of provisions it has made which may be released
into profits later.
Northern Electric is one of three companies which will incur a 17 per cent
cut in allowable charges from April. While it appears on few analysts' buy
lists, the company's position is poor only in the context of what is
considered an extremely favourable review for the sector. 'None of the
shares in this sector should be sold,' says one analyst.
Norweb is judged by most analysts to have fared about averagely and remains
one of the sector's higher rated companies. It benefits from its plans to
increase significantly the amount of money it makes from unregulated income,
including overseas and retailing ventures.
Seeboard was placed by Littlechild in the middle group, with a 14 per cent
cut required in allowable prices. Analysts were split: some felt it had
fared badly while others argued it had done well. But, with strong
profitability and high dividend cover, it remains rated highly.
Southern Electric is thought generally to have had an extremely good review.
In spite of above-average rates of return on its capital, it ended up in the
group of companies which faces only an 11 per cent cut in prices. Most
brokers rate the company as a buy.
Swalec appeared in the 17 per cent group and is judged generally to have had
a medium to poor review. Traditionally one of the lowest rated groups, some
analysts believe it has more scope to cut costs than most.
South Western Electricity has been one of the main beneficiaries of the
share price rise since the review's publication. It appears to have
convinced the regulator that its high costs are justified because of the
rural nature of the area it serves.
Yorkshire Electricity was one of the first companies to accept the
regulator's verdict, saying it was tough but challenging. Following a fall
in its rating in the City in the past year or so, several brokers (including
UBS) believe its shares are good value.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Markets: How do we profit from profiteers? - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Should consumers fight back against profiteering by buying shares in the
profiteers? Last month, water shares rose because the price review was less
tough than feared. This week, electricity shares soared for the same reason
(see page III for details). And Royal Insurance got a warm welcome when it
announced profits which included an underwriting profit of more than 17 per
cent on its UK consumer business.
There are, however, important differences between the water and electricity
businesses and general insurance. One reason why the utility companies are
such a joy to the investor is that the regulators control their prices not
their profits. So provided the companies can squeeze their own costs, there
is theoretically no limit to the amount by which profits can rise. Add to
that their effective local monopolies, and the inflation-proofing implicit
in the price control mechanism, and you have a real licence to print money.
The insurance business nowadays is very different indeed. It may be
sporadically profitable in certain areas, but overall it no longer makes
money on its basic underwriting business. Insurance shares may look
attractive right now - but they have been a lousy long-term investment.
Yet, until the middle of this century, general insurance companies did make
good profits from underwriting. Up to the 1950s they normally made around 5
per cent.
This margin slipped back to around 2 per cent in the 1960s, and in the 1970s
underwriting moved into the red, where it has broadly stayed ever since.
Some 20 years ago, a former chairman of Royal, Sir Paul Chambers, famously
predicted a return to underwriting profits of 5 per cent. His mistake was to
assume that history would repeat itself. The trend towards investing in
equities encouraged insurance companies to rely on stock market gains for
part of their profits. Competition drove insurance premium rates down. And
the hitherto cosy world of the big insurance companies was irrevocably gone.
There are some useful investment points to note here.
First, and fairly obvious, always look at the whole of a company's business,
not just the bit that affects you.
Second, look not just for good profits but for sustainable profits - at
least if you are a long term investor, rather than a speculator. Finally,
always bear in mind that long term changes in business and investment do
happen.
Consols had their day, and so did general insurance companies. Utilities are
still enjoying theirs. But keep one eye on the horizon.
Back to that 17 per cent profit Royal made on its consumer business. The
actual figures were 18 per cent on household (buildings and contents)
business and 15 per cent on motor. Motor insurance premiums are already on
the way down (see Weekend FT July 30, page V) and household rates are coming
back a bit. But the insurers do not expect them to fall as much as motor
rates.
The people who are forcing rates down are the direct insurers who cut out
the middleman and sell by telephone. They can offer better deals, because
their cost are less, and competitors have to follow. But it is harder for
the direct insurers to nose into the household market than into motor.
Why? One reason is that something like 40 per cent of all household
insurance comes via building societies. The societies get commission of up
to 30 per cent of the premiums, which does wonders for their overall
financial well-being.
Broadly, for every Pounds 100 you pay in household insurance premiums some
30 - 35 per cent goes in commission and other costs, 15 to 20 per cent in
profits, and at most half is actually spent on paying claims.
The building societies defense of their rather comfortable commission has
always been a double one. First, they do a lot of the admin for the
insurance companies. Secondly, the profit they make from their insurance
commissions subsidises their mortgage business. Maybe. But perhaps consumers
would like to make their own choices.
The brave new world of compulsory disclosure is looming over the life
insurance companies. How about some voluntary disclosure of who gets what
from your household insurance premiums?
Kids' lib apart, the new Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester sweeteners are rather damp
squibs. Very broadly, more depositors will benefit, mainly because the
qualifying date is later. (See page V) Borrowers miss out, but get a warm
nod and wink from C &amp; G boss Andrew Longhurst.
How much is that worth? When the Lloyd's offer was originally announced C &amp;
G hinted that it was confident its sweetener proposal would work and would
fight for it in the Courts if necessary. But when the High Court turned it
down, C &amp; G appeared reluctantly to concede that there was no point in
fight-ing.
The Department of Trade recently closed some illegal pyramid selling
schemes. Some of the victims are forming an action group to fight the DTI's
intrusion, which they consider an infringement of civil liberties.

per cent over the week to Thursday 11 August. This move leaves it very close
to its level at the beginning of the year, whereas the FT-SE-A All Share
index is still over 6 per cent down, and the FT-SE 100 over 8 per cent down.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays trebled its interim profits to Pounds 1.04bn before tax for the six
months to end June, thanks partly to a Pounds 680m cut in bad debt
provisions. The interim dividend was increased by 23 per cent to 8p a share.
Chief executive Martin Taylor commented that Barclays had made 'lousy
returns' in the past few years.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Fall in F &amp; C net assets - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust reported interim results this week,
showing a fall in net assets from 148p to 134.2p per share during the six
months to June 30. The share price fell 10.9 per cent in the first half,
which was not as much as the 13 per cent drop in the FT-SE-A All-Share
Index.
F &amp; C blamed fears of a higher inflation-rate and rising interest rates,
particularly in the US, for the falls. It warned that stock markets may have
difficulty in making progress, partly because of the rapid expansion of the
US economy.

Investment trust savings schemes continue to be popular with private
investors who poured Pounds 122.1m into them in the first half of the year,
an increase of 20 per cent on the same period last year.
The Association of Investment Trust Companies, which published the figures,
said that the number of regular savers (as opposed to lump sum investors who
can also invest via the savings scheme) has increased every quarter since
the end of 1992, to 79,000 from just under 56,000. The average amount
invested by regular savers is Pounds 80 a month.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Markets: Players gratefully take their eyes off the ball -
Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It usually helps if Wall Street has something other than the price of stocks
and bonds to think about during the slumbers that typically afflict US
financial markets at this time of the year, and that something this week has
been the baseball players' strike.
While the mid-season disruption of America's national pastime may not be a
particularly happy subject, it has at least provided respite, for traders
and investors, from the numbing dissections of economic statistics and the
endless speculation about Federal Reserve monetary policy that normally
passes for intelligent discussion around the trading floors and executive
offices of lower Manhattan.
At least with the baseball strike, there are some certainties everyone can
rely upon: namely, the rich and greedy owners are fighting with the rich and
greedy players over money (in this case, how to divide the Dollars 2bn
annual revenues the games generate). This sort of thing has been going on
throughout the history of baseball. This strike, which started yesterday, is
the sport's eighth work stoppage in just over 20 years.
Moreover, while the rest of America struggles to feel sympathy with the two
sides in the dispute, there are plenty of people on Wall Street who can find
common cause with baseball's players and owners.
For example, the players, who earn millions of dollars a year and feel that
nothing should interfere with the free market process that determines the
price placed on their talents, are not far removed from Wall Street's best
dealers and investment bankers. Their annual salaries are also measured in
seven figures, and they would never dream of accepting any restrictions on
who they work for, and for how much.
Similarly, the complaints by club owners that the business of baseball is in
trouble because costs are rising too fast relative to revenues will find an
echo throughout the US business community. The owners insistence that their
survival depends upon their employees - the players - accepting restrictions
on pay levels would make sense to any industry chieftain. For years, US
corporations have been cutting and restructuring their workforces, or
imposing wage cuts or freezes, in an attempt to rein in costs during
business downturns.
This is exactly what is happening on Wall Street. While much of the rest of
corporate America is prospering, the securities broking and investment
banking industry is enduring its most difficult period since 1990. After
three years of record profits, the earnings of Wall Street firms have shrunk
amid falling revenues from securities underwriting, broking and trading.
As a result, Wall Street firms have been taking action to bring costs back
into line with revenues. In the last few weeks, Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber,
Smith Barney Shearson and Prudential Securities - four of the biggest
securities houses in the US - have cut their payrolls, most noticeably in
bonds, which has suffered more than any other area from the deterioration in
market conditions.
More job cuts are likely, because there are few signs of an improvement in
the business environment. If anything, matters may get worse because the
upward trend in domestic interest rates, the root of Wall Street's problems,
has probably not yet peaked.
Just this week, statistics on July retail sales and inflation provided
little evidence to suggest that the economy has been slowing down. If
anything, economists believe the recent data has only made it more likely
that the Fed will put up interest rates again soon, possibly as early as
next week, when the central bank's open market committee meets.
Although another interest rate rise has been partially discounted by Wall
Street, it can only reinforce the bearish mood among stock market dealers
and investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has fallen from just
under 4,000 to its current level of about 3,750 since the Fed started
raising interest rates in February, may have quite a bit further to go
before the cycle of rising rates is complete.
Perhaps the market faces a repeat of the Dow's performance during the last
prolonged baseball strike, in 1981. In that year, the Dow stood at 1,006 on
the first day of the strike. Fifty days later, when the dispute was settled,
the average had dropped more than 6 per cent to 942. From then on it was all
downhill.
By the time the interrupted baseball season was over, barely seven weeks
later, the Dow had plunged another 12.5 per cent to 824. If today's market
repeats the performance of the last baseball-strike year, the Dow will be
down at 3,100 by the end of October, and there will be more unemployed
investment bankers and traders on the street.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Markets: Still skittish after all these profit rises -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Swedish bond market seldom excites London equity traders, who reached
their desks on Thursday only after braving flooded streets and tube
stations. But when a  1/2 percentage point increase in Swedish interest
rates was followed by a similar rise in Italy, many succumbed to a bad case
of cold feet, and the FTSE-100 shed 28.8 points.
There were clear domestic reasons for both moves - concern over the Swedish
inflationary outlook and deficit, plus Italy's determination to defend the
lira at a time of continuing political uncertainty. However, London's
immediate reaction betrayed underlying concern that the European interest
rate cycle is on the turn.
Traders started in equally nervous mood yesterday morning, and at one point
the FTSE-100 was down 27 points, but the bond market rallied on reassuring
US consumer price data and the FTSE-100 ended the day 4.1 points higher.
Analysts of the UK market tend to polarise into two camps: optimists who
continue to focus on the robust recovery in corporate profits, and
pessimists who fear equity values are looking overstretched - particularly
relative to returns available in the gilts market.
UBS points out that the real yield gap between equities and index-linked
gilts has declined from 60 basis points last November to minus 13, and the
last time it turned negative was in early 1987, preceding the stockmarket
crash.
Gilts reflect market scepticism over how long inflation will continue at its
present low level. NatWest Securities accepts the Bank of England will raise
UK interest rates this year in a pre-emptive strike against inflation, but
says investors must be aware that the battle the Bank is facing is not
against a return to the bad old days of UK inflation.
It says: 'Instead the Bank thinks that 3 per cent is achievable on the
current interest rate structure, but its aim is to get back to the lower
half of the target range of 1-4 per cent by the end of this parliament. If
it comes anywhere close to achieving this then it will be a very favourable
outlook for the gilt and UK equity markets.'
The bounce in corporate profitability is now well established. However,
Barclays, the UK biggest bank, still managed to surprise with a trebling in
pre-tax profits to more than Pounds 1bn in the first half of the year -
mainly due to a Pounds 680m drop in bad debt provisions. Not all the news
was good: operating profits fell slightly, partly because of low demand for
loans from recession-chastened consumers and businesses who are in no rush
to take on new debts.
The biggest fillip to equities came from the regulatory review of the
English and Welsh regional electricity companies, which was so favourable to
the 12 RECs that one analyst described it as 'a sheep in wolf's clothing'.
Although the new price formula means average family bills should fall by a
total of Pounds 70-Pounds 90 over the next five years, the City quickly
concluded that the RECs would be able to deliver real dividend growth of at
least 5 per cent over the same period.
The reporting season by the composite insurers got off to a strong start,
with General Accident, Commercial Union and Royal Insurance all coming in
ahead of expectations. Their domestic market recovered strongly, thanks to
higher premiums, efficiency improvements and more careful underwriting.
Good news was not confined to the financial and utilities sectors: profits
at GKN, the automotive components and defence engineering group, rose by 62
per cent, even although sales were up only 9 per cent. Much of the
improvement came from a continuing programme of cost-cutting and an upturn
in several businesses - particularly automotive components, which benefited
from recovery in the continental European car market.
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group, also came in with better
than expected results. Its worldwide speciality chemicals business benefited
from recovery, but results in its consumer businesses in Europe and America
did not yet fully reflect these improving conditions.
You cannot get closer to the consumer than an undertaker, and this tiny
sub-sector this week saw the climax of a dramatic takeover. Service
Corporation International, North America's largest funeral group, was
assured of winning Great Southern Group, the UK funeral company, when the
Takeover Panel refused an attempt to block SCI's revised offer of Pounds
113m.
Loewen, the Canadian funeral group, had tried to prevent SCI from raising
its bid because the Texas-based group made a 'final' offer which omitted a
standard clause allowing the offer to be increased in the event of
competition. The Panel decided this omission by SCI's advisers, led by the
merchant bankers Schroders, was attributable to 'a genuine mistake, however
regrettable'.
SCI has agreed to pay Pounds 4m compensation to investors who sold shares in
Great Southern before the misleading announcement was clarified. It is not
clear who will finally pick up the bill, but it seems unlikely that
Schroders will pocket much of a fee.
Meanwhile, excitement in the British burial business may not be over. The
day after SCI won the Panel's backing, it bought a 3 per cent stake in
Plantsbrook, the only other UK-quoted funeral company, and said it was
interested in buying further shares.
Plantsbrook is 46 per cent owned by Pompes Funebres, France's largest
funeral business, and SCI may want to secure a ring-side seat if the parent
considers asset sales. SCI is also concerned that Loewen Group, its largest
north American competitor, might consider turning its attentions to
Plantsbrook.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Markets: Insurers fail to inspire - Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three of the UK's largest insurance companies reported impressive results
for the first half of 1994 this week - but their managers can be forgiven if
they feel aggrieved by the market's less than enthusiastic reaction.
General Accident (pre-tax profits of Pounds 203.2m against a forecasted
Pounds 177m-Pounds 200m) saw its share price marked down 40p over the week,
and Commercial Union (which posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 181m, at the
top of the expected range) was rewarded with a rise of only 12p to 562p.
Royal Insurance did better, but it is the lowest rated of the composites.
Its share price rose by 17p to close at 279p, after UK results described by
chief executive, Mr Richard Gamble, as its 'best ever'.
'Most analysts' forecasts were blown out of the water but the markets'
reaction has been niggardly,' said Paul Hodges, analyst with James Capel.
The response seems all the more surprising because the shares of composite
insurance companies have underperformed the Footsie index in the last year
and appear under rated.
By Thursday night insurers were on a dividend yield of 5.32 compared to a
market average of 3.78, while the sector's price earnings ratio - measured
on the basis of its historic performance - amounted to only 9.61, compared
to 18.92 for the market.
Underpinning the cool response is the perception that the industry's pricing
cycle has reached its peak and that current buoyant levels of profitability
could soon begin to erode as prices fall.
In particular the markets are concerned by signs of price competition,
especially in the motor market, where a new breed of telephone insurance
companies, led by Direct Line, is making rapid inroads.
Some analysts fear that these pressures will gradually feed through into
other parts of the market, dampening the profitability achieved after
increases in rates and the introduction of more selective underwriting.
This week's results indicate such fears may have been overplayed. Profits
from the home insurance market were particularly good, for example. This was
partly the result of kinder weather which meant fewer claims for storm and
subsidence damage. But it could indicate that the direct writers, which are
currently attacking the home insurance market, may experience more
difficulty in winning market share than they have done in the motor market.
'People generally show more inertia in changing their home insurance policy
from year to year, compared with changing their motor insurer,' says Youssef
Ziai, analyst with Morgan Stanley.
In addition Ziai says that in some parts of the market - such as commercial
property, for example - premium rates are still increasing and he expects
competition from European companies and Lloyd's syndicates to be muted.
Analysts also suggest that the industry's balance sheet is not strong enough
to support rate competition.
Falls in the fixed income and equity markets, have knocked several points
off the solvency margins of the composites. 'The balance sheets of all the
companies have been seriously eroded. There is no excess capital,' says
Hodges. Hodges and Ziai both expect the present period of profitability to
be sustained beyond 1995 and the subsequent downturn to be less sharp. 'If
UK insurers are looking at a long period of healthy results, their share
prices should be higher than they currently are,' says Hodges. 'Investors do
not seem prepared to believe that healthy profits will persist.'
Nevertheless it is not difficult to find sceptics. Steven Bird, analyst with
Smith New Court and the most prominent of the bearish commentators, believes
competition will intensify. He insists that UK trading margins - the
companies made underwriting profits of between 16p and 27p for each pound of
home insurance premium income, for example - are simply unsustainable and
that, outside the UK, returns on capital are generally unimpressive. 'I
can't think of any reason other than possible bid talk for these shares to
rise significantly,' says Bird.

FT  13 AUG 94 / The Long View: Fiendish booby traps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the financial markets are a minefield, derivative instruments such as
swaps, futures and options appear to be the most fiendish of new-fangled
booby traps. Consider the growing number of casualties inflicted in recent
months by these most volatile of financial tools.
First we have the collapse in March of Askin Capital Management, a Wall
Street hedge fund operator whose boss David J. Askin contrived to lose
hundreds of millions in a matter of weeks, using supposedly 'risk neutral'
derivative trading techniques. One thing that is not in dispute is that
Askin himself was baffled by the sheer complexity of his own trading
strategies. His end was swift.
Then we saw Procter &amp; Gamble, veteran of soap and detergent wars, admitting
that its high-powered treasury department had stumbled in its derivative
dealings with Bankers Trust. Brokerage house PaineWebber quickly followed
with news of loss-making derivative trades in one of its mutual funds, which
was supposed to invest in boring, rock solid US government securities. It
felt obliged to reimburse investors out of its own resources.
Nor is the list, which can be extended almost at will, exclusively American.
Europe's biggest banks have been badly hit by the collapse of their
derivative trading profits in the first half of this year. This week brought
news, too, of gilt-edged losses and a spot of derivative difficulty at Union
Discount in the City. The discount house's troubles were hardly significant,
when compared with Allied Lyons' Pounds 150m currency option losses of not
so long ago, but in some ways they were more evocative.
For almost as long as most of us can remember discount houses have
sporadically declared huge losses in their core business of bill broking and
gilt-edged dealing. The normal pattern has been for them to raise money from
shareholders to plug the resulting hole in their capital and to invest in
diversification away from their core operations. All too often the
diversification turns out to be more risky than expected. Union, for
example, which declared an interim loss this week of nearly Pounds 800,000,
lost several million in 1991 as a result of its move into an equipment
leasing business.
The traditional response is for the houses to raise yet more money from
shareholders, while declaring a new-found aversion to risk. Alternatively
they conclude that the game is not worth a candle and merge or sell out,
which is why only a quartet of the old names from the London discount market
survive as independent quoted concerns: Cater Allen, Gerrard &amp; National,
King &amp; Shaxson and Union.
The experience of the discount houses is worth recalling because it helps
identify what is different in the novel world of derivatives trading. And
the difference is not as much as instinct might suggest. For while the
techniques are new - though not all that new by now - the source of this
year's problems is old hat. The really big trouble, of which there has not,
in reality, been that much to date, comes from taking large positions as
principal on the basis of inadequate capital.
Market making and position taking, which is how more and more banks in the
US and Europe expect to make their profits, are exceptionally risky
activities. As the discount houses found out time and again, it is possible
to generate respectable returns in this business for a while, only to be
overtaken by overwhelming losses when hit by shocks like the 1987 stock
market crash.
The novelty in today's markets lies in the complexity, the lack of liquidity
and, especially important, the lack of transparency. Balance sheets in the
financial sector have always been mildly distorted by hidden reserves and
window dressing. But now they are next to worthless as a guide to the
creditworthiness of institutions that deal heavily in derivatives because
the degree of risk in the balance sheet can fluctuate wildly minute by
minute. Published data are thus inadequate and out of date. It is impossible
to tell whether people are engaging in low-risk arbitrage or high-risk
position taking.
The result is that we are back to a world that has surprising similarities
with the 19th century. Then, partnership was still the City norm, published
balance sheets were a rarity and traders judged creditworthiness on a
combination of reputation, rumour and past record. People acted as both
principal and agent without a welter of regulations to govern conflicts of
interest. What are the rules for survival in such a world?
In the late 20th century we do, admittedly, have credit rating agencies, on
whose judgments the derivatives trading edifice is uncomfortably dependent.
Yet rating agencies are not infallible. So rule one is not to rely on rating
alone.
Rule two is to recognise that this market is best left to professionals, as
is investment in the shares of market makers. For them, caveat emptor
applies with deadly seriousness in view of the conflict of interest in which
many players are involved. The final rule is to pay even more attention than
usual, in judging creditworthiness, to capital and good parentage.
Without parents with deep pockets several Wall Street investment banks would
have disappeared over the past decade, including First Boston, Lehman
Brothers and, in the light of its recent derivatives upset, Kidder Peabody.
Drexel Burnham did disappear, precisely for want of such support. And
without a godparent at the Bank of England, many of London's discount houses
would certainly have failed.
Yet private investors can still become unwittingly embroiled in derivative
problems - witness the way in which US mutual funds sought to increase their
returns through derivative trading without disclosing this to clients. Once
again the rule is: be boring. A fund manager will not make good the loss in
a mutual fund or unit trust unless it has a reputation to protect and the
resources to do it. There are times, in financial markets, when it pays to
play safe.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Shop until you drop - US-style: Martin Dickson, complete

The Pepsi Ripsaw roller-coaster might not be among the world's most
terrifying amusement park attractions. But it makes up for its relative lack
of stomach-churning thrills with its bizarre location: in a fun-fair at the
heart of the largest shopping mall in the United States.
If your feet are killing you, refresh your spirits with a ride on the
Ripsaw, careering for 2 1/2 minutes above indoor trees, roof tops and
restaurants and through a miniature, artificial mountain. If the children
are playing up, and refusing to accompany you inside yet more clothing
shops, distract them with a ride on another of the fair's attractions, the
Log Chute. This will carry them in a hollowed-out tree trunk through a
mountain filled with animated figures - and drop them down a 40ft waterfall.
The Mall of America, which lies on the outskirts of Minneapolis, Minnesota,
and opened its doors two years ago this month, is a vast temple to
consumerism - the ultimate statement of faith that the chief national
pastime of the US is not baseball or fishing but shopping. (Actually, the
main pastime could soon be gambling, for casinos are springing up like weeds
across the land.)
The 23-ride amusement park sits in the middle of a round, four-storey
doughnut containing more than 400 shops, four large department stores, a
14-screen cinema and an 18-hole miniature golf course ('experience the
challenge of its two waterfalls and seven streams'). There are bars and
nightclubs where you can play pool, watch a televised football game, listen
to a comedy routine or learn to dance, country-style.
You can even get married. The Chapel of Love, located (fittingly) just
across a walkway from an outlet promoting local casinos, can provide you
with 'a decorated, 75-seat chapel, taped music selections, and the services
of an officiate, all offered in 1 1/2 -hour packages starting at under
Dollars 500'.
You can have a country-and-western themed wedding, rock 'n' roll nuptials,
or a Vegas-style affair. 'We can even get you Elvis,' says MaryAnne London
Gears, the chapel's manager. In the Mall of America's alternative reality,
the impossible becomes possible.
This, after all, is a world where the temperature is always a perfect 70`F
(21`C); where you can sit in the street 'outside' a perfectly reconstructed
Italian country restaurant, yet still be indoors under the mall's vast glass
canopy; and where you can indulge your fantasies of becoming a top model
with a visit to Glamor Shots where staff will make up your face, banishing
unsightly spots and pimples, dress you in fashionable clothes and capture
the 'glamorous new you' on film.
That is part of the hype, hoopla and kitsch. But in the real world of
hard-nosed financial investment, the mall represents two big gambles: that a
complex of such size can attract enough customers to make a decent return;
and that, by mixing entertainment with its wares, it can compete
successfully with rival forms of leisure and electronic shopping.
John Wheeler, the Minnesota mall's general manager, says: 'We've recognised
that people today want a good reason to leave their homes. We want to offer
them a whole variety of reasons to come here, which includes not only the
mall's goods and services but the experience of the whole.
'The whole concept of experience is very, very important to us.'
If this 'experience' succeeds - and the jury is still out - it will set an
example for mixed retailing and entertainment which the rest of the world
could follow. But the company which manages the Minnesota mall is encouraged
enough by early trading to be putting entertainment centres into several
other malls being built, while some smaller US malls have begun offering
rides on ferris wheels, dodgems and carousels.
Minneapolis, a stolid city in the mid-western farm belt - an area from which
author Garrison Keillor drew the inspiration for his laconic tales of the
fictional Lake Wobegon - might seem an unlikely setting for this
bread-and-circuses approach to selling. But it has played an important role
in the 40-year history of the US mall, and for good reason: Minnesota's
harsh winters and broiling, insect-infested summers make shopping in an
enclosed, temperature-controlled building an extremely attractive
proposition.
America's first mall, the Southdale Centre, opened in 1956 only a few miles
from what is now the Mall of America, and clones multiplied rapidly across
the land in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. By the end of the last decade,
though, the regional mall movement looked in danger of exhaustion. Americans
were devoting less leisure time to shopping and, when they did venture out,
they tended to patronise strip shopping centres near their homes or the
growing new 'factory outlets' - stores offering slightly imperfect or
end-of-line goods from well-known brand manufacturers at knock-down prices.
At the same time, mall owners became aware of another potent threat:
electronic shopping. The converging film, computer and telecommunications
industries will eventually create mass-market, inter-active television that
allows consumers to order an immense array of goods from home at the touch
of a remote control button.
This is unlikely to mean the end of shopping as we have known it; humans are
social beings and, from time immemorial, have found pleasurable distraction
in visiting bazaars. But all these forces are putting pressure on shops to
make parting with money an entertaining experience.
So, too, does the fact that people enjoying themselves in an entirely
artificial world are more likely to cast their credit cards around with
wild, impulsive abandon than those trudging from store front to store front
in the rain. The Mall of America's official slogan ('There's a place for fun
in your life') acknowledges these motives implicitly. Fun is, by definition,
frivolous and guilt-free - and shopping should be the same.
Yet, the first big test of shopping-as-entertainment actually took place in
Canada, where, in 1985, a family of real estate developers, the Ghermezian
brothers, built a mall near the city of Edmonton, Alberta, which
incorporated an amusement park, hockey rink and artificial lake. It
succeeded, generating substantially higher revenue per square foot than a
conventional mall. The Ghermezians then joined up with one of America's
largest mall developers, Indianapolis-based Melvin Simon &amp; Associates, to
build the Minneapolis pleasure dome, with a US teachers' pension fund
putting up the bulk of the equity.
In the event, the most grandiose plans for the Mall of America - such as an
aquarium and a monorail - were deferred because of the nation's 1990-1991
recession, and it ended up somewhat smaller than its Canadian cousin. Even
so, when the mall opened in August 1992, many retailing analysts pronounced
it a dangerous gamble out of step with Americans' desire to spend less time
shopping. 'It's risky, very risky,' declared one New York consultant. 'Few
people really see shopping as recreation any more. People are
time-strapped.' Two years on, the arguments continue.
Last year, though, 37m people visited the Mall of America - 7m more than
Walt Disney World in Florida (although the figures are not directly
comparable since the Minneapolis total would have been boosted by repeat
visits from local residents). They spent Dollars 625m.
Wheeler maintains these figures are in line with, or exceed, the project's
financial and traffic projections. But critics point out that the mall is
not yet fully occupied - at least 10 per cent of its space is vacant - and
question whether its owners are anywhere near making a decent return on
their real estate investment, particularly given the generous leases that
had to be offered to attract its four big anchor department stores: Macy's,
Sears, Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom.
Wheeler will say only that rental rates have gone up since it became clear
the mall had 'critical mass', making them comparable to other super-regional
shopping centres in the area. Yet, there are persistent reports in
Minneapolis that some of the department stores have had disappointing sales.
This, however, is not the case at Nordstrom, which sells up-market clothes
and is one of the fastest-growing retail groups in the US. Eric Nordstrom,
who runs the outlet, says it has generated the largest first-year sales of
any branch since the one in Chicago four years ago. He adds: 'I think it
surprised everyone in our company.'
But will it last, once the initial novelty has worn off? To succeed, Wheeler
says the mall needs to generate 70 per cent of its traffic from Minneapolis
and the mainly rural 150-mile radius around the city. It has now reached
that point after some initial hostility from local residents. 'People are
finding that you don't need to ride a roller-coaster to buy a pair of
socks,' Nordstrom notes.
The other 30 per cent of visitors - who account for half the dollars spent -
come from more than 150 miles away and are striking evidence that the mall's
publicity machine has succeeded in making the centre a big tourist
attraction in its own right. Its very name, Mall of America, and its stars
and stripes logo, play up the idea that this is a national asset.
Many tourists come from the surrounding mid-western and Rocky Mountain
states, lured by one-day 'shopper's special' air fares. Charter flights to
the mall, which lies close to Minneapolis airport, have been organised from
as far away as Britain and Japan. 'People are vacationing here from
Florida,' says an incredulous Nordstrom. 'I don't understand it.' He adds,
quickly: 'But you don't have to understand it.'
What makes this popularity particularly surprising is that very few of the
stores are unique. Most are simply outlets of large US chains; identical
shops can be found in hundreds of malls across the nation.
That, together with the mall's bland, characterless atmosphere, means some
tourists will leave disappointed. At bottom, the centre is as soulless as .
. . well, as a trip to a shopping mall.
For millions more, though, its sheer size and entertainments will be
justification enough for a visit. After all, it is not every shopping centre
that can sell you a T-shirt emblazoned with the proud, guilt-free boast: 'I
mega-shopped the mega-mall.'

FT  13 AUG 94 / US and N Korea near deal on nuclear dispute: Western
technology offered in return for guarantees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY, JEREMY KAHN and JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WASHINGTON, SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and North Korea announced a breakthrough early today in talks aimed
at bringing to an end their dispute over Pyongyang's controversial nuclear
programme.
In a joint statement the two sides released an outline agreement that
includes a transfer of western nuclear technology to Pyongyang in return for
North Korea freezing its homegrown nuclear programme, which is thought to
include weapons development.
The US said it was ready to provide Pyongyang with light water reactors up
to 2,000 MW 'as soon as possible'. North Korea agreed to halt construction
of two graphite reactors near completion and to 'forego reprocessing' of
spent uranium fuel rods which the West fears pose a radiation risk. The
graphite nuclear reactors produce high-quality plutonium that can be used in
nuclear weapons.
The two sides said they were ready to establish diplomatic representation in
each other's capitals 'as a move toward full normalisation of political and
economic relations'.
North Korea also reiterated its readiness to remain a party to the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and to allow implementation of its safeguards
agreement.
However, several important issues remain to be resolved and US officials
were cautious in assessing the impact of the accord. The deal would not
remove all nuclear bomb-making capacity from North Korea. Pyongyang does not
appear to have agreed to demands for full inspection of its nuclear
facilities.
'By no means it's a final agreement. But I think it will underscore some of
the sort of areas where there's agreement,' said Ms Dee Dee Myers, White
House press secretary.
Washington had been trying to win agreement from North Korea for 8,000 spent
uranium fuel rods, extracted from a nuclear reactor at Yongbyon in May, to
be shipped abroad for reprocessing, perhaps in China or Russia. But the two
sides agreed that the nuclear fuel rods would remain in a cooling pond and
not be reprocessed for the time being. The US fears the rods pose a
radiation risk.
US officials believe the rods contain enough plutonium to produce up to five
nuclear bombs. The CIA thinks North Korea may have already produced two
nuclear devices.
The deal would involve North Korea shutting down its graphite nuclear
reactors which produce high quality plutonium. In return, the US would
supply technology for a water-cooled reactor of the type used in the west.
These produce poorer quality plutonium, which is harder to detonate and are
easier to monitor by international observers.
It is not clear who will bear the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) cost of a large
water-cooled reactor. North Korea also wants compensation for ending
construction of a new large graphite reactor.
Plutonium that North Korea has already produced is not covered by the
agreement.

FT  13 AUG 94 / MAM cuts business with parent Warburg over Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury Asset Management has taken the unprecedented step of punishing its
parent company, SG Warburg, for the way Warburg managed Enterprise Oil's
failed bid for Lasmo.
For the past month, MAM has cut the business in UK share trading that it
gives Warburg to the minimum required by law. The fund management group, 75
per cent owned by Warburg, took the decision because of its fury that the
securities firm did not buy any of MAM's Lasmo shares when it bought 10 per
cent of the oil group on behalf of Enterprise seven weeks ago.
Warburg's unusual decision to buy the 10 per cent from only five investment
institutions, rather than picking up stock more widely in the market,
outraged MAM and other Lasmo shareholders. Anger over the way Warburg
handled the purchase contributed to the subsequent failure of Enterprise's
Pounds 1.6bn takeover bid for Lasmo.
MAM, among the biggest fund managers in the UK with more than Pounds 60bn
under its control, could not impose an absolute embargo on dealing with
Warburg because it has a legal duty to its clients to trade with any City
firm offering the best prices. However, it has been giving Warburg a
fraction of its normal level of business in UK shares. MAM has continued to
deal with its parent in the securities of overseas companies.
Warburg said yesterday that its trading with MAM has this week returned to
normal levels.
Disclosure of MAM's actions is the latest in a stream of embarrassments for
Warburg stemming from its decision to buy the 10 per cent of Lasmo at above
the market price from the five institutions - PDFM, Capital Group, Legal &amp;
General, Sun Life and British Gas. The purchase of 8 per cent from PDFM
alone was particularly galling to other Lasmo shareholders.
Warburg last week agreed to pay Pounds 250,000 to Rwanda charities to settle
a dispute with Swiss Banking Corporation, which had complained to the London
Stock Exchange that Warburg should have purchased its Lasmo shares, since it
had left a 'limit order' with Warburg.
A special sub-committee of the exchange's domestic equity rules committee
had earlier ruled in SBC's favour, but Warburg refused to pay the Pounds
750,000 claimed by SBC. It made an offer to SBC of Pounds 250,000.
SBC turned this down, but said it would settle if Warburg paid Pounds
750,000 to charity. Mr John Kemp-Welch, exchange chairman, put pressure on
both firms to settle, to avoid an appeal to the professional standards
committee. SBC finally said it would drop the matter if Warburg paid Pounds
250,000 to charity.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Electronic war of words heads from computer to court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A virtual war of words in cyberspace is heading for a very real
confrontation in a UK courtroom.
A London physics lecturer is suing a former colleague for libel on the
Internet, a self-regulating global computer network where millions of users
exchange academic ideas, political opinions, and, increasingly, insults.
No date has been set for the case but if the suit goes to trial in the High
Court in London it could expand the definitions of UK libel law and expose
the legal potholes in the information superhighway. Other cases have already
challenged libel laws in the US and Australia.
Usenet, the part of the Internet where the alleged libellous comments
appeared, is sometimes known as the world's largest electronic conference.
It consists of a series of 'news groups' in which an estimated 16m users can
post messages and debate special interests.
Within this conference setting, a culture of 'flaming' - the reckless
exchange of insults - has arisen. Because messages are sent to news groups,
which are accessible to almost all users, rather than individuals, rows
between users are aired in public.
Mr Nick Braithwaite, a media lawyer with London solicitors Clifford Chance,
said that many users forget their private vendettas on the Usenet are out in
the open.
'They think they are having a private conversation but it is like they are
using a megaphone,' he said.
In the UK case, Dr Laurence Godfrey, a former nuclear physicist at the
German Electron Syncroton Laboratory in Hamburg, has issued a writ against
Dr Phillip Hallam-Baker, a researcher at Cern, the European nuclear physics
laboratory in Geneva, claiming damages for libel or slander.
Dr Godfrey is suing for alleged comments about his professional work which
he claims were made by Dr Hallam-Baker on seven separate occasions between
April and July of last year on the Usenet. Dr Hallam-Baker has said the case
will be defended.
Dr Godfrey said he distinguished between insults and libel.
'The everyday insults are not libel and I do not take exception with them,'
he said. 'It is the allegations of an untrue nature that I am suing about.'
In a separate case, however, Dr Godfrey himself is being sued by Carleton
University and Brock University of Ontario, Canada, for Internet comments
which may be in breach of confidence.

<TEXT>
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester might fairly claim to be the victim of poor quality
legislation. But the performance to which it has gone in restructuring the
offer from Lloyds Bank raises some concerns about valuation and fairness.
Although consummation of the deal has been pushed back by three months, the
price has been left at Pounds 1.8bn. Lloyds will thus enjoy a better deal in
two ways. The time value of money will make the price less onerous and C &amp;
G's net assets will be boosted by a further three months of retained
earnings. So Lloyds will squander less on goodwill.
The amount involved may not be enormous but the fact that it has been wholly
ignored in the revision suggests a degree of imprecision in the original
valuation. The trouble is that C &amp; G members have little to go on when they
vote. Moreover they must do so now in the clear knowledge that the
distribution of rewards is random and arbitrary. Under a scheme designed to
meet the requirements of the law, some members will be denied any share of
the proceeds. Some non-member depositors will receive a bonus.
In a rational world it ought to be possible for a bank to buy a building
society. There is no reason why the latter should be ring-fenced by
protective legislation. One solution which would have made valuation easier
and ensured a fairer distribution of benefits would have been for C &amp; G to
begin the process by de-mutualisation and public flotation. Once again, the
law prevents this by insisting on a five-year period before newly-floated
societies can be taken over. It really is an ass.

FT  13 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: UK brewing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pubs without televisions were a bit quiet in July as drinkers stayed in to
watch the World Cup. But most of Britain's brewers are now feeling better
about life. Summer trading generally seems to have been reasonable, helped
by the steamy weather. There are also signs that the wholesale price war is
abating, at least when it comes to supplying smaller pub operators. However,
the big independent pub chains, such as Greenalls and Boddingtons, are
thought still to be getting very attractive terms and given the overcapacity
in the industry it is likely that the national brewers will remain under
pressure.
Against that background it is somewhat surprising that regional brewers and
pub operators have tended to underperform their national counterparts over
the last couple of months. In part that may merely reflect the fact that
large stocks have led the stock market rally. The shares of several of the
second division companies may also have suffered from the sale of
Whitbread's stakes in March.
Either way the smaller fry look relatively cheap. Yet the pub operators
appear well-placed as consumer spending recovers while brewers like Marston
are showing there is good growth to be had for those with strong brands.
Share prices also make little allowance for industry restructuring. Other
regionals must be considering pulling out of brewing while Greenalls'
ambitions have not been satisfied by last year's acquisition of Devenish.

FT  13 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Unilever
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is becoming traditional for Unilever's shares to move 5 per cent on the
announcement of its quarterly figures. In May they fell 57p, yesterday they
rose 55p. The jump this time was partly due to relief that there was no
obvious damage from the European soap wars. On the contrary, Unilever's
decision to turn off the promotional spending in markets where the
introduction of Omo Power went badly probably meant that short-term profits
actually benefited from the fuss. Since concentrated fabric powders
represent less than 2 per cent of Unilever's turnover, it is not material
anyway.
More important are signs that volume growth across the group has turned up.
After seeing growth fall from 2 1/2 per cent in the first half of last year
to 1 1/2 per cent in the second it is now creeping back up to 2 per cent.
The South American and Asian businesses stepped up another gear and in North
America growth is close to the group target of 4 per cent. But the consumer
businesses on both sides of the Atlantic have yet to respond and while the
detergent price war in the US has eased, Unilever's main markets are likely
to remain competitive even when economic recovery works through.
While the benefits of the cost-reduction programme announced in February
should kick in strongly next year, earnings growth is unlikely to match
companies more geared to European economic recovery. Despite the solid
long-term prospects, the share's modest rating is only to be expected at
this stage in the cycle.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The theory that the worst of the jitters about rising interest rates could
be over suddenly looks less plausible. Bond markets across Europe took a
tumble on Thursday, dragging equities in their wake, following rises in
Italian and Swedish rates. Wall Street is still restive at the thought that
US rates may soon go up again. The FT-SE 100 index lost only 25 points on
the week after staging a strong come-back yesterday afternoon. With both the
Bundesbank council and US Federal Reserve open market committee meeting next
week, though, the outlook remains unsettled.
The relatively modest decline in London equities is some comfort. Every day
brings brighter news on corporate earnings. This week centre stage belonged
to the banks and insurance companies, which took it in turns to shatter
brokers' profits forecasts. Industrial companies such as GKN  - and
yesterday the consumer giant Unilever - are also starting to enjoy the
upturn. The prospects for utilities are equally good following painless
price reviews by the water and electricity industry regulators. Dividend
growth forecasts of around 8 per cent for the market as a whole this year
are a powerful support.
Yet it is difficult to believe that equities will thrive while bonds remain
on edge. The weakness of the pound against the D-Mark - down to DM2.40
yesterday - reflects the strength of the German currency rather than any
loss of confidence in sterling. But while the market is transfixed by the
next move in rates, such weakness is not soothing.

FT  13 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rate rise shockwaves ease in
the afternoon
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shock administered by Thursday's key rate rises in Sweden and Italy was
alleviated to some extent by lower than expected inflation data in the US, a
recovery in Treasuries and the same pattern in European bond markets, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was nearly 2 per cent down at one stage as the Bundesbank's
average bond yield rose 26 basis points to 7.11 per cent. However, the Dax
index closed the session 30.60 lower at 2,124.68, a 2.7 per cent loss on the
week, recovered to an Ibis-indicated 2,133.74 at the end of the post-bourse.
Turnover rose again, from DM7.1bn to DM7.7bn. The session was notable for
falls in the leaders, Allianz and Daimler both dropping more than 2 per
cent, Siemens by DM10.50 to DM673.10 and Deutsche Bank by DM12.80 to
DM693.20.
Germany's biggest bank was more than 6 per cent down on a painful week which
culminated in debt rating fears, waved away by Standard &amp; Poors and Moody's,
and an earnings downgrade by Lehman Brothers from DM50 to DM43.40 a share.
Metallgesellschaft fared worse, DM16, or 7.7 per cent lower at DM190.50
after the board expressed caution about a DM250 a share rights issue price.
PARIS just held the 2,000 support level, the CAC-40 index sliding by 31.98
or 1.6 per cent to 2,006.95, down 4.8 per cent on the week after a session
low of 1,992.52. Turnover was FFr3.5bn.
Alcatel Alsthom, down FFr23 at FFr600, was marked down sharply after Lehman
Brothers downgraded the stock from outperform to underperform, cut its 1994
and 1995 estimates, and said that it was removing the company from its
recommended list.
Lehman said that problems in the German telecoms division would result in a
1994 loss, while its entry into the mobile telephone market was 'somewhat
late, such that they (Alcatel) will produce 500,000 handsets in 1994,
compared with Nokia's 25m. Other potential positives for the stock - orders
in China and ATM (a new telecommunications technology) are either too small
or too far off to have a material impact on earnings in the short term.'
MILAN reacted to Thursday's after-hours rate move by marking down prices
across the board. Nerves were frayed further by rumours that Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the prime minister, might step down as the lira came under
renewed pressure on the money markets.
Mr Berlusconi was due to make a televised address to the nation last night.
The Comit index closed down 24.74 or 3.7 per cent at 644.43, a fall of 8.4
per cent on the week.
Mr William Cowan of James Capel in London remarked that the Bank of Italy,
through its 'opportunistic timing' of the rate rise, had sent a political
message to the government of Mr Berlusconi.
With most of the country's political leaders currently on holiday, Mr Cowan
thought it was unlikely that the government would react immediately to the
bank's action. However, he thought the bank's action would have a positive
outcome, causing the government to take measures to reduce the budget
deficit.
AMSTERDAM ended a heavy week of results with good figures from Unilever,
which came in at the top end of expectations; but the overall tone was
negative. Unilever picked up Fl 2.10 to Fl 195.90, off a high of Fl 197.90
and unable to sustain the AEX index which closed off 2.38 at 414.43, a
week's fall of 1.2 per cent.
ZURICH recovered from an intraday decline of nearly 2 per cent to end with
the SM1 index down 8.3, or just 0.3 per cent at 2,580.5, 0.4 per cent lower
on the week.
Financials were a percentage point weaker on the day. But Swissair, up SFr6
at SFr855, was 6.9 per cent up on the week and SMH, adding another SFr2 at
SFr182, a full 10.3 per cent better over five days.
MADRID's afternoon recovery left the general index down 5.49 at 312.89, 2.8
per cent lower on the week. Turnover of Pta35.1bn was high, considering the
August holiday period.
Analysts suggested that the market was still nervous because of rate-rise
possibilities, especially in Europe. The banking group, Argentaria,
obviously rate sensitive, weakened Pta230, or 4 per cent to close at
Pta5,500.
STOCKHOLM, too, closed above its worst, in this case falls of around 3 per
cent, with the Affarsvarlden General index down 25.20 at 1416.30, off 4.7
per cent on the week, in heavy turnover of SKr2.73bn. Analysts felt that the
big market correction was over, and anticipated rises.

FT  13 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Rally in bond prices lifts US
stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A rally in bond prices, in the wake of encouraging inflation news, helped
the US stock market yesterday to end a difficult week on an upbeat note,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 17.81 at 3,768.71. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended firmer, up 3.07 at
461.95, while the American Stock Exchange composite finished up 0.45 at
443.70 and the Nasdaq composite 3.41 higher at 731.61. Volume on the New
York Stock Exchange was 251m shares.
After bond and stock prices had fallen on Thursday, following disturbing
producer prices and retail sales data which raised expectations that the
Federal Reserve would put up interest rates again soon, the situation was
partially reversed yesterday. Good news on inflation - the consumer prices
index rose by only 0.3 per cent in July, a smaller increase than analysts
had been expecting - lifted bonds and stocks because it soothed fears of an
imminent interest rate increase.
Although analysts warned that monetary policy would probably still be
tightened by the Fed some time in the near future, the CPI figure was a
welcome boost to short-term sentiment after a difficult week in which
long-term bond yields had risen steadily. Yesterday, however, bond yields
fell, with the benchmark 30-year issue advancing three quarters of point,
which pushed its yield down to 7.485 per cent - the first time it had been
below 7.5 per cent in a week.
Share prices responded immediately to the encouraging move in bond yields,
with blue-chip stocks rising steadily from the opening bell. Secondary
markets also fared well, although leading shares on the American Stock
Exchange struggled to keep up.
Among individual stocks, Exxon jumped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 60 1/4 in
volume of 2.2m shares as investors celebrated Thursday's decision by a jury
that the oil group was liable for only Dollars 287m in compensatory damages
for the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska in March, 1989. The total award was
significantly lower than the Dollars 895m asked for by the plaintiffs.
Eli Lilly climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 54 3/4 amid mounting speculation that
Glaxo will buy part of PCS - the US group's managed healthcare subsidiary,
which was acquired from McKesson earlier this year in a Dollars 4bn
transaction. The reports, however, were later denied by the companies, and
Eli Lilly shares dropped back sharply to end Dollars 1/4 lower at Dollars 52
1/2 . United American Healthcare rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 18 7/8 after
a national newspaper reported analysts' predictions of strong growth for the
stock in the coming year.
Leading bank stocks rebounded from recent declines because of interest rate
fears. Bankers Trust rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 69 and Citicorp added Dollars
 5/8 at Dollars 42 1/2 .
Canada
Toronto stocks ended the day with a negative bias as low gold and oil prices
prevented equities from joining the rally in US markets.
'If it hadn't been for a strong day with bonds we would have had another bad
day,' said Katherine Beattie, economist at MMS International.
The TSE 300 ended 0.46 higher at 4,175.14 in volume of 46.99m shares.
Declining issues outpaced gainers 364 to 350 with 323 issues unchanged.
Mexico
Mexican stocks closed up more than 1.5 per cent, buoyed by demand for
Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), the national telephone monopoly.
The IPC index closed up 40.87 points at 2,637.63 in moderate volume of
118.5m shares.

FT  13 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Amsterdam is gripped by hopes and fears
 -The Dutch market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In most countries, the failure to form a new government more than 100 days
after a general election would be expected to spark, at the very least, some
sort of reaction on the stock exchange.
In the Netherlands, where coalition governments are the norm and economic
stability is almost ingrained, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange has hardly taken
any notice of the drawn-out political talks in The Hague.
This week the deadlock appears to have been broken at last, though this
caused little excitement on the bourse. This might seem surprising because
the proposed new government - comprising members of Labour, the right-wing
Liberals and the left-of-centre D66 - would be the first in modern Dutch
history to exclude from power the Christian Democrats, the main losers in
the May 3 general election.
But as Mr Kees de Vaan, an analyst at Amsterdam-based merchant bank
MeesPierson, says: 'The government formation talks have been a non-event for
the bourse.' The main political parties are in broad agreement on the
economy and the new government, when it is installed, will bring only nuance
differences to existing policies, he notes.
The prospect of a new government taking office next week will make little
difference to sentiment on the bourse. And the strong likelihood that the
finance minister will be from the Liberal party should quell any nervousness
on the government bond market.
Far from dwelling on politics, the Amsterdam exchange has spent much of the
summer focusing on the dollar, interest rates and second-quarter corporate
earnings, which reached a peak over the past 14 days with results from
companies such as Philips, Royal Dutch, Unilever, Akzo, DSM and Hoogovens.
As probably the most dollar-sensitive exchange in Europe, the Dutch bourse
was hit briefly by dollar weakness earlier in the summer. But it has
recovered well from the lows of late June, when the Amsterdam-EOE Index
(AEX) hit 376.7 points after falling steadily from a high of 438.7 in late
January.
The reporting season of early August has seen Amsterdam swing from euphoria
to nervousness. In spite of some strong gains that took the index up to more
than 420 points and a series of sharp rises in corporate profits, the bourse
has failed to achieve earler heights, closing yesterday at 414.43.
The bourse's mixture of hope and fear is part of the market's transition to
a new preoccupation with earnings following two years in which it has been
driven mainly by interest rate concerns.
Two of Amsterdam's cyclical companies, the chemicals groups Akzo and DSM,
started the reporting season on August 3 with figures showing steep profit
rises. Although the results exceeded analysts' expectations they led to some
profit-taking on the day, reflecting the fact that both companies have
outperformed the bourse in recent months. Since then Akzo has fallen further
to trade at Fl 218.70 compared with Fl 219.50 on August 2, while DSM has
slipped to Fl 144.50 from the F1 147 level in early August.
In spite of the jagged price movements this month, analysts believe that
some stocks, including individual cyclicals, still have room to rise.
ABN Amro, in its August strategy report, said that it was cautious for the
short term, but added there was a possibility that the AEX might stand at
around 465 points by mid-1995.
'Our strategy remains unchanged,' the bank said. 'We continue to be
overweight in cyclical shares.'
MeesPierson, noting that market valuation was already high in historical
terms, is forecasting a 15 per cent return for the bourse over the next 12
months.
Analysts are agreed that selectivity is important, even in the popular
cyclical end of the market.
Of the two chemicals companies, Akzo is preferred for long-term potential
over DSM. Other cyclicals cited as buys are KNP BT, the big Dutch-based
paper and packaging group; Hunter Douglas, the manufacturer of venetian
blinds and ceiling systems; and Nedlloyd, the Rotterdam road and ocean-going
transport company.
Not all company results were well received. The nearly 15 per cent rise
reported on Tuesday by PolyGram, the music company that is majority-owned by
Philips, fell short of expectations, helping to unsettle other parts of the
market briefly at mid-week.
In recent days investors in Amsterdam have shown that they are looking not
only at second-quarter results but also at forecasts for the rest of the
year. Hoogovens, which reported a swing back into profit for the first half,
pleased the market with forecasts of substantial increases to come. Its
shares rose by 4.7 per cent to Fl 80.70 on Wednesday after the results.
Another beneficiary from a strong forecast is Philips, which trebled net
profit before extraordinaries at the half-year stage and predicted a
substantial increase for the year as a whole.
Banks and insurers, underperformers in recent months and not due to report
until later in August, seem out of favour with many analysts because of the
potential for rises in long-term interest rates.

A rise in the yen prompted profit-taking and arbitrage selling also dragged
share prices lower. The Nikkei index reversed a two-day advance, although it
still closed 0.7 per cent higher on the week, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225 average declined 157.53 to 20,663.83 after a high of 20,825.07 and a
low of 20,643.03. Some brokers tried to push the index up at the opening to
support prices for options settlement, but profit-taking and arbitrage
selling came in later.
Volume totalled 230m shares against 248m. The bulk of morning trading was
linked to the options settlement, and afternoon volume was the lowest of the
year. Public funds, which had supported activity during the week, were
absent, while buying of steel and chemical stocks by foreign investors
remained small.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 10.74 to 1,651.78 and the
Nikkei 300 lost 2.25 to 300.20. Declines led advances by 659 to 266 with 216
unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.10 to 1,333.27.
Arbitrage selling depressed bank stocks. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y30
to Y3,010. Brokers were also easier, with Nomura Securities losing Y10 to
Y2,250.
Chemical stocks were supported by foreign buying. Mitsubishi Kasei gained Y2
to Y550 and Showa Denko added Y5 to Y374.
The rise in the yen to the Y100 level against the dollar hurt
high-technology electricals. Hitachi fell Y5 to Y995, NEC lost Y50 to Y1,190
and Fujitsu declined Y10 to Y1,070.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 133.75 to 22,964.61 in volume of 39.8m
shares.
Roundup
Positive performances were seen in the region's markets yesterday.
BOMBAY closed at an all-time high, already enthused by good corporate
results and normal monsoon rains, and encouraged further by heavy
speculative buying.
The BSE index closed at 4,508.15, up 113.88 or 2.6 per cent, a rise of 4.8
per cent on the week. Many local analysts expected the market to hit the
5,000 mark by the end of the year as foreign investors returned and further
good interim results came through. However international analysts were
slightly more bearish, fearing the weak political situation may depress any
significant rises.
HONG KONG rebounded late in the session after hesitancy attributed to
Monday's interims from HSBC, and Tuesday's meeting of the US FOMC.
The Hang Seng eased 59.98 to 9,464.56, down 1.4,per cent on the week, in
turnover of HKDollars 3.24bn.
TAIPEI fell back for the third successive session on nervousness prompted by
central bank moves to tighten liquidity to prevent more funds flowing into
the equity market. The weighted index fell 63.88, nearly 1 per cent, to
6,628.14 in moderate volume as the overnight interbank rate increased to
10.625 per cent.
The electronics sector was the worst hit having been overbought in previous
sessions. Analysts suggested that the market would consolidate further
before testing the 6,700 resistance level again. The market lost 4.2 per
cent on the week.
MANILA broke through the 3,000 level as strong liquidity and sound economic
fundamentals pushed the index up 30.37 to close at 3,007.36 on volume of
4.1bn shares.
Analysts expected the market to continue to improve next week when the
required reserve on bank deposits are cut 3 per cent to 17 per cent on
Monday.
SYDNEY closed lower on continuing fears of an imminent rise in domestic
interest rates. The All Ordinaries index closed 10.9, or 0.5 per cent, lower
at 2,051.9 in turnover of 150.1m shares, a loss of 1.9 per cent over the
week.
Banks were generally weaker. Westpac lost 4 cents to ADollars 4.46 and the
Commonwealth 17 cents to ADollars 8.85.
SINGAPORE rose in heavy trading as retail investors switched funds from
Malaysian issues to local second-line stocks. The Straits Times Industrial
index put on 17.76 to 2,317.79 in volume of 445.6m shares valued at SDollars
965.56m, a gain of almost 2 per cent during the week.

FT  13 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Good rally after favourable US
consumer data - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market staged a highly successful recovery yesterday afternoon
as a rally in bond prices followed the announcement of satisfactory US
consumer price statistics. Early trading saw the London market down by more
than 27 points on the FT-SE 100 Index but there was little sign of the
selling pressure feared in the wake of Thursday's interest rate rises in
Europe.
At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index was 4.1 up on the day at 3,142.3. The
recapture of the Footsie 3,140 mark was acclaimed by some equity chartists
who now see the market in safer territory than seemed likely at the close of
the previous session. In very late trading, the September futures contract
on the FT-SE 100 Index reached 3,166, breaking above another important
support level. The Footsie had touched 3,110.7 yesterday morning, kindling
fears that 3,100 might be challenged.
The initial setback was influenced in part by awareness that a heavy seller
of stock index futures at Thursday's close was still in the wings. British
government bonds were also weak during the first half of the session. Equity
marketmaking firms were inclined to mark share prices lower while waiting to
see what the leading strategists would make of the rate rises in Italy and
Sweden.
Kleinwort Benson Securities commented that 'tightening jitters (on the turn
in interest rates) will affect the Continent more than the UK'. Ratings on
UK equities are seen to be less demanding than in the other leading European
markets. Many analysts stressed the benefits for UK shares of the rapid
growth in corporate earnings now flowing through.
Such views were buttressed yesterday by unexpectedly good trading figures
for the second quarter from Unilever, the food to detergents group. However,
most strategists agreed that the 'interest rate cycle is now turning in
Europe'.
The recovery spread across the full range of the stock market, leaving the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index with a gain of 2.2 at 3,728.8. Trading volume, as
measured by the Exchange's Seaq electronic network, remained high, with
640.3m shares traded compared with 694.4m on Thursday when retail or genuine
investment business of Pounds 1.36m remained within the range of recent
daily averages. Good trading volume has continued to underpin the stock
market
Interest-related stocks suffered, at worst, only minor falls and some moved
higher. The blue-chip internationals were restrained by weakness in the US
dollar but steadied before the close as the currency steadied, with the oil
stocks firm.
The regional electricity stocks continued to forge ahead, extending the
gains which followed the announcement on Thursday of what has been seen as
an extremely favourable price review - from the point of view of the
companies. The Footsie Index was boosted by the strong gain in shares of
Unilever, and also in Reckitt &amp; Colman which rose in sympathy.
The Footsie Index has lost 25.2 over the week, with virtually all the loss
coming in the wake of the rate increases in Sweden and Italy. The focus has
now turned to next Tuesday's meeting of the US Federal Open Market
Committee. The rise of only 0.3 per cent in US July consumer price index
announced yesterday appeared to leave open the question of whether
inflationary pressures are sufficient to alarm the US authorities and cause
them to tighten credit policies again.
Short-dated UK gilts, which are the most closely linked to base rate
expectations, closed some  7/32 lower but had  3/8 off. Longer dates,
encouraged by the US bond market, recovered more strongly and closed a shade
higher on the day - regarded as no mean achievement against the present
uncertain background on interest rates.

FT  13 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs firm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The euphoria surrounding the regional electricity stocks since the
distribution review by Offer, the electricity industry watchdog, gathered
pace with many of the front-line broking houses telling their clients that
the review provided plenty of upside in the sector.
'We have identified relative winners and losers, but it must be stressed
that all the recs are winners under Offer's formula,' said Mr Douglas
Falconer at Yamaichi.
Kleinwirt Benson said: 'The recs will become rated on a restructuring story
as the market realises the hidden value of rec balance sheets and their
National Grid holdings. With 10 per cent real dividend growth to 2000 the
recs will outperform.'
The recs were also boosted by news that BZW, the powerful UK investment
bank, and Swiss Bank Corporation had issued call warrants on the sector. BZW
issued 15m warrants to subscribe for baskets of recs, comprising Eastern,
Midlands, Seeboard and Southern shares. SBC issued 1m warrants for baskets
comprising East Midlands, Eastern, London, Midlands, Norweb, Southern and
Yorkshire.
Among the best performers yesterday was Eastern, which jumped 24 to 763p,
with the market still intrigued by the purchase of a near 3 per cent block
of shares in a single trade on Wednesday afternoon, which continued to drive
suspicions of possible takeover moves in the sector ahead of the lifting of
the government's golden share next year.
Southern raced up 26 to 740p, Midland jumped 25 1/2 to 756p, South West 25
to 739p and South Wales, 24 to 746p. Seeboard put on 18 to 414p.
Water stocks, left far behind the recs recently, staged a powerful rally
with some institutions, unable to buy large lines of the recs, shifting into
the waters. Severn Trent jumped 8 to 547p, and Anglian 5 1/2 to 537 1/2 p.
Rumours in the US that Glaxo was interested in Ely Lilly, the drugs group,
helped depress the UK company's shares in London, which closed a penny down
at 623p. The Wall Street speculation was putting a Dollars 75 a share price
on Lilly's head, its shares advancing Dollars 2 to Dollars 54 3/4 during
London hours. Last month, Eli paid Dollars 4bn for PCS, a US drugs
distributor.
There was a return of rumours that Grand Metropolitan might be looking to
sell its stake in IEL, a jointly-owned pub retailing group. Australian-owned
brewer Courage was again the name being touted as the most likely candidate
to buy the stake, although there were suggestions that management could be
involved in buying many of the pubs. Grand Met shares advanced 5 to 434p.
Lehman Brothers, the US brokerage, was responsible for the latest upsurge in
British Gas shares, hoisting its rating on the stock and revising its
earnings estimate for 1996, to take in the benefits of sharply increasing
exploration and production profits and the benefits of restructuring.
Mr Simon Trimble, Lehman's energy analyst said market fears over the safety
of Gas's dividend are unfounded, based on Lehman's forecast of future cash
flows, that restructuring will cut costs by Pounds 600m a year and that Gas
will respond vigorously to emerging competition in the domestic gas market
'if it is allowed to comptete on an equal basis with new entrants'.
Gas shares settled 2 higher at 288p after turnover of 4.6m.
Royal Insurance delivered one of the best individual performances in the
FT-SE 100 list, the shares advancing 14 more to 279p as the market continued
to warm to the excellent interim figures released on Thursday and the good
growth prospects.
British Aerospace tumbled 13 to 491p on talk that a Japanese airline was
seeking to cancel or delay its order for five A340 Airbus aircraft and five
options.
British Steel succumbed to profit-taking and the shares eased 1 3/4 to 160
1/2 p after trade of 7.2m.

FT  13 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Unilever surge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong second quarter results from Unilever stunned the market and sent the
shares soaring in the heaviest ever recorded daily turnover. Analysts had
been expecting a slight fall in profits, with concerns expressed over the
detergents market among other issues, all of which had served to depress the
shares in recent sessions. However, Unilever turned in a healthy Pounds 611m
profit - strong growth in the US and the rest of the world being compounded
by good returns from speciality chemicals.
Many brokers were moving their profit forecasts upwards, together with a
raft of positive recommendations. Mr Carl Short at SGST, a long-term bull of
the stock, said: 'There is now no reason why Unilever should be standing on
a p/e discount to the market.' He upgraded his full-year forecast by Pounds
21m to Pounds 2.374bn.
However, a less enthusiatic Mr Tim Potter at Smith New Court reiterated his
negative stance. 'These are better results, but one quarter does not justify
a re-rating.'
The shares surged 55 to 1097p in hefty volume of 9.3m.
At the same time, the sparkling Unilever results were being interpreted by
speculative investors as a bellweather for the entire food manufacturing
sector ahead of the half-time results season next month. United Biscuits
gained 9 to 339p, Cadbury Schweppes 5 to 467p and Booker 7 to 441p.

FT  13 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness defies sale talk
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Busy turnover in Guinness excited speculation that one of the group's big
shareholders might be looking to sell its stake. There was good two-way
business for most of the session with dealers reporting Salomon Brothers
prominent among the sellers - prompting speculation that the US-owned
investment bank was attempting to dribble part of a large order into the
market. Some observers even suggested that Salomon was selling on part of a
large bought deal, perhaps intending to retain a significant stake after
worries over a stock overhang had been removed and the shares rallied.
LVMH was being mooted as a possible seller, the French group having agreed
earlier this year to reduce its stake in Guinness from 24 to 20 per cent, a
total of 80m shares. A deadline of June next year has been set for the sale.
Another investor being mentioned as a candidate for baling out was US
investor Mr Warren Buffet. Having traded sideways, Guinness shares enjoyed a
strong afternoon session, ending the day 8 ahead at 455p on turnover of
6.6m.

The September contract on the FT-SE 100 started trading at 3,136 and during
the session saw a low of 3,112 and a high of 3,169 before settling at 3,159
by the close.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Lira crumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The D-Mark yesterday walked tall on foreign exchanges as investors sought
refuge from market volatility by moving into the German currency, writes
Philip Gawith.
All leading currencies weakened against the D-Mark, both in Europe and
beyond, but the most prominent victim was the Italian lira which tumbled to
record low of L1,030 against the D-Mark before recovering slightly to close
in London at L1,026 from L1,005 on Thursday.
The Swedish krona fell to SKr 5.037 against the D-Mark before closing at
SKr5.008. Both currencies were heavily punished for their central banks'
decisions on Thursday to raise rates, which the market considered misguided.
Foreign exchange volumes were at their heaviest for a number of weeks, but
traders said they fell short of panic selling.
Weaker currencies were matched by a general firming of interest rates, and a
further deterioration of sentiment in futures markets. Portugal was the only
country to lift its interest rates, with the repo rate on seven - day funds
rising to 11.08 per cent from 10.5 per cent.
The release of weaker than expected July consumer price data helped US
bonds, and hence the dollar, which closed at Y99.99, off an earlier low of
Y99.60, but down from Thursday's close of Y101.115. Against the D-Mark it
finished at DM1.5557 from DM1.5872.
Sterling was also a victim of D-Mark strength, falling below DM2.40 before
recovering to close at DM2.4061. Against the dollar it finished at Dollars
1.5467. Traders downplayed comparisons with the ERM crisis of 1992 and also
said the actions of Italy and Sweden should not be mistaken as a signal of
immediate rate rises across Europe.
Apart from the particularly severe fiscal problems of both countries, many
observers also felt, especially in the case of Italy, that the rate rise
might testify to a struggle between the central bank and the politicians.
Mr Akis Karayiannis, head of foreign exchange at Lehman Brothers in London,
said the economic backdrop now was very different from that which caused the
ERM crises.
Markets then found government promises, to raise interest rates against the
backdrop of economies mired in recession, lacking in credibility. But with
economies growing again, higher rates are to be expected, even if the timing
might be unexpected.
Mr Karayiannis said he also doubted whether clients had the level of
exposure to European bonds and currencies that would produce the sort of
selling pressure seen in earlier crises.
While official rates stayed unchanged in Europe, with the exception of
Portugal, most cash market rates firmed. In Germany, for example, three, six
and one-year rates firmed amid fears of an end to Bundesbank rate cuts.
The Bank of England in its daily operations provided UK money markets with
Pounds 323m at established rates after forecasting a Pounds 300m shortage.
Futures markets lost ground, with the December short sterling contract
trading 47,000 lots to close at 93.23 - off a low of 93.17, but well down on
Thursday's close of 93.35.
The December euromark contract finished at 94.80 from 94.85.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Coffee traders cautious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The coffee market had a nervous week following a sharp fall in prices on
Monday as speculators and hedge funds baled out of futures contracts in New
York to push prices down by 11 per cent.
Monday's sell-off on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange was followed by a
drop of almost Dollars 200 a tonne in London prices on Tuesday. This pushed
the market down to Dollars 3,195 a tonne for the November futures contract
at the London Commodity Exchange.
The market managed to claw back some of its losses later in the week, but
trading remained thin and jittery and last night, at Dollars 3,285, prices
were still almost 11 per cent lower than Monday's open.
Traders were reluctant to push the coffee market strongly in any direction
and stayed cautious ahead of the US Department of Agriculture report on the
extent of frost damage to Brazil's coffee trees, expected late yesterday.
Market participants were expecting US estimates to be more optimistic than
Brazil's own predictions.
The Brazilian authorities estimate that up to 11m bags or 40 per cent of the
1995 coffee crop has been affected by the frost. Traders believe the US
assessment will put the extent of the damage at between 3m and 5m bags.
That means the USDA is likely to estimate a crop of between 18m and 21m bags
for 1995 while Brazil expects a smaller 17m bags.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at GNI, the London brokers, said many traders
were waiting until after the trees flower in September for renewed
assessments of the damage. 'Undoubtedly at some stage there will be another
run-up in price, but the market could fall another Dollars 500 a tonne
before that happens,' he said.
Another USDA report about the prospects for this year's US harvest boosted
wheat prices on the Chicago Board of Trade on Thursday. The USDA reduced its
forecast of world wheat output by 5m tonnes to 541.95m tonnes, pushing wheat
futures prices up by 3 cents to Dollars 3.50 a bushel. The USDA also
forecast improved prospects for US wheat exports as well as record US crops
of maize and soyabeans.
Meanwhile, this week there was more evidence that the unprecedented
international trade agreement encouraging aluminium producers to cut output
is having an increasing impact on the huge surplus that depressed prices for
so long. The International Primary Aluminium Institute said producer stocks
fell for the fourth consecutive month in June, by 12,000 tonnes to 1.993m
tonnes.
Since February, when trade delegates from six of the major
aluminium-producing regions signed a 'memorandum of understanding' about
production cuts, producer stocks have fallen by 141,000 tonnes or 6.6 per
cent. LME stocks also fell in June - the first time in nearly four years
that IPAI and LME stocks had fallen in the same month.
Yesterday the LME reported that its stocks had fallen again and Mr Anatoly
Shleyev, head of the statistics department at Russia's state metallurgy
committee, suggested his country would be able to meet its promised annual
production cuts of 500,000 tonnes this year. Nevertheless, he said Russian
aluminium exports were likely to be 2m tonnes compared with last year's 1.6m
tonnes. Aluminium for delivery in three months closed at Dollars 1,490.50 a
tonne on the LME last night, Dollars 5.25 up on the day and Dollars 41.75 up
over the week.

FT  13 AUG 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices strengthened again this week. Most increases were small but finer
merinos rose more sharply in price, as did merino cardings. Both categories
have been selling well from the Australian stockpile recently, and finer
merino fleece supplies are expected to remain under pressure this season.
Crossbred wool also met with good demand at auctions in Australia and New
Zealand this week, with China buying actively. The current trade view is
that China could need supplies for urgent shipment and is lightly stocked.
Strength in the Australian dollar has helped to push up calculations of
imported wool costs. This does not apply to wool sold by the British Wool
Marketing Board but prices have tended higher in this sector also, in
anticipation of a dearer auction next week.
The spices report was not available for this edition.

FT  13 AUG 94 / International Company News: Size of oil spill awards lifts
Exxon shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Exxon, the US oil company, jumped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 60 1/4
yesterday after a Federal jury in Alaska decided the corporation should pay
Dollars 286.8m in compensation to Alaskan fishermen whose livelihoods were
hit by the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster five years ago.
The market's favourable reaction resulted from the fact that the award was
less than a third of the Dollars 895m the fishermen had asked for. More
important, it raised hopes that the jury would later impose punitive damages
at a much lower figure than the Dollars 15bn the plaintiffs had sought.
The jury's verdict was delivered late on Thursday in the second stage of a
three-stage trial that began 15 weeks ago in Anchorage, Alaska.
The first stage came in June when the same jury found that reckless conduct
by Exxon and Mr Joseph Hazelwood, captain of the Exxon Valdez, contributed
to the ship's running aground shortly after it left the state's main oil
port in March 1989.
In the second stage, the plaintiffs - about 10,000 fishermen - had sought
Dollars 895m in compensatory damages, but the jury of nine women and three
men decided after 23 days' deliberation that a much lower figure was
appropriate.
It works out at about Dollars 28,680 for each plaintiff.
In the third stage of the trial, due to resume on August 22, the jury has to
decide on punitive damages. If the fishermen's claim of Dollars 15bn were
awarded, each would become a dollar millionaire.
However, after Thursday's verdict, Wall Street analysts were tentatively
suggesting that the final settlement would be much lower.
Since the figure of Dollars 15bn was originally calculated as a multiple of
the compensatory damages sought, there was speculation that the final figure
for punitive damages might be reduced in similar proportion - in other
words, to less than Dollars 5bn.

FT  13 AUG 94 / International Company News: Shell in Texaco additives talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Texaco, the US oil company that is going through a big restructuring,
appears to have found a buyer for its world-wide lubricant additive business
in the shape of Shell Oil, the US arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell group.
Two Shell Oil subsidiaries, Shell Chemical and Shell International Chemical,
said they were in exclusive negotiations with Texaco to buy the lubricant
additive business with a view to merging it with their own chemicals
operations.
No price was disclosed, but the business had earlier been valued at about
Dollars 200m.
Lubricant additives are used to enhance the performance of automotive and
industrial oils. Texaco's three plants - in Port Arthur, Texas, Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil and Ghent, Belgium - make additives for automotive
transmission fluids, motor oil, tractor hydraulic fluids and various types
of gear oil.
The business came on to the market in April this year when Texaco sold its
chemical business to Huntsman Corporation of the US. Huntsman originally
agreed to buy the entire business for Dollars 1.06bn, but instead paid
Dollars 850m and asked Texaco to help it find a buyer for the lubricant
additives segment.
Since then Texaco has announced another restructuring involving 2,500 job
cuts and the sale of half its US oilfields.

FT  13 AUG 94 / International Company News: BHP seeks approval for iron
plant

Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian natural resources group, yesterday
said it was seeking environment approval to build a direct reducted iron
(DRI) plant in Western Australia's Pilbara region for more than ADollars
750m (USDollars 551.4m).
While the move does not mean BHP has decided to go ahead with the project,
it does indicate that final feasibility studies are in progress.
BHP stressed that board approval for the plant, negotiation of
'satisfactory' natural gas supply and price arrangements, and 'successful
completion of definitive engineering and economic feasibility studies' were
still required.
But if these conditions were met, construction of the plant near Port
Hedland, about 1,200km north of Perth, could start in the middle of next
year and be completed by 1997.
Capacity would be around 2m tonnes a year of hot briquetted iron (HBI). The
DRI process involves the reduction of high grade iron ore concentrate using
natural gas. The iron produced is made into small briquettes, which can be
fed directly into the new generation of mini-mills.

FT  13 AUG 94 / International Company News: Caterpillar set for record
quarter

<TEXT>
Caterpillar, the international heavy equipment and engine producer, which is
in the middle of a prolonged strike, reported yesterday that its July sales
were up 20 per cent. Thus the company was on target for a projected record
third quarter.
A Caterpillar spokesman declined to specify which of its divisions were
experiencing the strongest sales growth.
The company has said that if the strike continued through the third quarter,
some sales might be shifted into the fourth quarter.
Members of the United Autoworkers Union walked out at Caterpillar on June 21
in a dispute over working conditions. The union has, however, been sparring
with the company since November, 1991, when workers who were seeking new
contract terms conducted an unsuccessful five-month walkout.
With no talks on the latest dispute planned, there have been rumours that
Caterpillar's production schedules would be curtailed.
But yesterday it maintained that it 'continues to believe the labour
situation will have minimal impact on sales and profit for the full-year
1994 even it the current strike continues'.
Caterpillar says it has been able to meet planned production schedules,
despite the dispute, a point that has been confirmed by some of its major
customers.
The strike hit just as the company's two main industries - engine assembly
and heavy equipment manufacturing - were enjoying a robust rebound.
US diesel engine production was up 40 per cent in the first half of the
year, while production of construction equipment rose 16 per cent.

Esab until bid count completed

<TEXT>
Charter, the UK industrial group, said it would announce on Monday its next
move in its bid for the Swedish welding group Esab after it failed to
achieve a complete takeover by yesterday's deadline.
The British company said it was awaiting the final outcome of its offer
before making any public statement about its intentions.
Although Charter's Swedish advisers were still counting the returns from
small shareholders last night, it was already certain it had failed to
achieve the 90 per cent acceptances set as a condition of the bid.
Charter's options include increasing the Pounds 260m (Dollars 403m) bid, as
many Swedish shareholders anticipate, holding with the majority stake it is
already assured of or dropping the bid altogether.
A full takeover at the original offered price of SKr345 per share was
stymied earlier this week when five Swedish institutions with 20 per cent of
Esab's voting capital rejected the bid. This was despite the fact it was
recommended by Esab's board and accepted by Incentive, the Wallenberg family
industrial group and Esab's controlling shareholder.
Before yesterday Charter was assured only of 53 per cent acceptances, made
up of 48 per cent held by Incentive and 5 per cent it had earlier purchased
in the market.
The institutional shareholders rejected the bid as underpriced following a
sharp rise in Esab's share price since the offer was made in June and a big
rise in Esab's profit forecast for this year.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Radisson Hotels International of the US said in Stockholm yesterday it had
concluded an alliance with SAS International Hotels, the wholly-owned
subsidiary of Scandinavian Airlines System.
Under the agreement, 30 SAS hotels in Europe, Kuwait and China will be
renamed Radisson/SAS. An additional SAS hotel now being built in Hanoi will
also be named Radisson/SAS when it opens in 1996.
The deal does not involve any change of ownership or equity in either
organisation. SAS hotels will continue to operate under its current
management, with headquarters in Brussels.
Radisson is part of Carlson, a privately-owned group which also owns
restaurants and travel agencies.
SAS will have the exclusive right to develop Radisson hotels in Europe. The
companies said they hoped to add another 60 hotels to the Radisson/SAS
network by the end of the decade. The hotels will be included in the
Radisson international reservations system.
Following the announcement, SAS hotels said it would end its co-operation
with Swissotels. Radisson will terminate its agreement with Movenpick
Hotels.

FT  13 AUG 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft warns on
issue
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Metallgesellschaft's dropped sharply yesterday after it had issued
a stern warning on the risks for shareholders in a DM1.4bn (Dollars 890m)
capital raising issue which is central to its survival plans.
The subscription period for 5.6m new shares at DM250m will run from August
18 to September 1, the battered metals and engineering group announced
yesterday. But at the official market close yesterday the shares were down
DM16, or 7.7 per cent at DM190.50.
Pointing out that the issue price was higher than the current market rate of
around DM200 a share, the company said the success of restructuring measures
under way could not be definitely guaranteed.
The resumption of dividend payments could not be expected for the
foreseeable future and investment in the shares carried an 'increased risk',
it added in an official statement.
The company said that although the future of the group could not be seen as
conclusively assured, planned and partially implemented financial and
restructuring measures were important prerequisites for the company's
continuation.
The statement also noted an impending legal action in the US in which
Horsehead Resource Development is claiming Dollars 500m damages in a fraud
suit posted against MG's BUS Berzelius.
A further claim for the same amount by the sacked head of MG Refining and
Marketing had no chance of success, according to advice from the group's US
lawyers.
Meanwhile, MG is continuing its efforts to negotiate its way out of
long-term oil contracts in the US which brought the company to its knees at
the turn of the year.
For the near future, MG said group losses for the year to the end of
September would be about the same as last year's DM2bn deficit, while
'noticeable' effects of measures already taken would be felt in the current,
final quarter.
Prospects for the remaining businesses, some of which are still to be
disposed of, included further substantial losses at the BUS Berzelius
environmental services business, which last year lost a net DM25m, according
to yesterday's announcement.
Lurgi, which was carrying restructuring costs, would also make a loss.
Earnings at Lentjes would be lower than last year's DM19m, while profits
would return to normal in the services businesses which were hit by
extraordinary charges in the 1992-93 financial year.

FT  13 AUG 94 / International Company News: Axa buys Suez offshoot in
Canadian expansion
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Axa, one of France's largest insurance groups, plans to expand its North
American interests by buying Boreal Assurances, the Canadian insurer, from
Suez, the French financial and industrial holding company.
The acquisition of Boreal, which made net profits of CDollars 12.2m
(USDollars 8.8m) in 1993 on sales of CDollars 591m, will, according to Axa,
turn it into the fourth largest insurer in Canada. The French group's
existing Axa Canada subsidiary made net profits of CDollars 17.3m last year
on turnover of CDollars 310m.
The announcement of Boreal's sale comes only a few days after completion of
a complex deal whereby Suez sold most of its Victoire insurance business to
Commercial Union of the UK for FFr12.5bn (USDollars 2.33bn).
Axa, the second largest insurer in France, which already has a sizeable
subsidiary in Canada as well controlling The Equitable, the US insurer, was
initially mooted as a potential purchaser for Victoire.
However, it did not figure in the final stages of negotiations, having
decided instead to concentrate on augmenting its international activities.
Although Axa and Suez have agreed the terms of the transaction, for an
undisclosed sum, it is still subject to authorisation from the French and
Canadian regulatory authorities.
The Boreal disposal forms part of an ongoing divestment programme at Suez,
one of the largest and most varied of the classic French holdings which has
for the past three years been attempting to streamline its assortment of
industrial and financial interests.
Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Suez, said last week that the group, which has
raised FFr35bn from disposals over the past three years, now plans to expand
in specific sectors, notably within financial services in Asia.
Axa, chaired by the flamboyant Mr Claude Bebear, has also made no secret of
its Asian ambitions. It recently secured provisional authority to set up a
life insurance business in Japan and announced plans to invest USDollars
200m in the venture over the next five to seven years.

FT  13 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Cost savings behind Haden's 22% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Haden MacLellan Holdings, the diversified engineering group, yesterday
announced a 22 per cent increase in interim profits as its wide-ranging
restructuring and cost-saving programme began to pay off.
Despite intense competition in several markets, pre-tax profits for the six
months to June 30 rose to Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 1.8m) on turnover of Pounds
171.8m (Pounds 152.7m). Operating profits increased 33 per cent to Pounds
2.8m (Pounds 2.1m). The shares closed up 5p at 84p.
The improvement was fuelled mainly by the process engineering and services
operation in North America, where profits rose to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds
500,000) following record orders from the automotive industry and a two-year
drive to reduce costs.
Mr Richard Taylor, group managing director, welcomed the results but warned
that the group would have to focus on its core interests - including
industrial fasteners, machine tools and paint finishing systems - if it was
to achieve significant earnings growth.
'We've cut costs, but there's more to be done and we're looking at divesting
non-core activities,' he said.
The disposal plan is likely to focus on the manufacturing and distribution
division, where profits rose only marginally to Pounds 400,000 (Pounds
300,000) on turnover of Pounds 44.2m (Pounds 40.9m).
Although margins had improved, Mr Taylor said the market for the machine
tool business 'remained pretty dismal'.
Its sluggish performance was offset partially by profits of Pounds 1.3m
(Pounds 1.2m) in the fasteners business, which benefited from increased
investment in new plant and facilities.
The Pounds 13m rights issue in March helped reduce net borrowings from
Pounds 11.6m at the year end to Pounds 2.5m - equivalent to gearing of 14
per cent. 'We've strengthened the balance sheet and restored our credibility
as a global player,' said Mr Taylor.
Earnings per share rose to 1.7p (1.3p); the interim dividend is held at 1p.

FT  13 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Welded mesh potential offered in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Gregory was appointed general manager in July last year of BRC
Weldmesh (Vietnam), jointly owned - through Singapore based BRC Weldmesh
(SEA) - by Hall Engineering and BHP, the Australian steel and resources
group, writes Andrew Baxter.
'Some people say we're here a little bit early. But if we'd waited another
year before we'd started, we'd be too late. The potential is enormous,' he
says.
The venture is the most ambitious step so far in Hall's regionalisation
strategy. Operating from an old US military base in Ho Chi Minh City, the
company, which began production this spring, has a dual role.
Using imported steel and production equipment, it is producing bar chairs -
spacers used in welded mesh - for export to Singapore and Hong Kong.
But Mr Gregory is also trying to develop a local market for welded mesh to
reinforce concrete, and introduce a low cost housing system based on the
European 'lattice girder' system of lightweight prefabricated concrete beam
reinforcement and filler blocks.
Welded mesh costs a bit more than the mild steel reinforcing bar used in
Vietnam, says Mr Gregory, but is much stronger, so less needs to be used.
'We're using up a lot of hard shoe leather, spending a lot of time on the
ground,' he says. 'You need to estab-lish a base here, and not just come in
to make a quick killing.'
Because of welded mesh's advantages, the Ministry of Construction in Hanoi
has been '100 per cent behind us,' he says. The company is even helping the
government to develop astandards code for welded wire products.
Turnover is growing quickly from a standing start, but setting up the
venture has not been easy. Finding the right employees was a problem, but
the workforce of 25 is now performing well, says Mr Gregory.
Having got to grips with all the formalities of setting up a business in
Vietnam, his seven-day weeks are now down to a mere five and a half, giving
him time to spend on his martial arts hobby by teaching karate to young
Vietnamese.

Mr Derek Hunt, chairman of MFI, the furniture group, saw his pay packet cut
by 75 per cent last year, because of the absence of a Pounds 1.3m management
bonus on flotation.
His pay fell from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 400,000, according to the annual
report. The decline masked a 35 per cent increase in salary and benefits
partly because of an Pounds 85,000 performance bonus.
Mr Hunt's salary and benefits, including the performance pay-off, increased
from Pounds 271,000 to Pounds 367,000. Pension payments rose by 27 per cent
to Pounds 33,000.
MFI reported pro forma pre-tax profits more than doubled, from Pounds 40.2m
to Pounds 87.8m, on sales 9 per cent ahead at Pounds 659.4m, for the 53
weeks to April 30.

FT  13 AUG 94 / UK Company News: L&amp;G Ventures trust will invest in MBOs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Legal &amp; General Ventures, the venture capital group, yesterday announced it
was creating an investment trust which would invest primarily in companies
recently floated by management buy-out and buy-in teams.
Legal &amp; General is focusing on this set of companies because research
suggests former MBO and MBI companies have out-performed the stock market
since 1987.
The new vehicle will be the first investment trust to focus almost
exclusively on former MBO and MBI companies.
Earlier this year L&amp;G Ventures launched the first trust exclusively
investing mezzanine finance in unquoted companies.
To create the new vehicle, L&amp;G Ventures is taking over the management of an
existing investment trust, Group Development Capital Trust, which invested
in unquoted companies but now has most of its assets in cash and gilts.
The new investment policy will direct 75 per cent of Group Development's
assets into listed MBOs and MBIs and the other 25 per cent into unlisted MBO
and MBI companies which are likely to float.
Mr Charles Peal, managing director of L&amp;G Ventures, said recently floated
MBOs and MBIs were attractive investments because typically they were
focused businesses with strong leadership and strict financial controls.
SG Warburg is making a cash offer to shareholders of Group Development. The
cash offer will give shareholders 97.5 per cent of the value of Group
Development's assets.
At the same time, L&amp;G Ventures hopes to raise up to Pounds 25m through a
placing and offer of subscription units which will give the right to be
allotted new ordinary shares and warrants.
The placing and offer for subscription are conditional on a minimum
subscription of Pounds 10m being achieved. If this level is not reached, L&amp;G
Ventures will still take over Group Development.
Mr Peal said using an existing investment trust was a much cheaper way of
raising capital. Legal &amp; General Assurance Society already holds 26.5 per
cent of Group Development.

FT  13 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Unilever edges ahead by 4% to Pounds 1.06bn
 -Persil increases market share and overtakes Ariel in 'soap wars'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever has increased its share of the washing powder market in the UK and
France in spite of the 'soap wars' raging over its newly-launched Persil/Omo
Power detergent.
The Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group announced this yesterday
while revealing better than expected second quarter pre-tax profits up 4 per
cent from Pounds 590 to Pounds 611m. That took the figure for the first half
to end-June to Pounds 1.06bn (Pounds 1.03bn)
The shares jumped 55p to Pounds 10.97p.
Figures from Nielsen, the market research group, showed that the group's
Persil brand had increased its overall UK market share from 27 per cent to
28.2 per cent since the launch of Persil Power - known as Omo Power outside
the UK and France - in April.
The market share of rival group Procter &amp; Gamble's soap powder Ariel had
fallen from 29 to 26.4 per cent in the same period.
Ariel retained the lead in the concentrated powder market with 10 per cent,
but Persil's share had increased from 6 to 9 per cent.
Unilever has been engaged in a propaganda battle with Procter &amp; Gamble over
the latter's claims that Persil/Omo Power could damage garments.
The controversy meant sales of the new product had been disappointing in
Scandinavia, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Unilever said, however, that
sales were now improving in the Netherlands. Sales had been stronger in the
UK and France.
The group stressed that concentrated soap powder accounted for only 2 per
cent of worldwide turnover, which had been boosted by strong performances in
several markets.
Group sales for the second quarter and half year respectively were Pounds
7.67bn (Pounds 7.08bn) and Pounds 14.4bn (Pounds 13.5bn).
Sir Michael Perry, chairman, said he expected 'a continuing improvement in
trading conditions in our principal markets will lead to some further
strengthening of our results'.
In Europe, half-year operating profits increased from Pounds 654m to Pounds
685m on turnover of Pounds 7.84bn (Pounds 7.58bn). Sales of oil- and
dairy-based foods declined, but sales of ice cream and Liptonice, the
ready-to-drink tea product, were strong.
Sales and profits increased in the speciality chemicals business - supplying
products such as flavourings, fragrances and adhesives to third parties
 suggesting a pick-up in the economy.
North American turnover increased from Pounds 2.61bn to Pounds 2.8bn, with
profits up from Pounds 100m to Pounds 104m. The food business improved, with
stronger sales in oil- and dairy-based foods and pasta sauces.
Sales of ice cream increased significantly after Unilever acquired Kraft
General Foods' ice cream business last year, but the price war continued to
make conditions tough in detergents.
Profits outside Europe and North America were Pounds 346m (Pounds 318m) on
sales of Pounds 3.72bn (Pounds 3.32bn), with strong performances in Brazil
and India.
Earnings per share for the half year, at current exchange rates, were 36.13p
(36.38p).
The interim dividend will be declared with the third quarter results in
November.

FT  13 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Plantsbrook shares rise 48p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Plantsbrook, the UK's largest quoted funeral group, surged by 48
per cent yesterday on news that Service Corporation International had
acquired a 3 per cent stake, and was buying more shares, writes Simon
Davies.
Plantsbrook claimed it had no warning of the purchases, and had no
communication as to the intentions of the US funerals group.
Investors, however, reacted with enthusiasm, following the SCI bid for
Plantsbrook's only listed rival, Great Southern Group, which resulted in an
offer 63 per cent above the pre-bid share price.
At yesterday's closing price of 148p, the market capitalisation of
Plantsbrook (including convertible shares) is Pounds 163m, but at this
stage, there is little expectation of a bid.
SCI has indicated that it was concerned that its main competitor,
Vancouver-based Loewen, might be planning a raid on Plantsbrook shares, and
this move was implemented to pre-empt that.

FT  13 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Nightfreight shows sharp jump to Pounds
1.35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In its first set of results since coming to the market in May, Nightfreight,
one of the UK's largest independent express parcel groups, yesterday
announced pre-tax profits sharply up from Pounds 539,000 to Pounds 1.35m for
the six months to May 31.
The shares reacted favourably to the announcement, rising 5p to 105p,
matching the initial flotation price.
Turnover more than doubled from Pounds 9.31m to Pounds 21.8m during the
period, although Pounds 11.9m of the increase came from the acquisition last
November of PHS Group and Greenline.
Volume throughput from its core Nightfreight network showed a 19.6 per cent
increase. Mr Russell Black, chief executive, said the bulk of the
improvement came from new business, rather than existing customers.
Profits from continuing operations increased from Pounds 623,000 to Pounds
1.23m, with a further Pounds 540,000 coming from PHS and Greenline.
Since the flotation Nightfreight has opened a new depot in Lincoln, and it
plans further expansion in Cheshire and the Scottish Borders during the
second half.
It also recently established a joint venture with Toga Freight, to give it
access to the Irish market.
The company achieves the bulk of its profits during the second half of the
financial year, and Mr Black said it was on target for its prospectus
forecast of Pounds 4.5m.
Earnings per share emerged at 2.62p (1.54p) and an interim dividend of 1.13p
is declared.

FT  13 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Sizeable pay rises for Guinness directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of Guinness, the brewing and spirits group which in March reported
an 11.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for 1993, have been awarded pay
rises of up to 13.6 per cent.
The rises, which took effect from the beginning of last month but will not
be publicly revealed until publication of the company's 1994 annual report
next year, coincide with Guinness bowing to shareholder pressure and
abolishing directors' three year rolling contracts.
Three executive directors, including Mr Anthony Greener, chairman, have been
put on three year fixed term contracts renewable every 12 months. However,
Mr Brian Baldock, who is within three years of retiring, remains on a three
year rolling contract.
The move brings Guinness in line with the demands of Mr Alastair Ross
Goobey, chief executive of PosTel, the Pounds 25bn fund management
institution.
Two months ago Mr Ross Goobey announced that PosTel would be voting against
the election of directors who have rolling contracts longer than two years.
PosTel's initiative was taken after mounting frustration at large pay-outs
to directors when they are forced to resign. In its most recently published
report and accounts, for the 1993 year, Guinness revealed that it had agreed
to pay Pounds 670,000 to Mr Crispin Davis, an executive director until his
resignation last October. Mr Davis had been on a three year rolling
contract.
Guinness said that the move to fixed term contracts came after the company
had 'listened to shareholders'. Just four months ago the company stated that
it had no intention of amending the rolling contracts.
Three Guinness directors have had salary rises although the pay of Mr
Greener has again been frozen at Pounds 600,000 - in line with an agreement
he made with the company when he became chairman in January 1993.
The basic salary of Mr Philip Yea, finance director, rose by Pounds 30,000 -
13.6 per cent - to Pounds 250,000 while the pay of Mr Brendan O'Neill,
appointed a director last April, rose from Pounds 240,000 to Pounds 270,000,
an increase of 12.5 per cent. Mr Baldock's basic pay rose from Pounds
335,000 to Pounds 360,000 - an increase of 7.5 per cent.
The company said that the contract change and salary rises were both
decisions made by the committee of non-executive directors. Its members
include Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman
of Cadbury Schweppes, and Sir David Plastow, chairman of Inchcape.
Guinness stressed that accounting changes, including a Pounds 173m charge
principally relating to goodwill, were behind the fall in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 795m to Pounds 702m during 1993. On a comparable basis, however,
pre-tax profit fell by 1 per cent - 4 per cent at level exchange rates - to
Pounds 908m.

FT  13 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Howden expands in S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Howden Group, the Glasgow-based engineering company, has expanded its South
African operations with the acquisition of Donkin Manufacturing and a number
of associated companies for Pounds 4.6m cash.
There will be a further cost of about Pounds 500,000 for rationalisation and
reorganisation.
The businesses being acquired are involved in the design and manufacture of
fans and air handling units for the industrial and mining market in South
Africa. They had a combined turnover of Pounds 10m in the year to June 30.
The activities will be integrated with the existing operations of Howden
Group South Africa.
Howden also completed the amalgamation of its US subsidiary, Pneu Devices,
with FCD Corporation, a Connecticut-based manufacturer of military
environmental control systems and pumps, which it acquired in May.
The purchase price and the cost of combining the businesses is estimated at
Pounds 4.5m.
To finance these acquisitions Howden is raising some Pounds 9.56m before
expenses by the issue of 10.2m new ordinary stock units of 25p each.
The issue has been conditionally placed by Allied Provincial Securities with
institutional investors at 93 3/4 p apiece.

FT  13 AUG 94 / UK Company News: The returns from regionalisation - Why Hall
Engineering is expanding in Asia / Tackling Asia's Tigers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore, as many visitors have noted, is an island state that seems to be
run like a company. It is an observation that has a special relevance for Mr
Richard Siew, managing director of overseas operations at Hall Engineering
(Holdings).
'You can see government policy going in one direction, and you can more or
less say that we will also be doing that as a company,' he says.
In effect, the regionalisation which Singapore is urging the island's
corporations to pursue, exploiting untapped opportunities and lower labour
costs in neighbouring countries, is being mirrored at Hall.
This is a new departure for Shrewsbury-based Hall, which is best known in
the region for its constructional steel products. Elsewhere, it is also
involved in automation pressings and production equipment and steel
stockholding.
'We've been managing very successfully in Singapore on our traditional
businesses,' says Mr Siew, who took over his new Singapore-based post in
May. 'But although we've been established for a long time in the region, we
have not accelerated in line with the explosion in growth in the region.'
One of Mr Siew's key roles will be to help Hall step on the regional
accelerator. Asia - principally Singapore - has been good to Hall and its
shareholders, and accounts for the bulk of Hall's associated companies,
which contributed Pounds 7.6m to overall pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.6m last
year.
The contribution will be particularly useful this year following Hall's
surprise announcement in May that its results this year would be 'materially
short of those for 1993' because of the postponement of part of a large
European contract won by Stadco, the automotive engineering company, and
margin pressure in the UK steel stockholding and steel reinforcement
businesses. The news immediately depressed the share price by 71p to 169p,
although it has since recovered to 179p.
Historically, Hall's two investments in the region are BRC Weldmesh (SEA),
which makes welded steel wire mesh used to reinforce concrete, and BHP
Lysaght (SEA) which makes roll-formed roof sheeting and cladding.
The two companies, which are joint ventures with BHP of Australia, have
dominant market shares in Singapore - between 40 and 50 per cent for wire
mesh and 80 per cent for metal roofing.
The position has been built up through successful marketing and product
development during the construction boom in Singapore over the past 20
years. BRC Weldmesh, for example, pioneered the production of individual
welded mesh tailored to architects' designs to avoid the need for cutting
mesh at cramped construction sites.
Mr Siew believes it would be naive to expect quantum leaps in Singapore's
economy that would enable these businesses to grow sharply in the next five
years. Even so, the island state still offers opportunities. Mr Peter
Hellweg, managing director of BRC Weldmesh in Singapore, hopes the company
can benefit from ambitious public housing plans.
After a 'huge price fight' in the early 1980s, profits are reasonable, he
says, but the business needs careful managing. If profit margins became too
high, it could draw new competitors into an industry where entry costs are
low.
To maintain profitability - and in response to Singapore's relatively high
labour costs and manpower shortage - production of spacers for the welded
mesh has already been moved to Vietnam (see panel). Mr Hellweg says
production of more labour intensive fine mesh products may follow.
The regionalisation moves which Mr Siew is now accelerating for Hall are,
broadly, of three types. First, expansion is under way in its traditional
constructional steel businesses. Indonesia, with its 200m population, need
for improved housing and spending on its infrastructure, offers 'tremendous
potential' for wiremesh and roll-formed products, he says.
PT BRC Lysaght Indonesia, another partnership with BHP, has been operating
in Jakarta for 20 years and has recently opened a new factory in Surabaya to
service the east Indonesian market. Other regional Indonesian markets such
as Sumatra are being looked at.
Elsewhere, a BHP building products factory is due to open before the end of
this year in Sri Lanka. It has been a classic policy of starting with
exports, and building up the business until local manufacturing is viable,
says Mr John Kong, general manager of BHP Lysaght (SEA).
Burma and Cambodia are being investigated.
The second type of expansion is in Hall's higher technology businesses such
as automation, precision metal cutting and pressings. Malaysia's ambitious
industrialisation strategy, and the emphasis on the automotive,
petrochemical and aerospace industries make it a logical destination for
this end of Hall's business.
The third type of expansion involves Hall's low-tech and high-tech
businesses in unison, a tempting opportunity which, uniquely, is offered by
China's economic expansion. Hall has done nothing yet in China, says Mr
Siew, apart from exporting some mesh from Hong Kong, but he is hoping to
change that.
The mesh market in China has hardly been tapped, he says, and the challenge
will be to get it specified in preference to reinforcing bar (rebar), a
rival method which helps provide employment on construction sites.
The main difficulty will be to find a suitable local partner, says Mr Siew,
to help handle the formalities. 'We are sending out feelers,' he says.
At the high-tech end, Hall is following events in the automotive industry
closely. Mr Siew is encouraged by recent legislative changes which show
China wants to localise the supply of components to western manufacturers
setting up car plants, and may also develop a national car. A joint venture
between a car company and Stadco, giving it captive business, would be
ideal, he says.
Mr Siew has not been set financial targets by the head office in Shrewsbury,
but says: 'It's quite clear that the big picture is to grow and develop this
area. Look at the returns compared with elsewhere and common sense will tell
you where to put your money.'

FT  13 AUG 94 / Why the players complain it just ain't cricket: The strike
could wipe out America's baseball season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thursday night in Baltimore was fit for the end of the world or the baseball
season, whichever matters most. With thunder and lightning offstage, the
downpour began gently enough ('English rain,' said the man in the seat
behind), but soon assumed biblical proportions. The Baltimore Orioles and
the Boston Red Sox struggled into the third inning before the umps called
for the tarp and nearly three hours later they called it a night.
There was no 'make-up' game yesterday. In fact no major league baseball was
played anywhere in America yesterday, nor may it be for the foreseeable
future. After Thursday night's finale and with 50 days still to go in the
regular season, 672 professional players from 28 teams walked out on strike.
It is quite possible that no World Series, the ultimate championship, will
take place in October, the first such gap in the peacetime autumnal calendar
since 1905.
This is the eighth labour dispute in America's national sport in the last 22
years and undoubtedly the most serious since 1981, when nearly two months
were lost in mid-season. Though it has been coming a long time - the players
and owners have had no contract since last year - it casts a long pall. A
season that had more than its usual share of magic on the field has been cut
short.
The dispute pits two so far immovable forces - 28 team owners versus a
players' association (union). The owners, probably the only cartel in
America with congressional exemption from the antitrust laws, claim the
financial stability of the sport is in jeopardy; the players, with many
hard-won contractual victories under their spikes, suspect the owners want
to reinstate labour servitude.
The strike is, of course, all about money but, because it is baseball, the
most subtle of all sports, it is much more complicated than mere player pay.
This one is essentially about a concept known as the 'salary cap', already
in use in American football and basketball. The ceiling is not on the
individual contract but on total team payroll. If a superstar is paid a
fortune, then savings have to be made elsewhere on the playing roster.
The idea stems from the desire of the owners to reach a different
revenue-sharing agreement with the players from the 50-50 split in effect
under the expired contract. The owners contend that as many as half the
teams now operate at a loss, but since no team books are open for inspection
this is impossible to verify. Cynics point out that, if even a smallish
franchise can change hands for Dollars 125m, as the Seattle Mariners did in
1992, it is unlikely to be a money loser.
What the owners have never been able to do is agree how to iron out the
revenue differences between big city teams with vast TV revenues, like Ted
Turner's Atlanta Braves, which are able to afford a Dollars 54m a year
payroll, and those pushed to find even a third of that sum. Ironically, the
team with the best playing record this year, the Montreal Expos, has only an
Dollars 18.5m payroll, the second lowest after the Dollars 15.5m of the San
Diego Padres. The players argue that they should not be forced to suffer
from the owners' inability to settle their own problems.
But public sympathy is not exactly with the men who play the game. The
average major league salary now stands at Dollars 1.2m a year, nearly a
tenfold increase in the last 14 years. The fact that Bobby Bonilla of the
New York Mets stands to lose Dollars 31,148 per day's work does not exactly
cause the suffering faithful at Shea Stadium to weep buckets, given their
own take-home pay. There might be more feeling for those on the annual
minimum wage (Dollars 109,000), though many of them have been sent down to
the minor leagues to keep playing - and to be paid for it.
But economists are urging the players to stand fast. Henry Aaron (of the
Brookings Institution, not the Henry Aaron who hit 755 home runs) wrote this
week that the owners' plan was nakedly designed to increase team revenues at
the expense of salaries without guaranteeing that profits would be
distributed among the poorer teams. Baseball, he concluded, 'is financially
and competitively alive and well'.
It is in fact only a medium-sized business. Its estimated annual revenues of
about Dollars 2bn put it on a par with, for example, Dell Computer and the
New York Times. The strike will mostly hit local economies (about 2,000 are
employed directly and indirectly whenever the Orioles play at home), but
will not exactly be a factor in Fed monetary policies.
Still, baseball was on a roll, with this year's attendance projected at 70m.
Marvellous new stadiums in Baltimore, Cleveland, Chicago and Arlington in
Texas and popular new teams in Colorado and Florida have attracted vast
crowds (an Orioles ticket is like gold dust) and done much to revitalise
decaying downtowns.
Above all, this season had threatened to be one for the ages. All the six
realigned divisions have been competitive, even if the two in the west have
competed mostly to be awful. Individual records were under serious attack,
like the 61 home runs hit by Roger Maris in 1961. Perhaps the juiced-up
baseball has been a factor but, as of Thursday night, Matt Williams of San
Francisco, with 43 dingers, was exactly on Maris's pace, with Griffey,
Thomas, Bonds and Belle not far behind. Tony Gwynn of San Diego was batting
.394 with a fair chance of being the first since Ted Williams in 1941 to hit
the magical .400 mark (that is, four hits in every 10 official times at
bat). On the pitching side, Maddux, Mussina, Key and Cone were all at their
artful best, while Kenny Rogers of Texas pitched only the 12th perfect game
(no runner reaching base) in the history of baseball.
There were glimmers of cracks in owner solidarity on Thursday night, but
little optimism from the players. Ben McDonald, the Oriole pitcher, was
asked if President Bill Clinton might intervene, as he has contemplated. Big
Ben, who might have heard about the crime bill failure in Congress during
the rain delay, acidly replied: 'He can't take care of his own business,
much less ours.'

Sir, You reported ('Man bites midge', August 6/7) that the bog myrtle, 'one
of the least productive features of the Scottish Highlands', now is ripe for
exploitation as a base for a natural insect repellant.
There is another use for bog myrtle. As a herb, it can be used to spice
vodka to a rich and full flavour. A glass jar, say half a litre size, is
filled with the spring leaves of the bog myrtle, after which the leaves are
drenched in vodka. After some four days the essence is separated and the
leaves thrown away. The essence should then be poured into fresh vodka to
the proportion of 1:10.
The legend has it that the vikings also used to spice their beer with bog
myrtle, which was said to make them especially ferocious. Or perhaps they
used it as a repellant.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Food, inglorious food: A row over government eating
guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An apple a day keeps the doctor away. Eat your greens. A little of what you
fancy . . .
The dietary advice given by these ancient adages seems as fresh as ever
today. And it puts into perspective this week's row over plans by the UK
government to issue detailed new guidelines for healthy eating.
The food industry is lobbying the Department of Health to tone down draft
recommendations circulated by its Committee on Medical Aspects of Food
Policy (Coma), which it says are far more specific than current scientific
knowledge would justify.
Coma proposes, for example, that people should halve their weekly
consumption of cream from today's average of one tablespoon to half a
tablespoon. They should eat only one or two biscuits a day, rather than four
today. And they should allow themselves only three-quarters of a chocolate
bar a week.
On the positive side, potato eating should increase from two to three
'egg-sized potatoes' a day. And people should consume more daily bread: four
and a half slices rather than three today.
Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman of Cadbury Schweppes, says he recently went
with the leaders of other UK food manufacturers to tell health ministers of
their concern at the way the government's nutritional policy was developing.
'The government is telling people what they should eat - and there is no
scientific or medical justification for that,' he says. 'It is now taking
the level of 'guidance' to absurd levels.'
Consumer groups, however, support the efforts by Coma and other government
health bodies to give the public more specific dietary advice.
'People have got the basic message that they should eat better food, but for
some reason they're not doing so,' says Ms Jeanette Longfield, co-ordinator
of the National Food Alliance, an umbrella organisation comprising 50 groups
from the National Farmers Union to the British Heart Foundation. 'Coma is
trying to give people more specific guidelines - which can only help them.'
Critics of dietary guidelines have made much of the apparent disagreement
between specialists about what makes a healthy diet - and of the way
nutritional fashions change over time. But Dr Mike Rayner, a researcher in
Oxford University's Department of Public Health and Primary Care, says
uncertainties have been exaggerated.
'There are still areas of doubt - for example about the benefits of eating
more fibre and cutting down on sugar - but there are also conclusions which
have not changed for many years,' he says. 'One is the need to cut down on
fats.'
Dietary targets have conventionally been couched in terms of nutrients. For
example, an influential 1992 white paper said the percentage of food energy
derived from all fats should be cut by 12 per cent by 2005 and the
percentage from saturated fatty acids should be reduced by 35 per cent.
Consumer pressure groups argue that nutrient guidelines must be translated
into more comprehensible advice about food servings. 'It's harder to be
prescriptive about foods than nutrients because portion sizes vary,' Dr
Rayner says. 'But messages about nutrients haven't worked because people
don't really understand them. A new approach is needed, even if the food
guidelines are not scientifically perfect.'
In the US, there is greater consensus about dietary guidelines than in the
UK. 'There was much controversy during the 1970s but that has died down and
now the argument is just about details,' says Dr Paul Thomas, nutrition
project director at the Institute of Medicine in Washington.
The Human Nutrition Information Service, run by the US departments of health
and agriculture, publishes a Food Guide Pyramid which goes further than
anything issued by the UK government. The Pyramid has building blocks
corresponding to the main food categories, each with a recommended daily
intake.
The 'bread, cereal, rice and pasta group' forms the Pyramid's broad base,
with 6-11 servings a day. Recommended guidelines for fruit and vegetables
are 2-4 and 3-5 servings respectively. For fats, oils and sweets - the foods
at the tip of the Pyramid - the recommendation is 'use sparingly'.
Dr Thomas says the US industry 'varies in its enthusiasm' for dietary
guidance of this sort but is not campaigning actively against it.
The UK equivalent of the Pyramid is the Plate, launched last month in a
Health Education Authority leaflet. It does not explicitly recommend how
much to eat, though it says that the proportions of different foods on the
Plate reflect the balance people should aim for. Fruit and vegetables take
up 30 per cent of the plate, while fatty and sugary foods are squeezed into
10 per cent.
For Mr Cadbury and other UK food manufacturers, the Plate principle is
unacceptable.
Why then do nutritionists think it is worth trying to influence what people
eat? Because statistics show that at least a fifth of all deaths are linked
to diet, says Dr Sheila Bingham, senior scientist at the Medical Research
Council's Dunn Nutrition Centre in Cambridge. The best estimate is that 30
per cent of heart disease in the UK is caused at least partly by what people
eat.
The nutritional picture is not wholly gloomy. The rapid rise in sales of
skimmed milk, low-fat dairy products and lean meats shows that the message
is getting through to increasing numbers of people.
At the same time, however, consumer groups point out that the ever
increasing availability of cheap, unhealthy manufactured foods means that
people need more and more information and will-power to eat well.
Ultimately, genetic research will probably come to the rescue. Within 20
years, it may be possible to test everyone for genes that make them
susceptible to particular diseases related to diet. If so, nutritionists
will be able to abandon their general messages and formulate a healthy diet
for each individual. Until then, the sensible course is to ignore food fads
and follow the maxim that variety is the spice of life.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Respectable return on use of
consultants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir PETER LEVENE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest the letter from Barry Reamsbottom (August 9), who,
I fear, has misunderstood both the Efficiency Unit scrutiny report on
external consultants and the recent white paper on the civil service.
The scrutiny reported that much of the work undertaken by external
consultants was linked to the requirements of government programmes such as
road planning/building, weapons systems design, etc, rather than simple
cost-cutting exercises. Of the Pounds 12.2m direct savings identified in the
report, the expenditure generating this figure was less than Pounds 3m (in
itself a respectable return) and not the Pounds 508m total spend on external
consultants.
The 'market testing', or more correctly competing for quality, programme to
which Mr Reamsbottom refers somewhat disparagingly is on course to have
covered some Pounds 2bn worth of activities before the end of this year,
with savings in the majority of cases of more than 20 per cent being
achieved by the winning bids. This is true where an outside contractor has
won or where the work has been won by an in-house team.
Far from being discontinued, as Mr Reamsbottom suggests, the civil service
white paper incorporates this technique for all departments to employ along
with other efficiency measures that they are taking. The white paper makes
clear that departments will continue to publish their intentions and report
achievements against their commitments.
The scrutiny on external consultants was not launched either to defend or
castigate external consultants, but rather to show how government can
improve its procedures when using them. This, I believe, it has done. The
intention, as with market testing, is to ensure that the taxpayer's money is
not wasted.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Whiff of tiffs if Ziff sells in a jiff: Louise Kehoe opens
the covers of a US computer magazine publisher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The headlines in PC Week and PC Magazine, the flagship publications of Ziff
Communications, are written for computerphiles: PC Labs test 70 notebook
PCs, ISVs ready usage-based licences, Trio dispensing cure for SNMP ills.
The covers feature machines rather than humans.
Yet these and Ziff's 13 other titles, all geared to specific segments of the
computer market, are attracting attention from a new group of readers whose
interests are in dollars and cents rather than bits and bytes: the world's
largest publishing houses.
Ziff has been put up for sale by the three grandsons of William Ziff, its
founder. Dirk, 30, Robert, 27, and Daniel Ziff, 22, are the heirs to about
90 per cent of the business which their father, William Ziff Jr, built into
the pre-eminent US computer industry publisher.
'Publishing has been at the centre of our family's business interests for
two generations,' said Dirk Ziff last month. 'But since our father's
retirement last fall, Robert and I have realised that the company is not
where we want to spend our careers. After consulting with our brother Daniel
(a student at Columbia University) and our father, it was clear that we
should focus where our skills and interests lie, in the investment field.'
The proceeds of the sale will go into Ziff Brothers Investments, a budding
firm founded by Dirk Ziff that holds stakes in real-estate investments and
trades in equities and convertible securities.
The announcement came as a shock to industry observers and company
employees, who had expected the Ziff brothers to retain ownership of the
family publishing empire, even if they did not personally become involved in
its management. There is 'sadness, a sense of betrayal' among Ziff staff,
said one senior magazine editor. Some have gone so far as to describe their
feelings in a computer-style acronym - GLZ for 'greedy little Ziffs'.
However, the proposed sale has sparked excitement in the publishing
industry. The bidding process, handled by the US merchant bank Lazard
Freres, is reported to be attracting broad interest, particularly in Europe
and Asia.
Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch information and publishing group which owns
several other trade publication companies, including Boston-based Cahners
Publishing, is seen as a likely bidder. This week Reed said it was
considering making a bid to expand its presence in the US and was examining
the Ziff group. It is expected to decide whether to make an offer next
month.
K-III Communications Corp, the publisher funded and partly owned by
financiers Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, as well as Hachette Fili-pacchi
Magazines, the publishing arm of France's Matra Hachette, have also
expressed interest. Two other potential bidders, International Data Group
and CMP Publications, Ziff's direct competitors in the US computer trade
press, have been ruled out by the Ziff brothers.
If sold as a whole, Ziff Communications could raise about Dollars 2bn,
industry observers suggest. Some see the price going as high as Dollars 3bn.
The company may sell at a premium because its magazine titles are the
leaders in their field. 'Ziff has set the pace in computer trade
publications,' said William Bluestein, a senior analyst with Forrester
Research, a high-tech research firm.
Known in computer publishing as tough, hard-driving and ambitious, Ziff is
far from a traditional publishing house. It is often described as a 'yuppie
company' that relies upon the energy and drive of hard-working, highly paid
young editors and sales representatives. Its critics - and there are many -
charge that Ziff is 'bureaucratic' and 'management-heavy'. Few, however, can
afford to ignore Ziff, a powerhouse in computer publishing.
Ziff's advertising revenues outpace its competitors. According to Adscope,
an advertising tracking service, Ziff publications took 34 per cent of US
computer business advertising last year and in the first half of this year
advertising sales in the group's seven US business titles reached Dollars
341.8m, up 8 per cent from the same period a year ago.
Ziff sold 50,000 pages of advertising worldwide last year, with 7,000 pages
in PC Magazine alone, which has a paid circulation of more than 1m,
according to the company. Ziff also publishes six computer magazines in
Europe. Other ventures include a PC market research group, conferences and
trade shows. The Information Access unit publishes industry information on
CD-ROMs, while Ziff-Net, an online information service, offers PC users
articles from the company's magazines as well as discussion forums and
libraries of computer industry information.
Bidders for this cornucopia of businesses will have to move quickly,
however. Ziff's 4,300 employees have been told to expect a buyer to be named
by November 11, in time for the Comdex computer show in Las Vegas, one of
the most important events of the year in the world of PCs.
This apparent haste worries some observers. 'They seem to be in a great
hurry to sell,' said a Ziff magazine editor, who wonders if the Ziff
brothers may have decided that the financial performance of the group has
peaked.
With the growth of the 'home computer' market, PC makers are increasingly
favouring general interest magazines and newspapers for their advertising.
At the same time, competing trade publishers are targeting Ziff's market
with publications that are narrowly focused on lucrative segments, such as
purchasers of computer networking equipment and software. The company
retorts: 'Ziff is having a record year and the outlook for our business has
never been brighter.'
Yet Ziff has recently embarked upon some expensive and risky ventures.
Interchange, a new online news service offering news from the Washington
Post and several other newspapers and news agencies, faces fierce
competition from established services such as America Online and Compuserve,
as well as other entrants, such as Apple Computer's eWorld and a similar
service that Microsoft, the computer software leader, is expected to launch
this year.
Ziff's entry into the consumer market - with Family PC, a joint venture with
Walt Disney, to be introduced this month, and Computer Life, for
'sophisticated consumers', scheduled for release in September - is also a
gamble.
Another venture, launched yesterday, takes the company into television
programming with four-weekly shows for computer buffs. 'The pending sale of
the company hasn't slowed us down one bit,' Ziff boasts. Top management,
including Eric Hippeau, chairman and chief executive, has reassured
employees that it intends to remain with the company after the sale, and
insists that a change of ownership will not put a crimp on Ziff's ambitious
growth plans.
Whether a new owner will want to continue investing in the new Ziff
projects, started by Mr Hippeau, is questionable. Keeping him and many of
Ziff's key people on board will, however, require the current 'hands-off'
approach to be preserved, employees say. That may be a lot to ask on top of
a premium sales price.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: A Don Quixote to be remembered for
all the right reasons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JORG SCHIMMELPFENNIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having seen the Royal Ballet's production of Don Quixote first during
its original run in 1993 and a further two times during this year's summer
season, I still cannot agree with Clement Crisp who in his latest biting
attack opted for 'bloodbath'('Coppelia', August 12). The Royal Ballet's
reading of the the text is much more in line with the tradition of classical
ballet than a first glance suggests. One has to remember that, in the 19th
century, ballet music, to use Konstantin Skalhovsky's fitting comparison,
was supposed to enliven the dance as colour enlivens a drawing. Marc
Thompson's witty, though admittedly unusual, designs are but a natural
extension of this view. Instead of competing with the dancing it positively
encourages the eye - and the mind - to concentrate on what ballet is all
about. And what wonderful dancing it was.
When this ballet was shown for the last time a fortnight ago Fiona Chadwick
and Zoltan Solymossi, as Kitri and Basilio respectively, gave one of the
most inspiring performances I have ever seen. Their sparkling pas de deux,
flashing variations and a joyous finale was classical dancing at its very
best. The audience was still captivated long after the last of a seemingly
endless number of much deserved curtain calls.
With respect to the supporting roles, Nicola Tranah - in much the same way
as Rachael Whitbread on the previous night - proved the casting policy
absolutely right with a beautiful and highly lyrical reading of the Queen of
the Dryads. Jane Burn and Belinda Hatley (Ann De Vos on Friday night,
respectively) showed joyful dancing just as it is supposed to be done.

As a captive customer of Yorkshire Water, am I to infer that consideration

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CLARE DAVID
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read your article on the ever-increasing pretentiousness of today's
cuisine served by modern-day caterers with sympathy and horror ('Awful lapse
in taste', August 8). It is true that dishes are now becoming more and more
complicated, with a myriad of ingredients fighting for first place in the
'guess what you're eating' competition.
However, certain continental cuisine - especially Italian - concentrates on
allowing one flavour to tantalise the taste buds rather than bombarding them
with hot, cold, sweet and sour all in one go. The fresh taste of basil comes
shining through in the simple yet delicious Ligurian dish of Tagliatelle
alla Pesto Genovese, although some philistines do distort the recipe to
include parsley and potatoes]
Other sauces, like pastasciutta, again focus on one main ingredient such as
the mighty mushroom, the esoteric artichoke or the unassuming olive and,
stirred into some freshly cooked pasta, create a delicious and unpretentious
dinner.
Perhaps seeking out genuine Italian dishes is the secret of a happy, hearty
meal . . .?

<TEXT>
Since the US Federal Reserve started to raise short-term interest rates in
February, global markets have acquired a sporadic habit of lurching down in
tandem. Yet this week's synchronised market upset was precipitated not by
the Fed or the Bundesbank, but by interest rate rises in Sweden and Italy.
The merits of the Swedes and Italians are many and various; but since when
have markets taken their cue from the Riksbank and the Bank of Italy?
True, this was a European rather than a global nudge downwards. On Thursday
when the rot set in, Japan defied the trend in equities and bonds, while the
US fell in response to poor domestic retail sales figures. To give Wall
Street its due, it has internationalised itself to an unprecedented degree
over the past decade. But the Federal Open Market Committee meeting next
week will rightly take precedence over events in Scandinavia or Italy.
Yet even at a European level the market slide raises several questions. The
rate increases were said by the monetary authorities of Sweden and Italy to
be designed, respectively, to address inflationary pressure and to defend
the currency. But the markets' immediate reaction was to depress the krona
and the lira, thereby undermining these twin objectives.
As for the rationalisations offered by analysts for the synchronised nature
of the fall, they look unconvincing. Suggestions that the central banks'
decisions heralded the end of monetary easing in Europe look speculative.
The Bundesbank is Europe's de facto monetary authority, and it operates
largely on the basis of German domestic considerations, not those in Sweden
or Italy.
What is clear about recent bond and currency market behaviour is that
investors are in a funk about the growth of fiscal deficits. So, too, are
central bankers; and the unspoken objective of the interest rate increases
last week was to fire a shot over the bows of the politicians. The real
question is whether the bond market tremor is justified and whether the
central banks' actions will work.
Fiscal positions
Italy and Sweden are in very different fiscal positions. The OECD estimates
that Italy's outstanding stock of gross public debt will top 120 per cent,
as a percentage of GDP, by the end of next year. Only Belgium, within the
OECD area, carries a heavier burden of outstanding public debt. Yet Italy
has been taking steps to put its public finances in order. It is the only
country in the Group of Seven, apart from Japan, that is running a primary
budget surplus.
That means a surplus of revenue over expenditure equivalent to 2 per cent of
GDP this year, before deducting interest on the debt. This is the
traditional recipe for debt stabilisation and a return to fiscal orthodoxy.
In Sweden, for decades the model of social democracy, the fiscal position is
very different. Its debt stock falls short of Italy's. Yet both its general
government deficit and its primary budget deficit are the highest in the
OECD area. Its gross public debt, which was below the OECD average in 1991
at 53.4 per cent of GDP, is expected to top 100 per cent by next year, when
it will fall short only of Italy, Belgium and Greece. In short, the rise in
debt is vertiginous and the trend is adverse.
Market psychology
Against that background the central bankers' moves are double edged. Higher
short-term interest rates will raise the cost of servicing the debt and
reduce revenues if growth is restrained. Market psychology, meantime, is
doubly punitive. Capital flows respond politely to changes in interest rate
differentials in rising markets. But when they are worried, as at present,
about the growing risk of bond market default, they recognise that no
increase in rates can compensate for the risks.
The danger is that the pessimism becomes contagious. If everyone rushes to
be first out of the exit, the currency depreciates anyway and bond markets
fall. Governments are then forced to monetise the debt by borrowing from the
domestic banking system. The markets also know that, while Italy may be on
the path of virtue, the temptation to stray is greater when the budget is in
primary surplus, because the cost of servicing the debt alone is preventing
politically attractive tax cuts. For a new coalition like that of Mr
Berlusconi's, it is all too easy to blame past debts on corrupt Christian
Democratics and to call for a new start with a clean slate.
The Italian government is clearly determined to avoid the international
opprobrium that would follow. If Sweden's social democrats return in the
September election, they may prove tougher than expected. But for the
moment, the European bond and currency markets are driven by fiscal fear and
the electoral timetable. With Britain's Tories looking for pre-electoral tax
cuts and Germany's Social Democrats hoping to improve their chances
yesterday by promising the biggest programme of tax cuts for ordinary people
in the history of the Federal Republic, who is to say the markets are crazy?

FT  13 AUG 94 / Tills are alive with sound of money: Are UK banks making too
much profit? John Gapper says shareholders and customers may compete for the
bounty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Mrs Margaret Bird, a Barclays' customer for 40 years, the news that
Britain's biggest bank made Pounds 1.04bn pretax profits in the first half
of this year was baffling. 'I think it is an awful lot of money when they
are laying off people. It seems a bit strange,' said Mrs Bird as she used a
cash machine outside Barclays' branch in Southwark, south London.
Mr Dick Barfield, whose company Standard Life owns Pounds 200m of Barclays'
shares as an investment on behalf of its pension and life insurance policy
holders, did not agree. 'It is good to see the bank making decent profits
after a period when it has not made much at all,' he said. 'Banks ought to
make this sort of return to justify their existence.'
It has been more than a decade since the UK's high street banks achieved the
returns seen in the first half of this year. National Westminster Bank last
week reported interim profits of Pounds 767m, and Lloyds made Pounds 605m.
More important to the City of London, the banks achieved high returns on
capital, and increased their dividend payments to shareholders
substantially.
It is a remarkably rapid return to good fortune for banks whose profits  -
in proportion to their size - were negligible in the early 1990s. In 1992,
NatWest made pre-tax profits of only Pounds 367m for the whole year, and
Barclays made a Pounds 242m loss. The trauma forced Barclays into drastic
steps: it cut its dividend, and appointed a new chief executive.
The swing in earnings is almost entirely due to falls in provisions against
bad debts. Banks made huge provisions in the early 1990s to cover unwise
lending during the height of the late 1980s boom. But the financial health
of companies improved sharply in the first half of the year, allowing
Barclays to cut provisions by two-thirds to Pounds 306m.
This revealed how much more profitable banks have made themselves in the
past three years. They have pushed up margins on loans, increased charges
and cut costs by reducing staff numbers. 'As abnormal bad debts have become
normal, banks have been unmasked as very profitable institutions,' says Mr
Chris Ellerton, banking expert at the investment bank SG Warburg.
Despite banks' protests this week that their profits were reasonable, this
level of return is higher than that of banks in other countries, or of UK
industry generally. Mr Joe Rooney, European equity strategist at the
investment bank Lehman Brothers, says UK banks are an extreme example of a
trend towards higher industry profitability.
'We are seeing a sizeable shift in the distribution of cash from wages and
towards profits,' says Mr Rooney. But although profits of other UK
industrial companies reflect this trend, the average return on capital for
companies in countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development is under half that reported by Barclays and
Lloyds. Most European banks are now reporting much lower returns than UK
ones.
British banks argue that protests about their profits are misplaced. First,
they say that profits do not come solely from their UK branch networks.
Banks such as Barclays and NatWest have built investment banking operations
that trade in global markets and raise capital for large companies. They
also run retail operations abroad. Barclays' high street branches in the UK
made Pounds 659m - or 64 per cent - of its first-half profits.
Mr Colin Fisher, Lloyds' senior general manager for retail banking in the
UK, argues that the high street bank 'is not really making a great deal of
money. Its return on investment is poor by any standard'. Rather than being
congratulated, Mr Fisher says he 'comes under a lot of pressure from Brian
(Pitman, the bank's chief executive)' to make more money.
Second, banks say that they need a high level of profits to make a good
return for their shareholders, to retain enough capital to invest in their
business, and to offer fresh loans. Although Barclays made Pounds 533m
pretax profits in 1991, it was forced to remove Pounds 96m from its reserves
to meet its tax bill, and to pay Pounds 338m in dividends.
Mr Martin Gray, chief executive of NatWest's UK branch network, says banks
must make adequate profits because otherwise they would not attract capital
from investors such as US pension funds. 'Banks have to compete in a global
market where there is a scarcity of capital. We must make a high return to
cover the risk,' he says.
Quite how high is a matter of debate. Banks themselves say they have a 'cost
of equity' - the return they must offer investors to obtain capital - of
between 12 and 14 per cent a year. This is calculated by taking the 8.5
yield on 30-year Treasury bonds - a proxy for a 'risk-free' investment - and
adding 5 per cent to compensate for the extra risk of shares.
Banks should, therefore, make a minimum post-tax return of about this amount
annually. Their return this year will be much higher: Barclays' return in
the first half was more than 23 per cent. But bankers say this is not
excessive because the industry is more cyclical than others. They have to
make enough money in the good times to compensate for bad debt losses during
recessions.
This was the reason why Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' chief executive, was
unabashed at its profits. He said Barclays had squandered its shareholders'
funds over the past six years by making a return on equity averaging 4 per
cent. 'That sort of return does not just damage banks, it destroys them,' he
said, arguing that Barclays now needed to rebuild capital.
But there is a flaw in this logic. Banks would normally be in need of
capital in an economic recovery because demand for loans would be high. In
practice, this has not happened. Companies are still repaying debt from the
late 1980s, and individuals are wary of taking on fresh debts. This means
that banks have no clear outlet for capital.
The result is that banks are starting to build up excess capital - more cash
than they need to back loans. Barclays is likely to add about Pounds 800m to
its capital this year, and unless loan demand increases sharply, it will
find itself with a large pile of cash. The question for its 7m UK personal
and small business customers in the UK is whether it will be used to improve
service and lower prices.
There will be pressure on banks to do something. Investors are not keen on
banks holding excess capital because they have a history of wasting such
cash on loss-making acquisitions. Lloyds' shareholders have supported the
bank's plan to spend Pounds 1.8bn of its cash on buying Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester Building Society, but not all banks may find suitable takeover
targets.
An alternative means of slimming excess capital is to give it back to
shareholders. A lot of regional banks in the US - where bank profits
rebounded earlier - have bought back their shares. 'Shareholders tend to
think excess capital is best dealt with by giving it back to the people who
own the business,' says Mr Ellerton of SG Warburg.
Yet customers could also benefit from banks' new-found wealth. There are
already signs that rejuvenated banks are starting to compete with each other
by lowering some of the prices that they raised in the early 1990s. Small
business charges have been frozen, and initiatives such as Abbey National's
cut in overdraft charges are proliferating.
Mr Fisher of Lloyds says that despite his bank not making adequate returns
on current accounts, he has had to respond to margin-cutting moves by other
banks. He cites Lloyds' decision in June to clear cheques in three days
instead of four - thus losing interest on funds. 'I did not want to do it,
but I was forced into it by competitive pressure,' he says.
Mr Gray of NatWest says that although banks 'provide a hell of a lot for
free', they cannot ignore price competition over more profitable products
such as credit cards or mortgages. Similarly, Mr Bill Gordon, Barclays'
managing director of UK banking, says that improved profits mean that 'if
there is a price war, we are in a better position to fight it'.
Pricing is only one way in which consumers could benefit from banks'
profits. Another is improvements in the level of service. Banks have been
severely criticised for low service standards and inadequate technology
since the recession. The more candid bankers admit that part of the problem
stemmed from cost-cutting during the period of low returns.
'Quality of service can only be as high as you can afford,' says Mr Fisher.
'If you are trying to keep your bank going and your business customers
alive, there is no doubt that you get distracted.' Most banks have been
investing large amounts in staff training and technology in the past two
years, but some say they will now be able to speed up the investment.
In contrast to price cuts, investment in improved service may please
shareholders. They would regard it as money well spent if it reinforced
earnings by attracting new business, or protecting banks' large market
shares. Yet there is limited evidence that banks have gained earnings
benefits from the investments in technology and training made so far.
Mr Gordon says that technology, such as a computer system currently being
installed in 400 Barclays branches to guide managers dealing with small
companies, could help customers more than cuts in loan margins. 'It will
help our customers in spades. Some real insight into their finances is far
more use to them than a quarter per cent off interest rates.'
For this strategy to work, customers will have to recognise improvements in
what their banks offer, and be less willing to be lured away by lower-priced
products from others. Banks cite customer surveys showing gains in how they
are perceived. But they appear some distance from regaining a level of
customer loyalty that might protect them in a price war.
Mr Bird is one customer who has not yet noticed much of a difference at
Barclays. 'Service has really gone downhill,' she says. She has not switched
banks because it is 'such a hassle' to do so. Yet her bank hardly has reason
to feel secure in her loyalty if others start to use their growing piles of
capital to woo her with cut-rate offers.
If that happens, banks' record profits will start to look vulnerable. Mr
Gordon of Barclays says a decline in earnings would be a pity. 'Far from
banks being a bad thing, they are a very good thing. Where would we be
without them?' he asks rhetorically. If banks are to sustain their profits
at this year's level, he does not have much time to persuade the sceptics.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Woman in the News: Safe from screams of intolerance -
Taslima Nasreen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taslima Nasreen, the controversial Bangladeshi writer, was yesterday about
as far away as it is possible to get from the steamy streets of Dhaka where
her life was under threat from Moslem fundamentalists.
Hidden somewhere in the cool Swedish forests, where she was whisked under
police guard after fleeing to Stockholm on a tourist visa earlier this week,
Ms Nasreen's hosts from PEN, the writer's association, said she was enjoying
the natural tranquillity and security that now surrounds her.
The author herself said she may emerge from her secret hideout next week to
answer questions about whether she intends to apply for asylum in Sweden,
neighbouring Norway, or some other western country, or whether she
eventually intends to go home. For the time being, in her only direct
statement, she said: 'Even though I find myself in a secure refuge, I need
peace and quiet before I am sufficiently recovered to be able to fulfil my
public obligations.'
Her uncharacteristic reticence since leaving home is a measure of the
pressure Ms Nasreen, who is 32, has been under since she was forced into
hiding in June by death threats from fundamentalists enraged by her views,
particularly on the role of women in Moslem society.
Ms Nasreen has been challenging Islam since she was 10 years old. She
remembers her parents letting her two brothers go outside to play, while she
was told to stay at home. When she argued, her parents said: 'You are a
girl. A girl has no right to go outside the house.' It was, she recalls, her
first experience of the discrimination between men and women which has since
come to dominate her life.
She rebelled against that discrimination with a fury which eventually led
thousands of fundamentalists to take to the streets of Dhaka. The storm she
provoked has left many Bangladeshis uneasy about their country, which has
long considered itself to be among the most tolerant of Moslem-dominated
states.
For the rest of the world, Ms Nasreen's experience comes as an uncomfortable
reminder of the Salman Rushdie affair. Now there are two writers whose
pursuit of literary freedom has forced them to go into hiding. In each case,
Islamic mullahs have questioned the primacy given in the west to freedom of
speech and self-expression. They say such freedoms should not extend to the
freedom to insult God.
This clash has certainly been in evidence in Sweden this week. Mr Mahmoud
Aldebe, head of the Swedish Islamic Council, asked pointedly: 'Why are only
those who criticise Islam invited to Sweden, and not those who defend
Islam?'
Swedish government officials, mindful that many of the country's
350,000-strong non-European immigrant community are Moslems, say they are
sensitive to Islamic values. 'But in the end the overriding issue is the
desire to defend basic values of free speech and expression. That is why
Taslima Nasreen was warmly welcomed here,' said a foreign ministry official.
Ms Nasreen comes from a middle-class family in which she was encouraged to
study. She followed her father in becoming a doctor. But she defied her
parents' efforts to control her behaviour, for example, by talking to boys.
She married and divorced twice. Both husbands, she says, reneged on promises
to respect her freedom. Both wanted their food cooked, their shirts washed,
and their bodies massaged, she says.
She stopped practising medicine because, she says, she could no longer stand
the screams of women giving birth to girls. It was a brutal reminder of the
over-whelming importance placed in Bangladesh on the value of boys over
girls.
At the same time, Ms Nasreen became increasingly involved in her writing,
producing magazine articles, pamphlets and books - all aimed at promoting
equality for women. She attacked Islam but only because, as she once said,
'Islam gives women no freedom.'
Her critics say she exaggerates the condition of Bangladeshi women. They
argue that the country has a woman prime minister and a woman leader of the
opposition. There are women doctors, lawyers and pilots. Women are the main
beneficiaries of the country's largest charity, the Bangladesh Rural
Advancement Committee.
Indeed much of the SKr250m (Pounds 20m) grant aid Sweden gives to Bangladesh
every year is directed specifically towards women.
But this has not blunted Ms Nasreen's criticisms. The real issue, she
believes, is the abuse of women. Girl babies are left to die while no care
is spared to bring up boys.
The statistics suggest that Ms Nasreen has a point. For example, according
to United Nations data, the literacy rate in Bangladesh for men is 47 per
cent and for women only 22 per cent. This gap is common in the developing
world but it is particularly wide in Moslem countries.
Initially, Ms Nasreen's efforts to highlight this anomaly in her writing
attracted little attention outside the literary circles of middle-class
Dhaka.
But in the early 1990s, Jamaat-e-Islami, the leading fundamentalist
political party, singled out Ms Nasreen for attack. It whipped up a storm
when she published Shame - a fictional account of how Moslems tortured a
Bangladeshi Hindu family after the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque in India in
1992. Shame was banned in Bangladesh on the grounds that it might foment
Hindu-Moslem violence. But it became a best-seller in India, where it was
translated into English.
Suddenly, Ms Nasreen had become too important for the fundamentalists to
ignore. There were repeated death threats and the government supplied a
police guard. Ms Nasreen continued to court controversy. In May she gave an
interview to an Indian newspaper in which she was quoted as saying the Koran
needed revising. She later claimed she was misquoted but it was too late.
Mrs Khaleda Zia, the prime minister, authorised Ms Nasreen's prosecution on
a charge of promoting religious unrest. Ms Nasreen went into hiding for a
month, emerged in public to appear in court, and fled Bangladesh, apparently
with the tacit co-operation of government officials.
Many middle-class Bangladeshis believe Ms Nasreen has stupidly given
fundamentalists a rallying cry in a country where they command little power.
But now there is a risk that to appease the fundamentalists, the government
may be forced to enact tough anti-blasphemy laws, including a death penalty.
Such laws would run counter to the Bengali tradition of tolerance, which
dates back to the 19th century when Calcutta became the capital of British
India and a melting pot of people and ideas, including atheism and feminism.
Bangladeshis believe that even though Calcutta was lost to India, this
tradition still thrives in their country.
However, fundamentalists in Bangladesh draw much of their support from poor
and ignorant villagers - people who have hardly been touched by Calcuttan
tolerance.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Timetable for route out of an impasse: The pressure signal
workers are under to accept a pay settlement soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 10-week rail signal workers' dispute is rapidly approaching a showdown,
with the threat of the loss of future pension rights looming ever closer for
the strikers.
Mr David Armstrong, industrial relations director of Railtrack, has warned
that if the company and the RMT transport union do not reach a restructuring
agreement by September 30 the signal workers will lose out in the carve-up
of the British Rail pension fund on October 1.
Under railway privatisation the BR pension fund is to be split between the
successor companies. Actuaries appointed by the trustees will calculate the
amount each company will get based on the level of basic pay rates on
September 30.
Mr Armstrong insisted that Railtrack was prepared to improve the basic rates
of signalling staff by up to 26 per cent through restructuring. If this was
done before the division of the pension fund it would substantially improve
their pension entitlements.
He said that failure to reach a deal was likely to mean that between Pounds
30m and Pounds 50m of the BR pension fund would be lost to the signal
workers, to the benefit of other rail workers. The cost to each signal
worker would be between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 1,700 a year on pensions.
Mr Armstrong said: 'We have 33 working days left before this happens.' Any
package agreed after September 30 could not be backdated to ensure enhanced
pensions.
The pension issue seems likely to grow in importance in the next few weeks.
The signalling workers, who have already lost more than Pounds 500 through
the strikes, stand to lose substantially more.
Whether this concern will modify what Mr Armstrong sees as the RMT's
intransigent position is unclear. He has serious doubts about whether the
union is in any mood to negotiate a flexible new deal for the signalling
staff.
He pointed to what he saw as the union's almost continuous opposition over
recent years to restructuring proposals for other groups of railway workers.
'They have walked away from other restructuring deals,' he said. 'If we
agreed to the kind of up-front payment for the signal workers that the RMT
wants they could do the same again. They want to lock a pay deal into the
present archaic wages structure with its knock-on effects on overtime and
shift pay. This is why I am cautious about taking the first step.'
Pinned on the wall outside his office door is Railtrack's mission statement,
signed by Mr Bob Horton, the chairman. Mr Armstrong is anxious to stress
that it offers its workers 'a fulfilling and challenging career in which we
all share equal opportunities'.
Railtrack is not going to precipitate a showdown by sacking all the
signalling workers if they strike again and replacing them with a substitute
labour force. 'We don't want 4,500 unemployed signalmen. We want them all
back at work.'
He pointed out that Mr Ronald Reagan, the former US president, was able to
fire striking US civil air-traffic controllers in 1981 because he could call
on trained military air-traffic controllers to take over their jobs. It
would take from eight to 13 weeks to train new signalling workers, and most
of the railway network would be shut during that time.
Mr Armstrong is also concerned that such action would leave a legacy of
bitterness and division. It is unlikely that such draconian action could be
taken without provoking severe unrest among other railway workers.
He notes, however, that there is no shortage of recruits willing to become
signal workers. He said: 'We had two vacancies in the north-east recently
and we had over 2,000 applications for the two jobs - so much for the low
pay and poor conditions of signal workers.'
On the day Mr Armstrong started his job he found the signal workers dispute
smouldering in his in-tray. It has been a harsh apprenticeship for a man who
came from Trainload Freight, BR's heavy haulage company - his background was
in shipbuilding industrial relations.
Now he faces the unenviable task of trying to end the rail dispute with the
least pain and without imperilling the privatisation of the industry.

FT  13 AUG 94 / NHS reforms 'damaging cancer research'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Health Service reforms are damaging cancer research by rewarding
hospitals for success in treatment rather than research and by forcing
doctors to do administrative work, a survey warned yesterday.
Half of doctors conducting trials report difficulties in continuing their
research, said the UK Co-ordinating Committee on Cancer Research, which
represents large groups funding cancer research.
The advent of NHS trust hospitals has cut the time and cash spent on
clinical trials of new treatments, it said.
Professor John Smyth of Edinburgh's Western General Hospital, who is one of
the report's authors, said drug companies contributed to the cost of trials
but only those on new drugs where a high price could eventually be charged.
NHS researchers also looked at other drugs that could provide cheaper
treatments. It was this research that was suffering, said Prof Smyth. He
said: 'We're not against trusts, but the concept of research is
diametrically opposed to the market-driven approach.'
The government rejected the findings. Mr John Bowis, a junior health
minister, said NHS changes did not 'signal any lessening' of a commitment to
clinical research. He said: 'We have set a target of increasing research and
development expenditure to 1.5 per cent of total NHS spending.'
He added that a report on NHS research and development policy commissioned
by the government from Professor Anthony Culyer of York University would be
published next month. Prof Culyer would take into account the findings
published yesterday in which most respondents blamed their difficulties on
the increasing burden of administrative work, lack of time and staff
shortages.
Dr Jonathan Waxman, cancer consultant at the Hammersmith Hospital in London,
described how a team of specialists last month had to abandon its normal
work to teach a health authority representative the basics of cancer
treatment.
He said the government had tried to address the problem with grants to
teaching hospitals designed to compensate them for their high overheads and
time spent on research rather than revenue-earning treatment.
But Prof Smyth said the government's own advisers had seen that this did not
help other hospitals where many clinical trials were conducted.
The report, published in this week's British Medical Journal, outlines
proposals to limit the damage it says is being done to cancer research. They
include making clinical trials a government priority, allocating funds to
support the cost of trials and central co-ordination of work by the NHS.
The government yesterday published for consultation the names of drugs it
proposes to put on its 'limited list' of products available on the NHS.
The move is designed to produce cuts by extending the list of disease areas
in which only a small number of products can be prescribed by NHS doctors.
Drug companies have argued against limited lists, saying they stifle
research into new treatments.
The list of 26 products in 10 areas includes Arret capsules for diarrhoea,
Dermacort skin cream and Audax Ear Drops. Patients can already buy most of
the listed products without a prescription.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Council by-election boost for Labour
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour made four net gains in local authority by-elections last month as the
party enjoyed a political 'honeymoon' under its new leader, Mr Tony Blair,
according to a survey by the Local Government Chronicle.
Labour candidates unseated Conservatives in Bradford, Portsmouth, and Castle
Point, in Essex. The Liberal Democrats made a net gain of three and the
Tories lost five.
Since the 1992 general election, Labour has won 66 seats but lost 68, while
the Liberal Democrats have gained 162 seats with only 43 losses.

Gracemount Developments, a property company owned by Mr Paul Jillard, Mr
Keith Johnson and Grand Metropolitan Estates, is to develop a 300,000 sq ft
shopping centre worth about Pounds 85m at Solihull, West Midlands, Paul
Cheeseright writes.
The borough council, as owner of six of the seven acres needed for the
scheme, yesterday said it had signed contracts for the development with
Gracemount. The council will give Gracemount a long-term lease and receive a
royalty in return.
But the development will not start until the 30 different interests in the
land not owned by the council are bought out. If the council resorts to
compulsory purchase there will be a public inquiry next year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK and US defence officials have signed an agreement to work together on a
new generation of jump jet that could replace not only the Harrier but also
other conventional naval attack aircraft.
The agreement covers development and model testing of four possible designs
of short take-off and vertical landing aircraft by consortia involving
British Aerospace, McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed, Boeing and Northrop, as well
as aero-engine builders Rolls-Royce, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney.
The programme aims to demonstrate that it is possible to develop an
affordable, modular aircraft design which different services could adapt for
different missions without too many compromises.
The programme would produce a variant, with powered lift, that could
eventually replace the Royal Navy's FRS2 Sea Harrier and the US AV-8B, also
a Harrier.
British officials said the technology developed could also be relevant to a
replacement for the Tornado bomber.
The UK will pay Dollars 12m (Pounds 7.8m), one-third of the cost of this
phase of development.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Draft guidelines on care of elderly anger opposition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers were yesterday accused of trying to shift the burden of looking
after frail elderly people to families and local authorities.
Draft guidelines issued for consultation would make it easier for hospitals
to move elderly people out of long-stay beds and into nursing homes, where
their families might be forced to pick up the bill.
Labour said the government was watering down guidelines on elderly patients'
rights to free long-term care. The charity Age Concern said the right to
free care would depend on where the patient lived.
But Mr John Bowis, junior health minister, said the draft guidance clarified
the NHS's responsibility to the chronically ill.
The circular follows a watershed case in which a stroke victim who was
unable to eat, move or talk was discharged to a nursing home against his
family's wishes.
Present guidelines say patients should not be transferred from hospital to a
nursing home against their will, but a growing number of hospitals has
flouted the guidelines, closing 'continuing care' beds for the chronically
ill.
The situation has been made worse by growing pressure to treat more
patients.
The proposed guidelines say the NHS should foot the bill for patients with
complex or multiple handicaps who need continuing and specialist medical
care.
Others, whose condition could not be improved medically but who needed
intensive long-term support, would be assessed by social services and health
professionals.
A decision on their future care would take into account the wishes of the
patient and his or her family, and local eligibility criteria.
The document says every effort should be made to meet patients' preferences
within the practical options and resources available.
Where patients assessed as not needing free long-term NHS care refused other
options the health authority and the hospital 'will need to take account of
the needs of other patients in determining how long the person can continue
to occupy an NHS bed'.
Health authorities would have to review arrangements for paying for
long-term care in the light of local needs, ensure that they were making
appropriate provision, and agree and publicise local policies on eligibility
with local authorities and health units.
Mr Bowis said nobody had the right to occupy indefinitely a hospital bed not
required on a clinical basis, but patients were entitled to a clear decision
on whether they were entitled to continuing NHS care.
Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, said Mr Bowis had failed to
offer any clarification of where he believed NHS responsibilities for
long-term healthcare began and ended.
He said: 'More and more families are going to end up picking up the tab.'

FT  13 AUG 94 / Poll opens for Labour NEC seats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new generation of Labour politicians from the left and right is fighting
for places on the National Executive Committee in elections which start
today under a one member, one vote national postal ballot.
For the first time in more than three decades, Mr Tony Benn, the veteran
leftwinger, is not standing. Although Mr Benn was removed at the last party
conference after more than 30 years' service, he recently found himself back
on the NEC because of three vacancies.
These have been created by John Smith's death, the move to the European
Commission by Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, and Mr John
Prescott's elevation to the deputy leadership.
Among the 21 candidates for the seven seats in the NEC's constituency
section, Mr Peter Hain, one of Labour's main critics of the party's economic
policy, is seen as the principal challenger from the left. Mr Dennis
Skinner, a member of the hard-left campaign group, is not expected to win
back the seat he lost last year.
In an attempt to create a wider left alliance Mr Hain recently criticised
the modernising tendency in the party without naming the new Labour leader,
Mr Tony Blair.
Mr Hain said Labour was in danger of becoming 'an empty shell of a party
with its activist base destroyed', and claimed that the power of activists
had been usurped in the party 'which has become centralised to an
unprecedented extent'.
These are the first NEC elections to be conducted among the party's
260,000-strong national membership on a one member, one vote basis.
It is expected that Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary; Mr
David Blunkett, shadow health secretary; and Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief
secretary, will retain their seats. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor,
also looks safe.
The front-runners for the three vacancies from the right are Mr Jack Straw,
shadow environment secretary; Ms Mo Mowlam, shadow heritage secretary; and
Mr Chris Smith, environment spokesman.
Two of the seven elected members have to be women. Ms Mowlam is being
challenged by Ms Dawn Primarolo, the leftwinger who speaks on health.

FT  13 AUG 94 / European Commission rejects Portillo's stance on disabled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, was yesterday accused of
putting the jobs of thousands of disabled workers at risk to boost his
credentials on the Conservative right wing.
And European Commission officials denied his department's claim that a
European Union directive made it necessary to withdraw government contracts
which provide work for workshops staffed by the disabled.
The commission said it had 'never asked the UK to take this action and is
surprised that it has done so in such an abrupt fashion rather than trying
to get around it at community level'.
It said that in the unlikely event of a legal challenge to the British
scheme the commission would have sought a compromise to allow it to continue
in some form.
Mr Tony Lloyd, Labour employment spokesman, accused Mr Portillo of acting on
purely ideological grounds to strengthen his support among 'extreme
rightwing Conservative MPs'.
In a letter to the minister Mr Lloyd says he has been assured that the
European Commission made it clear that new rules on public procurement did
not require the withdrawal of such contracts.
He adds that the directive 'was certainly not designed to destroy jobs for
people with disabilities'.
Mr Lloyd calls for a 'very clear statement' on the reasons for a ministerial
decision which could only add to the difficulties of a disadvantaged group
of workers.
He urges Mr Portillo to discuss with the European Commission how the
priority supplies scheme which enabled sheltered workshops to provide jobs
for disabled people could be reactivated. If this could not be done Mr
Portillo should announce the steps he proposed to protect the jobs
threatened by his action.
Mr Phillip Oppenheim, the employment minister, said his department was
seeking confirmation that the commission did not regard the directive as
applying to government contracts with supported workshops and factories.
'This conflicts with firm legal advice previously received from the
government's own advisers,' he said.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Harassment of fishing boats 'stopped by navy'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The arrival of the Royal Navy in the tuna-fishing grounds of the Bay of
Biscay has stopped harassment of UK trawlermen by their Spanish rivals, the
head of the fisheries protection squadron said yesterday.
Speaking at a news conference, Captain Christopher Morrison said there had
been no attacks on British fishing vessels since shortly after the first
naval protection vessel, the Anglesey, arrived in the area eight days ago.
Capt Morrison also defended his squadron's role, which has been criticised
by fishermen's representatives, in checking that European Union fishing
rules are being carried out.
Two fishing vessels have returned to Cornish ports in the past week after
claims that their nets were too long.
Capt Morrison said when the Anglesey arrived at dawn on August 4, a British
vessel radioed to say it was being harassed. 'As she arrived on the scene,
the Spanish fishing vessels left . . . and since that moment no harassment
has taken place on British fishing vessels,' Capt Morrison said. 'Any idea
that the navy has sat by watching while Spaniards cut British fishing nets
is simply not true.'
The Anglesey has since been joined by a second fisheries protection vessel,
the Alderney. Fishermen have been angered by incidents in which two vessels
left the fishing grounds after Capt Morrison's squadron said their nets
exceeded the maximum length.
Capt Morrison's comments came after Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture
minister, told Cornish fishermen the navy would prevent Spanish ships
driving British trawlers off the fishing grounds in the Bay of Biscay.
The trawler Silver Harvest pulled in its net this morning in the middle of
more than 100 Spanish boats with HMS Alderney 'riding shotgun', said Capt
Morrison.
Spanish fisheries ministry officials were unable to confirm reports that two
Spanish vessels were sent back to port two days ago for using driftnets
longer than 2.5km.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Tories attack motorway toll plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government plans to introduce tolls for motorway users were thrown into
confusion yesterday by a fiercely critical report from a Tory-dominated
committee of MPs.
The Commons transport committee says in its report that the government's
arguments for motorway tolls in a green paper published last May were
'unconvincing'. It suggests that an increase in fuel duty would be cheaper
and easier to collect.
The committee says: 'The government will have to provide a great deal more
information before parliament and the public can be persuaded that the green
paper's proposals for electronic tolling are either desirable or workable.'
Fuel duty 'does not suffer from the defect of tolls, namely that motorists
will be inclined to avoid payment by diverting on to other roads'.
This could lead to the 'totally unacceptable' prospect of between 20 per
cent and 30 per cent of vehicles diverting from motorways on to 'unsuitable
local roads' at peak times, leading to 'additional accidents and casualties,
as well as environmental damage', the MPs warn in their report.
The MPs also attack the government's refusal to earmark the proceeds of an
increase in fuel duty for motorway spending, saying this would breach the
Treasury's rule against such use of tax revenues. They say this policy is
'purely an accounting convention' and has no statutory basis.
A further 'fundamental weakness of the green paper', the MPs say, was its
lack of a guarantee that proceeds from tolls would be 'genuinely additional
money for spending on roads', and would not simply be recouped by the
Treasury.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, described the report as 'an
important addition to the public debate on this issue'. He said toll revenue
would be used only to improve the tolled network, and added: 'Without
improvements, the diversion of traffic which worries the committee will
happen spontaneously.' He said the government's two-year research programme
into technology for the network would continue.
Labour dismissed tolls as 'another Tory tax', while road-user groups also
gave strong support to the committee. The Royal Automobile Club said the
government must 'go back to the drawing board', while the Automobile
Association said tolls were 'another unacceptable general tax on motoring'.
The British Road Federation predicted that it was 'unlikely any revenue from
tolling will be available to accelerate the motorway improvement programme
before 2000 at the very earliest', and said the government should 'urgently'
investigate other sources of funding.
However, the Freight Transport Association, representing industrial road
users, said the committee had 'got in a muddle' over whether motorway
charging was meant simply to raise money or to provide a 'value-for-money
motorway system'. It said increased fuel tax was a 'blunt instrument' which
would have an adverse effect on rural areas.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Chance for the marchers to break step: The latest moves to
end Northern Ireland's sectarian violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barely a week goes by in Northern Ireland without a date to be commemorated.
Ancient battles, the deaths of martyrs and atrocities from the political
violence of the more recent past are remembered with flags, speeches and
vows to stand firm against violence from the opposite side of the sectarian
divide.
This weekend is no exception. Three hundred and six years ago a group of
Protestant apprentices closed the gates of Derry, then the biggest city in
Ulster, in the face of approaching troops loyal to the deposed Roman
Catholic King James II. The siege was lifted in August 1689, and the
Protestant Apprentice Boys mark that anniversary with an annual march
through the centre of what is now a largely Catholic city.
When Catholic civil-rights protesters were being clubbed from the streets in
Derry 25 years ago by a sectarian police force, the annual Apprentice Boys
march sparked two days of riots which brought British troops to the streets
of Northern Ireland.
At first welcomed by Catholics, the troops quickly came to be seen as an
army of occupation bolstering Protestant political domination of the
province. Ms Bernadette Devlin, later an MP, predicted from a Derry
barricade at the time: 'We don't fight the army today, but the day will
come.'
The Apprentice Boys will be marching in Derry again this weekend and
republicans will hold their own demonstrations to repeat their calls for the
removal of British troops from the province - and to mark another infamous
date in the nationalist calendar, the introduction of internment in August
1971.
So has anything changed which makes this anniversary different? Cynics will
say no. But the Republicans' worst-kept secret - the announcement this
autumn of a prolonged IRA ceasefire in the wake of the Downing Street
declaration - offers the first glimmer of hope in two decades that a
resolution of the conflict might be in sight.
For several months senior republican figures have been hinting that a
prolonged IRA ceasefire is in the offing - the first since 1975. Senior
officials in the Irish government, which has kept open channels of
communication with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, are convinced
that 'something will happen' in the next month.
Sir Hugh Annesley, the chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
told the BBC this week that a prolonged IRA ceasefire could quickly lead to
a sharp reduction in the troop presence on the streets.
Both the Irish and British governments have been emphatic that a 'permanent'
rather than a 'prolonged' IRA ceasefire will be necessary before Sinn Fein
can be brought into political negotiations. The IRA refuses to engage in
what it sees as a one-sided unilateral disarming of its units, but that does
not rule out a phased response to military de-escalation measures as hinted
at by the RUC chief.
Senior Irish politicians believe that it is around such gestures,
reciprocated in turn by either side, and eventually embracing the Loyalist
paramilitaries, that a prolonged ceasefire might be built into a permanent
one.
This weekend the drums, pipes, flags and speeches will be redolent with the
symbolism of the past. But perhaps the moves about to come will prove to
have greater significance.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Director bought power shares ahead of review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Denis Cassidy, a non-executive director of Seeboard, the electricity
distribution company, bought 5,000 shares in the company at 382p each only
three days before release of an electricity industry price review.
Seeboard's shares closed yesterday at 414p, up 18p on the day. On Thursday
the price of shares in Seeboard and the 11 other regional electricity
companies in England and Wales soared after the publication of a report by
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, which showed price
controls as less onerous than had recently been thought likely.
The Stock Exchange is understood to have been investigating dealing in the
shares of the companies before the release of the report and is said to have
shown particular interest in share purchases by directors.
Some directors may have had advance reports of Prof Littlechild's
recommendations because they participated in the pricing review, although
non-executives such as Mr Cassidy are much less likely to have been
involved.
Separately, the Stock Exchange is understood to be examining trading in
shares of the companies by brokers, some of whom are believed to have
obtained advance copies of the report.
Seeboard said that Mr Cassidy, who is also chairman of Boddington, the pubs
group, had sought the approval of Seeboard's board to purchase the shares,
in line with board policy. He joined the board as a non-executive director
in May and owns no other Seeboard shares.
There is no evidence that Mr Cassidy had any advance knowledge of the
contents of the Littlechild report.
Explaining the purchase, Seeboard said that having joined recently as a
non-executive director 'he was showing a long-term commitment to the
company'.
It was not immediately clear why the board sanctioned a purchase of company
shares just days before the release of a price-sensitive document likely to
affect the company's future profits. The company declined to make any other
comment on the matter.
The Stock Exchange has an unofficial policy of closely monitoring trading in
a company's shares in the days leading up to the release of price-sensitive
information.
The review is regarded as highly favourable for all the electricity
companies. Analysts are divided on how Seeboard fared, with some saying that
it did relatively badly and others taking the contrary view.
Among the investment community the company enjoys one of the best ratings of
all the 12 regional companies.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Motor licensing agency to close local offices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency is to close all its 51 local
offices by 1997 with the loss of 1,500 jobs, it announced yesterday.
The agency, which earlier this week announced it was cutting 700 jobs at its
Swansea headquarters, said that a pilot computer scheme would eliminate any
need for over-the-counter services to the motor trade.
It said that about 1,000 jobs involved with collecting car tax could go
following the decision to collect the tax continuously, whether a vehicle is
on or off the road. The work of dealing with specialist registrations such
as trade number plates - involving about 500 employees - could be handled at
Swansea or dealt with by agents.
The annual cost of the district office network was put at Pounds 40m.
The agency said that all customers would be given notice of the changes and
that alternative sources of service would be in place before offices were
closed.
Unions and the Labour party reacted angrily. Mr Barry Reamsbottom, general
secretary of the Civil and Public Services Association, described the
decision as an 'act of butchery' by the government and pointed out that the
agency's staff were last year awarded a Charter Mark for excellence in
service delivery.
He said: 'The government is making two major assumptions. It is assuming
that untried, untested new technology will work, and secondly, that
legislation to introduce continuous licensing will pass without opposition.
'Over Pounds 130m remained uncollected last year because of vehicle excise
duty evasion. The news of the closure of VRO offices will be music to the
ears of the tens of thousands of car-tax dodgers.'
Mr John Sheldon, general secretary of the National Union Civil and Public
Servants, said the cuts had nothing to do with making the agency more
efficient or effective.
He said: 'The office closures and planned redundancies are a cynical part of
the government's preparations for the privatisation of DVLA.'
Mr Tony Lloyd, Labour employment spokesman, said the move was 'a devastating
blow' to the agency and to employment.
Motoring organisations predicted, however, that the changes need not cause
serious problems. The Automobile Association said that most motorists
already communicated with Swansea rather than with their local office.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Survey upgrades growth forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Upbeat news about the economy and improving business sentiment have resulted
in a widespread upgrading of economic growth forecasts in Britain this year
and next, Consensus Economics said yesterday in its poll of forecasters.
The company said its monthly survey of 35 economic forecasters found an
average expectation that gross domestic product would grow 3 per cent this
year and 2.9 per cent next year. Last month's expectation was 2.8 per cent
growth this year and 2.7 per cent in 1995, while three months ago it was 2.7
per cent for both years.
In general, economists are more bullish than the Treasury, which at the end
of June forecast growth of 2 3/4 per cent this year and next.
Consensus Economics says that, on average, forecasters raised their
expectations of consumers' expenditure, gross investment, company trading
profits and manufacturing production in both years over the past month.
However, the consensus points to an average rise of 2.6 per cent in retail
prices this year - unchanged from July - and a slight rise to 3.7 per cent
from 3.6 per cent in expected average retail price inflation next year.
The economists were slightly more optimistic about the outlook for the
current account and the public sector borrowing requirement. The consensus
now points to a PSBR of Pounds 34.4bn in the fiscal year to the end of March
1995 against the government's Pounds 36bn forecast, and Pounds 26.2bn for
1995-96 against the Treasury's Pounds 28bn.
Consensus Economics reports an upgrading of German growth forecasts. Its
panel produced average forecasts of 2 per cent GDP growth this year and 2.7
per cent next year, against 1.8 per cent and 2.6 per cent previously.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Accountant's employee monitoring 'failed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A leading accountant failed to make sufficient inquiries into the private
activities of an employee later convicted of forgery and deception, his
professional body has concluded.
Details of proceedings by the disciplinary committee of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales against Mr Brian Worth were
revealed yesterday. The committee found that Mr Worth, former chairman of
Clark Kenneth Leventhal (CKL), an international network of accountancy firms
including Clark Whitehill in the UK, knew that Mr Nicholas Young was
conducting private business from the firm's offices but received only
imprecise responses to inquiries about this business.
Mr Young, a former executive director of CKL, was convicted at the Old
Bailey three years ago and has since been released from jail. While claiming
to invest money in offshore trusts offering high rates of return he was
actually spending it on a system of horserace betting and on sustaining his
lifestyle.
The proceedings of an appeal by Mr Worth against disciplinary action show
that Mr Young paid CKL several thousand pounds each year - a significant
proportion of CKL's total income - in connection with his private
activities, which the committee says he described to Mr Worth as 'certain
clerical services to unidentified overseas clients'.
After the original hearing in November Mr Worth, former head of the
institute's investigation committee, was 'admonished' and ordered to pay
Pounds 1,000 in costs. The appeal hearing upheld this ruling and Mr Worth
was ordered to pay a further Pounds 1,000 in costs.
The committee said he had failed to make adequate inquiries into Mr Young's
work and that he had responsibilities as chairman of CKL and as a chartered
accountant to supervise and monitor all Mr Young's activities.
It concluded that he was not entitled to rely without further inquiry on the
'inadequate' explanations given to him by Mr Young on the source and nature
of payments. It said his failure to make further inquiries 'would have
caused concern and surprise to most right-thinking members of the public'.
The committee stressed that Mr Worth was of good character, had always acted
honourably and had been genuinely misled by Mr Young. There was little
chance further inquiries could reasonably have led to the detection of the
fraud.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Chinese hit by optic fibre glut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's fledgling optical fibre cable industry is in crisis due to a
nationwide glut that has forced some plants to close and others to slash
production.
This will be ominous news for international telecommunications companies
like AT&amp;T and Alcatel which are planning optical fibre plants in China.
The official Economic Information Daily newspaper said yesterday China's
cable production capacity had reached 300,000km annually, compared with
demand of 60-70,000km. Some 80 companies producing optical fibre had already
been set up with another 40 planning to enter the field. 'By the time all
these companies are ready,' it said 'China would be able to produce more
than 400,000km of optical cables, four to five times more than the market
demands'.
Problems of oversupply in the Chinese market are being exacerbated by the
global glut. The Yangtze Optical Cables, based in Wuhan, central China, and
one of the country's leading producers, has been forced to cut prices by up
to 15 per cent to preserve its share of the market.
Local and international producers have swarmed into the market, lured by
China's huge demand for cable to satisfy its ambitious telecommunications
expansion plans.
But Mr Xu Shanyan of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, said
yesterday that the ministry had been warning companies of an impending glut
in optical fibre cables.
'We do welcome competition,' he said, 'but the problem is that we can't have
too many factories. This will not only have an adverse effect on investors,
but also on our own joint ventures.'
Mr Xu said there were no plans at this stage to freeze the building of new
optical fibre plants, but he urged investors to study the market carefully.
Mr Louis Witters of Alcatel said the company was aware of the oversupply
problems and was following the evolution of the market.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Strong yen widens Japan's trade gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The combination of a strong yen and rapid growth in the country's principal
export markets pushed Japan's trade surplus higher again in July, according
to preliminary figures published yesterday by the Ministry of Finance.
The customs-cleared merchandise surplus rose last month by 4 per cent from a
year earlier to Dollars 12.3bn (Pounds 7.9bn), the highest July figure on
record and the fifth largest for a single month.
Exports rose 6.9 per cent to Dollars 34.44bn, and imports grew 8.5 per cent
to Dollars 22.15bn. The longer-term trend suggests the surplus is narrowing,
but only slowly. In the three months to July the figure was 2.3 per cent
lower than in the same period a year ago.
The steep appreciation of the yen in the last few months has kept the
dollar-denominated surplus stubbornly high, as the value of the country's
exports has risen rapidly.
The politically troublesome surplus with the US was Dollars 5.6bn last
month, up 20 per cent on a year ago. A Ministry of Finance official
attributed the sharp rise to the high yen and the strength of the US
recovery. He noted that the rate of growth was slowing, but said prospects
in the next few months would depend on developments in the currency markets.
The most important factor in the long-term movement of the trade balance,
however, is the pace of Japan's economic growth. The government's Economic
Planning Agency (EPA) yesterday gave a slightly more upbeat assessment of
growth prospects, although once again it refused to state unequivocally that
a recovery was under way.
In its monthly report it contented itself with observing that 'bright spots
have been spreading lately and there are movements towards pulling out of
the slump - but gradually'. Its reluctance formally to declare a recovery
contrasts with the assessment of the Bank of Japan, whose governor, Mr
Yasushi Mieno, on Wednesday repeated its view that the economy was 'headed
for recovery'.
Yesterday an EPA official said 'the situation is not such that the word
'recovery' can be used,' citing continuing weakness in capital spending and
uncertainty about the yen.
Meanwhile, corporate bankruptcies declined last month by 0.3 per cent from a
year earlier, according to figures published yesterday by the Teikoku
Databank, a private credit research agency. Total cases fell to 1,126, the
first year-on-year drop for four months.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Airlines face dogfight over new staff contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese Transport Ministry is threatening a confrontation with the
country's airlines over their plans to hire most new flight attendants on
short-term contracts at sharply lower wage levels.
The airlines, pushed into losses by the domestic recession, the high yen and
a worldwide decline in demand for first and business class seats, are
anxious to cut costs.
In the past few years they have stepped up recruitment of foreign cabin
crew, who are commonly paid a fraction of what their Japanese colleagues
earn. Now they aim to hire Japanese, largely for domestic routes, who would
be paid by the hour and could not expect to earn more than a third of the
salary paid to their colleagues.
The move is a further erosion of Japan's system of lifetime employment. The
contract staff who, although described as part-timers would usually work a
full week, could be shed and rehired as traffic demands.
Mr Shizuka Kamei, transport minister, said after a cabinet meeting yesterday
that co-operation between regular cabin crew and the contract recruits could
be disrupted during an in-flight emergency. He said the airlines should
rather look for savings among ground staff and warned the ministry could
retaliate, for example by refusing applications to open new routes.
Mr Michihiko Matsuo, the ministry's top civil servant, sought to dilute his
warning, saying the ministry could not regulate employment at airlines and
did not intervene in labour issues.
By invoking the issue of onboard safety, Mr Kamei has distressed the airline
industry. Japan Airlines said yesterday: 'Our plans to employ part-time
stewardesses pay very close attention to safety and security. We will study
any recommendation from the ministry.'
JAL has begun advertising for what it says would be an initial 100 contract
flight attendants - all women - who would be based in Japan and would serve
domestic routes. This number would eventually rise. The airline has some
6,000 full-time Japanese cabin attendants, but hopes to reduce these to
4,600 by 1998 in a drive to cut its total staff to 17,000 from a level of
nearly 22,000.
Japan moved further yesterday towards deregulating its domestic rice market
when a government advisory council called for a wartime law controlling
production and distribution of the staple to be scrapped. The government is
expected to accept the broad findings of the Agricultural Policy Council.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Iran simmers with discontent: Rafsanjani is seen to have
lost control at home and abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While international attention has again focused on Iran in the wake of bomb
attacks against Israeli targets in London and Buenos Aires, the government
of President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has been facing increasing
violence and unrest at home.
Earlier this month riots broke out in Qazvin, an industrial city 50km north
of Tehran, ostensibly over the rejection by the Iranian parliament of a
proposal to allow the city of 1m people to become an autonomous province,
devolved from that of Zanjan.
The unrest, which resulted in at least four deaths, was so serious that Mr
Ali Mohammad Besharati, interior minister, was forced to visit Qazvin and
pledge that, as a comprise, it would be separated from Zanjan and included
in Tehran province instead.
The most spectacular violence occurred in June, when a huge bomb exploded at
the country's most important Shia religious shrine - the mausoleum of Imam
Reza in the holy north-eastern city of Mashhad - killing dozens of people.
The bomb was possibly in revenge for the earlier destruction of a Sunni
mosque by the authorities which triggered serious riots in the eastern town
of Zahedan, with its large Sunni population. Potentially the most serious
incident of the year occured in February when a gunman fired shots at Mr
Rafsanjani, who was unwounded, at Friday prayers.
The emergence of ethnic and religious divisions was further underlined
earlier in the year, with the mysterious murders of a number of Christian
priests. First, Mr Haik Hovsepian Mehr, the head of the small evangelical
Assemblies of God, was killed in January, followed in June by his successor,
Mr Tateos Michaelian, and then by a younger priest and convert to
Christianity, Mr Mehdi Dibaj, in July.
The government has denied involvement and has sought to pin the blame for
all these acts of violence on the country's largest and most organised
opposition group, the Iraqi-based Mojahedin-e Khalq.
The violence caused by the public challenge to the government's authority
reflects the confusion and lack of coherence in the government's
implementation of policy. Mr Rafsanjani, who was elected president for a
second four-year term just over a year ago, has been widely credited with
shaping a more pragmatic face for the Islamic Republic. A shrewd political
operator, Mr Rafsanjani understood that Iran's interests were not best
served by confrontation with its pro-Western Arab neighbours or the rest of
the world.
After Ayatollah Khomeini's death in 1989, he set out to revise some of the
central policies of the earlier revolutionary era. One of the mistakes he
declared, was for Iran to have made so many enemies, leaving it friendless
and isolated in the eight-year war which followed the Iraqi invasion.
Yet, five years after Khomeini's death, Iran's foreign policy, while not in
tatters, can hardly be judged a success. Four Iranian diplomats are being
sought for questioning by Argentina over the Buenos Aires bomb, which killed
nearly 100 people last month.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, has again described Iran
as an 'international outlaw' and has renewed pressure on Iran's main trading
partners, Germany and Japan, to scale down commercial ties with Tehran.
Success has been no more forthcoming domestically, where Mr Rafsanjani
sought to place the need to rebuild the economy at the top of the political
agenda, in stark contrast to Ayatollah Khomeini.
But for all the attention given to the economy, it is arguably at its nadir,
with high inflation, a mounting debt burden and a shortage of foreign
currency earnings caused by the weakness of oil prices. Rising inflation has
also placed a heavy burden on many increasingly resentful Iranians.
With so many of the foreign and economic policy goals set in the early
Rafsanjani years either waylaid or unsuccessfully targeted, the government
appears to lacks direction and has been impotent in its efforts to weld
together the multiplicity of power centres of which it is comprised.
The public perception of Mr Rafsanjani, who has adopted a much lower
profile, is that he has lost control at home and abroad, so the challenge to
his authority is likely to continue and may even intensify.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Paris plays down terrorist risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France yesterday extended its curbs on Islamic militants but played down the
threat of domestic terrorist attacks in reprisal for security measures which
include the internment of more than 20 suspected Algerian radicals.
Mr Charles Pasqua, interior minister, said the risk of terrorist attacks was
greater outside France. 'We do not believe there is a direct terrorist
threat in France linked to the events in Algeria, but it is clear that we
have to take precautions', he told Le Figaro newspaper.
Mr Pasqua's comments coincided with a warning from the Armed Islamic Group
(GIA), a radical Algerian Moslem group which claimed responsibility for
killing five French nationals in Algiers earlier this month, that France
would face 'violent attacks on its interests in Algeria' if it failed to
meet various conditions.
The conditions included evacuating all French citizens from Algeria and
ending support for the military-led government. The GIA also ordered France
to protect Moslem rights in its national territory.
In France, more than 3,000 people were stopped on Thursday night, taking the
six-day tally to about 16,000. Eleven individuals were being questioned as
part of the latest checks, according to officials. Twenty-two suspected
Moslem militants are being interned at an army barracks.
Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, endorsed Mr Pasqua's handling of
the police action but sought to distance himself from the interior
minister's hardline analysis of the Algerian situation.
Mr Juppe denied France gave unconditional support to the Algiers regime and
said he had urged the government to hold elections as soon as possible. The
Algerian government cancelled an election in 1992 which the now outlawed
Islamic Salvation Front was set to win.
Mr Pasqua has argued that the only choice in Algeria is to support the
existing government or see the country fall into the hands of extremists.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Beating the big freeze in Ulan Bator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Having hauled equipment 8,000km across the former Soviet Union under armed
guard, an Anglo-German joint venture is racing against time to beat the big
freeze in an attempt to modernise Mongolia's only international airport at
Ulan Bator.
In two months it will be too cold to work outside. Before then the
contractors - Wimpey of the UK and Philipp Holzmann of Germany - must
reassemble some of their 500 tonnes of construction equipment, knowing that
the nearest spares are seven time zones away.
The equipment for the airport, including a 140 tonne British asphalt mixing
plant cut into component parts and accompanied by armed guards, took 16 days
to travel from Kosice in Slovakia to the Mongolian capital.
The parts need to be welded back together before contractors can start
resurfacing the 3,200 metre runway. But the intense cold is just one of the
problems which will have to be overcome by the two companies which won the
Dollars 31m (Pounds 20m) contract.
Almost all the equipment and materials needed to resurface the runway,
overhaul aircraft taxi and parking areas, construct a new control tower and
refurbish the airport terminal will need to be imported.
The asphalt mixing plant and other construction equipment and spares, much
of it used by Wimpey on an airport contract in Slovakia, was transported in
two trains. A mobile crane, on a defective truck, is still making slow
progress through Siberia. The rest of the equipment, including electric
generators to augment the shaky Mongolian power supply, has arrived safely.
The rifle-toting guards, veterans of the Afghan war, were customary on
freight trains crossing the former Soviet Union, said Mr Nick Connor,
general manager of Wimpey Asphalt's overseas division. In this case, the
only pilfering that occurred was inside Slovakia when lights for night
working and a small electric motor were stolen.
Night work, out of doors, will become impossible by mid-September. By the
end of October all outside work will halt until spring. Resurfacing the
runway, due to be completed by the end of this year, must start in the next
fortnight if the timetable is to be met.
Agreements have still to be reached with Russian oil refineries which,
because of shortages in Mongolia, will have to supply 2,000 tonnes of
bitumen for asphalt as well as 500 tonnes of diesel and 150 tonnes of
petrol. Even propane gas used to heat asphalt laying pavers will need to be
imported.
Negotiations are taking place with four refineries. The nearest is at
Krasnoyarsk in Siberia, 800km from Ulan Bator. The farthest is 8,000km away
at Ukhta close to the Artic circle.
One of the problems for the contractors is that 86 per cent of the finance
for the project comes from the Asian Development Bank which stipulates that
purchases of equipment and materials can be made only from member countries,
which excludes Russia.
The contract also involves moving Russian-built navigation equipment to work
alongside newly purchased western navigation aids. Engineers, employed by an
east German sub-contractor with experience of Russian equipment, will work
on the project.
Slovakian engineers who worked with Wimpey in Slovakia will help train
Mongolian construction workers who cost Dollars 150 (Pounds 96.70) a month
in pay and keep compared with Dollars 6,500 a month for a European worker.
That was 40 Mongolians for the price of one European, Mr Connor pointed out.
'There is no way we could complete the job for this price without using
local labour. At the peak we will employ about 200 workers, of which three
quarters will be Mongolian.'
Plant is a different matter. Most local equipment comes from the former
Soviet Union. In terms of technical sophistication and reliability it is
20-30 years behind that used in the west, the Wimpey boss said.
Ulan Bator has a population of some 600,000 people of which about half live
in yurts, the traditional tent-like home of the nomadic Mongolian people.
Expatriate construction workers, however, will be housed in flats connected
to the Russian hospital where Wimpey and Holzmann have their offices.
The hospital needs to raise finance to remain operational and is renting out
part of its space to commercial concerns. It will also provide medical
insurance at Dollars 20 per person to Wimpey and Holzmann.
Both companies plan to bid for further work in Mongolia with several large
road contracts expected to go to international tender. After the struggle of
getting its equipment to Ulan Bator, Wimpey hopes not to have to haul it so
far for the next job.

FT  13 AUG 94 / US decides that sharing is better than warring: Washington
will supply N Korea with water-cooled reactors made in the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unlikely as it may seem, the US is to supply advanced nuclear technology to
North Korea to stop its atomic bomb project. This may appear like helping an
alcoholic by giving him a bottle of Scotch, but it could be the best way to
resolve the dispute.
The joint statement from North Korea and the US after talks in Geneva this
week contained a US pledge to supply the Koreans with water-cooled reactors
and agreement by Pyongyang to shut down its gas-cooled graphite stations and
to 'forgo reprocessing' of spent uranium fuel rods which the west fears pose
a radiation risk.
The difference between the two types of reactor is important because
water-cooled reactors would make it more difficult to start an illicit
nuclear weapons programme.
Nuclear reactors produce energy for electricity by splitting uranium atoms
and releasing heat. They can also be used to produce material for atomic
weapons because other nuclear reactions occur in the fuel rods of a reactor.
One of the most important is the conversion of uranium into plutonium - a
man-made element which can be used as the explosive in atomic bombs.
All reactors produce this plutonium, but the kind which is most explosive in
atomic bombs is called Plutonium-239. This is made in the early months that
the uranium fuel is in use. Once the fuel has been in the reactor for some
time, the Plutonium-239 is itself converted into other forms of the same
element called Plutonium-240 and Plutonium-241, which are much less
explosive.
So to make atomic weapons, the nuclear fuel is ideally only used in a
reactor for a few months, taken out and the constituents chemically
separated. The nearly-pure Plutonium-239 is then available for bombs.
Graphite reactors - such as used by the North Koreans and by the UK for
nuclear weapons manufacture - often have their fuel in the reactor for a
much shorter time than in water-cooled reactors, the type used for power
production by the US and France . This is because they use less expensive
fuel which loses its reactive qualities more quickly. They therefore tend to
produce more weapons-type plutonium than water-cooled reactors.
Water-cooled reactors use a more expensive fuel which is pepped-up or
'enriched' with the more reactive form of uranium. They can thus run for
much longer between fuel changes and indeed must do so if the extra cost of
the fuel is to be justified. As a result, water-cooled reactors produce
plutonium which has a much lower content of the explosive form.
Graphite reactors are also easier to shut and restart than water-cooled, and
the fuel can be removed more quickly. An operator who wanted to skirt
international restrictions would find it hard to disguise from international
inspectors the minimum four-or five-day shutdown a water reactor requires
for refuelling.
If North Korea uses water-cooled reactors they will produce less
bomb-quality plutonium and will be easier to monitor, but there are several
snags and loopholes.
First, building a water reactor to meet North Korea's electricity
requirements will be expensive. The plant would be about half the size of
the recently-completed Sizewell B plant in Suffolk, England, which cost more
than Pounds 2bn. It is far from clear who would pay to build one, still less
certain what message this would send to other potential weapons states.
It is also possible, if uneconomic and more difficult, for North Korea to
cheat using a water-cooled reactor. Furthermore the North Koreans have
enough used graphite reactor fuel to make several atomic bombs which would
have to come under international controls. If the International Atomic
Energy Agency, the body responsible for monitoring, does not get a free hand
to inspect all Korean facilities, Pyongyang could restart a small weapons
reactor elsewhere or convert plutonium it has hidden into weapons.
But without appropriate inspection arrangements, promising western high-tech
goods to the Koreans may not lift the threat of a clandestine nuclear state
developing.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Storm at Bastille sinks its conductor: Paris opera house
rocked by last-minute dismissal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Yet another drama has unfolded at the scandal-scarred Opera Bastille in
Paris with the dismissal yesterday of Mr Myung Whun Chung, the acclaimed
South Korean conductor, as its artistic director only a month before the
start of its new season.
Mr Chung won praise at the Bastille for productions such as Shostakovitch's
Macbeth. However, his tenure in Paris has been clouded by the
highly-publicised problems of the Bastille.
It has fared well in terms of attendance but has been plagued by strikes and
financial difficulties since its glittering opening by President Francois
Mitterrand as a state-of-the-art 'people's opera' on the 200th anniversary
of the 1789 French revolution.
The departure of Mr Chung, 41, who joined the Bastille five years ago
following the firing of Mr Daniel Barenboim, the Israeli-born conductor,
ends weeks of wrangling between him and the Paris Opera's new management
team led by Mr Hugues Gall. Mr Gall is a former bureaucrat who was appointed
director-designate last summer after the election victory of Mr Edouard
Balladur's centre-right government.
Mr Chung had been brought into the Bastille by Mr Gall's predecessor, Mr
Pierre Berge, feisty head of the Yves Saint-Laurent fashion house and a
close friend of Mr Mitterrand.
The appointment of Mr Gall, whose operatic empire includes the 19th century
Garnier opera house and Opera-Comique as well as the brand new FFr3bn
(Pounds 360m) Bastille, immediately sparked speculation about the Korean's
future.
The behind-the-scenes battle between the two men came out into the open on
Thursday when Le Monde newspaper published an interview with Mr Chung.
The conductor claimed that the new management was trying to curb his
artistic freedom and to change the terms of his contract, which was to run
until the year 2000 with a sliding scale salary rising to FFr8m in his final
year.
Although Mr Chung told Le Monde that he would be willing to make 'a
significant financial sacrifice' to stay at the Bastille, he made it quite
clear that he was not willing to relinquish his power over the choice of
productions or artistes.
However, Mr Gall has made no secret of his intention to exercise full
authority over every aspect of the Paris Opera's activities.
The Opera yesterday issued a formal statement saying that it had terminated
Mr Chung's employment because he had rejected all its proposals to shorten
his contract. The Korean was said to be considering legal action.
Mr Gall now faces the challenge of getting to grips with all of the
Bastille's problems, as well as pressing ahead with his plan to shed 119 of
the Paris Opera's 1,700 staff and preparing for the start of the Bastille's
new season on September 19 without an artistic director.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Berlusconi preaches optimism on TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, last night sought to reassure
Italians and foreign investors about the political and economic health of
the country following another turbulent day on currency, bond and equity
markets.
In a series of television interviews, Mr Berlusconi said Italy was
functioning better than ever, and dismissed the idea of fresh elections only
three months after the mould-breaking poll which installed a new political
regime.
A smiling Mr Berlusconi criticised politicians and pundits on the left,
disgruntled after losing the March election, for pulling against the
interests of the country.
He said he also hoped soon to meet his coalition partner Mr Umberto Bossi,
head of the populist Northern League, who has continued to attack the prime
minister. 'There are certain people who are making irresponsible
declarations, and this is serious,' Mr Berlusconi said.
On Thursday the Bank of Italy unexpectedly increased interest rates by half
a point, to defend the currency. Analysts have also interpreted the rise as
a strong hint from the central bank that the government should act soon to
tackle the country's budget deficit.
The attempt to protect the lira appeared to have backfired yesterday, with
the currency slipping to nearly L1,030 against the D-Mark. At the beginning
of the week it stood at less than L1,000 against the German currency.
Equity and bond markets were also hit hard by the rise, the first since the
September 1992 crisis of the European exchange rate mechanism. At one point
Milan stocks had slipped by more than 5 per cent on the day, but the Comit
index recovered to close at 644.43, down 3.7 per cent. Meanwhile, the yield
on the 10-year benchmark bond rose to 11.73, up from 11.39 on Thursday. The
markets are closed in Italy on Monday.
Confindustria, the Italian industry federation, was sharply critical of the
Bank of Italy's move yesterday, warning that it 'runs the risk on the one
hand of failing to eliminate uncertainty on the markets, and on the other of
feeding a negative spiral of rate rises'.
The markets also had to digest an interview with Mr Berlusconi, conducted
midweek and published yesterday by the International Herald Tribune, in
which he admitted that executives of his Fininvest business paid bribes to
tax officials. However, he played down the scale and importance of the
bribes, which were authorised by his brother Paolo, who is under
investigation in Milan.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Investors count cost of diamond rush: Few winners after
Canadian prospecting frenzy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shock has hit hundreds of investors on the Toronto and Vancouver stock
exchanges in the past week. In just two days, more than half a billion
dollars was wiped from the value of exploration companies which have been
involved for three years in a diamond rush over an area almost as big as the
UK in Canada's Northwest Territories.
The sell-off was triggered by an announcement from Kennecott, the US
subsidiary of the UK mining group RTZ, that samples from one much-touted
kimberlite pipe do not contain enough precious stones to justify further
exploration.
The international mining community was caught off guard. Kennecott had
carried out its tests in utmost secrecy at a gold mine near Yellowknife, the
Northwest Territories' rough, boisterous mining centre. It refused even to
share progress reports with its partners in the project. 'We were absolutely
dumbstruck,' says Mr John Hainey, mining analyst at Canaccord Capital, a
Toronto securities firm.
Kennecott's shell-shocked junior partners watched their share prices dive by
as much as 85 per cent. Three of them - Dentonia Resources, Horseshoe Gold
Mining and Kettle River Resources - were worth a combined CDollars 178m
(Pounds 83m) the day before Kennecott dropped its bombshell. Two days later,
their market value had shrivelled to just CDollars 30m. The three companies
have called off a planned merger.
The Great Canadian Diamond Rush thus passes into history as another sobering
reminder of how the merest whiff of riches under the ground can sweep
entrepreneurs, hard-nosed analysts and gullible investors off their feet.
Any geologist will confirm that the chances of finding enough diamonds to
justify more than one mine in a single area are never high. Diamonds are
found in the greyish rock known as kimberlite. But only about one out of
every 200 kimberlite pipes contain diamonds, and no more than one in 20 of
those has enough big stones to justify a mine.
Such long odds did not discourage exploration companies from flocking to the
Northwest Territories, nor analysts from recommending their shares, in the
ambiguous phrase of one recent report, as a 'strong speculative buy'.
Mr Hainey invokes a gambling metaphor. 'The prize is so high,' he says.
'People are prepared to put their money into the lottery.' As with a
lottery, one big winner will probably yet emerge from the Northwest
Territories. A consortium of Australia's BHP Minerals and its Canadian
partner, Dia-Met Minerals, is expected to start construction early next year
on a mine near Lac de Gras, about 300km north-east of Yellowknife. On
present indications, the mine will be one of the world's premier diamond
producers.
The story of BHP and Dia-Met's achievement is perhaps even more impressive
than Kennecott's disaster.
The Northwest Territories presents unusual challenges for men and machines.
The vast expanse of treeless tundra is covered by snow and ice for more than
half the year, with temperatures dropping so low in mid-winter that trucks
and machinery must be kept running around the clock to prevent their engines
freezing. A shovel's metal blade becomes so brittle that it is liable to
snap when weight is put on it.
Diamond fever in the Frozen North goes back to the early 1980s. Mr Hugo
Dummett, a geologist working for Superior Oil, was tipped off by a bush
pilot that De Beers, which controls the world diamond market, was
prospecting near the Mackenzie River.
Under cover of darkness, Mr Dummett and Mr Charles Fipke, a Canadian
geologist and Dia-Met's founder, landed a helicopter close to the De Beers
lakeside camp and picked up eight or nine samples of their own.
Superior Oil got out of mining exploration after it was bought by Mobil, the
US energy group. But Mr Fipke continued the search, slowly moving eastward
towards the source of the vast ice sheet which scraped up - and then
deposited - metal-bearing rocks across northern Canada millions of years
ago.
The long search almost broke Dia-Met. Mr Fipke recalled in an interview last
year that several big mining companies which he approached for funds 'turned
us down flat'.
Several fellow-directors at Dia-Met walked out. By 1987, only Mr Fipke's son
and a pilot were left to help him sample the kimberlite outcrops.
In the meantime however, Mr Dummett moved to BHP. He persuaded his new
Australian bosses to form a joint venture with Dia-Met in 1990.
The breakthrough came a year later, about 600km east of the Mackenzie River.
Samples from a kimberlite pipe beneath Point Lake yielded 101 carats of
diamonds, equal to about 70 carats per 100 tonnes, which is well above the
grade normally required to justify a mine.
Dia-Met's success set off the prospecting frenzy. Claims covering 53m acres
(81,700 square miles) have been staked in the Lac de Gras area over the past
three years.
Mr Gordon Stewart, whose Yellowknife-based company ferries supplies to
remote mining camps, estimates that business has 'very easily doubled'. His
company has arranged over 2,000 supply flights over the past 12 months.
Subsequent work by BHP and Dia-Met around Lac de Gras unearthed even richer
deposits than Point Lake. The two companies have advanced to a full
feasibility study which should be completed around the end of the year. If
all goes to plan, the BHP-Dia-Met mine will be in production by 1997.
Anyone who shared Mr Fipke's early optimism has made a fortune. Dia-Met
shares, which were trading at around 70 cents in August 1991, soared to a
peak of over CDollars 60 earlier this year, when they were split
two-for-one.
As the company with the best chance of developing a mine, Dia-Met was
relatively unscathed by last week's crash. Its subordinate voting shares
currently change hands at about CDollars 17. From being close to bankruptcy,
Mr Fipke, who appears in Dia-Met's latest annual report wearing his
favourite weather-beaten brown jersey and blue jeans, is now worth CDollars
120m.
Hopes for a second Lac de Gras diamond mine had been pinned on the Kennecott
joint venture. But Kennecott, which came to the NWT relatively late, was
more impatient and less deliberate than BHP. 'They showed up with a blank
cheque book and signed up everybody close to the to Dia-Met claim block,'
recalls a geologist at one rival company.
Kennecott also cut corners in its bid to catch up to the Australians. While
BHP gradually increased the size of its samples, the US company went
straight from a small 2-tonne sample to a costly, underground programme
involving about 5,000 tonnes.
With Kennecott and its partners now licking their wounds, attention has
shifted back to De Beers. The South African group recently signed a
tentative agreement with two junior exploration companies, Tanqueray
Resources and Mill City Gold, which are confident that they have a promising
prospect at Yamba Lake, north-west of Lac de Gras.
De Beers has taken samples from Yamba Lake to its laboratories in South
Africa for further tests. It is due to decide in the next few weeks whether
to press ahead with the joint venture. The question however, is whether
investors who have suffered heavy losses are in any mood to put more money
into the Lac de Gras diamond play. Last week's setback could deprive many
small companies of the capital they need to continue their search.
Mr Stewart, whose Yellowknife supplies business has profited handsomely from
the boom, is among those who has lost heavily on his investments.
Despite the setback however, it probably would not take much to revive the
irrepressible confidence (some would call it greedy recklessness) which is a
hallmark of mining exploration. Another speculative bubble could quickly
appear if De Beers or one of the other companies makes another encouraging
find.
News of the Kennecott debacle was only a few hours old when mining analysts
at Credit Lyonnais Laing in London were advising clients that 'any fall in
the share price of (De Beers' new partners) must be considered a strong
buying opportunity.' By the middle of this week, many of the junior
companies' shares were starting to creep back up again.

Confirmation of Spain's gradual recovery from economic recession coincided
yesterday with a slight resurgence in the headline inflation rate. A 0.4 per
cent rise in consumer prices in July brought the year-on-year rate back up
to 4.8 per cent from 4.7 per cent in June. The government target of 3.5 per
cent for the year is increasingly less likely to be met. Fresh food prices
climbed by 1 per cent in the month. The underlying rate - excluding volatile
food and energy prices - was more moderate at 0.2 per cent in the month,
bringing the annual increase down from 4.4 to 4.3 per cent. The Bank of
Spain said growth was over 1 per cent in the second quarter compared with
the same period last year.

US consumer prices in July rose by a subdued 0.3 per cent, the same increase
as in the previous month, according to a Labour Department report out
yesterday. As with the wholesale price index published on Thursday, higher
energy and coffee prices were the main components in the rise. The core rate
in July - excluding food and energy - went up by just 0.2 per cent, lower
than the 0.3 per cent recorded in each of the two previous months. The CPI
now has risen at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent so far this year, suggesting
no undue inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, the markets still expect the
Federal Reserve to raise short term interest rates next week, probably by
0.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Swedish krona weakened ominously yesterday despite Thursday's surprise
increase in interest rates by the central bank aimed at stiffening the
currency and halting signs of resurgent inflation. The combination of rising
interest rates and a sagging currency heightened fears that Sweden, carrying
a huge budget deficit and spiralling public debt, is entering a vicious
cycle in which high interest rates deepen the deficit in the public sector,
which in turn weakens the krona and ultimately leads to greater borrowing
requirements. The krona slipped below SKr5 to the D-Mark to end the day at
SKr5.018 and was also weaker against an Ecu-denominated index. The index
rose by 0.45 to stand at 128.99. Meanwhile, the Stockholm stock exchange
fell by more than 1.8 per cent for the second day and market interest rates
continued to increase.
Support for Sweden's bid to join the European Union has increased
significantly, cutting the lead held by the anti-Brussels camp in the EU
referendum campaign to its smallest margin for months, an opinion poll
published yesterday showed. The Gallup poll in Expressen newspaper, the
first on the EU issue since before the July holiday, showed the Yes vote
rising three points to 38 per cent from a similar poll in June, while the No
vote slipped one point to 40 per cent. The result is a boost for the
right-centre coalition government and the opposition Social Democratic
party, which are campaigning for a Yes vote in the November 13 referendum.

Germany's opposition Social Democrats yesterday fleshed out their plans for
drastic tax changes if they win the October election, promising to scrap the
government's 7.5 per cent 'solidarity surcharge' to pay for unification at
their first cabinet meeting. They are also promising a big increase in child
allowances at once, and a rise in the tax threshold from 1996. The two first
measures would come into effect almost immediately - by January 1. To pay
for the cuts, higher earners, with more than DM60,000 (Pounds 24,800) a year
taxable income, will have to pay a 10 per cent income tax surcharge, and
married couples will lose some tax benefits. Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the
party's economy and finance spokesman, said the whole package amounted to
DM75bn in tax changes, with a neutral effect on revenues, but big benefits
for the great majority of low-paid wage earners.

The US Department of Agriculture estimated yesterday that next year's coffee
crop in Brazil would be reduced by between 30 and 40 per cent because of
damage caused by recent sharp frosts. The USDA put next year's crop at
17m-20m bags, higher than Brazil's own assessment of 17m bags made in
mid-July. It compares with US expectations of a Brazilian crop totalling 26m
bags this year. Ms Judy Ganes, soft commodities analyst at Merrill Lynch in
New York, said the USDA's figures were well within the market's
expectations. 'The market has been discounting a pretty bearish number so,
if anything, it could cause prices to bounce a bit,' she said. Coffee
futures prices in London and New York fell by about 10 per cent this week on
expectation that the US assessment would judge the Brazilian crop to be in
better health than expected. Prices in London closed at Dollars 3,273 a
tonne on Friday after a day of nervous trading ahead of the report. Week in

FT  13 AUG 94 / Crime bill defeat will test durability of 'comeback kid':
President Bill Clinton must regroup quickly to minimise fallout after the
devastating House vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton promised to 'fight and fight and fight until we win
this battle for the American people' as the White House and the Democratic
leadership in Congress tried to regroup yesterday after their devastating
defeat in the House of Representatives on the crime bill.
But the vote dealt an immediate knock-on blow to Mr Clinton's most cherished
objective of healthcare reform, when House leaders decided at a late-night
meeting to delay debate on the health bill - possibly into September.
Cabinet secretaries scattered after an emergency meeting yesterday morning
for a lobbying blitz on Capitol Hill, while Mr Clinton himself flew to
Minneapolis - accompanied by Republican and Democratic mayors - to rally
support at a meeting of the National Association of Police Organisations.
'We are going out now - the cabinet, mayors of both parties, citizens of
both parties all across this country - to say that this crime bill cannot
die,' Mr Clinton said as he boarded the presidential Boeing 747 on his way
to Minneapolis.
Congressional leaders scrambled to negotiate changes to the crime bill,
which includes measures such as gun control, more police and the 'three
strikes and out' rule imposing mandatory life sentences on repeat offenders.
The bill was blocked on Thursday evening as the Republican leadership and
the gun lobby linked to defeat by 225 votes to 210 a procedural motion for
debate to begin. But Mr Thomas Foley, Speaker of the House, predicted it
would be brought back to the floor and win passage next week.
Nevertheless, Thursday's surprising setback - despite furious lobbying from
the president - has already started to ripple wider.
Unless the White House can win back the initiative on both crime and
healthcare in the next few weeks, Mr Clinton's entire presidency could
become bogged down. If he cannot win in this Congress he is less likely to
do so after November's congressional elections, when the Democrats seem
certain to lose seats and could even lose their majorities in one or other
chamber.
'We're at a turning point both in the administration and in the country,'
said Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary and an old friend of the president.
No one expects a healthcare reform bill to pass by more than a handful of
votes, but members will be less inclined to stick their necks out on a
difficult vote for the president after his defeat on crime.
Until now Mr Clinton and his allies could always say he had pulled off
crucial votes such as his budget last year, or the North American Free Trade
Agreement. Now, however, the label of loser will be harder to shed.
Abroad, Mr Clinton has still not extricated himself from the complications
of Haiti, Bosnia, Cuba and Rwanda. Any of these could blow up in the weeks
ahead.
Nor does the vote bode well for the promise of a more disciplined and
focused White House under the new chief of staff, Mr Leon Panetta, whose
long experience as a member of Congress was expected to help the
administration on Capitol Hill.
Congress already faces a crowded agenda before it goes home for November's
elections, in which the entire House and one third of the Senate must face
the voters. Other bills are now likely to be simply pushed off the calendar,
while even crime and health legislation could simply run out of time.
This is scarcely auspicious for Democratic members of Congress, many of whom
are already seeking to distance themselves from Mr Clinton. Now they will
have no crime bill to wave in front of their constituents, and they must
face the charge that, despite a majority in both houses of Congress, they
are unable to deliver.
The vote is not without peril for the Republicans, however, some of whom are
nervous at the prospect of returning to their districts to face criticism
for having blocked the anti-crime legislation. At the same time, Republicans
risk being viewed as obstructionists and agents of gridlock.
Mr Reich said yesterday that Mr Clinton was 'as usual, resilient', while Ms
Donna Shalala, secretary of health and human services, said the entire
cabinet was 'riled up and enthusiastic'. Nevertheless, rebounding from this
defeat will be hard, even though Mr Clinton loves to call himself 'the
comeback kid'.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Milosevic stands by Bosnia blockade: Serbian leader hopes
enforcing the boycott will bring an end to sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first, it seemed another Machiavellian manoeuvre to hoodwink the
international community. But a week into Belgrade's embargo against the
self-styled Bosnian Serb state, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia
appears to be carrying out his decision to isolate his former proteges over
their rejection of the international peace plan.
In May 1993, when Bosnian Serb leaders spurned his efforts to promote the
Vance-Owen peace plan, the embargo he threatened was forgotten within days
of being announced.
However - at least for now - Belgrade's move seems genuine. Except for a
handful of lorries, transport to Bosnian Serb-held land has ground to a
halt. Financial transactions are blocked. Most telephone connections have
been cut. The pliant state media no longer vilify the west for 'unjust
sanctions'. Instead commentaries blame the war profiteering and bellicose
politics of Bosnian Serb leaders for sanctions against Yugoslavia.
Mr Milosevic has not had it all his own way on the propaganda front. Pale,
the Bosnian Serb stronghold, calls it betrayal - anathema to a population
fed a steady diet of nationalism over the past three years of war. The
Serbian Orthodox Church this week also accused Mr Milosevic of treachery.
However, after more than a week of aggressive television propaganda, public
opinion in the distorted political landscape of Serbia is now widely in
favour of the plan which calls on Bosnian Serbs to concede a third of the 70
per cent of Bosnia they currently control. At the same time, surveys suggest
that many Serbs who support the plan oppose the embargo against their
Bosnian kith and kin.
Tired after three years of war in neighbouring Croatia and Bosnia, and more
than two years of UN sanctions, Serbia has been surprisingly quick to
embrace Mr Milosevic's turnaround in the hopes that peace will go
hand-in-hand with economic recovery.
Mr Milosevic claims peace is 'the single most important interest of the
Serbian people'.
The Serbian president over the past year paved the way for the final
showdown with the Bosnian Serbs. To get rid of extremists in Serbia, he
called early elections and unleashed a merciless smear campaign against his
erstwhile ultra-nationalist ally, Mr Vojislav Seselj, a deputy and
paramilitary leader.
He systematically purged nationalists from any position of power - the
ruling Socialists, the police and the Yugoslav army. He has replaced
nationalistic rhetoric with leftist nostalgia for former Yugoslavia. He had
a hand in the well-placed 'revelations' that Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic and his associates were involved in various criminal affairs,
depriving Serb citizens of millions of dollars.
Mr Milosevic is now looking to the west in the expectation that his gamble
to cut off the Bosnian Serbs will be rewarded with the easing of sanctions.
In Serbia, hopes have been raised that any day now the UN embargo could end.
Meanwhile, western governments and Russia have not yet formulated their
response to Mr Milosevic. They will most likely ask him to agree to the
despatch of UN monitors along the border between Serbia and Bosnia. In
return, they may offer the opening of the airport in Belgrade.
Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN mediator, yesterday met Mr Milosevic in
Belgrade in an apparent attempt to persuade Serbia to back the dispatch of
monitors to the 48 border crossings.
If Mr Milosevic continues the blockade, the Bosnian Serbs will have little
choice but to endorse the peace plan.
Aides to Mr Milosevic predict that Mr Karadzic will not hold out for more
than 10 days, claiming Bosnian Serb reserves are depleted.
Yet, despite their total isolation, Bosnian Serb leaders seem confident. The
thought that the war is nearly over appears far from their minds.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Italian grand prix cancelled
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fia, the governing body of world motor sport, yesterday decided to cancel
the 65th Italian grand prix, due to be contested on September 11, ending
weeks of uncertainty caused by a row between tree-hugging environmentalists
and road-hogging Formula One drivers. Environmental groups have been
protesting against proposals to fell more than 100 trees and extend the
gravel-filled safety lane at one fast right-hand bend on the track. Drivers
called for the improvement after the accident which killed Ayrton Senna at
the San Marino grand prix earlier this year. Various local and national
authorities failed to come to a final decision on whether trees or turbos
should have precedence, until yesterday, when Fia decided it had had enough
and cancelled the race. Mr Aldo Moltifiori, mayor of Monza and the grand
prix's strongest advocate locally, claimed direct and indirect earnings from
the grand prix amounted to L70bn a year, with 100 jobs depending directly on
the race, and a further 1,400 temporary employees helping on race day
itself.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Railtrack prepares to bypass union: Managers may seek swift
end to dispute with direct appeal to signalling workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack is finalising a strategy aimed at encouraging signalling staff to
defy their union's strike calls and bring a swift end to the nine-week
dispute.
Managers at the state-owned group are preparing to approach workers
individually and offer a substantial pay rise in return for accepting
flexible working practices.
The proposed shift in strategy emerged at the beginning of five days of
disruption on the rail network. Yesterday's one-day strike will be followed
by stoppages on Monday and Tuesday. Another 24-hour strike is due from noon
on Monday August 22.
Mr David Armstrong, Railtrack's industrial relations director, said
yesterday: 'The prospect of getting the RMT to make an agreement with us
while the signalling staff are still on strike is very slim indeed. Only
when the union leadership are given a clear message that the men want the
strikes to end will they return to the bargaining table.'
Mr Armstrong said he was reluctantly preparing an alternative strategy to
negotiating with the RMT which would involve putting the restructuring and
pay rise package to each individual signal worker for approval.
He would not be pressed on when the company would take such a step, but said
he thought time was 'running out fast'.
A similar strategy was adopted by British Rail in 1991 when, after failing
to secure the RMT's backing for a restructuring package for its signalling
and telecom engineers, BR went over the heads of the union and signed up 80
per cent of the workforce before the union finally agreed to accept the
deal.
Mr Armstrong said he was encouraged by the responses Railtrack had been
receiving from signalling staff on the company's telephone 'hotlines'. He
said: 'A significant number of workers want restructuring. Some would like
to take our package.'
Railtrack was not trying to precipitate a showdown with its signalling
workers, Mr Armstrong said. If they went on strike again they would not be
sacked and replaced. 'We don't want 4,500 unemployed signal staff. We want
them all back at work.'
In 1981, President Reagan was able to fire striking US civil air traffic
controllers because he could call on trained military air traffic
controllers to take over.
Such action was not possible on the British railway network, Mr Armstrong
said. It would take from eight to 13 weeks to train new signal staff and in
that time most of the network would have to be shut down.
However, he said there was no shortage of recruits willing to become signal
workers. 'We had two vacancies in the north-east recently and had over 2,000
applications,' he said.
'So much for the low pay and poor conditions of signal workers,' he added.
Railtrack will spend about Pounds 100,000 this weekend on full-page national
newspaper advertisements to make a direct appeal for public support in the
dispute.
The expense was immediately criticised by Mr Jimmy Knapp, rail union leader,
as 'a huge waste of money which would be better utilised trying to solve the
dispute'.
Earlier, Mr Knapp said that there was no need for a fresh ballot of signal
workers and accused Railtrack managers of 'sitting back in their bunker'.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Russia aids ailing industries with cheap Pounds 1.4bn loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin has granted Rbs3,500bn (about Pounds 1.4bn) in low
interest loans to aid Russian industry, raising doubts about the
government's ability to confront loss-making enterprises and to keep
spending limits agreed with the International Monetary Fund earlier this
year.
A decree issued late on Thursday just before Mr Yeltsin left on a tour of
the Volga region says the funds are to be divided between the defence sector
and 'investments' in heavy industry.
The ambiguously worded decree instructs the central bank to issue government
credits at one quarter of the prime lending rate.
'It is very disconcerting,' an official from a western financial institution
said yesterday. IMF economists are examining the decree, which western
analysts fear will be the first of many in a continuing but futile attempt
to bail out ailing companies.
About Rbs200bn is to be lent to the defence sector and Rbs400bn is earmarked
for industrial investment in the third quarter of 1994. An additional
Rbs900bn is to be lent by the government to the defence industry and
Rbs2,000bn is to be lent for investment in the fourth quarter of this year.
The low interest loans are the Russian government's most decisive step to
date in tackling the mounting corporate debts which threaten to overwhelm
the Russian economy. But it remains unclear whether the government will be
prepared to tackle the loss-making factories by allowing them to fail.
Mr Oleg Soskovets, deputy prime minister and head of a special commission
established last week to deal with the inter-enterprise debt issue,
yesterday estimated the crippling debt burden at Rbs87,800bn.
'The question of inter-enterprise debt cannot be solved through the issue of
credit,' Mr Soskovets said. However, he said 'we should, of course, make an
exception for defence industries'.
Debts have mounted as companies have failed to pay suppliers, and the
problem has worsened since the government tightened credit after its spring
agreement with the IMF. In some cases, companies have been unable to pay
their workers, raising the prospect of social unrest.
One western financial official said of the debt: 'It clearly cannot be
allowed to go on because otherwise it could lead to a total collapse of the
Russian economy.'
Mr Yeltsin's decree is a sign that the government may be departing from the
market reform path it appeared to choose earlier this year.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Getty son offers Pounds 1m to keep statue in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Paul Getty II, son of the late American oil billionaire, yesterday
pledged Pounds 1m to the appeal to keep Canova's statue of the Three Graces
in the UK - and prevent its sale to the Californian art museum founded by
his father.
On Tuesday Mr Stephen Dorrell, the heritage secretary, agreed to delay for
another three-months the granting of an export licence to the Getty Museum,
which has offered Pounds 7.6m for the statue, to enable British galleries
and museums to match that sum.
An appeal, led by the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and the National Galleries of
Scotland, had reached Pounds 5.8m and Mr Getty's Pounds 1m makes it much
more likely that the Three Graces will stay in Britain. Mr Timothy Clifford,
the director of the National Galleries of Scotland, said trustees and staff
were 'dancing with joy. I'm sure even the Graces are now wreathed in
smiles'.
Elizabeth Esteve-Coll, director of the V &amp; A, said: 'It gives huge impetus
to the campaign and will hearten all those who wish to see this marvellous
work retained in this country.'
If the campaign is successful, it will not be the first time John Paul Getty
II, a committed Anglophile who did not get on with his father, has
contributed to appeals to keep works of art in the UK and out of the Getty
Museum. He was instrumental in retaining a painting by Duccio in 1984 and a
bust by Bernini in 1986.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Canada to wind up insurer with British offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canadian government regulators are to wind up the country's fourth biggest
insurance company. They took control of Confederation Life Insurance, which
had corporate assets of CDollars 19bn (Pounds 9bn) at the end of 1993, after
the failure of protracted efforts to put together a bail-out package.
Confed has 250,000 policyholders in the UK. Its British arm includes one of
the biggest providers of pooled pension products to medium-sized companies,
and Confederation Bank, which offers residential mortgage loans and deposit
accounts.
The Canadian government said it moved in the interests of policyholders,
creditors and depositors, based on information that Confed's assets were not
sufficient to provide 'adequate protection'. The 123-year-old mutual company
is the latest victim of the slump in North American property markets.
Confed's collapse is likely to accelerate the shake-up in Canada's
overcrowded insurance market where margins have been squeezed by fierce
competition.
The company's offices in Canada and the UK will remain open for the time
being. Canadian policyholders and depositors are partly covered by the
insurance industry's consumer-protection fund, but are nonetheless expected
to suffer losses.
The UK arm said yesterday that it was conducting 'business as usual'. Confed
disclosed earlier this week that it was in talks to sell the UK operations
to an unidentified financial services group. The negotiations have been
taken over by the Canadian regulators and are expected to be concluded
shortly.
Canada's superintendent of financial institutions took control of Confed
late on Thursday. It will seek a court order to wind it up and liquidate its
assets.
The Canadian Life and Health Insurance Compensation Corporation, the
industry's protection fund, said Confed would continue to pay death claims
and retirement and disability benefits to Canadian policyholders. However,
these will be subject to specified ceilings.
Toronto-based Confed had sought an alliance for the past year with
Great-West Life Assurance of Winnipeg, which would have included a CDollars
225m capital injection. The search for a rescuer was widened to a group of
10 Canadian and US insurers last month when it became apparent that the
company required as much as CDollars 600m to survive. The group was unable
to agree, however, on how to divide Confed's assets and liabilities.
Confed suffered heavy capital losses as a result of commercial property
lending during the 1980s. It wrote off CDollars 232m in loan losses in 1992
and 1993, but still has more than CDollars 800m of non-performing loans on
its books. It had CDollars 33bn under management at the end of 1993.

Agrobanka, the Czech Republic's fifth biggest bank, posted a loss of Kcs3bn
(Dollars 107m) last year after making a big increase in loan-loss
provisions, to Kcs4bn. However, the bank said it had recovered in the first
half of the current year with a profit of Kcs99m.
The 1993 loss announced yesterday wiped out the bank's capital, leaving it
with a negative equity of Kcs400m and with a negative capital adequacy ratio
of -0.8 per cent.
The Czech National Bank, the central banking authority, has set a minimum
adequacy ration of 8 per cent.

Pernod Ricard, the French drinks group, said first-half consolidated

FFr7.79bn last year, Reuter reports from Paris.
Pernod noted that first-half 1993 sales were inflated by anticipatory
purchases ahead of a rise in alcohol taxes which took effect during July
1993. Strong foreign and non-alcoholic drink sales this year largely offset
this effect.

Taiwan is to co-operate with Singapore in the manufacture and launch of a
commercial satellite at a cost of USDollars 215m, the head of Taiwan's
Telecommunications Ministry said yesterday, Laura Tyson writes from Taipei.
Mr Steven Chen said contracts would be signed in October and the satellite
would be launched in three to four years. Because Taiwan is not a member of
the International Telecommunications Union, Singapore's orbit will be used.
The satellite would cover east and south-east Asia and China, he said. It
would have 24 transponders, shared equally between the two countries.
The aim is to meet fast-rising demand for satellites from local
broadcasters, television stations, defence and cable television. Seven
transponders have already been booked.

<TEXT>
Three hundred Islamic activists marched through Dhaka yesterday, demanding
that Taslima Nasrin, the feminist author who has fled to Sweden in fear for
her life, be brought back to Bangladesh and tried for blasphemy, AP reports
from Dhaka. The protest march was organised by a coalition of 13 Islamic
groups that want Ms Nasrin executed for a comment she allegedly made against
the Koran.
For two months, Ms Nasrin hid in Bangladesh to avoid death threats by
fundamentalists. She surrendered to a court in Dhaka on August 3 and was
granted bail and permitted to travel outside Bangladesh.
Ms Nasrin flew to Stockholm on Tuesday and is living at an undisclosed
location. 'The government has connived with the infidel in allowing her to
leave the country,' Mohiuddin Khan, a protest leader, said. Before Ms
Nasrin, 32, emerged from hiding, extremist groups organised large
demonstrations against her. But since then, the turnout at anti-Nasrin
rallies has been smaller.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Zaire's ministers 'paid Dollars 14,500 a month'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Zaire's previous government paid its ministers salaries of Dollars 12,500 to
Dollars 14,500 a month despite a financial crisis and grinding poverty, a
report ordered by Mr Kengo Wa Dondo, the new prime minister, says.
The salaries would be generous in a western country but in Zaire, where a
government clerical worker earns 17,000 zaires (Dollars 12) a month and an
ordinary soldier gets 5,000 zaires, they are stratospheric.
The report, passed to Reuters and confirmed by ex-ministers, also says
paymasters in the government of former prime minister, Mr Faustin Birindwa,
actually drew between two and three times the authorised salaries from the
Bank of Zaire and pocketed the difference before paying the cabinet.
Mr Kengo, appointed in June to head a government of national unity, has
promised to put an end to the corrupt practices that dogged past
administrations and to halt Zaire's financial collapse.
In Zaire, state office is traditionally viewed as an opportunity for
amassing personal wealth, a fact President Mobutu Sese Seko has publicly
acknowledged.
According to the document, dated July 26 and compiled by a former member of
Mr Birindwa's cabinet, deputy ministers were paid Dollars 12,500 a month,
ministers Dollars 13,500 and deputy prime ministers Dollars 14,500. No
figure is given for Birindwa.
The payments were awarded at a time when Zaire was nursing foreign debts of
Dollars 9.5bn and was shortly to have its voting rights at the International
Monetary Fund suspended for non-payment of arrears. Local economists
estimate the budget deficit for the first six months of 1994 at around
Dollars 60m.
Former members of Mr Birindwa's government confirmed the details given in
the report on Thursday, but said that during its 14 months in office only
nine pay cheques were delivered.
They also revealed how the inner circle in charge of payments made further
profits. Salaries were paid in zaires at an exchange rate chosen arbitrarily
by Mr Birindwa, which was well below the market level, often halving the
final dollar value.

<TEXT>
Demonstrators set up roadblocks in Goma, Zaire, yesterday, saying they were
fed up with thieving by some Zaire soldiers sent to help in the Rwandan
refugee crisis. At least six tractor-trailers bringing relief supplies to
nearby refugee camps were stranded at the border because they were unable to
navigate through the barricades.
Some refugees joined in as about 5,000 people filled the streets, throwing
stones and taunting police after a soldier shot and killed a local man who
had been changing money on the black market.
Goma has become increasingly tense since the refugees arrived in mid-July.
Most refugees have been moved to camps away from Goma but thousands still
live on the streets of the town. The soldiers have been accused of stealing
goods and extorting money from aid organisations.

Nitric acid contaminated with uranium from a US atomic weapons plant may be
reprocessed at Sellafield, Cumbria. Between 15 and 20 shipments a year are
proposed, together worth about Dollars 500m (Pounds 325m) to British Nuclear
Fuels.
The material would come from a closed US military reprocessing plant that is
being cleaned up under a programme to deal with sites contaminated by the
military.
UK government policy is that countries should handle their own waste and not
send it overseas. But BNFL said last night the material was not waste.
Uranium was regularly imported into the UK to make fuel for power stations.
'The import of uranium in the acid is no different as the acid will be
re-used and the separated uranium can also be re-used.'
The purified uranium would be owned by the US and would be stored at
Capenhurst, Cheshire

The number of people waiting for National Health Service treatment has risen
by more than 53,000 since the first quarter of last year, figures released
yesterday show.
Provisional figures for the quarter to the end of June also showed 64,178
were waiting between one and two years, up 0.1 per cent from the previous
three-month period. Those waiting two years and more - many for fertility
treatment - rose 7.2 per cent to 447 in the same period.
Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, hailed the figures as a success
and said the total of 64,625 people waiting for treatment for more than a
year was more than 1,000 fewer than in the first quarter of last year.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, condemned the rise and said the
true total on the waiting list - including those waiting for a first
appointment with a consultant - was more than 2.3m.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Severn Trent in urgent review of dangerous chemicals storage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Severn Trent Water is to carry out an urgent review of the storage of
hazardous chemicals near rivers following a pollution incident earlier this
year.
The review is one of 28 recommendations in a report commissioned by Severn
Trent after organic chemicals entered the River Severn after their discharge
into a sewer in Shropshire.
Up to 120,000 homes in the Worcester area were unable to use tap water for
more than two days in April. Severn Trent has paid out nearly Pounds 1m
compensation to residents who had to queue at water tankers.
The report, by Professor Ken Ives, identifies 'serious weaknesses' in the
system at the time of the incident. As criminal proceedings are pending, the
report contains no findings or recommendations concerning the origin of the
pollution.
The discharge passed undetected through a sewage treatment works at Wem and
entered the Severn through two small tributaries.
Four days later consumers started complaining of an unpleasant taste. It
took 16 hours from the first complaint to trace the alleged source.
Prof Ives calls for improved detection procedures. He says it is 'a matter
of great concern' that such odourless chemicals could pass through a sewage
treatment works and be discharged into an important supply river.
The report adds that the response to complaints was rapid and efficient
although some sections of the public, particularly the elderly and those
living alone, were not alerted quickly enough.
Although the spill was not life-threatening, the report says the incident
has highlighted the urgent need for a national review of the system of
licensing the storage of chemicals, especially near vulnerable water
courses.
The report calls on Severn Trent and the National Rivers Authority to
establish a database of potential sources of river pollution and calls for
closer collaboration between the water service companies and the NRA over
river pollution incidents.
Mr Victor Cocker, Severn Trent managing director, said all recommendations
would be acted on, and some had already been implemented.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Clinton's anti-crime drive suffers setback
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Representatives dealt a heavy blow to President Bill Clinton
yesterday, defeating a Dollars 33.2bn (Pounds 21.4bn) multi-faceted
anti-crime package for which the president had personally lobbied.
Voting 225 to 210, the House defeated a procedural rule need to bring the
legislation, known as the crime bill, to the floor. The vote effectively
kills the bill in this form and denies Mr Clinton an anti-crime initiative
he had promised during his 1992 election campaign.
The defeat could undermine the effectiveness of the Clinton presidency;
political analysts said it seemed certain to make life more difficult for
the president in his efforts to get the centrepiece of his legislative
agenda - the healthcare bill - through Congress.
In an unusual twist, the powerful US gun lobby and the influential
Congressional Black Caucus - which normally favours gun control - teamed up
to delay and ultimately defeat the bill.
The gun lobby opposed a ban on 19 types of assault weapons included in the
legislation, while the black caucus was angered that a controversial 'racial
justice provision' had been removed from the bill in the face of stiff
Republican opposition.
The measure would have allowed minority defendants facing the death penalty
to use statistics to challenge capital punishment as racially biased.
Mr Clinton had sent Mr Leon Panetta, his chief of staff, to Capitol Hill
earlier in the day to lobby for passage of the procedural vote. The
president and Vice-President Al Gore had also called several members in an
attempt to secure their support.
Later Mr Clinton, who blamed Republicans for the defeat, accused the House
of 'failing the American people'.
The crime bill would have given local communities grants to hire 100,000
more police and provided billions of dollars over six years for new prisons
and crime prevention programmes.
It would also have instituted harsher penalties for certain crimes, raising
to 60 the number of federal crimes for which US attorneys would be allowed
to seek the death penalty and mandating life sentences for third-time
felons.

FT  12 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Derivatives reacted sharply to the setback in European bonds following the
release of German consumer data and the unexpected rise in Swedish interest
rates. The increase in Italian interest rates came too late to impact on
formal trading, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,181. But for
a brief move forward to 3,188 in the first half-hour of trading, the
contract was in decline througout the day, with the lifting of interest
rates in Sweden being the initial trigger to the selling.
The mid-morning release of German consumer data unsettled bunds, leading to
a further decline, but it was the selling of around 1,000 lots by US broker
Refco Overseas which led to a sharp retreat in the contract over lunch.
With Wall Street also dull, there was little to encourage a rally and
September settled at 3,146, down 28 from its previous close and 8 points
below its fair value premium to cash of 10 points. Volume improved to 19,459
lots.
The announcement on Italian rates came towards the official close of
trading, and dealers were left to react in after-hours' trading. September
fell a further 19 points, signalling a poor session today.
Turnover in traded options was 45,369 lots, of which 13,351 were in the
FT-SE 100 option and 14,388 in the Euro FT-SE.

FT  12 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: BOC hard hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was unfortunate for specialist gases business BOC that it announced
third-quarter figures on a day that interest rate concerns dominated the
market. The misfortune was compounded by the absence of a finance director
at the meeting with analysts and the net result was a slide of 31 to 714p in
the share price.
In fact, the underlying figures were less grim than the stock performance
suggested. There was concern over increased competition to Forane, the
anaesthetic gas, following expiry of the patent, and worries over the fall
in gas margins.
But Mr Jeremy Chantry of Kleinwort Benson who recently advised investors to
take profits in the stock argued that gas demand was high and margins were
merely affected by a shift of business to the US, where competition was
historically greater. Although he trimmed back his full-year forecast by
Pounds 10m to Pounds 350m, he suggested that at current levels the shares
were beginning to see yield support.
Composite insurer Royal Insurance was the best performer in the FT-SE 100
Index, outside of the utilities, as the market gave a positive response to
much higher than expected interim results. The shares settled 6 firmer at
265p.
Royal's profits, at Pounds 191m, were around 25 per cent ahead of the most
optimistic expectations, while the 4p dividend was a penny higher than the
general consensus.
Mr Andrew Pitt at BZW, the investment bank, described the results as
'outstanding' and the strength of UK profitability as 'quite staggering'.
BZW hoisted its current-year forecast by Pounds 60m to Pounds 400m and that
for 1995 by Pounds 45m to Pounds 440m. The investment bank increased its
dividend projections for Royal to 12p for 1994 and 15p for 1995.
Mr Pitt said the valuation case for buying Royal was 'overwhelming',
especially since the shares are trading at a 14 per cent discount to the
current net asset value of 308p a share.
Chemist group Boots underperformed the market after securities house Hoare
Govett put out a critical piece of research on the extent of the group's
retail potential.
Hoare poured some cold water on the argument that the trend towards over the
counter medicines would boost profits. It argued that if price controls were
relaxed, the chemist's profit margins could be eroded. It added that as the
trend for self-medication continues, more competitors may want to grab a
slice of the OTC market. Boots slid 9 to 525p.
Turnover in Storehouse jumped to 12m and the stock eased 2 to 222p, after
Smith New Court bought 6m shares and placed most of the stock with
institutions.
Grand Metropolitan was a busy market as two brokers recommended the stock.
The shares rose 4 to 429p in heavy volume of 8.3m as Robert Fleming
suggested that investors switch out of Allied-Lyons and into GrandMet.
Allied gave up 6 at 587p.
Northern Foods firmed 10 to 226p, with Smith New Court, the group's broker,
said to have shown a keen interest in the shares.
Nervous trading in Unilever ahead of today's figures left the stock 14 lower
at 1042p. The range of forecasts is between Pounds 530m and Pounds 600m.
Talk that it will buy Eastman Kodak's household products division continued
to circulate.
Encouraging first-half figures from Reed International were insufficient to
prevent a dramatic turnround in the share price. The stock opened 11 higher
as the international publisher revealed profits up 12 per cent. But there
was some concern over medical publishing sales which were 9 per cent below
last year, and also the group's performance in the US. The shares fell to
end 22 off at 806p but mainly as a result of profit-taking.

FT  12 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shell doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interim results from Shell Transport proved a substantial disappointment to
the market, with dealers focusing on worse than expected figures from the
company's exploration and production division which were only partly offset
by good numbers from the chemicals and downstream operations.
'The market obviously got too carried away thinking that Shell's performance
would match that of BP announced at the start of the month,' said one
specialist.
Strauss Turnbull, however, adopted a more positive view, increasing its
year-end forecast of replacement pre-profits to Pounds 4.6bn and raising its
dividend forecast to a top of the range 26.6p 'The market will be pleasantly
surprised by the dividend, which will be boosted because of the weakness of
sterling against the Dutch guilder,' said Mr John Toalster, oil analyst at
Strauss. Shell fell 12 to 718p.

FT  12 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs applaud review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confirmation of recent rumours that the electricity distribution review
would be much less severe than the market feared produced a surge of buying
across the sector. The regional electricity companies (recs) outperformed
the wider market by 6 per cent.
Adding to the general euphoria was a feeling that the companies themselves
may embark on a share buy-back spree. Another story boosting sentiment was
that a potential stakebuilder in Eastern Electricity had moved into the
market shortly before the close on Wednesday, buying nearly 3 per cent of
the company in a single deal.
A leading analyst at one of the top integrated trading houses in London said
the review was 'much better than expected from the market's point of view',
and could lead to a short term upturn in share prices of as much as 10 per
cent. He added that all the companies had received shareholder permission to
buy back their own shares.
There was a minor ripple of unease around the market, however, following the
emergence of rumours that an investigation had been instigated by the Stock
Exchange into possible insider trading by directors of some of the recs.
London Electricity was the sector's best performer, leaping 61 to 645p,
closely followed by South West, up 52 at 714p, and Southern, 51 higher at
714p.
There was widespread speculation that the buyer of a block of 7.7m Eastern
Electricity at 704 1/4 p on Wednesday could have been a potential
stakebuilder. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, was said to have bought
the stock for a client. The deal produced an overnight gain of more than
Pounds 2.3m for the purchaser. Around the same time on Wednesday an
institution bought a block of 1.7m shares in Midlands Electricity at 701 3/4
p. Midlands rose 32 1/2 to 730 1/2 p and Eastern 30 to 739p.

FT  12 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rate moves in Europe hit
share prices - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confidence in the UK equity market was badly shaken yesterday by the moves
to higher interest rates in Sweden and Italy, which prompted savage falls in
British government bonds. Not even strong gains in regional electrical
stocks (recs) could save the FT-SE 100 Index from a fall of 28.8 points to
3,138.2; traders feared that the 3,100 mark could be at hazard this morning
if the US bond auction disappoints.
Although the  1/2 percentage point rate rises in Sweden and Italy appeared
to reflect obvious domestic factors, the reaction across bond and equity
markets served to indicate the depth of concern that the interest rate cycle
may be on the turn in Europe.
The stock market opened higher but this owed much to substantial gains among
the recs following what was seen as a price review highly favourable to the
companies from the official regulator. Heavy turnover in the recs lifted the
Seaq figure well above recent averages for the first hour of trading.
But it was clear that the rest of the market was by no means as confident,
and that worries over the near term outlook for interest rates continued to
plague investors in the UK market.
The market had already begun to cool off when the news that Sweden's
Riksbank had raised its key rates in order to resist inflationary pressures
sent bonds and shares sharply downwards. Increased selling was seen and the
investment mood turned distinctly sour. Some hurried selling was seen from
fund managers who had not already reduced portfolios of stocks influenced by
interest rates.
By midsession, nervousness ahead of publication of US data on retail sales
and producer prices had increased the market's uncertainty and the Footsie
was 34.2 down at 3,132.8. But the US data turned out to be relatively
benign, with a rise of 0.5 per cent in the June PPI only just above
expectations and, with Wall Street steady at the opening, London markets
managed a modest rally.
Optimism was quickly extinguished by the rise in Italian interest rates,
which was followed by a renewed slide in UK bonds that quickly turned share
prices off again. Although the market closed above its lows for the day,
traders believed that 'the Footsie was only saved by the bell'. The Dow
Average was down 16 points soon after London closed.
Feverish dealing in the final half-hour saw heavy selling of calls on the
Footsie option and few traders were prepared to be optimistic ahead of the
opening of the market this morning.
The pressure fell entirely on the blue chip stocks which were the most
directly linked to stock index futures and to hurried selling by the
institutions. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, helped by a strong contingent of recs
stocks, climbed 9.7 to 3,726.9. Some traders have identified significant US
demand in the recs sector.
Trading volume, boosted by the recs activity and also by trading statements
from Shell Transport, BOC and Royal Insurance, rose by 17 per cent from the
previous day to 694.4m shares, with non-Footsie business making up around 60
per cent. On Wednesday, retail business was worth Pounds 1.36bn.
After the close of trading, market strategists tried to make the best of a
painful day. Several argued that yesterday's developments implied no
pressure on interest rates in Germany or other leading European countries.
The Bundesbank is likely to continue focusing on domestic factors, including
domestic money supply, and any rise in German rates is still a long way off.
But there was no avoiding the jolt delivered to confidence in UK equities,
even among those analysts who have been predicting that base rates could
rise before the end of next month.

FT  12 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Sell-off in bond market fells
Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSOM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A sell-off in the Treasury market, prompted by rising expectations of an
imminent interest rate increase, and a disastrous 30-year bond auction, left
US share prices lower across the board yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15.86 at 3,750.90.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.42 to 458.88, while
the American Stock Exchange composite finished 0.72 off at 443.25 and the
Nasdaq composite unchanged at 728.20. Trading volume on the New York SE
amounted to 275.7m shares.
Although prices opened marginally higher, the market struggled to hold on to
its gains as Treasury prices slipped steadily lower, pushing long-term
interest rates, as measured by the yield on the 30-year government bond,
higher. The decline in bond prices was sparked by a series of economic
releases which were not overly bearish, but were worrying enough to convince
more investors that the Federal Reserve would soon sanction another interest
rate increase to slow down the economy.
The news that led to the sell-off in the bond market was an upward revision
in June retail sales growth, from an originally estimated 0.6 per cent to
0.8 per cent. Analysts said that the robust growth in retail sales, combined
with recent strong jobs growth, made it more likely that the Fed would
tighten monetary policy, probably after next week's meeting of the Federal
Open Market Committee.
Bond prices fell further later in the day after investors shunned the
Treasury's auction of Dollars 11bn new 30-year bonds.
The day's other news - a 0.5 per cent rise in July producer prices and a 0.1
per cent decline in July retail sales - had less of an impact. The bigger
than expected rise in producer prices was ignored because the gain was
attributable almost entirely to higher petrol and coffee prices.
Gap Stores jumped Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 41 1/4 in volume of 2.8m shares
after announcing second-quarter earnings per share of 30 cents, up from 20
cents last year and above forecasts.
US Bioscience rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 6 1/8 on the American Stock
Exchange after the company's Hexalen drug, which is used in the treatment of
ovarian cancer, was cleared by regulators for marketing in Canada.
On the Nasdaq market, technology stocks were in demand once again: Microsoft
advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 55 1/4 in heavy trading, Intel climbed
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 60 3/8 and Lotus Development appreciated Dollars 1
to Dollars 41 1/4 .
Neutrogena forged ahead Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 26 1/2 after the personal
care products concern said it was in talks with a larger company that could
lead to a takeover of Neutrogena.
Comcast Communications moved up Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 17 1/8 immediately
after the cable television group reported a narrowing in its second-quarter
loss to Dollars 12.8m, from Dollars 17m a year ago, but the shares later
fell back to end unchanged at Dollars 16 3/4 .
Canada
Toronto closed sharply lower after moderate trading as fears of rising
interest rates drove North American markets down.
The TSE 300 composite index dropped 30.4 to 4,174.7 and declining issues
outnumbered advances by 419 to 298 after volume of 60.1m shares valued at
CDollars 651m.
Twelve of the 14 sub-indices weakened, led by mining, off 1.6 per cent.
Industrial products fell 1.3 per cent and financial services shed 1.2 per
cent. The transportation group had the day's biggest rise, 1.0 per cent. The
golds group also closed higher.
Spar Aerospace, down CDollars  3/4 at CDollars 14 1/2 , reported
second-quarter earnings of CDollars 170,000 or 1 cent a share, down sharply
from a year-earlier net of C2.5m or 17 cents a share.
Brazil
Shares retreated by 1.1 per cent in volatile trading in Sao Paulo, dragged
down ahead of the options and futures markets settlements next Monday and
Wednesday.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most-traded shares ended 494 down at 44,638.
Turnover was RDollars 333.4m (Dollars 372.9m).

The index was up 51.11 at 20,821.36 after a day's low of 20,690.24 and high
of 20,845.27. Prices firmed in the afternoon on a rise in the futures
market, while overseas investors continued to buy chemical and steel shares.
Volume decreased from 271m shares to 249.5m. Traders expected public fund
managers to support activity over the next few weeks ahead of this month's
public offering of Japan Tobacco and Japan Telecom. The success of the
listing of the state-owned tobacco group, in October, is considered crucial
in determining the fate of the former Japan National Railway group's plans
to go public.
The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 1.02 at 1,662.52 and the
Nikkei 300 edged ahead 0.30 to 302.45. Rises outscored falls by 532 to 414,
with 203 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.08 to
1,349.34.
Steel companies once again led trading on buying by overseas investors and
profit-taking by domestic institutions. Nippon Steel, the day's most active
issue, rose Y2 to Y372.
Nippon Soda, a chemical company, advanced Y18 to Y457 on reports by the
Nikko Research Institute, the research arm of Nikko Securities, which said
it would outperform the market due to a rise in pre-tax profits from its
restructuring programme.
Takasago International, which makes fragrances for cigarettes, moved ahead
Y14 to Y852 on buying linked to the Japan Tobacco's listing.
In spite of selling prompted by Nomura Securities' downgrades of investment
ratings, Sony was finally up Y20 at Y6,000 and Matsushita Electric
Industrial recouped some of its loss to end Y10 off at Y1,770.
In Osaka, the OSE average added 44.84 at 23,098.36 in volume of 83.6m
shares. Small-lot buying supported real estate and machinery stocks,
regarded as laggards.
Roundup
Sentiment was mixed in the region, the two biggest markets, in Hong Kong and
Australia, offering the least enthusiasm on the day.
KUALA LUMPUR improved 1.7 per cent on increased retail and institutional
buying. The composite index gained 18.68 at 1,111.48 as volume swelled from
425m to 528m shares, the largest since late February.
Brokers said sentiment was further boosted by news that Bank Negara would
lift the ban on the sale of short-term paper to foreigners from today.
Multi-Purpose Holdings rose 42 cents to MDollars 4.84 in volume of 11m
shares on a 48 per cent increase in interim net profits.
SINGAPORE was motivated by a good session in Malaysian shares traded over
the counter. The Straits Times Industrial index climbed 23.53 to 2,300.03.
BANGKOK was lifted by institutional buying of blue chips ahead of today's
holiday closure. The SET index rose 18.17 to 1,425.49 in turnover of
Bt10.64bn.
Shares in Siam Makro, the cash-and-carry store operator, rose sharply on the
first day of trading to close at Bt72, compared with an initial public
offering price of Bt50, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok.
Siam Makro, a joint venture between the privately controlled SHV group, of
the Netherlands, and the Charoen Pokphand group, of Thailand, is the first
Makro company to go public in the 16 countries where the stores have been
established.
The Thai company, valued by the market yesterday at Bt15.8bn (Dollars 634m),
raised nearly Bt2bn by selling 18 per cent of its stock in the initial
offering in order to finance rapid expansion.
MANILA saw strength in PLDT following a rise of Dollars 2 1/4 in the ADRs on
Wall Street overnight, leaving it up 1 per cent on the domestic market at
1,760 pesos. The composite index firmed 32.80 to 2,976.99.
Some analysts forecast that the market would fall back today following a
sharp rise over the last two sessions.
SEOUL gained ground on hopes that first-half results from manufacturing
companies would be better than expected.
The composite index was ahead 8.98 at 939.19, just off a day's high of
940.87. Gainers led losers by 484 to 279.
Korea Mobile and Samsung Electronics went the day's limit up to Won391,000
and Won93,900 respectively, Samsung reporting that its first-half net
profits more than quadrupled.
TAIPEI lost more than 2 per cent on reports that the central bank might
tighten monetary policy in the near future. Sentiment was also unnerved by
news that the Securities and Exchange Commission was conducting an inquiry
into 10 investment trusts for alleged manipulation of plastics and
electronics stocks.
The weighted index gave up 145.99 to 6,692.02, but was off an intraday low
of 6,618.14. Turnover came to TDollars 102.7bn.
The electronics sector bore the brunt of the day's losses, with United
Microelectronics dropping TDollars 6.50, or 4.3 per cent, to TDollars
146.50.
HONG KONG lost impetus as bank shares, particularly HSBC Holdings with its
interim results due next Monday, were depressed by the problems reported in
the colony by the London-based Standard Chartered.
The Hang Seng index eased 93.54 to 9,524.54, and turnover fell from
HKDollars 4.28bn to HKDollars 3.565bn. HSBC finished HKDollars 1.75 down at
HKDollars 93.50, its low for the day.
Financials led the sub-indices down with a fall of 1.6 per cent. Among
trading houses, Swire Pacific reported a 14 per cent rise in first-half net
profits, but brokers said the results were in line with expectations and the
stock closed HKDollars 2 lower at HKDollars 59.75.
Meanwhile, the H share index of China-incorporated stocks rose 6.5 to
1,357.49.
SHANGHAI offered a similarly ambivalent attitude to investment prospects,
its domestic, A share index falling 7.15 per cent as the B shares, designed
for foreign consumption but now effectively open to mainland Chinese
investors, put on 2 per cent, the index advancing 1.59 to 80.45.
Some brokers said foreign investors were responsible for yesterday's B share
gains. Others, just as positively, said mainland Chinese investors were
making the running.
AUSTRALIA fell as stronger employment figures shook the domestic bond
market, the All Ordinaries index losing 13.7 at 2,062.8. Turnover expanded
from ADollars 337.8m to ADollars 403.4m.
Broken Hill Proprietary, the steel, mining and oil conglomerate,
strengthened in early trading to ADollars 19.70 but closed after the jobs
data at ADollars 19.54, down 4 cents.
WELLINGTON dropped a percentage point as investors stood back ahead of
Saturday's by-election in the South Island seat of Selwyn, which may make or
break the government. The NZSE-40 index fell 20.91 to 2,067.19.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg saw a correction from recent high levels as investors took
profits. However, brokers said the bullish outlook remained intact and that
leading shares could test fresh peaks in coming days.
The overall index, down 35 at 5,883, had seen a rise of 4 per cent over the
previous week. The industrials index lost 53 points, mostly in the afternoon
session, to 6,641, and the gold shares index was off 27 at 2,195 after
falling earlier to 2,179.
In spite of yesterday's setback, analysts remarked that the industrials
sector remained positive, supported by a recent batch of good corporate
results.
Selective buying was seen in a number of key stocks, with Gencor, for
instance, rising 10 cents to R12.70, adding to Wednesday's 80-cent gain.
Elsewhere, De Beers lost R1.25 at R119.50, Anglos fell R3.50 to R256.50, JCI

gave up R1 at R31.75, Malbak receded 50 cents to R18.50 and Barlows eased 25
cents to R33.

FT  12 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses derailed by Swedish
interest rate rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OUR MARKETS STAFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swedish rate rises derailed bourses after a morning on the upgrade,
reminding investors of the next turn in the cycle, writes Our Markets Staff.
Merrill Lynch put this in perspective, saying that the first German interest
rate rise could well be over a year away, and that the key was the inflation
outlook. Sweden devalued in 1992, the broker noted, the export sector
boomed, unemployment there has been falling for over a year and wages have
begun to rise.
Italy's rate increase came too late to affect bourses. The initial response
was that this was another country with one of the biggest budget deficits in
Europe, and one of those with the greatest uncertainty about its economic
prospects.
STOCKHOLM dropped 1.9 per cent after the Riksbank raised its key lending
rate by  1/2 percentage point to 8 per cent, citing fears that the economy
was overheating. The Affarsvarlden General index closed 27.30 lower at
1,441.50.
Banks and insurers sustained the worst damage, the sector index shedding 5.4
per cent. Analysts remained negative over the short term, feeling that the
market was uncertain even before the rate rise with an election and European
Union referendum in prospect, and the largest budget deficit in the OECD.
The ball bearings group SKF dipped SKr5 to SKr148 after announcing
first-half profits of SKr543m, against a previous loss of SKr503m. Analysts
suggested that, in spite of the good results, many in the market were hoping
for a signal of strong growth in the second half, and this was not
forthcoming.
MILAN had closed by the time the news came out of a 50 basis-point rise in
the domestic discount rate, an action, said the central bank, to defend the
lira. However, the market had already been buffeted by further political
worries and weakness in the bond market.
The Comit index finished 5.35, or 0.8 per cent, down at 669.17.
Brokers remarked of the continuing political unease, that differences
between members of the governing coalition, over issues such as cuts to be
made in the pension system, had undermined confidence even further.
COPENHAGEN lost 2.3 per cent on Sweden's rate rise, the KFX index falling
2.34 to 101.07 in weak trading. Mr Soeren Dalgaard, chief economist at Jyske
Bank, said: 'The Danish share market has been affected by rate nerves; there
is a tendency for foreign investors to lump all the Scandinavian markets
into one.'
HELSINKI fell into the doldrums as the market lost 1.25 per cent on fears of
interest rate rises. The Hex general index declined 23.4 to 1,852.7. Within
that, the banking and finance sector dropped by 3.1 per cent, but analysts
expected the market to bounce back soon.
FRANKFURT was a case of what might have been. The Dax index was reported at
2,184.23 in midsession but bund futures dropped sharply towards the end and
the key index closed 5.09 lower at 2,155.09 as turnover rose from DM5.5bn to
DM7.1bn. Equities saw little reaction to US PPI data in the post-bourse.
There were similar stories at corporate level. The energy and chemicals
group Veba rose as high as DM539.50 in the pre-bourse on a 43 per cent
increase in half-year net profits, lifting the market as a whole in the
process. But it fell by as much as DM10 from that level before closing at
DM532, down DM2.20.
Thyssen, the steel and engineering major, managed to sustain its
outperformance. A series of buy recommendations, interest after the
Hoogovens results in the Netherlands, and some switching out of financials
into cyclicals, took the shares up DM4 to DM318.50 on the session. They rose
to DM319.40 after hours.
Deutsche Bank plunged late in the session, partly on the
financials/cyclicals switch, but more on what traders described as heavy
selling pressure from a major US investment house. The shares ended DM17.50
down at DM706.
ZURICH closed a percentage point below its best, the SMI index ending 2.6
lower at 2,588.8. SMH provided the outstanding feature of the day, rising
SFr20 to SFr824.
Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Bank Sal Oppenheim in Zurich said that SMH had
risen by 13 per cent since the beginning of August, mainly on buying from
London. He offered two reasons: first, a 1994 price/earnings ratio of 12;
and secondly, the prospect of better shareholder information from the
watchmaker in future.
PARIS was dragged lower by events taking place elsewhere in Europe and fears
that this could trigger a round of interest rate rises elsewhere.
The CAC-40 index fell 25.24, or 1.2 per cent, to 2,038.93 in turnover of
FFr3.1bn.
Alcatel Alsthom dropped FFr11 to FFr623, adding to Wednesday's similar fall,
and announced a rise in first-half sales after the market had closed.
AMSTERDAM took a good look at the KLM results and, in spite of the better
than expected first-quarter results, was disappointed by the airline's
appraisal that it was only 'cautiously optimistic' regarding full-year
figures.
The shares strengthened to Fl 55.60 when the results were first posted,
before investors had time to take a closer look and drive them down to Fl
52.30, the session's low. They ended Fl 1.20 off at Fl 53.60.
The AEX index, upset by the Swedish rates news, slipped 0.81 to 416.81, but
was up from the day's low of 413.72, on a day that saw three other major
companies reporting.
Philips pleased the market as it trebled second-quarter net profits, far
exceeding analysts' expectations - they had been forecasting a doubling in
profits. The shares added Fl 1.90 at Fl 57.80 in high volume. The results
also helped its subsidiary Polygram, whose own figures had disappointed the
market earlier in the week, to a gain of 10 cents at Fl 78.00.
Elsevier, down Fl 2.10 at Fl 171.90, lost ground on profit-taking after
posting a good set of figures and announcing a 10-for-one share split and a
proposed listing on the NYSE, probably in the form of ADRs.
Royal Dutch, down 80 cents at Fl 195.90, was another to disappoint the
market with second-quarter results at the lower end of expectations.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Rate rises hit markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial markets yesterday received a rude wake-up call from their summer
torpor as both Sweden and Italy lifted short-term interest rates, writes
Philip Gawith.
The 50 basis-point increase in the Swedish ceiling rate to 8 per cent, and a
similar rise in the Italian discount rate, to 7.5 per cent, raised fears
that the interest rate cycle in Europe may have bottomed.
The rate moves were poorly received by sceptical markets, and both
currencies traded lower. Yesterday afternoon the lira was quoted at a record
low of L1,016.50 against the D-Mark, compared to a London close of L1,005
some 10 minutes before the rate move was announced.
The Swedish krona was quoted in London at SKr4.987 against the D-Mark, off a
low of SKr5, but well below Wednesday's close of SKr4.940.
Events in Europe overshadowed the release of a fairly neutral set of July
PPI and retail sales figures in the US. The dollar, however, weakened
sharply as nervous investors sought refuge from currency turbulence in the
D-Mark.
Yesterday evening the dollar was trading at DM1.5635, more than 2 1/2
pfennigs off the day's high of DM1.5905. In New York it finished at
DM1.5600.
Sterling had a steady day, with weakness against the D-Mark offset by
strength against the dollar. At midday in New York the pound was trading at
Dollars 1.5485, up from Dollars 1.53 earlier, and DM2.4256, down from
DM2.4350.
The interest rate futures markets had a hectic day with heavy volumes
traded, and large price movements. The December short sterling contract saw
more than 50,000 lots traded and was bid yesterday evening at 93.23,
compared to Wednesday's close of 93.43. The December Euromark contract
traded 66,000 lots and was bid at 94.78, compared to the previous close of
94.96.
Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, said it raised rates as a pre-emptive
strike against inflation. The Bank of Italy, in turn, said rates were lifted
in order to defend the lira.
Markets, however, were equally unimpressed with both motivations and
predicted further currency weakness.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America in London, commented:
'The message from the market to big budget deficit governments is that
investors are no longer prepared to invest in their assets unless we see a
big cut in their budget deficit, or a big increase in interest rates. Fifty
basis points is neither here nor there.'
Mr Hawkins said the market's initial response had been so negative that
speculators were now likely to turn their attention to other countries with
fiscal problems, notably Portugal, Greece and Belgium. 'The foreign exchange
market at the moment is now looking at budget deficits more than anything
else.'
Countries with a sounder fiscal position are expected to stay out of the
firing line. Mr Brian Durrant, economist at broker GNI, commented: 'I do not
think German policy will be altered in any shape or form by events we have
seen today.' Indeed, some analysts believe another interest rate cut from
the Bundesbank is likely, possibly as soon as next week when the council
next meets.
Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-Amro, noted: 'The issue is
fiscal deficits rather than Swedish monetary policy being a leading
indicator for Europe. But that is certainly how the market is seeing it
now.'
That said, yesterday's rate moves have clearly served as a further catalyst
for bearishness across the board in European interest rate markets.
A common criticism among analysts was that both central banks had
essentially missed the point, which was that markets were worried about
large budget deficits.
Against this background, selling the currency is logical because higher
interest rates promise only to aggravate the economic difficulties these
countries face, and make holding their assets a less palatable prospect.
Some analysts said the central banks' actions could be interpreted as
warning shots across the bows of the politicians, warning them that they had
to cut their budget deficits.
Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg in London, said high
debt countries might have to accept a degree of exchange rate fluctuation as
the price for interest rate independence.
He predicted that the issue of how high deficit countries would cope with
rising interest rates would prompt further speculation against their
currencies.
The dollar's weakness was attributed more to the search for safety in the
D-Mark rather than in any specific concern about the US currency. Analysts
said that yesterday's data were unlikely to have altered any views of the
likelihood, or not, of a Fed tightening at next week's FOMC meeting.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of
Pounds 120m after forecasting a Pounds 350m shortage. Earlier it had
supplied Pounds 200m liquidity at established rates. In the cash markets,
sterling LIBOR firmed on speculation of higher rates to 5 per cent from 5
9/16 per cent.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese tin exports rattle a
fragile market - The challenges facing the metal's producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The possibility that Britain's last operating tin mine - South Crofty, near
Redruth - might close down raised emotions in Cornwall but it created not a
ripple of interest elsewhere in an industry decimated over the past 10 years
by mine and smelter closures.
Those left in the industry are obsessed by one question: when will the
Chinese government gain tighter control over its recalcitrant tin miners and
stop them pouring exports into the west? These exports, they claim, are
destabilising the market and preventing tin producers from benefiting from
the improvement in world economic activity.
'We expected the tin price to reach about Dollars 6,000 a tonne by now,'
says Mr Fidelis Madavo, tin specialist at the CRU International consultancy
group. 'But here it is struggling along at Dollars 5,000 to Dollars 5,100.'
The tin market has been in turmoil since the sudden collapse in 1985 of a
price support scheme operated by the producers' International Tin Council,
which was backed by the governments. The huge stocks accumulated by the ITC
 -more than 40,000 tonnes - have been a malign influence on prices ever
since.
Tin had already been struggling in the early 1980s because a big chunk of
its market - for beverage cans - was being won away by aluminium producers.
This trend started in North America, where aluminium's share of the beverage
can market has risen from 15 per cent in 1973 to 93 per cent, and it has
been a growing threat in other industrialised countries too. Also thinner
coatings of tin are being used on tin-plated steel cans.
Nor have the metal's main other uses been particularly buoyant. Its use in
solders, now the principal application, increased throughout the 1980s as
did its use in chemicals. But in 1993 tin consumption was 30 per cent below
its peak 20 years previously.
In an effort to whittle away the former ITC stocks, a group of producers
formed the Association of Tin Producing Countries - its aim to voluntarily
restrict exports. The scheme has not worked well. Unexpected and
unrestrained exports from Brazil - not a member of the ATPC - caused havoc
in the early years.
Then China, now the world's biggest producer, continued to pump large
quantities of the metal into export markets. The collapse of the former
Soviet Union, once a substantial consumer of tin, added to the producers'
difficulties.
Today the ATPC faces its greatest challenge because after much persuasion
China joined in April this year. But it has flagrantly been exceeding its
export quota.
China agreed to limit its tin exports in 1994 to 20,000 tonnes. The official
China Daily reported at the beginning of this month that in the first half
alone the country exported 24,700 tonnes, a 33 per cent increase on the same
months of 1993. 'The ATPC is a toothless tiger and should be disbanded,'
said one analyst, reflecting a widely-held view in the industry.
The China Daily also reported that the Chinese government would tighten up
on tin exports in the second half of this year. It did not, however, say
how.
'Do the authorities really have control over shipments?' says Mr Andy Shaw,
tin specialist at the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy group.
'China has said it will adhere to certain ATPC recommended limits on exports
in previous years even though it has not been a member, but of course it
hasn't'
Mr Shaw suggests that, if it had not been for China's exports of refined tin
during the past few years, 'the stocks overhang which was left as a legacy
of the collapse of the International Tin Council could have been more or
less drawn down by now'.
CRU's Mr Madavo expects China's refined tin exports to slow in the second
half of this year but the 1994 total will probably exceed the 32,000-33,000
tonnes exported last year. China also ships out tin in concentrate (an
intermediate material) and, when this is taken into account, the export
total could rise to 40,000-45,000 tonnes.
'Traditional tin producers are being forced to deliver their metal into
London Metal Exchange warehouse,' Mr Madavo says. LME stocks, which totalled
20,000 tonnes at the end of last year, have climbed to 30,000 tonnes.
And, where CRU was earlier forecasting that western world demand for tin
would outpace supply this year, it now seems there will be a supply surplus.
Consumption is forecast to rise by just over 1 per cent, from 168,000 tonnes
last year to 170,000 tonnes and, while western world production is expected
to shrink from 141,000 tonnes to 135,000 tonnes, that would not be enough to
allow Chinese exports to be easily absorbed. The market also has to cope
with steady selling from the US strategic stockpile which disposed of 6,900
tonnes last year.
Nevertheless, analysts tend to be relatively bullish about tin's longer-term
prospects.
The International Tin Research Institute recently suggested that demand
could be boosted by 20 per cent within five years with a number of new
applications due to reach the market soon.
These include a tin-zinc alloy for plating car components; inorganic tin
compounds for fire-retardant packaging; lead-free tin alloy for gunshot;
antimony-tin solders with a higher tin content than present lead-tin
solders; and tin bottle capsules, used instead of lead.
On top of this, British Steel has announced that its 'Ultimate Can' for
beverages is ready for commercial production. This can, developed with other
European tinplate producers, is said to be 30 per cent cheaper than its
aluminium equivalent.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group, says: 'We are cautiously optimistic about the
prospects for tin demand over the next decade.
'The decline in consumption in tinplate has run its course even before we
consider the implications of the Ultimate Can. But, if producers are to
enjoy the benefits of higher demand, when it eventually arrives, they must
act to reduce stocks.'

FT  12 AUG 94 / World Commodities Prices: Aluminium breaks its resistance
level - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a late-afternoon spike in ALUMINIUM and COPPER prices on the
London Metal Exchange yesterday. Three-month aluminium broke through a
technical resistance level at Dollars 1,485 to close at Dollars 1,485.25, up
Dollars 14.50 a tonne from Wednesday's close.
Dealers said the move was supported by positive technical indicators and
improving fundamentals, and they were looking for an LME stocks drawdown
today to keep the upward momentum. 'Prices may now have the strength to go
above Dollars 1,500,' one dealer said.
Copper also moved higher but remained in its Dollars 2,400-Dollars
2,430-a-tonne range. Dealers said copper could test the higher end of this
range today, though they were wary that the LME may report another stocks
rise today. Copper closed at Dollars 2,417.50, up Dollars 7.
NICKEL staged a technical rally in choppy trading, though there was selling
towards Dollars 5,900 a tonne.
COFFEE prices slipped by Dollars 83 a tonne to see the November futures
contract on the London Commodity Exchange close at Dollars 3,200 a tonne.
The market had bounced off the day's low as some coffee roasting companies
returned to buy stocks, but trading remained thin and jittery ahead of a
report from the US Department of Agriculture today assessing the frost
damage to Brazil's crop.
The market has lost about 10 per cent of its value this week as fears of
more frosts in Brazil have receded.

report

<TEXT>
Wheat prices rallied yesterday at the Chicago Board of Trade as traders
responded to US government forecasts of smaller world wheat production and
improved near-term export prospects for US wheat. Wheat futures for December
delivery were up 4 1/2 cents a bushel in midday trading.
In its monthly crop report, the US Department of Agriculture reduced its
world wheat output estimate to 541.95m tonnes, from an earlier forecast of
546.1m. The agency also trimmed its estimate of US wheat production, largely
on deteriorating prospects for the US spring wheat crop. The USDA cut its
spring wheat production estimate to 564m bushels, from last month's forecast
of 605m.
US Durum wheat production will jump to 98m bushels, up nearly 40 per cent
from last year, reducing the need for imports and taking the pressure off a
trade dispute between the US and Canada.
Traders said US wheat export prospects were also improving, with Pakistan
and Egypt making purchase inquiries for wheat this week.
As expected, the USDA forecast bin-busting harvests for US maize and
soyabeans, in a remarkable recovery from last year's disastrous crops.
Given favourable weather conditions US farmers should harvest a near-record
9.2bn bushels of maize this fall, and a record 2.3bn bushels of soyabeans,
the government said.
The estimates, the first of the season for the USDA, fell near traders'
expectations. The agency also boosted its export and feed use figures for
soyabeans, causing futures prices to move higher.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saviours of Cornwall mine due
to be named
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Williamson, whose consultancy organisation was instrumental in
completing the funding to ensure the survival of the UK's last operating tin
mine, was uncharacteristically reluctant to talk yesterday.
He hopes, however, that the indentity of the large investor or investors who
had enough faith in tin's future to come to the rescue of South Crofty mine,
near Redruth in Cornwall, will be revealed today or on Monday. 'Until
everything is absolutely in place, it is better I say nothing,' he said.
South Crofty needed to raise at least Pounds 1m (Dollars 650,000) by August
4 under the terms of a package agreed with the UK government. The deadline
was met and, once the legal formalities are completed, the government and
the RTZ Corporation between them will waive loans totalled Pounds 31m. This
will leave South Crofty free of debt and with enough development capital to
sustain it for up to three years.
In the latest International Mining Review from his David Williamson
Associates, Mr Williamson, a Cornishman himself, gives an indication of the
arguments he must have put forward to persuade the big investor/s to provide
more than Pounds 500,000.
He says the collapse of tin prices to historically low levels makes South
Crofty marginally unprofitable. 'But should the tin price move up from
current levels of around Dollars 2.50 a lb (Dollars 5,510 a tonne) to
Dollars 3 (Dollars 6,612), the mine would become extremely profitable with a
net present value of close to Pounds 10m at an 8 per cent discount rate.'
He points out it would be too expensive to re-open South Crofty if it were
closed. 'While a mine is running there is always hope,' he says.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: European sector hit by surprise rate rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Unexpected rises in interest rates in Sweden and Italy sent European
government bond markets into a tail-spin yesterday. In spite of their status
as Europe's high-debt, high-deficit nations, their pre-emptive actions were
widely interpreted by investors as harbingers of rate rises in Europe's
hard-currency nations.
'These rises came against a backdrop of people re-assessing their outlook on
the Bundesbank and the view that we were at the bottom of the interest rate
cycle,' said Mr Jouni Kokko of S. G. Warburg Securities.
The markets were also upset by the timing of the rate rises, which came when
they were least capable to cope with surprises. Volume in the cash market
has been thin in recent weeks, due to the summer holiday season, which means
even the lightest of sell orders can have a strong impact on prices.
Ms Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets, said that Sweden's move would
create serious problems for the rest of the Scandinavian bloc, where
governments were already having to deal with fiscal issues and referendums
on whether to join the European Union.
In Sweden, yields rose sharply after the Riksbank raised the ceiling rate by
50 basis points to 8 per cent and the central repo rate by 28 points to 7.20
per cent. The National Debt Office delayed its bill auction due to the
turmoil triggered by the rises and the fall in the krona put additional
pressure on the market.
At the short end, the rate on six-month Treasury bills jumped 71 basis
points to 8.74 per cent while the yield on nine-year bonds closed up 56
basis points at 11.28 per cent.
Ten-year UK gilts fell by nearly two points as many dealers now believe that
an autumn rate rise is inevitable. One dealer noted that due to the bearish
mood in the market, it would take longer than expected for the Bank of
England to complete its recently-announced taps. Of the Pounds 700m to be
sold, almost Pounds 500m still has to be taken up.
On Liffe, the long gilt future fell 1 27/32 points to 100 3/8 in volume of
93,400 lots.
Longer-dated US Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday in the wake of
inflation and retail sales data that was deemed bearish for the government
securities market and a disappointing 30-year bond auction.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  27/32 at 83
23/32 , yielding 7.649 per cent and the two-year note down  1/8 at 99 25/32
, yielding 6.226 per cent.
The July inflation figures produced mixed feelings among bond market
investors. The headline 0.5 per cent rise in the producer prices index was
above expectations, but the bulk of the gain was attributable to higher
petrol and coffee prices. Core producer inflation, which excludes the
volatile food and energy components, was up only 0.1 per cent.
More disturbing for the market, and the factor behind the early declines in
bond prices, was the retail sales data. Although sales were reported to have
declined by 0.1 per cent last month, analysts latched on to the upward
revisions in prior months' sales, in particular an increase in the original
estimate of June sales from growth of 0.6 per cent to 0.8 per cent.
The retail sales data unsettled investors, and made dealers sceptical about
the chances of the afternoon auction of Dollars 11bn in 30-year bonds
passing off successfully.
Their doubts subsequently proved well-founded when investors stayed away
from the auction in droves. Demand for the new issue was extremely weak, and
Wall Street dealers were left with the bulk of the 30-year bonds on their
books.

FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Swire Pacific first-half
earnings reach HKDollars 2.05bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Swire Pacific, the Hong Kong-based property, aviation and trading group,
yesterday reported a 14 per cent rise in first-half net profits to HKDollars
2.05bn (USDollars 265m) from HKDollars 1.8bn in the same period last year,
boosted by property sales and steady growth in rental income.
Earnings per A share increased to 129.4 cents from 113.5 cents. The interim
dividend is raised to 33 cents from 29 cents.
The growth in earnings, which was broadly in line with expectations, was
signalled on Wednesday with the release of Cathay Pacific's profits.
The airline, which is 52 per cent owned by Swire Pacific, disappointed the
market with an 18 per cent rise in interim net profits to HKDollars 803m.
Although expected, Swire's announcement drove the share price down Dollars 2
to end the day at HKDollars 59.75.
The biggest gains came from the property and industries divisions. Swire
took a HKDollars 273m profit from the sales of properties under development
and HKDollars 1.24bn in net rental income.
More than half the 147 apartments in the company's Mid-Levels development
have been sold, at an average price of HKDollars 9,784 a square foot, or
more than HKDollars 10m for the smallest, 1,094 square foot flat.
The flats were put up for sale weeks before the government announced its
intention of taking steps to cool the property market and three months
before these measures were unveiled.
In the industries division, beverages businesses in Hong Kong and the US
spurred significantly higher profits.
During the first half Swire consolidated its position in this field by
acquiring controlling interests in the Taiwan Coca-Cola Bottling Company and
BC Development Company, and integrating these with existing soft drink
operations in Hong Kong, the US and southern China.
Aviation was redeemed by a jump in profits at Hong Kong Dragon Airlines,
which specialises in flights to Asian destinations including China.
Increased capacity and improved yields at Dragon Airlines were in contrast
to the higher costs and lower margins which affected Cathay Pacific and
maintenance company Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company.
The strong yen had an impact on the balance sheet as long-term unrealised
exchange losses on Cathay Pacific's foreign currency borrowing soared to
HKDollars 3.3bn at June 30, compared with HKDollars 2.2bn at the end of
1993.

Surging demand for cellular phones in Thailand has enabled United
Communications' (Ucom) to report robust half-year net profits of Bt864m
(Dollars 34.5m). Second-quarter profits were Bt448m.
The results have been consolidated for the first time so no comparable
figures are available for 1993.
'The growth in the cellular phone business has made Ucom one of Thailand's
fastest growing companies,' said Mr Dan Fineman of Jardine Fleming Thanakom
Securities.
Approximately 55 per cent of Ucom's profits come from cellular phones.
Jardine Fleming believes cellular phone sales will climb by 60 per cent this
year to 741,000 and that Ucom's full-year net profit will be Bt1.8bn.

FT  12 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Finland raises CDollars 200m over 10

<TEXT>
Amid the turmoil in Europe's government bond markets following interest-rate
tightening in Sweden and Italy, activity in the eurobond market all but
ground to a halt.
The only significant deal of the day was a CDollars 200m issue of 10-year
bonds for the Republic of Finland via joint lead managers Paribas and Swiss
Bank Corporation. The bonds were priced to yield 27.5 basis points over the
Canadian 10-year government benchmark bond at their re-offer price of
99.845.
While the leads reported good demand from the Benelux region and
Switzerland, boosted by the 9.5 per cent coupon, other dealers felt the
issue had been too tightly priced.
'Given the size and the timing of the deal, I think it should have had an
extra 10 basis points' on the spread, said one syndicate manager, adding
that the timing of the deal, amid a raft of US inflation indicators, was
'bizarre.' After the bonds were freed to trade, the spread widened to around
31 basis points.
While more swap-driven Canadian-dollar issues are expected soon, activity is
expected to remain quiet near-term, with most of Europe closed for
Assumption holiday on Monday.
The Hong Kong Housing Society, a non-profit making organisation which
provides affordable homes for Hong Kong people, issued a HKDollars 2bn
floating-rate note for general funding purposes, writes Louise Lucas in Hong
Kong.
The 2 1/2 -year notes, the bulk of which will be placed locally, carry an
interest rate of 0.85 per cent over the three-month Hong Kong interbank
offered rate.
The offering will not be listed on any stock exchange. There is a call
option after two years and three months.
Wardley Capital arranged the issue and HSBC Markets is book-runner.

FT  12 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Barclays plans loan
repurchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Bank yesterday started the process of reducing its capital by
proposing to pay back Dollars 800m in loan capital. The repurchase is aimed
at rebalancing its capital ratios following a fall in its US dollar assets.
Barclays has been considering a number of measures to reduce capital after
raising its tier 1 ratio of shareholders' funds to risk-weighted assets to 7
per cent in the first half of the year from 6 per cent at the end of 1993.
The loan capital purchase will not affect its tier 1 ratio but it will cut
the overall capital to risk-weighted assets ratio to about 10.5 per cent
from 11.1 per cent, and eliminate loan interest payments.
Mr Patrick Perry, Barclays' treasurer, said it 'has quite enough capital to
be going on with, so it seemed sensible to pay some dollar capital off'. It
had 'no plans' to buy back another Dollars 500m such issue.
Barclays is also thought to be considering buying back some Dollars 500m in
perpetual preference shares included in its tier 1 ratio. It has a total of
Dollars 940m of such shares and a call option to repurchase Dollars 500m can
now be exercised.
Such a move would require Bank of England approval, but could reduce its
tier 1 ratio to about 6.6 per cent. It might not choose to cut its tier 1
ratio in this way if there was a strong growth in loan demand requiring more
capital.
The bank yesterday offered to purchase the two Dollars 400m issues of
guaranteed capital notes through a fixed-rate tender. The offer is being
made by Barclays North American Capital Corporation, and Lehman Brothers is
the deal manager.
The purchase price of the 10 1/2 per cent notes due 2017 will be calculated
at a fixed spread of 25 basis points over the yield of the US Treasury 6 per
cent note due November 1997.
The price of the 11 5/8 per cent notes due 2003 will be calculated at a
fixed spread of 30 basis points over the yield of the US Treasury 5 1/8 per
cent note due April 1998.

Hong Kong Electric, which operates the electric power monopoly on Hong Kong
island, has trumped market expectations by turning in a 33 per cent rise in
net profits for the first half. Earnings came in at HKDollars 1.73bn
(USDollars 224m) against HKDollars 1.3bn in the same period last year.
A warm spell in April and May, sparking heavy use of air conditioners,
helped increase unit sales by 10.1 per cent during the half year. Maximum
demand for the half year reached a record 1,925MW, up 5.9 per cent on last
year. Sales to commercial customers, which account for 70 per cent of the
total, rose 10.5 per cent.
Earnings per share hit 86 cents, up from 64 cents in 1992, and shareholders
are to receive an improved dividend of 37 cents, compared with 33 cents in
the first half of 1993.
Property interests continued to contribute to overall profits, and Mr George
Magnus, chairman, expects the rest of 1994 to yield improved growth in
electricity sales.

FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Loans move signals sea-change on
Wall St - Investment banks eye commercial lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four years ago, a series of big loans to highly leveraged companies nearly
brought First Boston, the US investment bank, to its knees.
When the junk bond market collapsed, it was left holding USDollars 1.2bn of
what were meant to be temporary 'bridge' loans, which it had planned to
refinance in the bond market.
But times have changed in the leveraged finance business. The junk bond
market had a record year in 1993 - and CS First Boston (as it is now known)
is returning to corporate lending. Only this time, the bank says, it will
put the loans on the balance sheet of sister bank, Credit Suisse.
The loans move signals a sea-change on Wall Street. US commercial banks have
had their eyes on the junk (or sub-investment grade) bond market for some
time. Now, US investment banks are arranging loans for sub-investment grade
companies. Unlike in the 1980s, when they advanced large-scale bridge loans
to back one-off transactions, they say loans will be a standard service.
Recently, three of the country's largest securities houses - CS First
Boston, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers - hired commercial bankers to
create commercial loans units.
Wall Street is not planning to compete head-on with the commercial banks for
lending business, though. Mr Seth Waugh, who heads Merrill Lynch's corporate
bond and high-yield departments in North America, says the decision to
originate commercial loans is an extension of the product line Merrill
offers to clients, rather than a radical step in a new direction.
At CSFB, Mr Mark Patterson, head of the firm's leveraged finance group,
says: 'It's a line extension to clients whom we already serve in many other
ways. We're not reinventing the banking wheel. All we'll be doing is
offering clients the ability to work with our bank on the senior debt layer
of their capital structure.'
Industry analysts take a similar view. Mr John Keefe, and independent
analyst in New York, says: 'I don't know if anyone will spend immense
amounts of time and effort on it . . . It's more an effort to round out
their product line, rather than to staunch any competitive move by
(commercial) banks' into the bond business.
There are clear similarities in the approach taken by the three Wall Street
firms. Each has its eyes on the sub-investment grade loans market.
Raising money for smaller companies without a strong credit rating is in
some ways more profitable than doing business with big ones - there is less
competition for the business and fees are higher.
There are other reasons for staying in non-investment grade lending. Mr
Waugh explains why Merrill Lynch does not need the capital strength of a
bank to originate loans: 'Initially, the plan is to stay only in the
leveraged part of the market - high-yield, not investment-grade - because it
is not as intensive in terms of balance sheet usage.'
The indication from Merrill and the other firms, however, is that they might
begin originating loans in the investment grade sector.
In another marked similarity between the firms, each has hired an executive
(or two, in the case of Merrill) from Chemical Banking to lead their lending
businesses.
That may not be surprising, given that bank's current dominance of the
syndicated loans market, and the market for non-investment grade credits.
But Chemical, an agent or co-agent on half of the Dollars 22.8bn of such
debt raised in the second three months of the year, denies the move will
damage its syndicated loans business.
There is one clear difference between the approach taken by the three firms.
While CSFB will originate loans on behalf of Credit Suisse, Merrill and
Lehman plan to sell their loans on to syndicates of banks, and only
occasionally keep part of the exposure on their own balance sheets.
Rivals question this approach. According to one senior investment banker:
'It makes a lot of sense for First Boston. It has a parent that's already a
bank, a bank that has extraordinary financial strength.
'But for Merrill, it does not make much sense at all. The problem is that
you need a whole infrastructure. Anybody can originate a loan, but what
about syndication, administration, and how you deal with a work-out if you
have a problem? Credit Suisse can do all that, Merrill can't'
Mr Waugh at Merrill disagrees. Getting into the loan business is a natural
move for securities firms, he says, because 'these days loans are trading
much like securities. It's a pretty active and liquid market.'
Many investment banks already hold loan assets bought from commercial banks
in the secondary market.
Moreover, he says that apart from the short-term commitment of capital
required when putting together a syndicate, the new business will not be
using any extra capital.
Anyway, says Mr Waugh, 'if we hold fewer bonds and more loans, we're
improving our balance sheet because by definition loans are more senior than
securities.'
Such comments carry echoes of the bridge financings of the 1980s: they were
meant to be temporary.
With those memories still fresh, the investment banks are likely to tread
more carefully this time.

FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Samsung Electronics posts
fivefold rise

<TEXT>
Samsung Electronics, South Korea's largest electronics company, reported a
more than fivefold rise in net earnings for the first half of 1994 due to a
surge in exports of semi-conductors.
Profits increased to Won285bn (Dollars 354m) from Won56bn a year earlier,
while sales increased by 35 per cent to Won5,099bn.
Samsung Electronics, which is the flagship of the Samsung group, is the
world's biggest producer of memory semiconductor chips.
Semiconductor profit margins have risen due to increased demand by the
global computer industry. The earnings increase also reflects a sharp
reduction in depreciation following an accounting policy change.
The half-year results already exceed Samsung Electronic's 1993 profits of
Won154bn and analysts estimate that earnings for 1994 will be at least
Won350bn. It is also expected this year to become the first Korean company
to surpass the milestone of Won10,000bn in sales.
Samsung Electronics' other main businesses include consumer electronics,
computers and telecommunications, but analysts believe they are barely
profitable.
Korea Mobile Telecom, the monopoly cellular telephone service, reported net
profits up 68 per cent to Won69bn for the first half of 1994.
KMT is one of the country's most profitable companies. Sales increased by 89
per cent to Won333bn due to high growth in cellular subscribers. The number
of subscribers has increased by 90 per cent annually since 1988, when the
service was introduced.
Growth is expected to continue at the current rate because Korea still has a
low diffusion rate of 2 per cent for cellular telephones, while falling
prices for handsets are attracting new customers.

FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Asset sales lift Thomson profits
in second quarter

<TEXT>
Thomson Corporation, the travel and publishing group controlled by Canada's
Thomson family, recorded a 39 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings after
being helped by gains from asset sales.
Operating profit from travel and newspapers improved substantially, but
there was a small drop in specialised publishing's contribution.
Earnings rose to USDollars 104m, or 18 cents a share, from Dollars 75m, or
13 cents a share, a year earlier. The bulk of the increase came from
non-recurring gains, mainly the sale of the group's 50 per cent interest in
Thomson Directories. Sales climbed to Dollars 1.56bn from Dollars 1.47bn.
Thomson Travel's operating profit rose to Dollars 39m from Dollars 31m.
Supply and demand for the UK subsidiary's summer holidays this year has been
almost in balance. Bookings are currently 18 per cent ahead of last year and
should end the season about 15 per cent higher.
Fewer holidays than usual need to be sold in the late part of the season
when price-cutting is normally most intense. Furthermore, Britannia Airways,
a Thomson subsidiary, is operating at 'near maximum' capacity this summer.
Thomson said it had formed a base for expansion into the domestic UK holiday
market by buying Country Holidays, the UK's largest holiday cottage letting
agency.
The drop in the information and publishing division's profits to Dollars 56m
from Dollars 58m was ascribed to seasonal losses in the education and
school-publishing group, and delays in finalising unidentified sales.
'Prospects for the full year remain good,' the company said.
Operating margins of Thomson's UK regional newspapers continued their recent
improvement. The UK-based legal, professional and business publishing group
also put in a stronger performance.
Circulation and advertising lineage of its US and Canadian newspapers are
'marginally' ahead of last year.
Gulf Canada Resources said production of natural gas and crude oil declined
in the first half of the year primarily due to the divestment of assets in
1993, Reuter reports. The company posted a first-half loss of CDollars 49m,
against a loss of CDollars 41m in the first half of 1993.

<TEXT>
Chugai Pharmaceutical, the Japanese ethical drug maker, lifted pre-tax
profits 35 per cent in the six months to June but expects that
government-imposed price cuts will limit its full-year growth to only 2.8
per cent.
Profits reached Y8.6bn (USDollars 86.87m) halfway, aided by efforts to
reduce operating costs as well as by a 5.1 per cent rise in sales to
Y76.9bn. For all of 1994, the company is forecasting taxable profits of
Y17.5bn on revenues ahead 4.3 per cent to Y158bn.
In April, the Japanese health ministry, concerned at the escalating costs of
treating an ageing society, told manufacturers to cut prices of prescription
drugs by an average 6.6 per cent.
This was the latest in a series of such reductions, which have hampered
earnings growth in the industry. Prescription drugs account for more than 80
per cent of Chugai's sales.
The dividend for the year is to be maintained at Y9 per share although the
company is adjusting the interim payment to Y4.50 from Y3.75 to equalise the
two halves. Interim net earnings were Y15.42 compared with Y11.89, and the
full-year forecast is Y29.62 against Y28.52.
Pioneer Electronic, the Japanese audio-video equipment maker, is aiming to
merge its two US entertainment units, Carolco Pictures and Live
Entertainment, around October, a Pioneer spokesman said, AP-DJ reports.

FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Goodwill Games hurt TBS income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Turner Broadcasting System, the US entertainment and news group, yesterday
reported a sharp drop in second quarter net income from Dollars 31m to
Dollars 13m following losses on the 1994 Goodwill Games in St Petersburg,
and poor results from film releases.
Although revenues for the three months rose to Dollars 678m from Dollars
487m, helped by acquisitions, operating profits fell by Dollars 23m to
Dollars 74m. Earnings per share dropped to Dollars 0.05 from Dollars 0.12.
Mr Ted Turner, president, said: 'With continuing network expansion
domestically and internationally, as well as telecasting the Winter Olympics
and the Goodwill Games, we knew 1994 would be financially challenging.'
Revenue from entertainment operations rose by Dollars 178m to Dollars 459m,
of which Dollars 132m was contributed by acquisitions - New Line Cinema
Corp, acquired in January, Castle Rock Entertainment, in December 1993, and
Hanna-Barbera Holding, of which TBS bought the outstanding 50 per cent at
the end of last year.
Advertising revenue rose by Dollars 24m, driven mainly by increased rates
for Turner Network Television and an increase in sports revenue.
However, entertainment operating profits fell by Dollars 46m, due partly to
Dollars 26m in second quarter losses from the Goodwill Games. In the 1980s,
Mr Turner created the games as an alternative to the Olympics, but so far
they have cost TBS Dollars 39m. News revenue rose Dollars 10m partly from
more advertising at Cable News Network.

FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Tighter cable rules hit Comcast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Comcast Corporation, the cable and cellular telephone group which this month
agreed to merge with the QVC home shopping channel, recorded a net loss of
Dollars 12.9m, or 5 cents a share, for the three months to June 30,
The figures, which compare with a net loss of Dollars 17.1m, or 8 cents, in
the same period last year, reflect the impact of tighter federal regulation
of cable services, in spite of healthy consumer demand for cellular
services.
Mr Brian Roberts, Comcast's president, reported that 'subscriber growth in
cable and cellular businesses continued at a very healthy pace during the
second quarter'.
However, revenues were static at Dollars 340.6m, compared with Dollars
340.1m, and operating cashflow fell by 6.9 per cent to Dollars 148.6m
following moves by the Federal Communications Commission to curb the prices
charged by cable operators.
Consumer demand for cellular services provided some compensation and during
the second quarter 'subscriber additions proceeded at the vigorous pace' of
the preceding six months, Mr Roberts said.
The results contributed to a half-year loss of Dollars 40.2m for the six
months to June 30, against a net loss of Dollars 783.7m in the first half of
last year. The 1993 six-month loss was struck after a one-off charge of
Dollars 742.7m following a change in accounting for taxes and employee
benefits.
Operating cashflow of Dollars 290m for the six months fell by 5.2 per cent.
The dividend is unchanged at 2.3 cents a share for the quarter, making an
unchanged 4.7 cents for the half year.
Earlier this month Comcast and Liberty Media Corporate agreed to acquire QVC
as part of plans to improve Comcast's programming capability. That followed
Comcast's agreement in June to buy the US cable TV businesses of Maclean
Hunter for Dollars 1.3bn. Comcast estimates the Maclean deal will make it
the US's third largest cable operator.

FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Kodak may split L&amp;F subsidiary
before sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eastman Kodak, the US photographic products group, has given up the attempt
to find a single buyer for its L&amp;F Products subsidiary and is instead
proposing to break up the operation before selling it.
The decision emerged from a letter to L&amp;F's employees in which L&amp;F said it
would be sold as two separate units: one comprising its world-wide household
products, and the other its world-wide do-it-yourself products.
Kodak yesterday declined to comment on the reasons for the split, but there
was speculation that it believed it could get a better price for the
operations.
Some companies thought to be interested in bidding for L&amp;F may only be
interested in one side of the business. For example, Colgate-Palmolive, the
US consumer products group which earlier this year expressed an interest in
buying L&amp;F for its household products, may have had little interest in
acquiring L&amp;F's do-it-yourself business.
Other companies said to have examined L&amp;F include Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch
consumer products group, Reckitt &amp; Colman of the UK, and Procter &amp; Gamble of
the US.
L&amp;F's household products include Lysol disinfectants and cleaners and
Resolve carpet cleaners. On the do-it-yourself side they include Minwax wood
finishes and Thompson's waterproofing and staining products.
Kodak put L&amp;F on the market in May as part of a plan to divest peripheral
businesses and concentrate on its film and digital imaging operations. Other
businesses included in the divestment plans were its Sterling Winthrop drug
subsidiary which was sold to Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals group, for
Dollars 1.68bn in June.
No price has been put on L&amp;F's operations, but there has been speculation
that they could fetch up to Dollars 2bn.
Interco, the US footwear company, is evaluating business alternatives for
its footwear operations in an effort to enhance shareholder value, Reuter
reports. The company said these include an initial public offering and/or a
spin-off to shareholders involving all or a part of the common stock of one
or both of Interco's footwear operating companies.

FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Gap recovery gains momentum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gap, the US casual wear retailer, yesterday continued the strong recovery it
made in the first quarter by reporting a 55 per cent increase in net profits
to Dollars 44.4m from Dollars 28.7m in the second quarter to July.
The second-quarter earnings figure - a record for the company - came on a 12
per cent increase in sales to Dollars 773m from the comparable period's
Dollars 693m.
Earnings per share rose from 20 cents to 30 cents.
The result more than outweighed Gap's profits fall in last year's second
quarter. Then its results were hit by expansion costs, weak consumer demand
and competition from other groups imitating Gap's basic clothing formula.
Since then Gap has shifted its product mix away from simple unisex clothing,
such as T-shirts and jeans, to more fashionable merchandise, particularly
for women.
Net income for the first half of 1994 rose by 54 per cent to Dollars 107.8m
from Dollars 70.2m.
Turnover rose by 14 per cent to Dollars 1.53bn from Dollars 1.34bn and
earnings per share from 49 cents to 74 cents.
Gap said store-for-store sales increased by 1 per cent in the second
quarter.
Better stock control had reduced the need for price cutting on surplus
goods, and this, coupled with with an increased emphasis on fashion
merchandise, led to higher margins in all divisions.

rise at midterm

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Veba, the energy-based conglomerate, has continued its profits drive with a
30 per cent increase in first-half pre-tax earnings.
Following the 18.5 per cent rise in the first quarter, Germany's
second-biggest electricity provider yesterday repeated earlier forecasts of
a significantly improved result for the full year.
Revitalised by restructuring in its chemicals divisions, and reinforced with
new electricity operations in east Germany, Veba earned DM1bn (Dollars 600m)
in the review period on sales up just 7 per cent to DM35.5bn.
The interim result, published in a shareholders' letter yesterday, included
a DM120m provision for a further cost-cutting programme in the chemicals
sector, launched in May.
Including the closure of rubber production plant, the action is intended to
reduce annual labour costs by DM300m.
Measures already taken led to a considerable improvement in operating
results from chemicals, the letter said, although the extraordinary items
meant the half-year figure remained negative.
At the end of the review period the chemicals divisions employed 32,430,
some 14 per cent fewer than at the end of 1993.
Total deliveries from the Huls chemicals division rose 15 per cent, or 10
per cent after adjustment for consolidations and disposals. In common with
most other German chemicals makers, Veba reported most volume increases
going to foreign customers. Domestic deliveries rose only slightly, it said.
Turnover from electricity increased 29 per cent to DM8bn, due to the
inclusion of majority stakes in five regional utilities in the former East
Germany. Earnings rose by an undisclosed amount.
Power deliveries from the PreussenElektra subsidiary rose 20 per cent due to
the acquisitions, while deliveries in the west showed above-average growth
of 1.3 per cent.
The oil business also showed better profits on turnover up 5 per cent at
DM7.5bn, although Veba said the result was still unsatisfactory.
Services, transport and trade, contributing DM14.9bn to total sales, also
generated earnings above last year's high level, it added.
After adjustments for consolidation effects, and the inclusion of 5,600 east
German electricity workers, the total workforce increased 1.7 per cent to
130,500 in the review period.
Payroll costs were only 1.2 per cent higher than a year earlier at DM4.69bn.

FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Lac spurns Royal Oak's bigger
offer
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lac Minerals, the Canadian mining group trying to fend off unwelcome
predators, has rejected a CDollars 2.4bn (USDollars 1.73bn) takeover bid
from Royal Oak Mines, the much-smaller Vancouver-based gold producer.
Royal Oak earlier this week raised its cash-and-shares offer from CDollars
2.2bn, mainly by improving the cash component. But Lac yesterday produced a
long list of objections, claiming the bid is 'inadequate and not in the best
interests of Lac and its shareholders'.
Lac has also received an unsolicited bid from American Barrick, the
Toronto-based gold producer. Although the Barrick offer is worth slightly
less than Royal Oak's, it has the advantage of including Barrick's
relatively liquid and well-regarded stock.
It would come as no surprise however, if Barrick sweetened its offer within
the next week or two.
Mr Jim Pitblado, Lac chairman, said yesterday that 'there is significantly
greater value for shareholders in keeping Lac independent than there is in
Royal Oak's revised offer'.
He noted that 70 per cent of the offer comprises paper based on Royal Oak's
'low-quality, short-lived and high cost assets'.
In addition, 'the highly leveraged balance sheet of the proposed combined
company would leave it with no ability to finance its exciting development
opportunities'.
But Mr Victor Flores, who manages a gold fund for United Services Advisors
of San Antonio, Texas, which owns a sizeable block of Lac shares, predicted
that, following the spate of bids, the battle for Lac could be close to a
conclusion.
'If anyone else wants to make an offer, they'd better do it pretty quickly,'
Mr Flores said.
Lac hopes that several US gold-fund shareholders will back its fight for
independence on the grounds that they want a diversified portfolio and are
already at or close to their prescribed limits on American Barrick shares.
But Mr Bill Martin, who runs a gold fund for Benham Capital Management in
San Francisco, said that the decision would probably come down to 'the best
price you can get for Lac'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines posted a strong increase in net profit in the first
quarter of 1994-95, reflecting good demand for air travel sparked by general
economic recovery as well as the company's cost-cutting efforts
Net profit surged to Fl 122m (Dollars 69.3m) in the three months to June
from Fl 40m a year earlier. Per-share profits were up 82 per cent at Fl 1.31
after the 60 per cent rise in ordinary share capital in early 1994.
KLM said part of the profit increase was due to its partnership with
Northwest Airlines of the US, including the two companies' recent joint
launch of a new business class.
The Dutch national carrier said it was 'cautiously optimistic' for the rest
of the year but it made no specific forecast.
Total traffic, comprising passengers, mail as well as cargo, was up 12 per
cent. But yields were down 3 per cent, due to the relatively stronger growth
of cargo traffic and the continued trend among passengers towards seeking
out cheaper seats and lower fares.
Turnover rose by 7 per cent to Fl 2.26bn, while costs were up 5 per cent at
Fl 2.05bn. Unit costs fell 6 per cent.
KLM said the reduction of financial expenses by Fl 14m to Fl 92 was due to a
rise in interest income.

FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Hopes of increased bid boost
Esab shares

Shares in Esab, the Swedish welding group, yesterday defied a sharp general
fall on the Stockholm stock exchange as investors gambled on a higher bid
from Charter, the UK industrial group.
In spite of a near 2 per cent fall in the general index sparked by an
unexpected rise in interest rates, Esab B shares rose a further SKr5 to
SKr365, SKr20 above Charter's offer of SKr345 per share.
The takeover ran into trouble earlier this week when five Swedish
institutional shareholders, holding almost 20 per cent of the voting capital
in Esab rejected the Charter bid, saying it was underpriced.
Charter already holds acceptances worth 53 per cent of the votes, but set a
condition of winning 90 per cent acceptances by today's deadline in order to
achieve a complete takeover of the world's largest welding equipment
supplier.
Charter said it would see how holders of the balance of the shares reacted
before deciding its next move, which is not expected before the weekend.
The UK company still insists its bid - recommended by the Esab board and
accepted by Esab's controlling shareholder, the Wallenberg company Incentive
 -is fair, but many minority shareholders believe a higher offer is likely.
Charter has not publicly ruled out raising the bid in light of a sharply
increased profit forecast issued by Esab earlier this week and the rise in
the Esab share price. But Mr Jeffrey Herbert, the chief executive, has also
suggested Charter could pull out of the deal, as its agreement with
Incentive allows if the 90 per cent level is not reached.
However, in Stockholm, shareholders believe Charter will be reluctant to
walk away from an acquisition which so neatly satisfies its long search for
a fourth international industrial arm to add to its interests in building
equipment, coal and rail track equipment.

FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: SKF rebounds to first-half
profit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The recovering European automotive industry provided the impetus for a
strong first-half performance at SKF, enabling the world's leading maker of
roller bearings to rebound to a SKr817m (Dollars 105.1m) profit from a
SKr469m loss.
The result, at the top end of expectations, was driven by a 13 per cent
increase in volumes which pushed sales up 14 per cent to SKr16.6bn.
But it was accompanied by warnings that demand was unlikely to continue to
rise as fast in the second half as in the first.
Mr Mauritz Sahlin, managing director, said: 'There are now signs that
inventory build-ups are beginning to occur. Eventually such build-ups
usually lead to a levelling off in demand.'
The warning did nothing to disturb the group's forecast of full-year profits
of SKr1.5bn. However, general turbulence on the Swedish stock market caused
by higher interest rates saw SKF's B shares fall SKr6 to SKr148.
In the second quarter, profits amounted to SKr511m, swinging from a SKr114m
loss, as sales rose 17 per cent to SKr8.57bn from SKr7.32bn.
The group's revival has been driven by rising demand from European car and
truck producers and double-digit productivity gains. SKF is a significant
supplier to most of Europe's largest vehicle manufacturers, except Renault,
making the automotive sector its largest single customer.
Mr Sahlin said: 'New car sales began to recover in Germany and after six
months matched the level achieved during the preceding year. France and
Great Britain showed improvements in sales, each with second quarters that
were stronger than the first.'
The company said it was continuing to win market share, with supplies to
customers increasing faster than production.
It also benefited from a rising sales trend in the US market and from better
figures from its two other segments, machinery and after-market.
The group's main unit, bearings and seals, swung to a first-half profit of
SKr749m from a SKr251m loss as sales increased to SKr15.4bn from SKr13.5bn.
Ovako Steel also returned to the black, posting a SKr74m profit on sales of
SKr1.92bn. The turnround from a SKr224m loss was helped by restructuring, a
better product mix, higher demand and rising prices, SKF said.

FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Fokus Bank extends recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fokus Bank, Norway's third largest commercial bank, said yesterday that
first-half profits after loan losses rose to NKr178.9m (Dollars 26m), up
from NKr145.8m a year earlier. Lower costs and reduced loan losses
compensated for losses on securities, it stated.
Mr Bjarne Borgersen, the bank's acting managing director, described the
result as 'very satisfying'. The figures consolidate the recovery achieved
last year when the bank reported its first profit for four years.
Fokus was taken over by the state in 1991 during Norway's biggest banking
crisis since the second world war.
Net loan losses for the period fell to NKr32.3m from NKr174.7m, ahead of the
bank's own projections, as total non-performing loans tumbled from NKr2.7bn
to NKr2.09bn.
Expenses were reduced by NKr63.8m to NKr450.3m as part of a sustained
cost-cutting exercise.
This year's turmoil in bond markets provided the main drag on the
performance. Fokus said it suffered a NKr27.0m net loss on securities after
making a profit of NKr89.9m in the first half of 1993.

FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: PepsiCo to launch ready-to-drink
coffee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PepsiCo, the US soft drinks company, yesterday signalled its intention to
launch an assault on one of the few untapped areas of potential growth in
the US beverage industry: the market for ready-to-drink coffee in bottles
and cans.
Its Pepsi-Cola subsidiary said it had formed a partnership with Starbucks
Coffee, the hottest name in the fast-growing US gourmet coffee bar sector,
to develop a range of coffee-based drinks that will be sold through the same
outlets as existing Pepsi-Cola drinks.
Test marketing should begin next year.
Pepsi-Cola said the drinks would be marketed under the Starbucks name
because this had become the prem-ium coffee trademark in the US.
Initially they will probably be sold in bottles from refrigerated units.
However, the partnership is also considering selling hot coffee in cans.
The formation of the partnership will be seen in the beverage industry as an
attempt to emulate the striking success in the US of ready-to-drink iced
tea, which in the last few years has become a Dollars 1.5bn-a-year market.
PepsiCo has already entered the iced tea sector through a similar joint
venture which it formed with the Thomas J. Lipton tea company in January
1992, under which it sells a number of flavoured tea drinks under the Lipton
Original brand.
Ready-to drink coffee is already available in the US, but it is still a
small category.
One company in the business is General Foods, part of the Philip Morris food
and tobacco group, and Coca-Cola is believed to be poised to enter the
market.
The Seattle-based Starbucks has grown from 11 stores in 1987 to become the
leading retailer of specialty coffees in North America, with more than 400
outlets.
In the process it has helped cultivate a taste in the US for gourmet and
specialty coffees.

FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help lift Reed Elsevier to
Pounds 314m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch information and publishing group, yesterday
announced a 12 per cent increase in its first-half following improved
performances by its business and consumer publications.
Profits rose from Pounds 281m to Pounds 314m on sales up 9 per cent at
Pounds 1.5bn (Pounds 1.39bn) in the six months to June 30.
The results were enhanced by a Pounds 15m contribution from new
subsidiaries, dominated by Official Airline Guides - acquired last year for
Pounds 277m - and Editions Techniques, the French legal publisher, which
cost Pounds 77m.
'The acquisitions are doing well and make our full-year prospects very
comfortable,' said Mr Ian Irvine, co-chairman. Profits would have been
higher still, he added, had it not been for lower pension credits and losses
on property disposals.
Operating profits rose by 15 per cent from Pounds 295m to Pounds 340m as the
existing publishing businesses benefited from organic growth and cost
reductions. Cost savings and restructuring helped lift operating margins by
1.3 points to 22.6 per cent.
Mr Irvine warned, however, that flat trading conditions in some sectors
meant the group was unlikely to benefit from price rises in the near future.
Scientific and medical publishing was hardest hit and Mr Irvine said 'the
market remained in deep trouble'. Nevertheless, a reorganisation helped the
area lift operating profits by 9 per cent to Pounds 83m on flat sales of
Pounds 254m (Pounds 248m).
Restructuring also helped the professional publications business, where
contributions from Editions Techniques pushed profits up to Pounds 65m
(Pounds 59m) on turnover ahead 14 per cent to Pounds 247m.
The sharpest increase was reported by the business division. Buoyant
exhibitions activity and gains by Official Airline Guides lifted profits by
34 per cent to Pounds 135m on sales of Pounds 579m (Pounds 515m).
A recovery, meanwhile, in UK advertising and positive Dutch circulation
figures led to increased profits of Pounds 57m (Pounds 48m) in consumer
publications, on a 5 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 426m.
'To increase profits and, more importantly, margins in these difficult
markets is an excellent achievement,' said Ms Christine Munro, media analyst
at Hoare Govett.
Earnings per share at Reed International, the UK publisher with a 52.9 per
cent interest in the Anglo-Dutch group, rose to 23.6p (21p) under FRS 3. It
declared an interim dividend of 6.7p (7.5p).
Elsevier reported earnings per share of Fl 5.11 (Fl 4.41), with a dividend
up from Fl 1.67 to Fl 1.76.

FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Ferguson in agreed Pounds 38m bid for
Elswick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ferguson International Holdings, the mini-conglomerate, yesterday made an
agreed offer worth Pounds 37.7m for Elswick, a rival label supplier.
The move will turn Ferguson into the largest group in the Pounds 600m a year
UK labels market, with a share of about 10 per cent.
Ferguson is offering one new share and 175p cash for every 29.2 Elswick
shares. This values each Elswick share at 18 1/4 p, a 50 per cent premium to
the closing price on Wednesday. Yesterday, the shares finished 5p up at 17p.
Ferguson shares were little changed at 356p.
Mr Denis Cassidy, Ferguson chairman, admitted that the company was paying a
'full price' for Elswick, but said this was partly to warn off any other
predators. 'We understand other companies may have become interested.'
He added that the offer valued Elswick at an exit multiple of nearly 18 on
historic earnings per share close to the sector average.
'We wanted a business that would be a major step in the development of our
core label business. Elswick does that. It brings together two high quality
businesses with similar trading styles operating in complementary sectors.'
Ferguson specialises in supplying labels for the garment and food
industries, while Elswick is strong in the toiletries and car care sectors.
Mr Cassidy said the deal would be earnings dilutive in the year to February
28, becoming earnings enhancing in year two.
The company is to issue up to 7.5m new shares, with the cash part accounting
for Pounds 12.4m of the offer. Gearing will jump from the present 12 per
cent to about 60 per cent, and increase further as investment is made in the
new business. Mr Cassidy said he was confident that the synergies from the
takeover would become evident 'fairly quickly'.
Elswick made operating profits of Pounds 3m last year on turnover of Pounds
54.2m, 75 per cent of which emanated from its labels business. The remainder
came from an agribusiness based in East Anglia.

FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Investment programme leads to loss at
Division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Division Group, the first UK virtual reality company to float on
the main market, rose 8p to 146p yesterday, despite half-year figures
showing a loss of almost Pounds 1m.
The company warned a month ago that it would incur a deficit, tempering the
news with the announcement of a strategic alliance with Hewlett Packard, the
US electronics group.
Division floated in May last year at 40p.
The operating loss before tax and interest in the six months to the end of
April amounted to Pounds 945,000. After Pounds 53,000 in interest received,
the loss to shareholders was Pounds 982,000 or 2.6p a share. No dividend
will be paid, in line with company policy.
Turnover was Pounds 2.11m, against a comparable Pounds 914,000 and equal to
turnover for the whole of 1993.
Mr Iann Barron, chairman, said the loss reflected investment in product
development and marketing. There had been signs of increasing maturity in
the virtual reality - advanced computer simulation - market. In March the
company delivered what it believed was the world's largest virtual reality
system to Matsushita of Japan.
A development team had been established in North Carolina and expenditure
would continue at a high level.

FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Relationship sours after 26 years - The
Scholes-ABB disagreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER AND DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The breakdown in relations between Scholes Group, the medium-sized UK maker
of electrical installation equipment, and Asea Brown Boveri, Europe's
largest electrical engineering group, looks at first glance to reflect a
classic mismatch between giant and minnow.
Scholes agreed late last month to a Pounds 96.1m takeover bid from Hanson,
the Anglo-US conglomerate. But on Wednesday it said it was open to higher
offers and revealed that, when the Hanson bid was received, it had reached
an advanced stage of discussion with Felten &amp; Guilleaume of Germany to
replace ABB as technology partner.
ABB has a 4.5 per cent stake in Scholes, and has given an irrevocable
undertaking to accept the Hanson bid. But for Scholes to be seeking to
replace ABB indicates how far relations between the two companies have
deteriorated in the past three years.
Early in 1991, amid much fanfare, they announced the formation of two
important UK joint venture companies, strengthening a relationship that had
begun in 1968 with a licensing agreement. The first, ABB Wylex Sales (51 per
cent owned by the UK company) was to sell the products made by the second,
ABB Wylex Product &amp; Development (51 per cent owned by ABB).
This was an expanded version of a 1980, Scotland-based joint venture
producing high performance miniature circuit breakers. But it would offer a
range of new products supplied by ABB, including protective equipment,
infra-red sensors and emergency lighting systems.
The 'little and large' element of the deal was apparent at the time - ABB's
research and development spending alone was more than 10 times Scholes'
annual turnover. But both sides saw attractions.
For Scholes, the deal was intended to bring protection from the shocks of
the European Single Market. The late Mr Reg Harrington, then chairman and
chief executive, foresaw dramatic changes in a UK market which still had
about 50 installation equipment suppliers, against three or four for each of
the main continental European markets.
With aggressive foreign companies buying into the UK market, he saw a
broader technology relationship with ABB, Europe's largest installation
equipment supplier, as the key to Scholes' survival.
ABB, meanwhile, hoped that access to 1,500 Wylex outlets would enhance its
position in the UK installation equipment market, where it had been less
successful than on the Continent.
The two sides' accounts of the breakdown vary, but at least they agree on
one point - that the relationship was not living up to expectations.
Scholes' talks with F&amp;G show it would be happier working with a company
nearer to its size. But Mr Eric Drewery, chief executive of ABB in the UK,
rejects the notion that the difference in size made failure inevitable.
'ABB is made up of many large and small companies and the relationship was
between Scholes and ABB Stotz-Kontakt in Germany,' he says. 'The big world
of ABB did not impinge on the relationship.'
Instead, he says, 'there was a mixed bag of problems, some small and some
large, which meant we had not got the mileage we expected out of the joint
ventures. We felt that Scholes could have penetrated further with the
technology we supplied'.
Mr Bill Riches, chairman of Scholes, says the two had come to recognise that
their arrangements were not working as envisaged and relations became 'quite
strained'.
One particular flashpoint has been the two-year negotiations for Scholes to
buy Hanson's Crabtree electrical equipment interests.
Mr Riches says that two years ago ABB indicated it would support a Scholes
offer for Crabtree, contribute Pounds 12m to Pounds 15m (increasing its
stake to 10 to 15 per cent) and support the enlarged group with its
technology.
But after BMW's purchase of Rover, he says, ABB decided it would not put new
money into minority interests involving its technology unless it had some
guarantee that it would eventually lead to control. Scholes could not
provide such a guarantee.
Mr Drewery says ABB had little interest in a minority stake in the enlarged
company, and was not in the business of becoming 'a friendly banker' to
Scholes. It likened its position to that of Honda at Rover to explain why it
did not want an enlarged stake in the bigger group.
Due to this impasse, Scholes started looking for another European partner
that would do more than just supply technology, and started talking to F&amp;G.
Mr Riches claims that ABB, seeing the writing on the wall, went to Hanson
with support for a bid for Scholes.
Mr Drewery emphati-cally denies this - as does Hanson - and says the idea of
a bid for Scholes was Hanson's alone.
Mr Riches says that, if a deal with Hanson is not concluded, he is confident
that replacing ABB as Scholes' technology partner would not be contrary to
its interests. F&amp;G would even be better.
ABB, meanwhile, hopes Hanson will succeed. Mr Drewery believes the combined
Crabtree/Scholes business will be more effective in marketing ABB's products
in UK than Scholes was alone.

Shares in Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management company, yesterday rose 13p
to 97p after a confident statement by Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman.
Speaking at the annual meeting, Mr Waddell said the first quarter showed a
'satisfactory improvement' over last year.
'This reflects a strong performance in the waste services businesses, which
has more than offset a disappointing quarter at Rechem,' he said.
Mr Waddell said Rechem had suffered from the continuing uncertainty over the
importation of waste for incineration, repeating the comment he made earlier
this year that it was crucial that government statements on importation
regulations be implemented.

A 22 per cent rise in turnover helped Reed Executive, the recruitment
agency, move from pre-tax losses of Pounds 177,000 to profits of Pounds
2.78m in the 26 weeks to July 3.
Mr Alec Reed, chairman, said the high fixed costs of the business meant
'even a small fluctuation in turnover means large movement in the bottom
line': interim sales rose from Pounds 43.2m to Pounds 52.8m.
'The state of the economy has now recovered to the level where we are
experiencing candidate shortages', said Mr Reed. He added that margins were
improving as a result.
Earnings per share were 3.3p compared with losses of 0.9p, while an interim
dividend of 1p (nil) is declared.

December year end.
That compared with a fall of 0.8 per cent in the trust's benchmark - the
FT-Actuaries World Index - but represents a 9 per cent advance on the year
ago figure of 253.6p.
Net revenue for the six months amounted to Pounds 1.53m, against Pounds
1.76m. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p, payable from earnings of
1.89p (2.18p) per share.

Mr Paul Townsend, chairman, said CRP's only active subsidiary, Victor Mara,
which makes theatre scenery, continued to show a disappointing performance.
Trading conditions in its business were likely to remain competitive and
unpredictable.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at Unit Group, the USM-quoted pallet maker, widened from Pounds
388,000 to Pounds 1.66m in the year to end-March.
The deficit was split between trading losses of Pounds 1.07m, and closure
and reorganisation costs of Pounds 580,000. During the year the company
consolidated operations on a single site at Golborne, Warrington.
Turnover fell from Pounds 18.9m to Pounds 16.8m.
At the end of May, Unit raised Pounds 1.26m before expenses through a
subscription and rights issue which, together with the sale of a former
engineering site, helped cut gearing from 135 per cent to 34 per cent. Mr
John Adams, chairman, said: 'The group is now operating comfortably within
its existing banking facilities.
'The immediate priorities are to achieve a further reduction in operating
costs, improve production efficiency and recover increased timber costs by
price increases.'
Losses per share were 29.8p (6.3p) and again no dividend is proposed.

In a letter to shareholders, Equifax said that if the board was concerned
that its 600p a share offer would be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, then it should wait for a judgment before advising shareholders.
Trans Union has offered 50p less, but because it has no UK operations its
bid has no risk of a referral, whereas Equifax's offer is conditional upon

Taylor Woodrow, the construction, property and housebuilding group, has
raised Pounds 30.8m from the sale of the west London headquarters of the
Amoco oil group.
The office building in Hangar Lane, constructed in 1986, had a current book
value of Pounds 28.5m. It has been sold by Taylor Woodrow's property
investment subsidiary to Sun Alliance and London Assurance.
The property produced a net rental income of Pounds 2.35m last year. Taylor
Woodrow said the sale proceeds would be used initially to reduce group
borrowings and to re-invest in the group's mainstream activities.
Net debt at the end of last year of Pounds 123m represented 23 per cent of
shareholders' funds. The group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 30.2m (Pounds
94.5m restated loss) in 1993.

FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Wembley disposals likely as deficit widens
to Pounds 9.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wembley, the debt-burdened stadium and greyhound track operator, yesterday
hinted at further disposals following a sharp increase in first-half losses.
The group, which announced a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 9.73m for the half
year to June 30, against restated profits of Pounds 2.58m, may sell its US
greyhound track operations to help meet a Pounds 38.4m debt repayment due by
the year-end.
Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman, is thought to have held talks with possible
bidders for UTR, the North American greyhound business, but no formal
agreement has been signed.
UTR contributed Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 600,000) to group operating profits of
Pounds 6.82m (Pounds 11.3m).
Of the group's other divisions, the Wembley Complex made profits of Pounds
5.3m (Pounds 5m); GRA, the UK greyhound business, saw profits rise to Pounds
1.5m (Pounds 1.2m) while Leisure Services reported gains of Pounds 600,000
(Pounds 300,000).
Sir Brian played down the pre-tax losses, saying they were almost entirely
because of a restatement of goodwill on Pacer Cats, the computer ticketing
business.
Earlier this year Wembley sold a 50 per cent stake in Pacer Cats to meet a
Pounds 40m debt repayment, but had to write back Pounds 18.7m of goodwill
previously written off to reserves.
Following the bank repayment, interest costs fell from Pounds 8.01m to
Pounds 7.08m.
Sir Brian, however, pointed to increased turnover on continuing operations
of Pounds 63.2m - up 8.2 per cent from a restated Pounds 58.4m - and said
full-year prospects were encouraging.
Wembley is considering refinancing proposals from three rival groups: Apollo
Advisers, the US investment house led by Mr Leon Black; Allied
Entertainments, the promotions business run by Mr Harvey Goldsmith; and City
entrepreneurs Mr Luke Johnson and Mr Hugh Osmond.
'It is hoped that the board will be able to present a proposal to
shareholders during the second half,' Sir Brian said.
Restated losses per share came out at 4.35p, against earnings of 0.39p; the
company said it was unable to declare interim dividends on ordinary or
preferred shares.

FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Purchases and joint ventures boost CIA
Group to Pounds 2.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIA Group, the UK's largest independent media buyer, increased interim
profits by 23 per cent from Pounds 1.89m to Pounds 2.32m pre-tax in spite of
a sharp increase in operating costs due to expansion.
Acquisitions and joint ventures mean that the USM-traded group now operates
in 13 cities across six European countries - a year ago its operations were
confined to three cities in the UK.
Mr Chris Ingram, chairman and chief executive, said that 1994 would mark the
move from 'being a UK group with growing international business to a genuine
European group'.
Turnover for the six months to June 30 increased by 73 per cent to Pounds
212.3m (Pounds 122.9m), while operating costs jumped from Pounds 5.57m to
Pounds 12.3m. Mr Ingram said the cost base had increased significantly 'as a
result of putting in place the infrastructure for building and running a
considerably larger and more complex organisation operating on a
multinational basis'.
In the 1994 second half and moving into 1995, the higher costs would be
covered by a much larger business base, he said.
Organic growth in existing businesses was 20 per cent in the first half,
helped by the recovery.
Earnings were 2.76p (2.77p). The interim dividend is 0.51p (0.487p).

FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: GPA shores up balance sheet with Dollars
1bn package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA, the aircraft leasing company, has successfully launched a Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m) aircraft lease portfolio securitisation package which should
substantially strengthen its balance sheet and enable it to meet the terms
of the financial restructuring worked out with its bank creditors in October
1993.
Alps 94-1 as it is known (the first is called alps 92-1) is being fully
underwritten by Lehman Brothers, and is a Dollars 998.2m securitisation,
which will acquire 27 aircraft from GPA's fleet of 480. The 27 aircraft have
an average lease life of five years, and the seven tranches of
investment-grade bonds and securities amounting to Dollars 782m within the
alps 94-1 package, have been designed to match the leases in terms of
maturity and return.
The Dollars 782m is split 53 to 47 in fixed and floating interest rates with
coupons ranging from Libor plus 48 basis points for the variable rate notes,
to Treasuries plus 100 basis points for the fixed rate notes. Some Dollars
71.2m of class D (unrated) notes are being bought by General Electric
Capital Corporation and Dollars 144.5m of class E notes by a subsidiary of
GPA, to complete the Dollars 1bn package.
Mr Patrick Blaney, chief executive of GPA, said the alps launch 'represents
a giant step for GPA. It is a continuation of the work we started with the
restructuring last October, and will continue the process of GPA's
recovery'.
The restructuring requires GPA to repay Dollars 700m to Dollars 900m of
principal on Dollars 3bn debt up to the end of 1996 plus interest. Mr Blaney
said the new package would enable GPA to meet the terms of that
restructuring.
The group has no commitments to purchase new aircraft from Boeing or Airbus
before 1997, or with McDonnell Douglas before 1995. Deliveries of the latter
may be postponed.

FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: F&amp;C warns on progress of markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust warned yesterday that stock markets may
have difficulty in making progress, partly because of the rapid expansion of
the US economy.
The UK's second largest investment trust after 3i reported a fall in net
assets from 148p to 134.2p per share during the six months to June 30.
However, net assets per share rose 9.6 per cent compared to June 1993's
figure of 122.4p.
The share price fell 10.9 per cent in the first half against a 13 per cent
drop in the FT-SE-A All-Share Index. The trust blamed fears of higher
inflation and rising interest rates, particularly in the US, for the falls.
Mr John Sclater, chairman, said: 'Concern about future inflation and higher
interest rates is adversely affecting market sentiment. To a large degree
this is based on fears that the US economy is expanding too rapidly.'
However, Mr Michael Hart, chairman of F&amp;C Management, said that he did not
rule out the possibility of the FT-SE 100 reaching 3,500 by the end of the
year.
The trust benefited from a 25 per cent rise in the Japanese index through
its 13 per cent holding there, but it was weakened in falling markets
elsewhere by its gearing, part of which was in yen.
F&amp;C has traditionally followed a policy of borrowing to gear up in falling
markets in order to buy cheap stocks.
Mr Hart said that though the aim was to borrow in a weak currency, where the
yen was concerned 'we got it wrong.' He believed, however, that the yen
would weaken.
After-tax revenue declined from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 9.31m due to a sharp
fall in bond income. The expenses of running the trust's savings scheme,
through which private investors can make regular contributions, have been
rising fast, according to Mr Hart and the trust will be made more
cost-effective. Details are to be announced in the autumn.
Total net assets were Pounds 1.41bn, down from Pounds 1.56bn at the start of
the year.
Earnings per share dropped from an adjusted 1.13p to 0.88p. The interim
dividend is 0.6p, against an equivalent 0.575p - the board's intention is to
recommend a final of 1.23p, making a total of 1.83p - a 4 per cent increase.
At the end of June, the trust's asset mix was UK - 43.6 per cent; North
America - 21.1 per cent; Europe - 13.5 per cent; Japan - 13.4 per cent; Far
East - 5.7 per cent and others - 2.7 per cent.

FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Property side helps TransAtlantic rise 46%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TransAtlantic Holdings, the insurance and property group, yesterday
announced a 46 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 30.2m to
Pounds 44.2m in the first half to June 30.
Most of the rise was attributed to property investment income from the
group's shopping centres, which rose to Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 14.4m), and to
its half share in the profit from Sun Life, which increased from Pounds
18.5m to Pounds 22.5m.
While Sun Life achieved a 19 per cent rise in new regular premium business,
to reach Pounds 68m, TransAtlantic sounded a note of caution about prospects
for 1994 as a whole.
It said that the life and pensions market overall was showing signs of
contraction and the year-on-year increase was not likely to be sustained for
the full term.
The board is paying an unchanged interim dividend of 6p. Mr David Fischel,
managing director, said this was in accordance with the group's normal
policy of proposing an interim dividend of half the previous year's total.
The group recorded an exceptional profit of Pounds 13.3m from the flotation
of Capital Shopping Centres, the regional shopping centre company in which
TransAtlantic retains a 75 per cent stake. There was an exceptional Pounds
400,000 loss relating to the disposal of investment properties.
Capital &amp; Counties, a wholly owned subsidiary of TransAtlantic which
includes CSC, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 29.8m (Pounds 12.8m) for
the first half. Income from property investment rose to Pounds 42.1m (Pounds
35.8m).
Alongside the flotation of CSC, Mr Donald Gordon, TransAtlantic's chairman,
highlighted the acquisition of the Harlequin shopping centre in Watford for
Pounds 162m in February. This contributed Pounds 4.2m of the property
investment income.
Earnings per share rose by 38 per cent to 8.26p (5.98p). The shares rose 3p
to 381p.

FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Johnson Cleaners' shares fall on gloomy
statements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johnson Group Cleaners' shares yesterday slid 9 per cent to 287p as the dry
cleaning and textile rental group announced a 5 per cent drop in interim
pre-tax profits and warned the full-year return was likely to fall this
year.
Mr Terry Greer, chairman, said the first half had proved difficult in both
the dry cleaning and the textile rentals businesses. Profits had fallen from
Pounds 8.7m to Pounds 8.2m on sales up 2 per cent to Pounds 83.2m for the 26
weeks to June 25.
He expected no material improvement in the second half and said it was
'unlikely that the results for the full year will match those of 1993.'
The gloomy statements should not have come as a surprise to investors who
had been warned of difficult trading conditions both at the year-end and at
the annual meeting.
However, analysts pulled back forecasts for the full year from about Pounds
18m to Pounds 17m after the announcement.
Analysts cited disappointment that Johnson Group had not yet got to grips
with the losses in the US franchise business, which they estimated was
losing up to Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) a year. Johnson also suffered its
first real setback on textile rental, with margins estimated to have fallen
by 2.7 points to 19.6 per cent.
Mr Greer said textile rental in the UK had been hit by price pressure and
the costs of developing its new business of supplying uniforms to the food
sector. The textile rental division returned operating profits 8 per cent
lower at Pounds 4.6m, on sales 5 per cent higher at Pounds 23.5m.
The contribution from dry cleaning fell by 4 per cent to Pounds 3.98m on
sales marginally higher at Pounds 59.7m (Pounds 59.3m). Adverse weather in
the UK and the absence of any revival in discretionary spending by consumers
meant that sales had remained virtually flat, Mr Greer said.
The interim dividend is held for the fifth consecutive year at 2.8p. This
contrasted with Johnson's decision last year to increase the final pay-out
for the first time in three years.
Earnings fell by 7 per cent to 10.44p.
COMMENT
The drop in Johnson's share price may reflect the fact that the market is
finally beginning to realise this company will be a late bloomer in any
recovery. Evidence from previous recessions shows Johnson picking up after
four years of recovery. So far, the UK has enjoyed two. The setback in UK
textile rental is disappointing, but the group still enjoys the highest
margins in its peer group. The one big question is how long it takes the
company to get to grips with the US losses. This, like dry cleaning, will
depend on recovery. The forecasts of about Pounds 17m for this year leave
the shares on a prospective p/e of about 14 times. This looks about right
given the gloomy prospects this year.

FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Rights issue helps Select Appointments fund
US buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Select Appointments, the international recruitment group, yesterday
accompanied news of its sixth acquisition in a year with a financial
restructuring.
The Dollars 32m (Pounds 21m) purchase of New Boston, a US recruitment
business, doubles Select's turnover and will help move the lossmaking UK
group into profit. New Boston consists of five speciality employment
agencies based in New England. Turnover last year was Dollars 49.8m, with
operating profits of Dollars 3.65m. Select reported a reduced loss of Pounds
642,000 last year, on improved sales of Pounds 35m.
Select is launching a Pounds 44m rights issue to fund the acquisition, the
balance being used for the refinancing.
It is issuing 352m new ordinary shares at 12 1/2 p, on a 1.64-for-1 basis. A
consortium of Swiss investors, which own 90 per cent of existing shares,
have opted not to take their full allocation in order to widen the
shareholder base. As a result, their 260m new shares will equate to 80 per
cent of the new issued capital, and the remaining 90m shares have been
placed with institutions.
Select will use Pounds 15m of the rights issue to redeem its preference
shares, all of which were bought by the Swiss investment consortium in order
to fund the group's ambitious expansion strategy.
Mr Zach Miles, Select's finance director, said that the company was
searching for further acquisitions. 'Our strategic plan is to be
geographically spread in different markets. The recruitment business is
cyclical and by being in different locations we can develop a stable income
stream.'
He added that Select had already moved into profit prior to yesterday's
acquisition, and that New Boston would boost this year's results further.
Select shares firmed a quarter of a penny to 13p.

FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: BOC suffers from Forane factor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC, the industrial gases and healthcare company, continued to suffer from
depressed sales in pharmaceuticals following the expiry of the patent
protecting Forane, its main anaesthetic gas in the US.
The US market was split evenly with the sole competitor, Abbott Laboratories
of the US, BOC said. It was 'reasonable to assume that there will be further
competitors' in the next year or two.
Profit margins for industrial gases also edged lower in the third quarter
and the shares fell 31p to 714p.
An exceptional Pounds 85m charge announced earlier this year depressed the
company's results in the nine months to June 30.
Pre-tax profit of Pounds 169.3m compared with Pounds 261.6m for the same
period in 1993 but matched analysts' forecasts.
Earnings per share before the exceptional item were slightly lower at 32.54p
(33.24p). BOC said this was largely the result of the increased number of
shares in circulation.
The gases business saw profits rise to Pounds 243.7m (Pounds 231.3m) for the
nine months, on sales of Pounds 1.85bn (Pounds 1.7bn).
Industrial activity and demand improved in most countries, particularly in
the US and Australia, said the company, 'but pricing pressures have not
generally abated'.
Healthcare profit fell by 42 per cent to Pounds 42.8m (Pounds 73.8m) as a
result of competition to Forane. A new anaesthetic gas, Suprane, increased
its market penetration.
The Pounds 85m provision was made for restructuring programmes, of which
Pounds 60m was for the healthcare business and the remainder for gases. The
programme began this year and will extend over three years. When complete,
BOC expects it to produce savings of about Pounds 60m a year.
Third quarter margins were supported by the early benefits from the
restructuring programme, said the company.

FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Ferranti business sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Matra Marconi Space, the satellite joint venture between GEC-Marconi and
Matra of France, has bought Ferranti International's satellite
communications business from the receivers. The price has not been
disclosed, but is thought to be relatively low.
The Ferranti unit employs about 100 people. It designs and manufactures
ultra high frequency satellite data terminals and microwave radio relay
systems.
The deal follows the purchase by Matra Marconi in July this year of the
satellite business of British Aerospace. The merged group, Europe's leading
satellite manufacturer, turns over about Pounds 750m and employs a workforce
of more than 2,000 people.
Earlier this year, Arthur Andersen, Ferranti's receivers, agreed in
principle to sell the company's principal defence businesses to GEC rather
than to a management buy-out team. Ferranti went into receivership last
December after GEC withdrew an offer of 1p a share.

FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: S&amp;N poised for acquisitions - Healthcare
group likely to have net cash position by year end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smith &amp; Nephew, the healthcare group, is 'actively looking for
acquisitions', Mr John Robinson, chief executive, said yesterday.
A disposal earlier this week left gearing at just 4 per cent, and the
company is likely to have a net cash position by the end of 1994, he said.
The target could be in a similar business to Smith &amp; Nephew's areas of
expertise such as keyhole surgery equipment, said Mr Robinson. It could,
however, be in a new area provided there were synergies such as the
possibility of using S&amp;N's existing sales staff.
This week's disposal of Ioptex, the lossmaking eye surgery products company,
led to an exceptional Pounds 148m charge in the interim results, published
yesterday.
Excluding the charge, pre-tax profit for the six months to July 2 were
Pounds 82.2m, within analyst's forecasts and a rise of 12 per cent on 1993
when restated to conform with FRS 4 accounting rules.
These call for convertible preference shares then in issue to be
reclassified as debt and their dividend as interest.
Turnover was Pounds 486m, an underlying sales increase of 7 per cent.
Adjusted earnings per share were 5.04p and the interim dividend is 2.02p,
both up 7 per cent.
With dividend cover now at the company's target of 2, pay-outs would now
rise in line with earnings growth, Mr Robinson said.
Operating profit margins rose from 16.5 to 17.1 per cent, reflecting higher
production volumes and efficiency improvements and an increasing proportion
of sales coming from higher technology products.
Mr Robinson said that target operating profit margins had almost been
reached.
Most of the company's product areas saw sales grow by 8 to 11 per cent,
about the same as in 1993. The exception was in commodity products like
surgical gloves, where sales fell.
Consumer healthcare, including Elastoplast plasters and Lil-lets tampons,
saw the sharpest increase in growth rates, from 2 per cent in 1993 to 10 per
cent this time. The Simple brand of cosmetics did well, but the figure was
flattered by restocking.
US sales growth slipped from 7 per cent to 6 per cent, although Mr Robinson
said that the effect of US healthcare reforms had 'flattened'.
Continental European sales growth fell from 7 per cent to 4 per cent as
France and Spain clamped down on health spending. Mr Robinson said that
France had a better close to the half.
COMMENT
Disposals and organic growth have been S&amp;N's routes to bring innovation,
high margins and decent growth to the mundane end of the healthcare
business. The company should make about Pounds 175m for the full year,
giving a p/e of 14.5, just under the market average. That combination of
lowish risk and steady growth makes S&amp;N an attractive investment compared
with the uncertainties of drug companies; but it looks pedestrian compared
with cyclical stocks in other sectors. There are few reasons to sell S&amp;N
shares but, until management finds some clever acquisitions, even fewer to
buy them.

FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Sotheby's achieves 22% rise to Dollars
23.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sotheby's Holdings, the parent company of Sotheby's, the New York-based
auction, finance and real estate operation, reported improved second-quarter
and first-half results, helped by the continuing recovery in the
international art market.
For the six months ended June 30 pre-tax income rose by 22 per cent to
Dollars 23.3m (Pounds 15m) against Dollars 19.1m. Auction revenue rose from
Dollars 114.5m to Dollars 122.3m as overall revenues rose by Dollars 8.45m
to Dollars 132.4m. Net income per share increased from 21 to 25 cents.
Auction sales for the second quarter increased 5 per cent to Dollars 530.8m,
while over the six months they rose 9 per cent from Dollars 635.2m to
Dollars 692.1m.
The figures confirm the slow improvement in the international art market
highlighted last month when Sotheby's announced sales 15 per cent up at
Dollars 1.38bn in the 1993-94 season. Rival Christie's reported an 11 per
cent increase in turnover to Dollars 1.17bn. Two smaller London-based houses
also registered improvements last month, Phillips gaining 12.5 per cent to
Pounds 88m and Bonhams 21 per cent to Pounds 33.9m.
Ms Diana Brooks, Sotheby's Holdings president and chief executive, said:
'Our auction sales for the six-month period increased 9 per cent and reflect
a pattern of broad-based growth in many collecting categories, principally
due to strong results for a number of single-owner sales.'

FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: British Bus makes further purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Bus, the acquisitive Salisbury-based transport group, is buying
Derby City Transport, owned by its managers and employees, for Pounds 7m.
This is the third acquisition by British Bus since June, when it received an
equity injection of Pounds 30m and arranged new debt facilities of Pounds
35m.
The deal is part of a broader plan to consolidate the competitive position
of British Bus relative to its two main rivals, Badgerline and Stagecoach.
Derby City Transport is unusual among bus companies because of its ownership
of taxis and rental car franchises. Its managers and employees paid Pounds
4m for the company in 1989 and had a refinancing with Pounds 1.5m of equity
capital from NatWest Ventures in 1993.
Mr Martin Bodenham, a partner at KPMG Peat Marwick in Nottingham, which
handled the sale for the shareholders, said that during the last three
months there had been a flurry of approaches by the large bus groups.
British Bus owned 22 per cent of the company through Luton and District, one
of its recent acquisitions, which had been a trade investor in the original
buy-out.

FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: SCI buys 'strategic' stake in Plantsbrook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Service Corporation International, North America's largest funeral group,
yesterday continued its aggressive foray into the British burial business by
buying a 3 per cent stake in Plantsbrook, the sector's largest quoted
company.
SCI claimed this was a strategic stake, but said that it was interested in
buying further shares.
The announcement came just one day after the Texan company received approval
from the Takeover Panel to put forward a recommended 775p for Great Southern
Group, the only other UK listed funeral company.
Plantsbrook is 46 per cent owned by Pompes Funebres, France's largest
funeral business, and it is understood that SCI's strategy could be to
secure a ring-side seat if the parent considers asset sales.
It had informed both Pompes Funebres and Plantsbrook of its share purchases,
which have taken place over recent weeks.
Pompes Funebres controls around one third of France's funeral market, in
addition to interests in Belgium and Singapore, and SCI has made no secret
of its ambitions to use Great Southern as a springboard for expansion into
Europe.
SCI was also concerned that Loewen Group, its largest North American
competitor, might consider turning its attentions to Plantsbrook, after the
failure of its attempts to block SCI's Great Southern bid.
Plantsbrook controls about 9 per cent of the UK funeral market, compared
with Great Southern's share of some 4.5 per cent.

FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Charges push Tiphook loss up sharply to
Pounds 331m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The share price of Tiphook, the debt-laden transport leasing company, rose
by 10 per cent as fears of a rights issue diminished, but pre-tax losses for
the year to April 30 jumped from Pounds 21.8m to Pounds 331.1m.
The shares added 4p to 38p, as Tiphook reiterated the commitment of its
bankers, which control the destiny of a company with gearing of 1,551 per
cent.
Net debt almost halved from Pounds 1.02bn to Pounds 512.5m during the year,
following the sale of its container leasing company. However, shareholders'
funds fell from Pounds 215.1m to Pounds 33.3m.
The container sale continues to throw up some difficulties. Transamerica,
the purchaser, is proposing a further cut of Pounds 11.4m, in addition to an
initial Pounds 12m adjustment from the Pounds 734m purchase price. This has
been fully provided for.
However, Tiphook had originally estimated Pounds 31.8m of costs associated
with the sale and financial restructuring, while the actual amount charged
was Pounds 19.5m.
The 1994 figures included exceptional items of Pounds 295.7m (Pounds 75.3m),
and Pounds 75.9m (Pounds 72.1m) in interest charges.
The sale of the container division resulted in a loss of Pounds 124.8m,
while there was a further Pounds 168m taken under operating activities.
The company has been reduced to two core divisions, Trailer Rental and Rail
Wagon Rental, which both saw substantial profit declines during the year. To
reflect its new composition a name change is planned to Central Transport
Rental Group.
Due to the earlier sale of 9,532 of its older trailers, the division
achieved average utilisation of 74.1 per cent in 1994, compared with 56.6
per cent.
However, on lower rental rates operating profits before central costs and
exceptional items were Pounds 18.3m (Pounds 31.8m).
The Rail Wagon operations' operating profits fell from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds
800,000.
Mr Rupert Hambro, chairman, said: 'We are acutely aware of our very high
level of borrowing. With our continuing drive for economies and cost
reductions we have reasonable expectation of seeing margins improve.'
Tiphook was also looking to 'take appropriate steps to improve our financial
structure.' There is no dividend. Losses per share came to 301.1p (41.2p).
COMMENT
The key to Tiphook's survival has probably been the size of its
difficulties. With more than Pounds 1bn of debt, Tiphook's bankers had a lot
to lose. Nevertheless its future remains uncertain. Financial reconstruction
is inevitable, meaning substantial dilution for shareholders. In addition,
the company has to resolve problems such as a Pounds 156m obligation to
purchase trailers in 1996, for which no funding is in place. An improving
European economy could provide some joy, but at this stage the risks are far
more striking than the rewards.

Fyffes, the Dublin-based fruit and vegetable distributor, has succeeded in
establishing its first foothold in the German banana market with the
acquisition of a 70 per cent stake in JA Kahl for about IPounds 8m (Pounds
7.9m).
Kahl, which Fyffes said was expected to have sales of IPounds 60m in the
year to December 1994, is based in Munich, where it has a modern
distribution and banana ripening centre. It is one of the main fruit and
vegetable distributors in the Bavarian region.
Mr Carl McCann, group finance director, said the acquisition represented an
'important step' in the group's expansion into continental Europe and its
modern facilities, with a direct link to the German rail network, created
'good prospects to grow the business'.
The German market is particularly important for Fyffes' European expansion
as per capita consumption levels of bananas there are among the highest in
Europe.
This is Fyffes' second acquisition in Europe this year, having spent IPounds
15.9m last month in acquiring a 50 per cent stake in Velleman &amp; Tas, a
leading banana and fresh fruit distributor in the Netherlands.
Earlier this year, Mr McCann said he expected to spend about half of the
group's IPounds 80m cash on acquisitions during 1994, and he confirmed
yesterday that that remained his goal. Some IPounds 12m was spent on
acquisitions in Spain and Denmark last year.
Mr McCann said the combined annual turnover of the four acquisitions
amounted to IPounds 350m, and the total outlay, including deferred payments,
amounted to IPounds 40m.
Fyffes has set itself a target of selling 26m boxes of bananas in Europe
this year, up from 18m in 1993. In the medium term, the group hopes to
source a large part of this increase from a 9,000 acre plantation
development in Guatemala which it helped to finance.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Philips trebles with help from the World Cup

Philips, the Dutch electronics group, more than trebled its profits in the
second quarter of 1994, beating even the most optimistic of analysts'
forecasts.
It also predicted a substantial increase in full-year earnings now that it
has begun to feel the effects of economic recovery in some European
countries.
Part of the second-quarter rise was due to higher sales of colour television
sets in the run-up to this summer's soccer World Cup.
Philips' shares jumped to a new 12-month high of Fl 58.50, but fell back
slightly later in the day to close at Fl 57.80, a rise of Fl 1.90.
Philips said: 'We are rather more encouraged with respect to the future than
we were some six months ago.'
Net profit surged to Fl 402m (Pounds 147m), from Fl 117m before
extraordinary items in the second quarter of 1993. First-half net profit
totalled Fl 662m, up from Fl 220m last year.
Turnover advanced 6 per cent in the quarter, pushing first-half turnover up
3 per cent to Fl 27.96bn. Sales volume in the first six months rose by 8 per
cent, easily outstripping an average 2 per cent fall in prices.
'Some of this growth comes from increased sales of televisions, stimulated
by the World Cup, and is probably not sustainable,' said Mr Dudley Eustace,
finance director. The soccer-inspired sales are thought to be the main
reason behind the 14 per cent increase in consumer electronics turnover in
April-June.
Mr Eustace noted that the decline of the dollar, which is negative for
Philips, was another reason why the strong second-quarter and first-half
performances could probably not be matched in the rest of 1994. However, the
company expected 'substantially better' full-year results.
The heavy restructuring of the early 1990s was paying off, enabling the
management to concentrate on 'revitalising' the company. On Wednesday, for
example, it announced a Fl 500m investment in its Dutch semi-conductor
plant, the biggest single investment since the company ran into difficulties
in 1990.
The semi-conductors and components sector saw first-half operating profit
nearly double to Fl 750m. Consumer electronics swung into an operating
profit of Fl 211m from a loss of Fl 113m, helped by a halving of losses at
Grundig in Germany. Communications equipment activities in Germany continued
to suffer from lower investment by the country's telecommunications
authority.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Royal Insurance confirms recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Insurance, the composite insurer, yesterday confirmed the extent of
its recent recovery when it posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 191m for the
first six months, Pounds 139m more than last year.
Royal's figures, which reflect buoyant trading conditions in the UK market,
exceeded expectations.
The insurer recorded an underwriting profit of Pounds 78m in the UK, where
between 1990 and 1992 it was badly hit by heavy weather and
recession-related losses.
Mr Richard Gamble, group chief executive, said his company's performance was
its 'best ever' in the UK, and the results were as good as those of
competitors. 'We are back with the pack,' he said, adding that the group was
'better placed than ever before to maintain a disciplined approach to any
change in market conditions'.
UK underwriting profits from domestic (home buildings and contents) business
amounted to Pounds 53m, with the company's operating ratio (claims plus
expenses as a percentage of premiums) falling to 83.7 per cent from 101.5
per cent last year.
In the US, Royal was hit by losses of more than Pounds 17m from the Los
Angeles earthquake and a number of heavy weather claims. Total US
underwriting losses were Dollars 185m (Pounds 119m) against Dollars 153m.
Canadian underwriting losses fell to CDollars 32m (Pounds 15m) and the group
broke even on its underwriting in other international territories.
Analysts were encouraged by a higher than expected increase in the interim
dividend to 4p, from 2.5p. The shares gained 6p to close at 265p.
Mr Stephen Bird, an analyst with Smith New Court, said that despite this
week's positive news from insurers, investors have shown little interest in
the sector and still fear competition could damp profitability.
Royal's worldwide general insurance premium income rose 3 per cent in
underlying terms to Pounds 1.78bn. Long-term premiums fell 3 per cent to
Pounds 607m.
Total investment income showed a small reduction to Pounds 243m, against
Pounds 245m. Worldwide new annual life premiums rose 3 per cent to Pounds
51m, with new single premiums falling 12 per cent to Pounds 282m. The
group's estate agencies incurred losses of Pounds 6m and loan interest
amounted to Pounds 16m.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Thomas Cook buys Barclays' travellers cheques subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thomas Cook, the world's second largest supplier of travellers cheques after
American Express, said yesterday it had acquired the third biggest supplier,
Interpayment Services.
Neither side would disclose how much Thomas Cook was paying for the Barclays
Bank subsidiary.
Interpayment is the world's largest issuer of Visa travellers cheques,
generating annual sales of about Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.5bn) in 145
countries. The deal increases Thomas Cook's share of the Dollars 54bn
travellers cheque market from 17 per cent to 30 per cent.
Thomas Cook is 90 per cent owned by Westdeutsche Landesbank, Germany's third
biggest bank.
Mr Alex Jablonowski, managing director of Barclays Global Services, said
that the sale was part of the bank's strategy of focusing on its core
businesses.
Barclays, which this week announced first-half pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.04bn, would not say what profit the travellers cheque subsidiary had
generated.
Mr Graham Rider, Thomas Cook's managing director of financial services, said
that the deal would enable the company to sell travellers cheques through
many more banks than is possible now.
Thomas Cook's cheques carry its own logo, together with that of MasterCard.
In Europe, the cheques also carry the sign of euro travellers cheque
International (etcI). Mr Rider said many banks around the world would sell
either MasterCard or Visa travellers cheques, but not both.
The acquisition would allow Thomas Cook to sell Visa cheques as well as
MasterCard, he said.
Mr Rider said that the Thomas Cook MasterCard and the Interpayment Visa
brands would continue to operate separately. They would have discrete sales
and marketing strategies but would use the same distribution and processing
facilities.
Barclays said it would continue to sell Visa travellers cheques through its
branches and customers would not notice any change.
The acquisition goes some way to helping Thomas Cook close the gap on
American Express, its traditional travellers cheque rival, which has 44 per
cent of the world market.
A history of Thomas Cook, written with the company's co-operation, concedes
that American Express invented the travellers cheque in 1891.
American Express admits, however, that persuading Thomas Cook's offices
around the world to honour its cheques was a crucial step towards their
wider acceptance.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Shell optimistic despite 7% fall: Recovering demand and
higher oil prices relieve disappointing figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Dutch/Shell yesterday sought to offset news of a sharper than expected
decline in second quarter profits with encouraging comments on the outlook
for oil prices this year.
Demand was increasing more rapidly than expected and prices could remain
above second quarter levels for the rest of the year, the group said. The
statement contrasted with Shell's warning in February that it expected oil
prices to remain depressed.
Although crude prices were on average 12 per cent lower during the second
quarter at about Dollars 16.05 a barrel, by the end of the period they had
recovered to levels similar to those achieved in the same period of 1993.
Disrupted production in Nigeria had helped prices improve further since
June. 'The signs are more optimistic,' the company said.
Shell announced a 7 per cent drop in profits on a replacement cost basis -
which excludes the effects of inventory changes - to Pounds 574m for the
second quarter. Interim profits were 4 per cent lower at Pounds 1.52bn.
The second quarter decline was due to lower oil prices and a sharp drop in
refining margins, as well as charges and currency losses totalling a net
Pounds 211m. This included a Pounds 322m gain on a property sale in Hong
Kong.
Stripping out the Pounds 133m net exceptional charges and Pounds 78m in
currency losses, underlying profits fell by 12 per cent to Pounds 785m. This
was some Pounds 100m less than had been expected, and Shell's shares in
London were marked down by 12p to 718p.
Analysts said they were disappointed at the performance of the exploration
and production business, which saw profits fall by 43 per cent to Pounds
233m in the quarter. 'BP and Chevron managed to offset oil price weakness
with cost reduction,' said Mr Fergus McLeod of brokers NatWest Securities.
'That does not seem to be coming through at Shell.' Shell began to cut costs
later than its rivals, but is acknowledged to be an efficient company with
less fat to cut.
The upstream business was hit by a higher tax rate as well as the low oil
price and exceptional items. This offset the benefits of higher volumes in
both oil and gas. Shell increased its net crude production and natural gas
sales outside the US by 8 per cent.
Downstream activities such as refining and marketing were also affected,
returning profits 10 per cent lower at Pounds 455m. Refining margins were
particularly weak in the Far East - in Singapore they fell almost 40 per
cent.
The chemicals business returned to the black with profits of Pounds 92m
before exceptional charges of Pounds 162m. After the charges - mainly
related to a fire in a US petrochemicals plant, property losses and asset
sales - losses were more than halved at Pounds 70m. Shell said the division
was showing encouraging growth, with volumes 11 per cent ahead in the
quarter.
Metals incurred a Pounds 108m loss, reflecting costs related to the Pounds
1.14bn sale of Billiton to Gencor. Shell is planning to float its Australian
mining assets and sell its Chilean copper mine this year. These disposals
are expected to more than offset the metals loss.
Interim dividends for Royal Dutch and Shell Transport, which account for 60
and 40 per cent of the group's profit respectively, will be announced on
September 15.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Reed Elsevier plans to gear up for US bid: Anglo-Dutch
publisher eyes two targets and seeks New York listing as profits rise 12%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch information and publishing group, yesterday
said it was considering making a bid to expand its presence in the US.
The group has been conducting due diligence on Ziff Communications, the
world's largest publisher of computer magazines, and Mead Data Central, the
electronic information arm of Mead Corporation, the US paper group, and is
expected decide whether to make an offer for either next month.
Mr Ian Irvine, Reed Elsevier's co-chairman, said the group made first-half
operating profits in the US of Pounds 134m, against Pounds 107m. Gains in
North America helped lift pre-tax profits 12 per cent to Pounds 314m.
Acquisitions in English language markets are part of the group's long-term
strategy, but Mr Irvine warned that the current prices demanded for Ziff and
Mead Data 'were nowhere near our expectations'.
City analysts said Ziff - the privately held publisher with annual sales of
about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) - was on the market for between Dollars 2bn
and Dollars 3bn, while Mead Data - the world leader in providing on-line and
CD-Rom legal information - could fetch more than Dollars 1bn.
Mr Irvine said Reed Elsevier would be prepared to borrow up to Pounds 1bn to
finance acquisitions, but would proceed only if the target businesses
promised to generate substantial cash.
Analysts said such borrowings could increase full-year interest payments to
more than Pounds 80m. Net interest expenses in the first half nearly doubled
to Pounds 26m on net borrowings of Pounds 552m.
Mr Irvine ruled out a rights issue to finance the deals, saying debt funding
would prove cheaper as long as the group maintained its healthy cash flow.
At the interim stage, operating cash flow stood at Pounds 217m.
Mr Pierre Vinken, co-chairman, said the group would also raise its profile
in North America by seeking a listing in New York. 'This move recognises the
increasing importance of Reed Elsevier's business in the US and the desire
to achieve a broader ownership of shares in Reed International and
Elsevier.' It could also make it easier to raise dollar-denominated loans.
Analysts suggested that plans for large US acquisitions and the New York
listing were hatched by Mr Peter Davis, Reed Elsevier's former co-chairman
who resigned in June. Mr Vinken, however, said: 'Mr Davis's departure had
nothing to do with strategic differences. It was all about refocused
responsibilities.'
The group is next week expected to announce a compensation package for Mr
Davis, who earned Pounds 636,592 last year including performance related
bonuses. Although one analyst said he could receive Pounds 800,000, Mr
Irvine said: 'The package will be well within the maximum that could have
been paid.' Shares in Elsevier, which is planning a 10-for-1 share split to
improve liquidity, ended down Fl 2.10 at Fl 171.90 in Amsterdam. Reed
International shares closed down 22p at 806p in London.

FT  12 AUG 94 / US sets Bosnian Serbs deadline on peace plan: Clinton
threatens to seek lifting of arms embargo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday set a deadline of October 15 for Bosnian
Serb acceptance of an international peace plan or the US would urge the
United Nations Security Council to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia. The
proposal won swift support from France.
As well as putting extra pressure on the Bosnian Serbs the US
administration's purpose appeared to be aimed at heading off congressional
moves to force the president into a unilateral lifting of the arms embargo.
But in this it failed. Shortly after the announcement, the Senate approved
the Clinton-backed proposal 56-44. But it also approved 58-42 a separate
proposal for Congress to order the president to lift US participation in the
embargo on November 15, if there was no peace agreement by then.
In Paris, Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, said France was
backing Mr Clinton's deadline. If the Serbs had not accepted the peace plan
by then, France would lift the arms embargo, but he warned such a move would
not be good for the people, for UN forces or for peace. The situation of UN
peacekeepers must be clearly defined before the embargo could be lifted so
they were 'not exposed to a generalised war'.
Mr Clinton wrote to Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the armed services
committee: 'If by October 15 the Bosnian Serbs have not accepted the Contact
Group's proposal of July 6, 1994, it would be my intention to introduce
formally and support a resolution at the UN Security Council to terminate
the arms embargo.'
The Bosnian Serbs have refused to accept a peace map drawn up by the
so-called Contact Group, consisting of the US, the UK, France, Germany and
Russia, which has led the negotiations. The map roughly divides
Bosnia-Hercegovina into equal shares between the Serbs and a Croat-Moslem
federation.
Meanwhile, Russia yesterday called for the lifting of the economic embargo
on Serbia, which has cut links with the Bosnian Serbs. The foreign ministry
said the sanctions are now 'illogical and counterproductive', as Serbia
appears to have kept its word on the blockade.
The president's letter to Senator Nunn states US concerns about the impact
of unilateral action to lift the embargo, according to extracts made
available to the Washington Post. It states that US relations with its
allies would be 'seriously strained', co-operation with Russia put in
jeopardy and the likelihood of US military involvement 'increased, not
decreased'.
The Bosnian army, which would profit most from access to western heavy
weapons, yesterday continued to make advances against Bosnian Serb troops.
In Sarajevo, UN efforts to feed the city blockaded by Bosnian Serbs suffered
another blow when gunfire hit cargo aircraft, forcing the suspension of the
relief airlift. In the city, sniper fire killed an 11-year-old girl.

Interest rate rises in Sweden and Italy yesterday set alarm bells ringing in
bond markets across Europe. But the logic which suggests that other
countries are bound to follow looks flawed. Sweden and Italy both face
specific problems in reducing their budget deficits which are not replicated
elsewhere.
True, their moves are a reminder that a general turn in rates is inevitable
once the recovery is firmly entrenched. But despite falls of over 1 point in
the German government bond market, the Bundesbank is unlikely to tighten in
the short term. Indeed if currency pressures on high deficit European
countries intensify, a strong D-Mark may speak for delay.

FT  12 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Shell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As far as their views on oil prices are concerned, BP and Shell seem
suddenly to have switched roles. BP, traditionally bullish, was distinctly
lukewarm last week while Shell, historically cautious, now appears more
upbeat. The change is curious since, as yesterday's interim figures showed,
Shell benefits less than BP from a higher oil price. Not only does Shell
have more downstream business, where margins tend to be squeezed when the
oil price rises; it also has more exposure to high tax rate countries, which
damps the earnings impact of price fluctuations.
Even allowing for that and for an undisclosed tax hit in the second quarter,
the fall in Shell's exploration and production earnings compared with the
first three months was disappointing. Nor was there much sign of the
benefits of Shell's cost-cutting programme, but then it was always
unrealistic to expect the same sort of transformation being wrought at BP,
given that Shell was much more efficient to start with.
For oil price bulls, there is greater upside in BP which is also more geared
to recovery in European petrochemicals while Shell will suffer more pain
from the slump in east Asian refining margins. Although BP's share price has
outperformed Shell's over the past two years, it still stands at a fat
earnings discount which is increasingly hard to justify.

FT  12 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Royal Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal has trailed the top flight of UK insurance companies for so long that
yesterday's half-year figures are something of an event. Pre-tax profits to
the end of June were Pounds 191m. That is Pounds 10m higher than reported by
Commercial Union earlier this week and only a shade less than General
Accident. Yet the market values Royal at around Pounds 1.7bn, against Pounds
2.6bn for GA and over Pounds 3bn for CU. Unless Royal's earnings are
significantly lower quality than those of its rivals, this relative
valuation is difficult to defend.
Royal's exposure to UK domestic property insurance is certainly a reason for
caution. Last winter was especially benign in terms of weather. While all
the composite insurers will have to accept lower margins in the UK as rate
competition increases, Royal's mix of business could lead to more volatile
returns. Its performance in the US also remains a concern. Even allowing for
the impact of bad weather in the first quarter, Royal is struggling to turn
the business around. If the company can start to convince on that score,
though, it will deserve a rating more in line with its peers.

FT  12 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Reed Elsevier
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The trouble with highly-rated companies like Reed-Elsevier is that they have
to run fast to stand still. The fall of nearly 3 per cent in Reed's shares
after yesterday's interim results suggests disappointment with the pace of
organic growth. The impact of last year's acquisitions, notably Official
Airline Guides (OAG), accounted for Pounds 15m out of the Pounds 33m
increase in pre-tax profits. But to worry too much about how much organic
growth may be evident at any one stage of the cycle may be to miss the
point. Reed Elsevier's longer term future depends heavily on how the group
is reshaped by acquisitions.
The good news is that OAG seems to be working well. The bad news is that the
two large companies at which Reed Elsevier has been looking, Ziff and Mead
Data, look expensive. Though Reed is generating large amounts of cash, it
would not wish to see its interest cover reduced below six or seven times.
It thus has around Pounds 1bn to play with. It cannot afford both Ziff and
Mead and needs to negotiate indicated prices down substantially. There is
little danger of it overpaying, but some nimble footwork is required before
the next large purchase is secure.

FT  12 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Dividends on Offer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was nothing remotely shocking in yesterday's review of distribution
prices by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator.
By demanding one-off price cuts in distribution ranging from 11 to 17 per
cent, Prof Littlechild has reduced the companies' rate of return. By running
down dividend cover, releasing provisions and finding additional
efficiencies, though, the regional electricity companies should be able to
deliver real dividend growth of at least 5 per cent - and probably more -
until the end of the decade. While utilities are always prone to political
interference, this looks like a more than adequate return, given the level
of risk.
Exactly how well shareholders are rewarded now depends on the ability of
individual companies to manage costs and cash. Offer's annual efficiency
target for operating costs of 3 per cent is higher than that imposed on the
water companies by their regulator a fortnight ago. But the Recs are quietly
confident. And while the water companies will have to borrow to bridge the
gap between cash flow and capital spending, most of the Recs will enjoy
positive cash flow. All 12 companies have authorisation from shareholders to
buy back shares: their timing could separate leaders from laggards.
Whether the prospect of five years of positive cash flow is enough to flush
out potential bidders is less certain. A predator able to cut costs faster
than the incumbent management and invest surplus cash to the benefit of
shareholders would certainly deserve a hearing. Given Prof Littlechild's
faith in the power of market forces, it is difficult to imagine the
regulator instinctively siding with the defence.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Dishonest directors worsen Russia's debt crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Corrupt factory managers are exacerbating the debt among Russian business
enterprises which is threatening to paralyse the country's economy, a
government report has warned.
The mountain of debt, now estimated at nearly Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.8bn),
has built up as businesses fail to pay suppliers, creating a knock-on effect
that has left some companies unable to pay their employees.
The debt levels are seen as so dangerous that a government commission was
convened last week to address the problem and is reporting weekly to the
president and prime minister.
The government report, written by Mr Petr Karpov, deputy director of
Russia's Federal Bankruptcy Agency, and based on a detailed financial study
of 15 Russian enterprises, alleges that a small number of corrupt factory
directors are helping to undermine Russia's financial system.
The report names Russian enterprises and accuses some factory directors of
shipping goods without receiving payment, in exchange for kick-backs.
'Immoral business is now a widely spread norm of economic behaviour, because
it is profitable,' the report concludes. It urges the government to curb
these corrupt business practices by forcing loss-making companies into
bankruptcy.
Inter-enterprise debt poses one of today's biggest challenges for the
Russian government and is a test of Moscow's commitment to economic reforms.
The arrears, which have worsened since the Russian government tightened
credit after its spring agreement with the International Monetary Fund, are
affecting even the most sensitive sectors of the Russian economy, including
the nuclear power industry.
Now the government is facing a choice between bailing out factories and
perhaps triggering a new wave of inflation, or taking the political risk of
forcing bankruptcies.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Disabled workers' jobs at risk as Portillo enforces EU order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The jobs of thousands of disabled people may be under threat following a
decision by Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, to comply
strictly with a European Union directive on competition rules.
Mr Portillo has authorised the withdrawal of government departments from the
priority suppliers scheme, which helped sheltered workshops for disabled
people, such as Remploy, win government contracts.
The move, following a Commission directive on public supply contracts, was
condemned as another attack on the disabled.
Mr Tony Lloyd, Labour's shadow training minister, said Mr Portillo, who wore
his 'euro-scepticism like a badge', was apparently prepared to accept EU
rules threatening British jobs without a fight. Mr Alf Morris, a former
minister for the disabled, said: 'The government quotes the EC only when it
is convenient to them. They totally ignore the EC on other occasions such as
the case of the social chapter. I'm certain the EC would not mean this
legislation to be applied to the disabled.'
Commission officials expressed surprise at the speedy and unprompted
compliance with the July 14 directive.
It is understood that the UK might be correct in its strict interpretation
of the directive which forbids special relationships with suppliers, but the
Commission said: 'We have not approached the government to abolish this
system. There could have been other ways of dealing with this situation.'
The priority suppliers scheme, sponsored by the Department of Employment,
was set up after the second world war to help workers in sheltered workshops
match the lowest tenders put in for contracts. The Ministry of Defence is
still one of the biggest users of the scheme.
Yesterday the Department of Employment said it was no longer possible for
contracts in excess of Pounds 150,000 to be placed under the scheme because
of the EU rules.
This leaves companies such as Remploy, with 8,736 disabled employees in 95
factories, having to compete on the same terms as other companies, including
those from overseas with cheap labour.
'The Employment Service is working with Remploy to find ways of avoiding any
impact on Remploy workers,' said a department spokesman. Mr Tony Withey,
Remploy chief executive, warned that the effect on the company could be
considerable.

FT  12 AUG 94 / US sets Bosnian Serbs deadline on peace plan: Clinton
threatens to seek lifting of arms embargo

President Bill Clinton yesterday set a deadline of October 15 for Bosnian
Serb acceptance of an international peace plan or the US would urge the
United Nations Security Council to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia.
The administration's purpose appears more aimed at heading off congressional
moves to force the president into a unilateral lifting of the arms embargo
than to put extra pressure on the Bosnian Serbs.
The president's proposal in a letter to Congress came just before the US
Senate was due to consider a separate proposal to order Mr Clinton to lift
US participation in the embargo by November 15.
'If by October 15 the Bosnian Serbs have not accepted the Contact Group's
proposal of July 6, 1994, it would be my intention to introduce formally and
support a resolution at the UN Security Council to terminate the arms
embargo,' Mr Clinton wrote to Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the armed
services committee.
The Bosnian Serbs have refused to accept a peace map drawn up by the
so-called Contact Group, consisting of the US, the UK, France, Germany and
Russia, which has led the negotiations.
The map roughly divides Bosnia-Hercegovina into equal shares between the
Serbs and a Croat-Moslem federation.
Meanwhile, Russia yesterday called for the lifting of the economic embargo
on Serbia, which has cut links with the Bosnian Serbs. A foreign ministry
spokesman said the sanctions are now 'illogical and counterproductive', as
Serbia appears to have kept its word on the blockade.
The president's letter to Senator Nunn states bluntly US concerns about the
impact of unilateral action to lift the arms embargo, according to extracts
made available to the Washington Post. It states that US relations with its
allies would be 'seriously strained', co-operation with Russia put in
jeopardy and the likelihood of US military involvement 'increased, not
decreased'.
The lightly armed but increasingly assertive Bosnian army, which would
profit most from access to western heavy weapons, yesterday continued to
make advances against Bosnian Serb troops. Increased movement of Bosnian
government troops around Sarajevo are an increasing concern for UN forces.
'All this is worrying because any increase in the number of troops can tip
the balance in the area of Sarajevo and Visoko (north-west of the capital),'
a UN spokesman said.
However, around Sarajevo, fighting had reportedly tapered off a day after
the UN threatened both sides with Nato air strikes for violating the heavy
weapon exclusion zone.
The first threat of air strikes directed at the Bosnians had come as the
Bosnian army appeared increasingly keen to launch a fresh military campaign
to take strategic roads from the Bosnian Serb forces.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Rapid gear change to stay in the race: European carmakers
are recovering from recession, but are they sufficiently competitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The grinding of gears has been harsh, but gradually Europe's automakers are
climbing out of the worst recession of the postwar period.
Four of the big six volume carmakers in Europe crashed into heavy losses
last year, as new car sales fell by more than 15 per cent to 11.4m, the
lowest level since 1985.
While the leading European car producers are still struggling to stem the
flow of red ink with drastic restructuring measures, their share prices
have, however, been rising sharply for the past 18 months. In the first half
of this year new car sales have also begun to flicker back to life.
The automotive sector was the worst-performing area in European stock
markets over the past seven years, according to James Capel, the
stockbroker. This year it has been the strongest, and had outperformed
Capel's European JC index by 20 per cent by early August.
Fiat, which incurred the biggest loss in its 95-year history last year and
is paying no dividend on its ordinary shares for the first time since 1947,
has outperformed the Milan market by 38 per cent in 1994.
PSA Peugeot Citroen with its first loss last year since 1984, has
outperformed the Paris bourse by 20 per cent, while Volkswagen, which had a
group loss of DM1.94bn last year, has outperformed the Frankfurt market by
22 per cent.
Though share prices started to rise early last year, new car and commercial
vehicle sales were still plunging precipitously. But some foundation for
such early optimism is finally beginning to appear. New vehicle sales
started to pick up during the first half of this year, arousing renewed
confidence among vehicle makers and their suppliers that recovery is under
way.
'We now expect that 1994 will turn out to be a much better year than we
thought likely at the end of 1993,' said Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN,
one of the leading UK automotive components suppliers.
In the first six months, new car sales in west Europe have risen by 6.8 per
cent to 6.5m. The upturn has been led by the UK, France, Spain and
Scandinavia.
'Western European markets have evidently passed through the nadir of demand,
with many markets now recording quite high rates of expansion,' said Mr
Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman of the management board of BMW of Germany.
With its heavy fixed costs, the auto industry is sensitive to changes in
sales volumes. As demand picks up, allowing plants to be run at higher
production volumes, profits should respond accordingly.
'Assisted by a major shedding of labour, savings in purchasing costs and the
start of a recovery in sales, profits now look set for a strong recovery,
and we are predicting that earnings will reach new highs in 1996,' said Mr
Bob Barber, automotive expert at James Capel.
The turnround is not without pain, however. Recession forced plants to close
in the face of severe overcapacity and tens of thousands of jobs have been
eliminated.
Ford of Europe has reduced its workforce (excluding Jaguar) by 15 per cent,
with the loss of 15,100 jobs since late 1992. Mercedes-Benz, the car and
commercial vehicle subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest engineering
group, cut 14,700 jobs from its domestic workforce in 1992, a further 11,000
last year, and it is planning to cut another 8,000 jobs to bring its
workforce to 151,000 by the end of 1994.
Volkswagen reduced the workforce at its six domestic plants (excluding Audi)
in the past three years by 27,000 to about 102,000 by spring. Higher
productivity and reduced sales volumes mean that it still has about 30,000
surplus employees. For 1994 and 1995, it is operating a pioneering pact with
German trade unions, allowing a big cut in pay and working hours (to a
28.8-hour week) to stave off even more radical job losses.
Most carmakers believe that they have turned the corner after last year's
losses, the scale of which took the industry by surprise. 'No source had
predicted the scale of the disaster until well into the year,' said Mr
Gianni Agnelli, Fiat chairman, recently. After last year's record loss of
L1,783bn (Pounds 730m), Mr Agnelli says the company's full-year result
should 'be better than break-even'.
Past responses to recession have not been enough this time round, however,
and carmakers have had to revamp their strategies.
The European motor industry is undergoing a hectic transition, as the
European Union moves to become an open car market with the removal of all
quota restrictions on car and light commercial vehicle imports from Japan at
the end of 1999. European carmakers are also in a race to become globally
competitive. Their rivals in North America - in particular Chrysler and
Ford, with GM bringing up the rear - have already made huge progress in
closing the competitive gap on the Japanese producers.
The share taken by Japanese carmakers in west Europe may be down this year
as they have been battered by the strength of the yen, but it is likely to
be only a temporary respite. Japanese penetration is still forecast to rise
to about 15 per cent by the end of the decade.
Incursions into the European market are also growing from North America,
both from the big three US carmakers and from Japanese assembly plants in
the US.
European carmakers are fighting back with radical changes of strategy. For
instance, Mercedes-Benz is transforming its new product strategy. Having
accepted the unpalatable truth that its luxury cars were 'over-engineered'
and that it could end up being 'priced out' of world markets, it is planning
to launch vehicles into several new segments of the world market by the late
1990s, including a small family car sized between a Volkswagen Golf and a
Ford Fiesta, and most surprisingly a micro compact car for urban commuting
that it is developing in a joint venture with SMH, the Swiss maker of Swatch
watches.
Restructuring is taking on new forms, as carmakers dispose of in-house
components operations to outside suppliers to allow themselves to
concentrate on the core operations of the design, development and assembly
of vehicles. In its boldest move in this direction Fiat is transferring a
components operation with more than 700 employees to GKN, which is to invest
Pounds 50m in a new plant in Italy.
Belatedly, European makers are also closing yawning gaps in their product
armouries. Volkswagen, Ford of Europe, Fiat and Peugeot are all launching
their first MPVs (multi-purpose vehicles like the Renault Espace) into a
fast-growing sector of the world market until now dominated by Japanese and
US producers.
Such responses may not be enough. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating
agency, warns in a recent report that 'European auto industry fundamentals
are becoming increasingly difficult for the volume automakers'. It says that
Europe's car market is becoming 'more subject to volatile cyclical
fluctuations' as European economies converge. It forecasts that long-term
growth in new car demand will slow, with the main markets 'approaching
saturation'.
The European industry will 'remain beset by significant excess production
capacity', while intensifying competition for market share has led to
rapidly rising marketing costs and aggressive discounting. European
automakers' 'relatively limited' presence in other regions of the world
leaves them highly vulnerable to competitive conditions in western Europe.
It is a catalogue of shortcomings that may temper investors' optimism, which
has sent automakers' share prices soaring in recent months.

General Motors has only itself to blame for the presence in this world of
another potential antagonist.
Uschi, wife of Volkswagen boss Ferdinand Piech and recently delivered of her
third child, a jolly little chap called Gregor, says she fell pregnant last
September - which she claims was also the height of the brouhaha over GM's
allegations of industrial espionage against her 57-year-old husband's newish
recruit, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. 'They got us into such a tizzy
that I clean forgot my pill and it just happened,' she divulges to Stern
magazine.
Perhaps she should consult last year's office diary. Conception apart, the
big events for father Ferdinand last September were actually the sudden
appearance of a whacking loss at VW's Seat subsidiary in Spain, and his
abrupt scrapping of an international finance deal for Skoda, hours before it
was due to be signed. The Lopez affair was going through a rare quiet spell.
Piech himself was not distracted from his one-man crusade to counter
Germany's falling birth rate. According to best estimates, the fruits of the
deceptively
robust auto engineer's loins now number 13.

People who criticise regulators for inadequately explaining the terribly
important decisions at which they arrive might care to glance at Professor
Stephen Littlechild's magnum opus - as a model of how not to go about
things.
Much of the electricity price review is written in the pseudo-approachable
first person. The text runs to 118 pages of analysis and tables. And the
appendix contains a four-line formula replete with Roman and Greek symbols.

Whisper it quietly. The World Bank is about to get a new spin doctor, and
not before time.
Just when it should be basking in the glory of its 50th anniversary, all
sorts of people have been taking pot-shots at it for spending far too much
money on its new headquarters and nowhere near enough on helping the world's
poorest countries.
Instead of '50 more years', there is an increasing body of opinion that the
World Bank slogan should be '50 years is enough'.
Those on the right argue that the markets can take over its role as
investors in developing countries, while those on the left counter that the
bank's programmes hurt rather than help the poor.
Its public image would seem to be in need of urgent repair.
The hunt has been on for some time to find a replacement for Alex Shakow,
the current head of the bank's external relations, who is going to another
job inside the World Bank.
However, the smart money is on Mark Malloch Brown, 40, a Brit who used to
write for The Economist and currently works for a political consultancy in
Washington.
In between he has worked for the UNHCR, helped Corazon Aquino get elected in
the Philippines, and been involved in Refugees International.
Clearly a man who knows his way around the world's trouble spots.

Poor Thames Water. There is a time and a place for everything. It is
unfortunate that the water utility chose yesterday to run a full-page ad in
the Evening Standard extolling the virtues of its new water ring main, an
underground tunnel 8ft in diameter and 50 miles long providing fresh water
for Londoners: 'Thirsty people we Londoners. And with demand for water
growing all the time . . .'
Not yesterday, it wasn't. The paper's front page was dominated by the story
of how the capital's underground railway system broke down when tunnels
flooded after record rains descended.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Observer: Labour's pet grouses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Quite what Islington man thinks about the Glorious Twelfth of August is not
entirely clear, but Labour leader Tony Blair would do well to mind his back
when it comes to the whole subject of huntin', shootin' and fishin'.
Earlier this year, Tony Banks, the talkative animal lover from Newham North
West, demanded the sacking of Baroness Mallalieu and Lord Donoughue from
Labour's front bench team in the Lords after they set up a robust campaign
backing the continuation of field sports.
The urbanised Banks, wrongly as it happens, claimed that the two working
peers were contravening party policy. 'I am not going to listen to people
telling me how to win votes who could never get elected to anything
themselves,' he barked.
Plenty of the party's more famous extra-parliamentary supporters are right
behind the peers. Writer Penny Mortimer was heard to complain recently that
the Tony Banks breed of MP had become 'urbanised' and was in danger of
losing the votes of the party's rural supporters.
Film producer David Puttnam is another field sports type, and even Sam
McCluskie, former general secretary of the National Union of Seamen, turns
out to be a part-time hare courser.
No doubt Blair, in his wisdom, will set his sights on less controversial
targets - full employment, say, and the statutory minimum wage.

Struggling to pass even a much-diluted version of US health reform,
President Bill Clinton will not want to be reminded of the need for deeper
change. But this week's report from the Kerrey Commission on budgetary
reform offers just that. As it stands, the country's tax and benefit system
implies a burden on younger Americans that is both unsustainable and unjust.
Unfortunately, it is also unlikely to be speedily redressed.
Wrung from President Clinton in return for Senator Bob Kerrey's vote in last
year's budget battle, the Commission will only present its final
recommendations in December. But the interim report, published this week,
unkindly clarifies how little the 1993 package improved the country's
long-run fiscal health. After 1998, the federal budget deficit will begin to
rise again. As the Commission points out, interest payments and social
benefits will consume nearly three-quarters of all federal revenues by 2003
and 100 per cent 10 years later. By 2030, total federal expenditures are
projected to exceed 37 per cent of GDP, compared with just 22 per cent
today.
Much of the rise will be driven by the ageing of the population, a burden on
future workers for which all industrial countries must be prepared.
Shouldering it, in all cases, will require three things: a high national
savings rate, rising productivity of existing workers, and a well-structured
tax and benefit system. The US fiscal dilemma is more pressing than that of
many countries, despite the fact that its population is ageing relatively
slowly, largely because its record on all three has been deteriorating.
Fiscal burden
Some steps have been taken, but these fall far short of what is needed. The
Social Security Act of 1983 established a fund to help pay social security
benefits to baby-boomers when they begin to retire in the next century. But
the trust will run out by 2030. In the meantime, the money saved is
effectively spent on reducing the headline federal deficit, which will, in
any case, rise in line with other obligations, such as Medicare.
The fiscal burden will have to be reduced. That means spreading the cost of
ageing more equitably, both across generations and within them. The current
system fails on both counts. Thanks to the rules of the social security
system, payroll taxes must meet the cost of providing benefits to today's
retirees that are two to five times as great as their contributions would
have earned in a private pension system. Moreover, although two-thirds of
direct federal benefits go to people over 65, less than a fifth goes to
those below the poverty line.
Sensible entitlement
Sensible entitlement reform would continue the efforts, begun in 1983, to
make today's workers meet more of the costs of their future retirement. But
it would have to target future benefit payments by means-testing a good
proportion and ensuring that all are taxed, just as non-retired incomes are
taxed. Less than a quarter of entitlements are currently means-tested. Tax
exemptions must be similarly reassessed: these disproportionately favour the
well-off and cost Dollars 400bn - half the total cost of the entitlement
system.
It is hard to exaggerate the political difficulties involved in passing such
reforms. Owing to its varied membership, the Kerrey commission's
recommendations are unlikely to be sufficiently ambitious. But if, as he
claims, Mr Clinton wishes to boost American long-term economic growth
through public investment, serious tax and entitlement reform is the only
possible route. Without it, there is no room for higher spending elsewhere,
however justifiable.
On recent evidence, the coalition in favour of cutting government
expenditures is fragile, at best. And, when the Commission reports in
December, Republicans may be fresh from a strong showing in November's
elections, and unwilling to grant Mr Clinton any legislative triumphs. As
far as budgetary reform is concerned, he is also unlikely to make the
attempt. First, as ex-chairman of the council of economic advisers Herbert
Stein once said, 'the American public will have to make it safe for
politicians to do the right thing'. Thus far, they have not done so.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Littlechild underpowered
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation of the power industry four years ago has, in many
respects, proved a great success. Electricity companies are running a leaner
system which is much more responsive to consumers' needs and delivering cuts
in real prices. But this impressive performance has been marred by the
excessive rewards which have gone to two groups of people: managers and
shareholders.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, industry regulator, has no remit to tackle
the extravagant remuneration packages awarded to executives, almost
regardless of performance. He can and yesterday did, take action to improve
the price regime, which has allowed shareholders to earn far larger returns
from the monopoly businesses than thought possible four years ago.
The review was never going to be an easy task, because the balance of reward
between shareholders and customers had slipped so far in favour of the
former. Dividends have greatly exceeded the City's predictions, and share
prices have, in some cases, risen by as much as three times in value.
Although domestic customers have seen electricity bills fall recently, this
owes more to the decline in generation costs than to price regulation. The
electricity companies have passed virtually all of the benefits of their
improved efficiency through to shareholders, thanks to price formulae which
were devised by a government more concerned with obtaining good
privatisation proceeds than with protecting the interests of consumers.
Partial success
With the initial balance so far out of kilter, it is not surprising that
Prof Littlechild's success yesterday was only partial. On the face of it, he
has been quite tough. He is proposing to force the companies to make a
once-and-for-all cut of between 11 and 17 per cent in their distribution
charges (which account for about a quarter of electricity bills), and then
limit future increases to 2 per cent below the rate of inflation for a
further four years. Together, these actions should produce steady real
declines in household electricity bills up to the end of this century.
Yet stock analysts were calculating yesterday that the companies will still
have sufficient earnings and borrowing capacity to sustain real dividend
increases of at least 6 per cent a year for the foreseeable future. If that
turns out to be the case, it will raise questions about the effectiveness of
Prof Littlechild's new regime.
Efficiency gains
One reason why excesses may continue is that the potential efficiency gains
in the electricity industry remain far greater than was ever imagined at
privatisation. Even though companies have shed thousands of jobs and reduced
their operating costs by impressive amounts, they are still only part-way
through the cost-cutting process. Indeed, in the cat-and-mouse game that is
inevitably being played between regulated companies and their regulator,
there is an incentive for management to underplay the scope for
rationalisation in order to secure softer price targets.
There are other factors as well. Most electricity companies have paid off
their debts, which means that there is considerable capacity for gearing up.
The companies are also about to sell off their prize asset, the National
Grid Company, which will enrich their coffers still further. And if the
much-predicted shake-out of the industry materialises, there will be
efficiency gains from mergers and takeovers too.
Prof Littlechild has to ensure, of course, that his price regime does not
damage the electricity industry's ability to deliver a vital service and
maintain improvements. But all these factors indicate that there is little
danger of this: indeed they constitute a case for setting more demanding
targets than he did yesterday.
Now that the deed is done, however, it would be a mistake to add a threat to
reopen the price review, within the designated five-year period, if the
electricity industry were once again to offend public opinion with the size
of its earnings and salaries. That would only create inhibiting uncertainty.
Ultimately, the country's interest lies in having the most efficient
electricity industry possible, and that can best be achieved by allowing
managements to exceed their targets if they can, rather than threatening to
confiscate any excess gains. The pity, though, is that the targets are not
tougher.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Clinton's cling-ons: Calls for an end to the closed world of
the White House press corps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was only a single-sentence paragraph, about the presidential trip to
Europe in June, but, to the dyspeptic eye, it leapt out of the page. The pen
was wielded by Maureen Dowd, as elegant a writer as any on the New York
Times. Her target was the cellular phone-carrying yuppies on the White House
staff supposed to look after the travelling media.
'Another day, the White House marooned 24 reporters and staffers in the
misty British countryside for 12 hours, unable to figure out a way to get
our group 100 miles from Cambridge to Portsmouth, the next stop on the
president's schedule.'
It is the presumption - that it was the White House's fault - that gets the
goat. For it means the English-speaking White House press corps no longer
has the capacity or responsibility to move itself, using public or private
transport, a short distance across a country which uses much the same
language and credit cards. Ms Dowd added, with self-deprecation, that even
using the phone was a problem as 'the instructions . . . were in British'.
Michael Lewis commented on the same trip for the New Republic as someone who
is not a regular pack member. He wrote: 'To strike out on one's own, it
turns out, is in violation of the code of White House correspondents. No
matter how hard I try, a senior White House journalist explains to me, I
will never escape 'the womb'.'
This is seriously worrying, or ought to be. Pack journalism is bad enough,
but surely cosseted pack journalism, divorced from the realities of life, is
worse. The womb, also known as the steel cocoon, can only provide a warped
view.
The White House press corps may be the most egregiously privileged and
insular, but its attitudes are hardly unique. The gaggle of British soccer
hacks covering the World Cup finals declined to take advice on a simple way
to enter the Rose Bowl - namely via a public gate - insisting instead on the
long lines of the media entrance because Fifa officials required it and
could thus be blamed for the delay. It had to be somebody else's fault.
The Westminster lobby, the Japanese press clubs, even, presumably, the
cliques (or is it claques?) of ballet critics take pride in their
exclusivity and privileges. The only differences are the Americans do it on
a grander, if not more efficient, scale and do not exclude those not from US
news organisations from holding a White House press card (on the basis of
this column, the FT may soon be issued a job lot).
The tendency to bite the hand that feeds (and carries the luggage, and books
the hotel rooms and provides the transport and, oh, also briefs) is perhaps
most pronounced in the White House bear garden. A colleague on the
president's most recent trip reports how a famous network correspondent went
ballistic in Bonn when a bus driver had problems negotiating a tight turn,
so risking losing the convoy.
In her tantrum, she seemed not to have realised the improbability of a
German bus driver not knowing his way to the only local airport (Cologne)
big enough to handle Air Force One and the 747 'zoo' plane carrying the
press (first class reserved for the networks, naturally; business class for
the US writing hacks, most foreigners; and staff in the back).
Now, being a White House (or Westminster) correspondent is not the easiest
beat. The compensations of ample air time and front-page space do not
necessarily offset the long hours, cramped working conditions and the
frustration of not being able to roam freely throughout government. It
sounds glamorous but often is not.
The simple solution is to let the sun shine in. It may be impossible to
abolish the White House press corps or its international counterparts, and
it would be counterproductive not to arrange adequate facilities for them to
file their stories. But let them travel on their own, eat on their own and
book their own hotels.
For one thing, it would be cheaper. The White House gets good discounts on
hotels but charges roughly 1 1/2 times the first-class air fare, and bills
for luggage handling, too. It would also free the White House staff to do
something sensible. But, most to the point, it would reintroduce the media
to those who watch TV and read newspapers.
In the Washington Post recently Henry Allen suggested modern journalists,
now so much part of the establishment, were losing touch with their roots.
Were the newspaper industry to face the Titanic's fate, he wrote, 'maybe if
they started having more fun and less respectability right now, if they had
more product and less by-product, more output and less input, more craft and
less profession, they might not go down at all'.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Children neither seen nor heard: A steep fall in the birth
rate means demographic worries for east Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British author, PD James, recently wrote a novel called The Children of
Men. It is set in England in 2021 and describes how infertility has spread
like a plague. The human race faces extinction as scientists try to reverse
the trend. At the end of the book, a woman gives birth, but whether this is
enough to save the human race is left open.
German demographers and doctors could identity with this work of fiction:
five years since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the birth rate in east
Germany continues to plummet.
Mr Horst Halle, head of the maternity department at the Charite, east
Berlin's largest hospital, first noticed the trend in early 1990. 'You just
had to look at the statistics,' he explained. 'Before 1989, there were about
16,000 babies born each year in east Berlin. Today, that figure has slumped
to 6,800, a decline of about 60 per cent.
'In the Charite itself, we used to record about 2,200 births a year. Today,
we have fewer than 1,800, and we are doing better than most maternity
hospitals in east Berlin.'
Such an unprecedented fall in the birth rate would have shocked the former
communist regime in East Germany. It prided itself on its wide range of
social services aimed at providing women with excellent childcare facilities
to encourage them to have children.
Then, day-care centres were free. Women could take a year's paid maternity
leave and return to a guaranteed job, or take off three years with generous
state support and still have the same job to go back to. Indeed, more than
90 per cent of the female working population were employed, compared with 49
per cent in west Germany. By the age of 21, east German women started having
children, unlike their west German counterparts, who generally started a
family in their mid-to-late 20s.
Despite these incentives, however, the birth rate in east Germany was
relatively low compared with most other east European countries under the
communists. Mr Jurgen Dorbritz, a demographer at the Federal Statistics
Office, says: 'What we are now seeing in eastern Germany is a birth rate
which is falling from a low base. That is the worrying aspect. That's what
makes the statistics so extraordinary.'
In 1989, there were 198,922 live births in east Germany, the equivalent of
12 births per 1,000, or about 1.6 children per family. This was the same as
in west Germany. By 1993, the number of east German births had fallen to
79,926 - or about 60 per cent of the 1989 rate - the equivalent of 0.8
children per family, or only half the west German level.
'We just don't know how long this trend will continue. One thing is certain.
There will be very few children born between the years 2015 and 2020 because
of the lack of women of child-bearing age. Can you imagine how difficult it
is going to be to pay for the number of old people in our country?' said Mr
Dorbritz.
According to the latest statistics from the German Association for Pension
Insurance, the number of people under the age of 20 in east Germany will
fall from 3.84m in 1993 to 2.6m in 2020; the number of people aged between
20 and 60 will fall from 8.7m to 7.6m; and those over 60 will rise from 3m
to 4.13m. The percentage of pensioners per 100 contributors to the state
pension insurance system will rise from 26 per cent in 1993 to more than 50
per cent by 2020.
Mr Halle, who has worked in the Charite for 28 years, believes there are
several reasons why east German women are remaining childless. 'Demographers
tend to ignore the fact that we had been expecting a sharp fall in the birth
rate in the year 1995, regardless of unification. This is because the east
German abortion law of 1972 made abortion available on demand. We knew we
were not going to have many child-bearing women in the mid-1990s,' he
explained. In 1972, the birth rate fell to about 6 per 1,000, climbing back
to about 12 births per 1,000. Today it is fewer than 5.1.
But Mr Halle also believes that the process of German unification itself has
had a profound social effect on east German women. 'A young east German
woman knows that if she becomes pregnant, the chances she will find a job
are now far less, especially given the high level of unemployment,' he said.
East German women have borne the brunt of unemployment, which is officially
16 per cent of the working population, excluding those on short-time work,
early retirement schemes, or job creation programmes.
By the end of the first quarter of this year, more than 790,000 east German
women had lost their jobs, representing a female unemployment rate of 23 per
cent. In west Germany, 1.1m women, or 9.3 per cent, are out of work. 'East
German women today have freedom of choice, but they have lost their status
in society,' said Mr Dorbritz.
The other pressure arising from unification is that many east German women
have had to seek new qualifications, retrain, or change jobs more often,
unlike the former days when a job was for life. 'There is no more security.
The widespread sense of uncertainty has played a major role in the decline
of the birth rate,' said Mr Dorbritz.
The freedom to travel has played its part in the decline of the birth rate
as well: young east German women have an unprecedented chance to go abroad
before they settle and start a family.
'There was hardly anything else to do before 1989,' said Mr Dorbritz. 'East
German society was geared towards encouraging young women to procreate. All
those social planks of free kindergartens, both parents in a job, heavily
subsidised or free children's clothes and shoes, have now disappeared.'
Greater mobility and open borders have led to a sharp rise in migration from
east Germany to west Germany. More than 1.2m from a population of 17m east
Germans went to live in west Germany between late 1989 and early 1991.
'Many of these people were young and skilled,' said Mr Nicholas Eberstadt, a
demographer at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research.
'Of the overall drop in the birth rate, roughly one-ninth can be attributed
to the sheer decline of east Germany's population during those two years.'
Staff at the Charite hospital know that, unless the birth rate increases,
the obstetricians, doctors and nurses could be without a job. 'We have 2,000
beds here,' said Mr Halle. 'Before unification, we were dealing with more
than 2,200 women a year. If we cannot account for all the beds, we will be
under pressure to make savings. That means cutting jobs.'
But his main concern is the kind of society which will evolve in east
Germany in the next century. 'The prognosis is very bad,' said Mr Halle. 'I
do not know how we are going to fend for the elderly. Who is going to pay
for them?' One answer might be to allow immigrants into the country under a
quota system to replenish the population - a solution advanced by some
liberals.
One thing is clear. Mr Eberstadt believes that, if the present trends in
east Germany continue, it will be virtually impossible for what he calls
'generational replacement' to occur.
'For generational replacement, eastern Germany's women of child-bearing age
today would have to give birth to an average of about 2.07 infants over the
course of their lives. They are now having 0.8 children, less than one birth
per woman per lifetime. This is not enough for a net population
replacement.'

<TEXT>
Sir, 'Coal production is falling from fashion - and production is down  - in
virtually all European countries,' says Michael Smith ('Coal cleans up its
act for a power struggle', August 3). This is for the very simple reason
that indigenous production is relatively uneconomic. The Canute-like efforts
of the Spanish socialists to maintain coal production in the Puertollano
region, underwritten by the long-suffering Spanish consumer and aided by
pork barrels from the European Commission, which itself is maintained by
long-suffering taxpayers, cannot alter the facts that IGCC (integrated coal
gasifier with combined cycle) is a deeply flawed concept. The flaws are its
cost and efficiency relative to lower cost and unglamorous conventional
plant.
Here in Denmark, the fuel conversion efficiency of 1992-commissioned,
squeaky-clean, super-critical but conventionally fired coal plant is already
46 per cent, 16 per cent better than any figure ever acknowledged in any of
the FT's articles for the 'best coal-fired power stations'. High-quality
coal, at a landed price well below Pounds 1/GJ, is imported from all over
the world.
As materials for boilers and designs for steam turbines continue to improve,
the efficiency of the conventional coal-fired steam plant by the end of this
decade will, in Denmark, continue to stay ahead of anything foreseen by the
IGCC - and at much lower first costs. In fact, a 450 MWe unit is being
planned for commissioning by 1998, not far from my home here in Denmark,
which will convert coal to electricity with a conversion efficiency of 48
per cent. In combined heat and power mode, it will be around 90 per cent
efficient.
New, better and cheaper methods of flue gas cleaning demonstrate acid rain
emissions from low-cost coal at levels comparable with those from IGCC.
Current events in Nigeria and Algeria, together with continuing instability
in the Commonwealth of Independent States, underline the madness of the
European-wide 'dash for gas' in power generation. Continued pork barrelling
by politicians and manufacturers, and the interference in the market
mechanisms by European Commission amateurs, will leave our children
dangerously exposed to a squeeze between high-priced or even unobtainable
gas, obsolete, inefficient coal-fired plants and taxpayer-subsidised,
technological monsters like IGCC.
When are we going to wake up to reality?

FT  12 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wrong purchasing approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES ENSOR.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Whitehall could save Pounds 130m on consultancy' (August
5), highlights an important weakness in government purchasing. Matters have
been getting worse rather than better. The Department of Trade and Industry
recently abandoned its long-standing central computer database of
consultants because 'departments know who to contact'. This inevitably means
yet more concentration upon the generally expensive, en-trenched suppliers
listed in your table.
It is fashionable to attack the European bureaucracy. But purchasing
consultancy ap-pears to be handled better in Brussels and Luxembourg, where
most director-generals maintain computer databases and all projects are open
to competitive tender. Significantly, the largest firms obtain a far smaller
share of this business, and it is simpler for potential bidders to find out
about projects being mooted than with UK departments.
The Cabinet Office report does not appear to have addressed the increased
cost of using committees (often of eminent retired industrialists) to assist
departments in assessing tenders. In our experience, remuneration of these
experts can exceed sums paid to a consultancy for doing a project.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Personal View: Riding tandem along UK superhighway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HARPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The communications industry is facing a future of im-mense potential with
the development of a new generation of broadband 'information superhighway'
networks delivering telephone, computer, television and other services.
Using optical fibre and advanced electronics, these networks will enable
visual and virtual reality images, speech, sounds and graphics to be
communicated instantly between any two points on the globe.
Today, it can only dimly be visualised what will develop from this: a new
dimension to commerce and industry; a revolution in education, medicine,
shopping and leisure; quite possibly a decisive cut in the need for physical
travel and thus in energy consumption, pollution and traffic congestion; and
a new medium for political activity.
Telecommunications carriers such as BT have good reason to push broadband.
Growth of conventional telecoms is slowing. The carriers have turned to
specialised international business services; but the market for these is
limited and competition is fierce. Broadband for their home markets is the
big opening on their business horizon.
The report on optical fibre networks by the House of the Commons select
committee on trade and industry, published on July 27, is the first
all-party parliamentary judgment on the UK telecommunications regime. It
makes three principal criticisms. UK policy is too concerned with
infrastructure and competition in existing services and needs to be
refocused on broadband services; there is little sense of urgency about
broadband development; and there is a lack of a clear sense of vision about
what broadband could do for the UK and its people, in contrast to the type
of leadership being shown in the US.
The US is seizing the high ground. The US administration has forward-looking
legislation before Congress which in particular will enable cable TV and
telephone companies to compete in each other's business areas. US telecoms
operators are planning to invest millions of dollars in a broadband
adaptation of the coaxial cable technology traditionally used by the cable
TV industry. US computing and entertainment interests are scrambling to
dominate the world market for broadband applications. Japan is not far
behind. The challenge to Britain and the rest of Europe is pressing.
Britain is a world leader in optical fibre broadband technology. However, it
is bogged down by dispute about a regulatory ban, rooted in the thinking of
the 1980s, which excludes BT from cable TV in order to protect Britain's
combined cable TV and telecoms operators. There is right on both sides. The
cable companies are committing large investments in reliance on this ban.
But, as the principal national operator, BT has a role in broadband which
should not sensibly be denied. The select committee has proposed lifting the
ban on a franchise-by-franchise basis, with protection in any given
franchise lasting only seven years. This is fair and workable. But even if
accepted by government, it would take years to have effect nationally. I
suggest an alternative which would cut through the difficulties and work
more rapidly.
The cable companies plan to invest Pounds 6bn just to create conventional
facilities for two-thirds of the population. They would have to spend a lot
more to upgrade to broadband. A national broadband network would cost BT
Pounds 15bn or more. All this investment would be risky. Both investment and
risk would be greatly reduced and progress would be faster if the two sides
co-operated to create a single national broadband network.
The classic objection to this would be that it creates monopoly and
inefficiency. To counter this I propose a new formula. BT and the
competitors should form a network company which they jointly own in equal
shares. BT's contribution would include its existing duct network, which is
a central resource. The company would have a professional board made up
exclusively of its owners' representatives.
To ensure efficiency, its managing director and its top executives would be
appointed by the owners on regularly renewable contracts, with stringent
performance-related pay requirements. The board would control expansion of
broadband across the country, in step with success in marketing. Charges and
profits would be determined by a return on assets requirement, set to
correspond to the upper quartile of returns being earned by blue-chip
companies generally and ratified by the industry regulator, Oftel. Profits
would be reinvested or distributed by agreement between the owners. Initial
investment and later investment requirements not met from profits would be
found by the owners or from the market.
Anyone who wished to provide broadband services to the public, including of
course BT and the present cable TV operators, would be entitled to use the
network, paying standard charges to the new company. Again, charges would be
ratified by Oftel. There would be free, fair and unregulated competition for
provision of services over the network.
Technical and commercial problems of interconnecting competing networks,
which are getting more difficult with no obvious way out, would be
eliminated. The need for the ban on BT would disappear. The way would be
cleared for broadband services to develop freely by competition to their
natural commercial level.

operations. He is now senior partner of the Lullington Group of
telecommunications advisers

FT  12 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mysterious analysis of Italian bond
performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M MASI.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We are flattered by the attention that the FT dedicates to the Italian
bond market. One of your columnists, Barry Riley, seems to be particularly
intrigued and amused by the Italian Treasury operations, especially with
regard to our 30-year bond. For example, he defined last November's launch
of this bond as a curious phenomenon. He implied that no investor with any
good sense would hold this paper to maturity. In fact, he argued, even if
the Italian government were to repay this bond in 2023, that the money would
hardly be worth a cup of espresso ('Italy adds another dimension to debt',
November 17 1993). Although we value a good cup of coffee highly in Italy,
we did not take that as a compliment.
Recently, while commenting on the French financial situation ('Airline
cracks in the French financial facade', August 3), he reminded FT readers of
how wise his judgment on the Italian 30-year bond had been. Reason: the
yield of that bond had gone up from under 10 per cent (last November) to
about 11 1/2 per cent (in early August).
At this point we started wondering how Mr Riley values the success of a
bond. Certainly he could not simply judge, as it appears from the article,
on the basis of gross yields, taken out of context. Mr Riley must have some
benchmark in mind against which to measure the performance of the Italian
30-year bond. We were puzzled.
Could he be comparing the performance of 30-year Italian bonds with that of
comparable bonds issued in other countries? No. Thirty-year bonds worldwide,
like all other medium- and long-term bonds, have experienced a substantial
increase in their yield since the beginning of the year. The Italian bond is
not unique in this respect.
Could he instead be looking at the performance of 30-year bonds relative to
other Treasury bonds of different maturity? No. The spread between 30 and
10-year bonds in Italy moved well within the range displayed by the other
major countries. We have run out of ideas: Riley's analysis must be much
more sophisticated than our own simplistic way of thinking.
Like several of my colleagues at the Treasury, I am about to go on holiday.
We are all relieved to learn, however, that Riley's column will resume on
September 14; well after we will be coming back from our vacanze. This way
we will be sure not to miss any of his insights. One day we hope to
understand them.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Arts: Henry VI - the Battle for the Throne - Katie
Mitchell's new production for the RSC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Listening to Shakespeare's three Henry VI plays, you can believe that they
may indeed be his earliest extant work. The verse is remarkably regular in
its iambic pentameter pulse, sentences almost always reach their close at
the close of a verse line, imagery is eloquent but simply wrought. There are
several striking characters - including the raging Queen Margaret, the
deformed and ruthless young schemer Richard Duke of Gloucester, and the
contemplative but ineffectual King Henry himself - but they lack the
line-by-line psychological mobility of later Shakespeare creations. Several
speeches are plainly set pieces; several scenes, too.
I say this, but I have never previously felt that way while watching. Now,
however, the director Katie Mitchell has mounted a version of Henry VI -
Part Three for the RSC, in which she has elicited an unusually contained
performing style from her actors. Gone is the searing intensity associated
with these plays since the famous RSC Wars of the Roses staging 30 years ago
(starring Peggy Ashcroft, David Warner, Ian Holm, Donald Sinden) and the
vivid epic style that endured through to Adrian Noble's Plantagenets trilogy
in 1988-89. Mitchell, it seems, wants to show this play's formality of pulse
and structure; wants to hold the characters' intensity of feeling within the
orderly forms accorded them; wants a style labelled 'Early Bard'. The
characteristics of this style are evenness of rhythm, a generally muted
andante moderato way of speaking, and a studious formality of gesture.
It works - though it is close to being underwhelming. No individual
performances make any special impact; the winner is Shakespeare (though his
text has been stylishly adjusted, and cut), Shakespeare the historian.
This staging, which will tour, is currently at The Other Place in Stratford.
Most of the cast are new to the RSC, and lack Shakespearian experience.
There are times, especially in Part One, when you wish Mitchell has urged
them to greater dynamic variety. And why on earth has she (or her movement
man Paul Allain) taught almost every actor the same contrived Slow Gesture?
This involves taking two seconds in raising a formally extended arm to
achieve a big pointing gesture (the way that Lapotaire does in Mitchell's
1993-94 RSC staging of Ghosts). The actors have also learnt how, when
turning the head 30 degrees from looking at one character to another, to
take two seconds about that too. And oh]
De-dum-de-dum-de-dum-de-dum-de-dumb: they speak their iambic pentameters as
if following a metronome.
Jonathan Firth turns Henry VI's mildness into sheer dullness; Stephen Simms
as Richard Duke of York is little better; and Lloyd Owen as Edward IV,
despite a voice whose calm utterance is as charming as Miles Kington's, is
worse. Is Mitchell telling us that Shakespeare means these characters to be
history's pawns, not its makers? Maybe so, but he put more ichor in their
veins than she allows them.
Now and then, whenever the text suggests a more developed dramatic method,
Mitchell lets some characters emerge more forcefully. (Mature Bard.)
Richard's soliloquies loom out with surprising modernity. Yet Mitchell has
scaled him down too. Tom Smith plays him as if he were Young Wackford
Squeers in Nicholas Nickleby, without wit or intelligence, lasciviously
gratifying himself with his mean fantasies of future power.
There is a certain amount of 'realistic' business. Richard of Gloucester has
one physical shtick: he chews his finger meanly, even when it's clad in
armour. The Duke of Exeter stammers over key consonants. And - in a
time-honoured bit of RSC tradition that goes back to Ashcroft - Queen
Margaret (the vehement Ruth Mitchell) retains some of her old French accent,
especially some of her French Rs. But these devices are unusually laboured
here. They stick out amid the widespread classical restraint, as if Mitchell
were demonstrating that Shakespeare did not yet know how to make these
characters more complex.
For Mitchell, this play of civil war represents a break in style from the
several domestic interiors (Vassa Zheleznova, The Dybbuk, Ghosts, Rutherford
and Son) that she has recreated so finely. Rae Smith's designs are a model
of expressive economy, and Tina MacHugh's lighting is beautifully
atmospheric in its subdued way. Latin chants, arranged by Helen Chadwick,
play an important role here. This staging makes me impatient to see the RSC
put on the Henry VI plays and Richard III as a tetralogy; and though I am
impatient with some features of Mitchell's direction it would be interesting
to see her sense of history shaping all four plays.
At The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon. Touring in England and abroad from
September to December.

Keen gardeners are well served by television today. In Gardeners' World
Geoff Hamilton visits the Logan Botanical Gardens in Scotland (8.30 BBC2)
and Garden Club promises to 'check out varied vegetables, blooming bedding
plants, and those deemed to be beneficial to butterflies' (9.00 C4). Lovers
of comedy repeats should also be happy. BBC1 provides yet another chance to
see an episode of the prison series Porridge (8.00), BBC2 re-screens an
episode of the space saga Red Dwarf (9.00), and C4 continues its re-run of
The Golden Girls (9.30). But if gardening and old comedy are not your
passions then radio is a better bet. In BBC Proms 1994 the BBC Concert
Orchestra plays Sibelius's Karelia Suite, Four Dances by Constant Lambert,
Rawsthorne's Concerto for Two Pianos, The Sorcerer's Apprentice by Dukas,
Capriol Suite by Warlock, and La Valse by Ravel (7.00 Radio 3). In Something

FT  12 AUG 94 / Arts: Coppelia - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Always let your conscience be your guide. This may be sound moral advice,
but in ballet it should take second place to letting music be the guide. By
and large, our dancers, choreographers, producers, have been musically
sensitive in the past - it was a virtue instilled into our fledgling ballet
in the 1930s by Constant Lambert. (Lambert, that superb musician and
conductor, that dazzling arbiter of taste, sacrificed something of his own
self as composer in serving the Sadler's Wells Ballet. Without him as
artistic guide and musical conscience, our national ballet would have been
far less good).
Musical things have got more brutish of late: scores mauled by obstinate
creators, a plethora of junk composition, dancers ploughing through the
classics as if tobogganing down a slope. There is no excuse, except
arrogance and bad musical education, for the mayhem lately committed on
Sylvia or the sound-track provided a few years ago for Frankenstein, or the
recent bloodbath of Don Quixote. And in not listening carefully to the
ineffable charm of Delibes' Coppelia music, English National Ballet's cast
on Monday night were minimising everything they did.
ENB ends it summer season on the South Bank with this week's run of that
dear and sunny masterpiece. Perhaps the hideous muddle of the Festival Hall
itself - a shopping mall in Hades, with its restaurants and bars and stalls
and side-shows of amateur dancing and exhibitions of the unlovely and
trumpery - has percolated onto the stage. Certainly, the performance of
Coppelia I saw, led by Agnes Oaks and Thomas Edur, was brisk, jolly,
unsubtle, and fatally unresponsive to the music's grace.
Delibes' score must be the guide, and Ronald Hynd's staging really knows
this. Hynd was inspired by two great Swanildas - Pamela May, Alexandra
Danilova (his wife, Annette Page, was also enchanting). The wit and musical
responsiveness of such performances echo in this staging, but briskness and
peasant jollity (acceptable in its place, but an unrelenting companion all
evening) now ride unrestrained through the action. I longed for delicacy,
for some expansiveness of style, in almost every interpretation, at every
moment.
Agnes Oaks projects her view of Swanilda with greater verve than heretofore.
It is a buoyant but somehow unrelaxed reading. There are no problems in
nipping through the dances, which she does with splendid aplomb. I wish,
though, that she would lighten her reading with more innocent grace, and a
less determined vivacity. The music's spirit, Delibes' mellifluous and
shapely melodies, should be her guide. Thomas Edur is a faultless Frantz.
Faced with a character of boundless lack of interest - the role was only
intriguing when played, as it was created, by a pretty girl en travesti at
the Paris Opera - Edur lives every moment with a wonderful enthusiasm, and
dances with impeccable ease. He alone warms, illuminates the evening.
The Coppelius, on whom much depends, was Wayne Sleep. He is too astute a
player not to seize every opportunity, but it is as himself rather than as
Coppelius that he does so. The role, and the central crisis of the story -
which is the creation of life by alchemical means - is lost. From everyone
else, bounce, peasant gaiety, furred jerkins, and expressions of extravagant
joy. What fun they have] What fun, indeed, the audience has] I wish, though,
that we might have seen what Delibes score was really about.
English National Ballet's summer season is sponsored by Nomura. It
continues, with Coppelia, until the end of this week.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Arts: Sir Alex Alexander - An appreciation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE CHRISTIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Alex Alexander, who died on July 25, did more for Glyndebourne's
financial well-being during his period of trusteeship and directorship than
any other individual in this opera company's history of 60 years. He brought
a new dimension to the business of fund-raising and sponsorship and, at the
same time, he instilled a sense of commercialism in the management of
Glyndebourne's operation. His fund-raising efforts obviously benefited
Glyndebourne's artistic endeavours but the commercial policy never came into
fundamental conflict with artistic objectives.
I first met Alex in 1973, following correspondence in which I invited him to
support Glyndebourne Touring Opera - an invitation which was
characteristically not refused. I felt an immediate rapport with him and
this grew into friendship which, within a few months, caused me to think
that he might join our board of trustees. I consulted one of our trustees,
Sir Mark Turner, who expressed some surprise on the grounds that Alex, to
his knowledge, had not shown much interest in the performing arts up to that
point. Two years after Alex's appointment to the Glyndebourne Arts Trust,
Sir Mark commented that the decision to appoint Alex must have been the best
one of my life - a comment with which I have no possible disagreement.
Alex, within a very brief period of trusteeship, joined the board of
Glyndebourne Productions Limited (the organisation which holds executive
responsibility for the Opera Company). He was also appointed chairman of a
finance committee which I brought into existence in the mid-70s at a time of
recession and at a time when box office receipts were unable to keep pace
with inflation. He was hugely active as chairman of this committee and, as a
result, Glyndebourne - despite diminishing box office returns - successfully
met the challenge of inflationary costs. Alex also chaired an appeal in 1983
which raised Pounds 750,000 to help maintain the fabric of the theatre.
It might be expected that his widespread and very effective success in
'robbing Peter' to pay Glyndebourne could have created enemies. Not so in
the case of Alex, whose charm - he had an irresistible smile - and practical
approach beguiled all who came into his fund-raising sights. I know of no
other individual with a better track record for raising funds for the arts.
Glyndebourne was, I believe, the first charitable organisation in the field
of the performing arts to benefit from his genius, but there were others who
got swept into his slipstream - to their great advantage.
His friendship with people was based on a code of ethics, the chief one of
which was unshakeable loyalty. Once a friend of Alex, always a friend -
unless you breached the code. In Marga he had a wife who gave him stalwart
support in his business life and who, more than anyone, inspired his
interest in the arts. We grieve for her and her family.
Sir George Christie is chairman of Glyndebourne Productions.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Arts: The Rake's Progress - Salzburg Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a measure of Salzburg's underlying conservatism that, despite three
years of Gerard Mortier's modernising influence, festival patrons still
regard Stravinsky with caution. Caution not being part of Mortier's
vocabulary, he has programmed three Stravinsky stagings this summer.
The gamble seems to have paid off. After slow advance sales, The Rake's
Progress at the Kleines Festspielhaus became a hot ticket, while a
street-theatre production of The Soldier's Tale caught the imagination of
Salzburg's tourist hordes. The most ambitious of the three is being kept
till the final week - a Peter Sellars-Kent Nagano production of Oedipus Rex
and Symphony of Psalms, with designs by an avant-garde firm of architects.
These are worthy festival projects, but it is odd that Mortier should
totally ignore Stravinsky's biggest contribution to musical theatre - his
ballets.
Mortier clearly relished the opportunity to juxtapose The Rake's Progress
and Don Giovanni - two dissolutes who flaunt moral conventions and are duly
punished. The other point in common, of course, is a standard 18th century
orchestra. But there the similarities end, and it would be hard to imagine
two more contrasting production styles than the Chereau-Barenboim Don
Giovanni (which I reviewed last Saturday) and the new Rake.
Not for the first time, Mortier placed his trust in a visual artist with
little experience of the theatre - someone who, he hoped, could transplant
to our own times the operatic characters drawn from Hogarth's pictures. Jorg
Immendorff responded by identifying Tom Rakewell with his own fate as an
artist - prey to ideals and idle dreams, lust and consumption, devilish
pacts and their inescapable consequences. The result was an entertaining
exercise in artistic licence, colourful but often unrecognisable.
The stage resembled a painter's atelier, with Anne posing as a model. Tom
was dressed in T-shirt and jeans, while Trulove was a Joseph Beuys lookalike
(the controversial postwar German artist was Immendorff's hero). Tom's
flights of fantasy were symbolised by a model aeroplane, with wings like an
artist's palette. His progress was followed by apes (the human beast), who
acted as stagehands and became the inmates of bedlam. Modernist and
Hogarthian paintings appeared in miniature on the back wall, and the
auctioneer wielded not a gavel but a sledgehammer, with which he politely
smashed everything on view.
Thanks to a succession of pictorial dropcloths and clear stage direction by
Peter Mussbach, the story - and many of its comic and ironic touches - did
not get entirely lost. But the moral was wasted. It was hard to identify
with characters who inhabited such a two-dimensional stage and looked the
same from start to finish. There was an air of artificiality, which rubbed
off on the music and led to bouts of tedium.
In most other respects, the performance was exemplary. Under Sylvain
Cambreling, the Camerata Academica was alert to Stravinsky's rhythmic wit,
relishing all the harmonic twists and tricks. Jerry Hadley made a
fresh-voiced, fresh-faced Tom. Despite her garish blonde wig, Sylvia
McNair's Anne was purity personified. Monte Pederson's Nick Shadow had the
body of a wrestler wrapped in a business suit, but would have benefitted
from sharper characterisation. Grace Bumbry was a subdued Baba, Linda
Ormiston the deliciously predatory brothel-keeper. The audience response was
ecstatic.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Technology: Trials raise hope of breakthrough drug -
International Aids conference / A crucial therapeutic distinction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the last decade, average life expectancy of patients diagnosed with
Aids in the developed world has increased from six months to more than three
years.
Most of the progress has been not in the treatment of HIV, the virus that
leads to Aids, but of the opportunistic infections associated with Aids that
eventually cause death. The most common include PCP, a form of pneumonia,
MAC (Mycobacterium Avium Complex), cytomeglovirus (CMV), a form of herpes,
and tuberculosis.
Among the opportunistic infections, CMV retinitis is particularly feared by
Aids patients because it can cause permanent blindness. Once patients have
been diagnosed with Aids, between 20 per cent and 30 per cent develop CMV
retinitis each year.
However, Syntex, the Californian-based company being acquired by Roche of
Switzerland, appears to have made a breakthrough in the treatment of the
disease.
It has been testing an oral version of one of its top-selling drugs,
Cytovene, to see if the medicine can prevent the development of CMV
retinitis.
Aids activists had expected interim results of the trial, which was started
in December and originally due to finish next summer, to be presented at the
10th International Conference on Aids in Yokohama.
But Syntex said it was not yet prepared to provide details. The US Federal
Trade Commission is still investigating Roche's Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.4bn)
takeover of Syntex and has until later this month to make its decision. The
medicine, which last year generated sales of Dollars 85.5m, is already used
to treat patients once CMV retinitis has developed.
An independent advisory group monitoring the trial has told Syntex it should
prematurely stop giving dummy drugs to people on the trial. The US Food and
Drug Administration has also given its consent to stop that wing of the
study.
The decision was made on ethical grounds after it was discovered only 17 per
cent of those on Cytovene developed the disease, compared with 30 per cent
on the dummy drug. About 725 people were involved in the trial.
Scientists nevertheless warned that although the drug appeared highly
effective, concerns remain about Cytovene's safety when used with other
medicines.
A new oral version of Cytovene was used in the trial. The drug has until now
been administered through a permanent catheter in the chest to patients who
have already developed CMV retinitis. The oral version is also being tested
for patients who have already developed CMV retinitis. Three trials just
completed showed that when taken orally not as much of the drug becomes
available as when given intravenously, meaning the oral version is slightly
less
effective.
The oral version delays another onset of the disease between 51 days and 57
days. That compares with 62 and 67 days for the intravenous version.
However, the oral version has fewer side-effects and has significant quality
of life benefits.
Another increasingly common, devastating and lethal disease in late-stage
Aids patients is mycobacterium avium complex, a bacteriological disease that
during two years affects about 31 per cent of HIV-positive patients at an
advanced stage of the disease.
The main therapy available to prevent the disease is Rifabutin, a treatment
marketed in Europe by Pharmacia of Sweden. In two large trials involving
1,146 patients, only 48 people on Rifabutin developed MAC, compared with 102
on placebo. But 16 per cent of patients stopped taking the drugs because of
toxicity and other reasons.
Preliminary results of a study presented at the conference suggested
Abbott's Biaxin may have fewer side-effects and be more effective.
Mark Pierce of Vanderbilt University presented details of a trial of 682
patients with advanced Aids. Although the breakdown between placebo and
active drug has not yet been completed, only 5.7 per cent of patients
dropped out because of adverse effects.
In all, only 57 of the patients on both placebo and the drug developed MAC,
compared with a predicted 87 if all were on placebo. That meant a possible
80 per cent reduction for those on the drug compared with the expected
levels on placebo, claimed Pierce. The full results could be ready as early
as October, he added.
Wasting disease is a further serious problem for Aids patients, with body
cell mass falling below a level capable of sustaining life. The answer is
not eating more, which does not consistently restore weight, and often, at
best, increases fat rather than vital lean tissue.
However, a trial was presented in Yokohama which suggested Saizen,
Ares-Serono's recombinant human growth hormone, used on undersized children,
could be an effective treatment for the condition.
Preliminary findings were given from a 12-week study of patients with
HIV-associated wasting. Before the trial, the 78 patients who finished the
study had lost on average 11kg of their previous weight.
Those on Saizen increased their weight by 1.5kg of lean tissue, while those
on placebo gained weight which then continued to fall.
The trial indicated there was no difference between the two groups in the
development of Aids diseases or death. Those who have been on the drug for
two years on average gained more than 10kg.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Property: Fillip for the young ones - Low prices are
attracting first-time buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While Japan's commercial property market is still in the trough of a
four-year slump, the residential sector is enjoying a fillip. Developers,
burdened with unsold residential properties, are flooding the market with
low-cost flats. Sales are brisk.
This uplift has provided relief for property developers, who have been
severely affected by the first sustained fall in land prices since the
second world war; and the government, which hopes a pick-up in housing sales
will help lead the economy out of recession.
The sharp rise in sales of flats has been helped by record low mortgage
rates - currently 4.05 per cent, down from 5.5 per cent in 1990 - coupled
with an expansion in the government's subsidised loan programme for house
purchases.
During the first six months of this year, a record 34,109 flats came onto
the market; in July alone, the number of flats offered by developers jumped
by 150 per cent on the same month in 1993, to 10,179, with 85 per cent of
total supply sold.
The slide in the market following the speculative bubble of the late 1980s
has also led to a slump in the price of flats. An average three-room flat in
the outskirts of Tokyo declined by 25 per cent from Y60m to Y40m between
1990 and 1993, making it affordable for many Japanese for the first time.
Yet the recovery is fragile because prices continue to fall as domestic
property sales increase. Despite this rise in sales, surplus supply and
vacancy rates continue to shoot up.
The rise in residential sales has also increased competition, with
commercial property developers, facing a continued slump in office rents,
lured back into the market.
According to the research arm of Haseko, a leading residential-sector
developer, annual demand for flats during the next five years is expected to
rise to 45,000 units; but this year alone, 80,000 flats are expected to come
onto the market and analysts believe this over-supply will persist for at
least three years.
Ms Keiko Ohtsuki, real estate analyst at Morgan Stanley, a US investment
house, says that in spite of some price stabilisation in the six months to
June, the general downward price trend is likely to continue in the
medium-term. As a result, developers, enjoying improved revenues after
several years of poor earnings, are likely to be forced to further cut their
prices for flats, again squeezing their profit margins.
The supply of new flats has had a significant impact on the prices of
existing residential properties and on the rental markets. Buyers in Japan
generally prefer to purchase new housing and low-interest loans have
attracted first-time buyers from the rental market in significant numbers.
In central Tokyo, housing rents are down by between 10 per cent and 20 per
cent from their peak in 1990 and, with the market favouring the consumer,
many landlords are willing to negotiate even larger discounts.
As with residential prices, commercial property values have also yet to
bottom out. Recession-induced corporate restructuring has depressed demand
for office space, in particular for high-grade accommodation in central
Tokyo. According to Ikoma Data Service, a property research company, vacancy
rates in Tokyo have risen to 8.9 per cent from 5.9 per cent a year ago.
Development projects started at the peak of the market in the late 1980s are
now coming onto the market, exacerbating the glut in office space. Office
rents have also fallen by between 30 per cent and 50 per cent from their
peak in 1990.
With office constructions in leading cities down 47 per cent last year
compared with 1992, many in the industry, such as the Japan Real Estate
Institute, a think-tank, say it will be another 18 months before the office
glut eases.
At the same time, market liquidity remains a problem, with developers still
reluctant to off-load commercial real estate bought at the market peak in
the late 1980s for fear of incurring losses. That is a chief reason why
industry analysts believe the easing of the over-supply does not necessarily
point to the recovery of the market overall.
The stagnant commercial property market remains at the core of the problems
at Japan's banks, as the vast bulk of their lending was extended against
over-valued land. Banks remain burdened with bad debt write-offs follow-ing
their disastrous foray into property lending in the 1980s.
In response to their bad debts, banks last year set up the Co-operative
Credit Purchasing Corporation. Under this scheme, banks sell their bad loans
to CCPC at a discount, writing off the difference. When CCPC was set up in
May last year, it bought the banks' bad debts at a 34 per cent discount
based on the collateral value. More recently the CCPC has been buying banks'
bad debts at a discount of 64.6 per cent.
Some market observers say the prolonged downturn of the commercial property
market and the increasing costs of maintaining land assets may induce
investors to change their investment culture, by shifting their focus away
from capital gains and towards a property's income-generating potential. But
such a change is likely to come about slowly.
Reluctant to sell their assets - owning land is an important status symbol
to the Japanese - but at the same time forced to clear their balance-sheets,
some investors are selling their holdings to affiliates or other enterprises
within the same corporate grouping at artificially high prices.
Nevertheless, many Japanese companies will eventually have to succumb to the
cost pressures and to abandon their wait-and-see strategy.
As Mr Akitoshi Takatsuki, a researcher at Sakura Bank, a leading commercial
bank, puts it: 'Companies and investors are aware of the further downside
risk of the market, but they are scared to change their ways. To do so would
open a Pandora's Box of problems.'

FT  12 AUG 94 / Technology: Riders on a storm - Small shops have fired the
biking revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Christopher Chance began making high-end mountain bikes in Somerville,
Massachusetts, in 1982, he had no idea he would be part of a technology
revolution the likes of which the sector had not seen since the 1800s.
'I loved mountain biking,' he says. 'So I decided to get into the business.
I was aiming for better performance, so I just kept on experimenting with
things, how to get a stronger, lighter bike with better suspension.'
Today, Chance's company, Fat City Cycles, is one of a score of manufacturers
 -including Kona, Specialized, Cannondale, Giant, Trek and Marin - at the
cutting edge of bicycle production. Many, like Chance, started out as small
entrepreneurs fiddling around in sweaty shops. Those small shops, however,
invented new techniques which lit a fire under the industry.
'The amazing technological improvements we've seen over the last 20 years in
bicycles were led by small entrepreneurs looking for ways to improve the
ride,' says William Strickland, editor of Bicycling magazine. 'Those little
changes added up to big advances.'
Unlike in Europe, where bicycles have always been used as a mode of
transportation, the US market was mostly limited to children and enthusiasts
until the 1970s, when interest in 'road bikes' - bicycles used on footpaths
 -picked up.
That renewed interest in bicycles turned to fervour in the 1980s, when the
introduction of mass-produced mountain bikes transformed the sector from a
sleepy, old-fashioned market to an industry serving one of the hottest new
sports of the decade. At the end of 1993, there were 100m cyclists in the
US, 33 per cent more than in 1983, according to the Bicycle Federation of
America. Mountain bikes were the overwhelming favourite, comprising about 95
per cent of all bicycle sales in the country last year.
Because mountain bikes are used in more demanding circumstances than road
bikes, there was soon a push for improved technology. Makers derived
inspiration from motorcycles, automobiles, even aeroplanes. Later, the
advances were used in road bikes and the new hybrids, a cross between a
mountain and a road bike.
With the advent of mountain bikes, manufacturers started concentrating on
suspension, since riders have to negotiate rocks and bumps as smoothly as
possible. They borrowed the idea of front and back forks from motorcycles.
Front suspension forks caught on quickly, but full suspension bikes have
presented performance problems. 'It's not like a motorcycle, where you can
just turn up the throttle,' says Chance. 'The bike depends on the rider's
energy, and the early full suspension models required users to put out more
energy to make the bike move.' With so much resistance between themselves
and the tyres, riders found the bicycles tiring, and complained of an
awkward bobbing sensation when pedalling.
The industry has just begun to overcome the problems of full suspension by
making adjustments in braking and chain tension, and by shifting the pivot
point where the suspension attaches to the frame. With many of the wrinkles
ironed out, full suspension bikes are enjoying vastly increased sales.
Another source of impetus for better bicycles is the revived interest in
racing. Like car companies, bicycle manufacturers are hooking up with racers
to market their products and to gain inspiration for technological advances.
'Our racing team rides all over the world in all kinds of weather and on all
types of terrain,' says Thomas Armstrong, head of marketing for Cannondale.
'They give us feedback on the bikes so we can make improvements.'
One of the main concerns in bike racing is obtaining the lightest frame
possible to take competitors speedily to the finish line. The materials used
in racing bikes are usually expensive, but as costs dwindle, they filter
down to the general public.
In the 1980s, for instance, the price of aluminium frames, which are lighter
than steel, dropped substantially, and these were adopted by the mass
market. Now, aluminium is being challenged by titanium, a strong and even
lighter material. Titanium itself may be replaced by exotic materials such
as carbon fibre, beryllium and AerMet, a steel alloy used in the landing
gear of aeroplanes. Manufacturers are also starting to experiment with
thermoplastics.
Anyone who has not been in a bicycle shop in the past few years would today
be amazed, and probably a little confused, at the options in components. A
new disc brake is ideal for downhill riding, because it doesn't heat up as
much as traditional brake pads. Brake pads, too, are being refined in shape
and materials for better braking power.
Grip pedals are also a novelty in the bicycling shops. Based on ski
bindings, the pedals hook into specially designed shoes.
Serious enthusiasts have access to a slew of other products, such as a new
biking shoe which incorporates a system to tighten and loosen tension. And
for a softer saddle, a buyer might opt for a new seat by Selle San Marco,
which contains the state-of-the-art Dupont thermopolymer Hytrel.
New manufacturing technologies are less sexy, but just as important. Fat
City, for instance, uses a method which thins out metal in the middle of the
tube, and adds extra thickness at the ends, which come under the most
stress. The process makes the bicycle lighter and stronger.
The drawback of these technologies is cost. A sophisticated bicycle can cost
Dollars 10,000 or more, beyond the reach of most consumers. Moreover, shop
owners say many consumers purchase far more sophisticated items than they
really need.
'The industry is really getting ahead of itself in the technology area,'
says John Balmer, product manager of Kona in Washington state. 'For the kind
of riding most people do, a lot of these things are just not necessary. I
think there's going to be a re-focus in the industry on durability and
safety features over the next decade, while we absorb some of the
technological advances made in the 1980s.'

FT  12 AUG 94 / Management: Unravelled cloth - The Church of England is a
Pounds 630m-a-year operation but it lacks a centralised management structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The problem with the Church of England, a member of its general synod
commented during a debate on the church's financial troubles last month, is
that it has 43 different management structures.
Unfortunately, the real problem is that this is an over-simplification. The
speaker had in mind the fact that each of the church's 43 dioceses is
largely autonomous. That would create enough problems for the central
management of any large organisation. But in the Church of England, the
central management does not exist.
There is no shortage of structure. In addition to the 43 dioceses there is a
policy-making General Synod, the Church Commissioners, the Central Board of
Finance, a pensions board and the offices of the Archbishops of Canterbury
and York.
Yet the church is a Pounds 630m-a-year operation for which no single body
has overall managerial responsibility. Church leaders, faced with the
biggest financial pressures of modern times, recognise this as a source of
inefficiency in decision-making that must be changed.
A variety of interconnected problems came to a head with a Pounds 800m slump
in the value of the Church Commissioners' assets between 1989 and 1992,
caused mainly by over-investment in property.
Although the asset values have since begun to recover, the collapse brought
belated recognition that the church had become over-dependent on the
commissioners, who contribute to clergy stipends and housing and provide
pensions.
Churchgoers are already painfully aware of the consequences for them -
parishes must meet more of the clergy pay bill, while dioceses are likely to
have to start financing pensions under plans to be published later this
year. But the consequences for the way the church is managed will be equally
far-reaching.
A commission chaired by Rt Rev Michael Turnbull, incoming Bishop of Durham,
is reviewing the entire central organisation and policy making structure,
and its relationship with dioceses and parishes.
Commission members began work with a presentation on management structures
from Charles Handy, visiting professor at London Business School, discussing
with him issues like the fashion for federal organisation in companies. But
although the Church of England has in many ways the ultimate federal
structure, comparisons with business have limitations.
'We have an organisational structure that in some senses is very progressive
and accords with modern management thinking - indeed, a number of
fashionable terms like mission statement and subsidiarity have religious
origins,' says Philip Mawer, general secretary of the Church of England
general synod and a former senior civil servant.
'But even in federally structured companies, there are ways for the central
management to exercise control. The downside of our highly dispersed and
locally-based structure is that we do not have arrangements at the centre to
pull the threads together. There is no Church of England board.'
Although Bishop Turnbull has described the existing structure as 'clumsy and
cumbersome', his commission is unlikely to propose simply sweeping it away
when it reports next year - that could be a recipe for a debate lasting a
decade. Radical change is, however, possible. One idea being discussed would
amalgamate the officials of bodies like the synod and Church Commissioners
into a single central support staff.
A similar approach could apply locally, creating Church of England area
offices to provide services to groups of bishops and dioceses. As well as
saving on administration costs, this form of organisation would increase the
scope for spreading common policies - and more of a 'corporate culture' -
within the fragmented structure.
Two reports to be published in advance of Turnbull this autumn will increase
pressure on the church to adopt a more overtly managerial style.
A study of clergy conditions of service will address the future of the
freehold system, by which most incumbents have total job security until they
choose to move or to retire. That is likely to lead to more formal ways of
dealing with individuals who underperform.
The second report will consider the way cathedrals are run. Famous historic
churches are not only places of worship - many are large tourist attractions
competing in increasingly commercial style for a share of the leisure
market.
The extent to which such business activities have moved beyond bookstalls
and brass rubbing is illustrated by the Westminster Abbey Experience
currently being offered to visitors to London. It is a mixed-media show in a
temporary auditorium alongside the abbey which, by using archive film and a
replica Coronation Chair, 'draws on techniques more familiar to theme parks
and the theatre', as the authorities admit.
Yet cathedrals are run by dean and chapter in a managerial style that
appears as ancient as most of the buildings. With members of the commission
producing the report including Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Storehouse, and
Peter Burnham of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, a more business-like approach to the
church's commercial activities may well be recommended.
Ultimately, however, the church is not a commercial organisation but a
voluntary one. While, in common with many charities, it faces pressures
familiar to private- and public-sector managers, its viability depends
ultimately on financial support from individuals. There are dangers that
this might be jeopardised by an excessively professional, businesslike
style.
Cut your coat according to the cloth may be a basic management commandment,
but it will not prove an easy one for the men and women of the cloth to
follow.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Management: New light on the Grail of corporate renewal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like a politician's perennial promise of light at the end of the tunnel, top
managers are forever telling their long-suffering staffs that successful
corporate renewal is just around the corner. More often than not, their
declarations are as empty as the politician's. The corners prove as
unending, and the light illusory.
Westinghouse, the troubled conglomerate which was once the worthy arch-rival
of US General Electric and a host of European companies, has declared
victory in its battle for strategic and organisational renewal on at least
three occasions during the past decade. Each has proved a false dawn: the
company has declined further and had to begin the process again.
Westinghouse is far from alone. In the US, Eastman Kodak and IBM have made
successive attempts to revitalise themselves, with little success until now.
In Europe, most British clearing banks, like several continental electronics
manufacturers, have encountered similar barriers with successive 'change'
programmes. In Japan, Mazda, Yamaha and Matsushita have made highly
publicised but hitherto ineffective efforts at renewal.
The roots of this corporate sclerosis are intricate and intertwined, but two
causes are particularly troublesome. Both are self-inflicted.
First, many top managers fail to recognise how complex their organisations
are. Far from being machines which can be changed by the hasty pulling of a
few levers, they are complex, organic systems in which - if the desired
transformation is to take place - a protracted series of linked actions has
to be carried out.
The second reason companies fail to transform themselves, despite any amount
of new visions, 're-engineering', and other changes, is because they fail to
establish an entirely new internal climate. The 'smell of the place',
manifest in small details of how the organisation feels and functions, is
unaltered.
Sumantra Ghoshal and Christopher Bartlett, business school professors from
Insead and Harvard respectively, call this climate the 'behavioural context'
of an organisation. They say that Westinghouse is trapped in an
authoritarian climate where roles and relationships are characterised by
four self-reinforcing 'Cs': compliance, contract, control and constraint.
By contrast, US General Electric, ABB, Canon and other companies have broken
out of this straitjacket and converted to a much more healthy quartet of
characteristics: discipline, trust, support and stretch. These have been
practised for years by consistently innovative companies such as Andersen
Consulting, Intel, Ikea, Kao of Japan, and 3M.
In an article about to be published in the US-based Strategic Management
Journal*, Ghoshal and Bartlett explain the practical workings of a 'quality
of management' model which they, with several of Ghoshal's colleagues at
Insead, have developed around the four characteristics.
Individually, the four facets of the model will be familiar to readers of
literature about the management of change. Like most models, it is also a
very simplified representation of reality. But it has two considerable
virtues.
First, Ghoshal and Bartlett do not have a behavioural science background -
both have worked mainly in strategy, organisation and general management -
so their discussion of the differences between the four facets, and the
interaction between them, is low on jargon. For instance, they show clearly
how discipline and stretch are each ineffective without the other.
Second, they explain how each characteristic can be reinforced by several
very practical actions.
Discipline. Unlike compliance, this does not rely primarily on authority
relationships or management policies. In organisations such as Intel and
Andersen, self-discipline is encouraged through the careful socialisation of
employees and becomes second nature to them. That is a fine distinction, but
a vital one. Discipline is fostered by the provision of clear standards to
which employees feel committed, plus open and rapid feedback.
Support. Traditionally, delegation from boss to subordinate is policed by
top-down control. By contrast, the academics say that even at disciplined
and performance-orientated companies such as Intel and Anderson, managerial
relationships are unusually supportive. This atmosphere - usually called
'coaching' - also fosters collaboration between colleagues.
Trust. Instead of increasingly impersonal and distant (or 'contractual')
relationships, most companies that have been able to renew themselves
permanently have built trust and openness into their behavioural climate. To
achieve this, fairness, involvement and levels of competence have all been
increased.
Stretch. In most companies, people's horizons and creativity are constrained
by the organisation's relatively low and short-term ambitions. In
self-renewing organisations, the internal climate encourages - even induces
 -employees to strive for far-reaching objectives.
As practising managers will recognise, the model is more challenging than it
looks. The creation of an environment which is disciplined and stretching,
yet supportive and trusting, is far from simple - especially for people used
to taking decisions, rather than helping others make them.
Whatever some top managers may think or pretend, corporate renewal is a
long, treacherous and winding road. Above all, it requires their own roles
to change. A bunch of relentlessly hands-on drivers must become
navigators-cum-social engineers.

UBS, keen to build up its southern and eastern European emerging markets
business, has reached into those markets it finds most promising to recruit
a new team of analysts.
Emre Yigit, formerly head of research at Turkish securities firm Global
Securities, will cover that region at UBS. Gidon Yardeni, formerly a senior
analyst at Tel Aviv-based Pacific Mediterranean Investment Company, will
follow Israeli companies, while Pedro Fonseca, an analyst at Finantia, a
leading Portuguese investment bank, will provide research on Portuguese
companies.
Gary Rigby, managing director of equity emerging markets at UBS, says that
while Turkey, Israel and Portugal may not immediately spring to mind as the
hottest emerging markets of 1994, there is considerable investor interest in
all three. Turkey, he notes, was the top performing emerging market in the
second quarter of 1994, although he concedes that in the first quarter it
was about the worst.
And despite the fact that a number of Israeli companies are listed on
US-based Nasdaq, European investors have relatively little access to
information about them, he says.

FT  12 AUG 94 / People: Lunn's last order at JD Wetherspoon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JD Wetherspoon, the fast-growing chain of pubs whose reputation is based on
cheap beer and no juke-boxes, is having growing pains. Keith Lunn, 38, who
was responsible for the day-to-day running of the 87-strong chain, has quit
as retail director.
Tim Martin, the 39-year-old founder of the group, said that Lunn's departure
had been 'mutually agreed'. Lunn, who had been with the group for four
years, is the first main board executive director to quit since it was
floated on the stock market in October 1992. A few months ago Martin's
younger brother, Gerry, left the group in order to run his local pub in
Barnet.
Martin refused to elaborate on the company's brief statement to the stock
exchange. However, it is believed that Lunn's departure may have been
prompted by the arrival of Mark McQuarter, 34, who joined as Wetherspoon's
first managing director in May. McQuarter, a Scottish chartered accountant,
had worked for NatWest's venture capital arm in Scotland and before that had
been with Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries.
Lunn is not being replaced on the main board but his operational
responsibilities will be undertaken by John Hutson, 29, a general manager
who joined the group in January 1991.
Since the company came to the stock market just under two years ago, its
profits have grown rapidly and its stock market capitalisation has more than
trebled to Pounds 140m. Wetherspoon is one of the first of a new generation
of specialist pub retailers and has made a name for itself by developing new
pubs out of vacant bank branches or empty supermarkets. Apart from its
special retailing format, its skills are said to lie in its ability to win
planning permission and get its outlets licensed. The number of its outlets
has doubled since flotation and it is planning to open another 20 in the
coming year.
In March it raised Pounds 22m in a rights issue and analysts are expecting
the company to increase its profits from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 6.2m when it
reports its results for the year which has just ended.

<TEXT>
Dairy Crest, the processing arm of the Milk Marketing Board, has announced
the appointment of Michael Dowdall as chairman. Dowdall will see the company
through its flotation next year after the abolition of the board in November
and the deregulation of Britain's Pounds 3.3bn milk business.
Dowdall, 64, is currently chairman of the Gaymer group and Geest, the
bananas and food processing company. He is also a director of BPB Industries
and NFU Mutual Insurance company.
He succeeds Geoffrey John who has presided over Dairy Crest's transformation
over the past six years from a government organisation into a
commercially-run company and who will remain as deputy chairman to oversee
the hand-over. John says he was unable to devote enough time to issues
concerning the flotation.
Dowdall will bring strong operational skills to Dairy Crest. He retired as a
director of Unilever in 1991, but while there built a reputation as a strong
manager. As detergents co-ordinator, he was responsible for merging all of
the company's European national detergent businesses into one operation.
'He'll do a bit more than just chair meetings,' says one former colleague.

Clinton Silver, 64, who stepped down as deputy chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer
at the end of last month, has joined the board of Tommy Hilfiger
Corporation, a fast-growing US company which specialises in designing and
marketing sportswear for men and boys.
Tommy Hilfiger, the principal designer and honorary chairman, was a
small-town boy who went to New York as a freelance designer in 1979 and has
been likened to Ralph Lauren. He founded the company in 1989 with financial
backing from Apparel International Holdings, which is now the company's
majority shareholder.
The company's shares were floated on the New York Stock Exchange in
September 1992 and have more than doubled in value. The company's revenues
rose 64 per cent to Dollars 227m in its last financial year and Tommy
Hilfiger products are sold through 480 in-store shops.
Silver (above), who spent 42 years at Marks and Spencer, will help guide the
company's long-term plans for international expansion in Europe and the Far
East.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's Office of Science and Technology has appointed scores of
advisory committees during its two years in existence. But never before has
one had the style and glamour of the Technology Foresight Panel announced
this week to cover the 'learning and leisure sector'.
Its chairman is Peter Wallis. Peter who? Wallis is better known as the
author, broadcaster and style guru Peter York, who coined the famous term
Sloane Ranger. Other members include: David Puttnam (above), the film
director; Janet Street-Porter of the BBC; Anthony Smith, president of
Magdalen College, Oxford; Neil Chalmers, head of the Natural History Museum;
and Alexander Korda, guru of hi-tech venture capital.
The panel is one of 15 appointed by the Cabinet Office to look at prospects
for technological progress in its sector and match these with the strengths
and weaknesses of British industry. By the end of the Technology Foresight
exercise next year, the government hopes to have a list of priorities for
research within and across all sectors of science and business.
Wallis/York says his panel would look particularly at 'the fast growth area
of new electronic and education media. The contribution these can make to
national income but also to our quality of life is not always fully
recognised - partly because the businesses are so varied but also because
they cut across many traditional areas of industry.'
Puttnam adds: 'We are in reach of the 'fully wired home' in which not only
conventional entertainment but interactive education and information
services will be available on demand - at a price.'

FT  12 AUG 94 / Efficiency measures fail to help energy trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Measures to encourage more efficient electricity use are included in the
price controls, although they will not help the government's beleaguered
Energy Savings Trust.
Electricity companies have an incentive to sell as much electricity as
possible because their profits are directly related to volume. In future
volume will account for only half the 'revenue driver' which determines a
company's profits. The other half will be based on the number of customers
the company has. Prof Littlechild argues that this will reduce the volume
incentive while encouraging companies to go out and seek new customers.
He will also allow companies to keep more of the profits made from reducing
power losses, which amount to 7 per cent of the electricity passing through
the system. Prof Littlechild expects these measures to produce savings
equivalent to the electricity used by a city the size of Nottingham.
However, he decided against introducing fresh measures to curb demand for
electricity. Last year he approved an allowance in the price controls that
will raise Pounds 100m in four years for electricity companies to spend on
energy efficiency projects.
He said yesterday that he was unwilling to increase this because the full
costs and benefits of demand side measures have not yet been established in
the UK. He also believed that it was not the regulator's job to impose what
was essentially a tax on consumers, even if it was for a worthy cause.
This marks a further blow for the government-sponsored Energy Savings Trust,
which is supposed to raise several hundred million pounds from gas and
electricity users for domestic energy efficiency work. Ms Clare
Spottiswoode, the gas regulator, has already said that funding for the trust
is a matter for parliament, not her.
Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of
Energy, said he was 'deeply disappointed' by the review because it 'reversed
the regulator's position on the Energy savings Trust'.
He also said that the reduction of the volume component of the revenue
driver to 50 per cent was not enough to cut the profligacy of the
electricity companies. 'It's 25 per cent in Northern Ireland and 10 per cent
in the gas industry because that is what the real costs are,' he said.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Fear of job losses is part of mixed reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears of widespread job losses in the electricity industry were voiced
yesterday as industry, consumer groups and politicians gave a mixed reaction
to Prof Littlechild's review.
The Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, which has 40,000 members
in the industry, warned that there could be a further 14,000 job cuts
because 'every price review seemed to be followed by redundancies'. It would
fight enforced redundancies.
Mr Sol Mead, deputy head of Unison's 30,000 electricity members, said:
'Companies will be under great pressure to maintain dividends to
shareholders and provide the same rate of golden handshakes for bosses.'
A more positive response was given by the Major Energy Users' Council. The
group, which represents many of Britain's biggest companies, said the price
reductions were a step in the right direction.
The recognition that the regional companies' capital spending must be
financed by a balanced approach and not just consumer exploitation was
welcome news, it added.
However, Mr Ken Green, electricity purchasing manager for Imperial Chemical
Industries, said: 'Once again Offer has failed to deliver a solution which
fully embraces customer interest.'
He said the price control would not present power companies with big enough
incentives to improve efficiency.
The National Consumer Council said the reductions were not good enough and
customers had been overcharged since privatisation.
The chairmen of the Regional Electricity Consumers' Committees, which
represent the interests of electricity consumers, said they welcomed the
announcement but were disappointed that the cuts did not go further.
'However, having met him to discuss his proposals, we understand his
difficulties in reconciling quite different approaches,' they said.
Yorkshire Electricity said yesterday that the controls were tough and
challenging. Customers were already reaping the benefits of privatisation
through lower charges.
Mr Malcolm Bruce MP, the Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman,
yesterday called on Prof Littlechild to introduce an immediate cut in
electricity tariffs in Scotland. He said Scottish electricity customers had
been 'ripped off too much for too long'.
Prof Littlechild is thought likely to announce the outcome of his review of
Scottish distribution and supply charges towards the end of next month.
Unlike regional electricity companies in England and Wales, Scottish Power
and Hydro-Electric are vertically integrated, generating as well as
distributing electricity. The Scottish companies were both given negative
X-factors (the percentage by which their charges are permitted to increase
in relation to the retail prices index) at privatisation whereas the others
received positive X-factors.
Hydro-Electric and Scottish Power yesterday dismissed Mr Bruce's remarks.
Scottish Power pointed out that its tariffs had fallen by 4.8 per cent in
real terms since privatisation in 1991. Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the
Scottish National party, said the companies were both 'guilty of the same
profiteering as Offer is trying to curb'.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Stock Exchange probes dealings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange has launched a review of trading in shares of the 12
regional electricity companies in recent weeks and has questioned several
brokers about transactions which may have involved insider dealing.
Brokers said the Stock Exchange appeared particularly interested in whether
some directors had purchased shares in rival companies.
Share prices soared yesterday after the report showed price controls less
onerous than were thought likely until recently.
The Stock Exchange declined to comment yesterday. But it is understood that
the exchange, as a routine matter, conducts special surveillance of trading
in a company's shares when it knows a price-sensitive statement is about to
be released. Such statements would include profits reports, notice of an
acquisition or disposal, or - in a regulated industry - news of regulatory
changes.
Dealers said that the purchase by an electricity company director of shares
in a rival did not mean that inside information was available. Such a
decision could have been based on detailed knowledge of the industry and its
likely prospects, similar to the information available to industry analysts
at a securities house. However, if the director was privy to information not
available to knowledgeable individuals, and used that information to
purchase shares, insider dealing may have occurred.
ESN Pension Scheme, the company which invests the regional power companies'
pension funds, yesterday said it had stringent rules on the purchase of
electricity company shares by employees. Employees may not buy the shares
except those offered in an initial 'free' offer. If they do buy shares, they
must do so through a broker selected by ESN which reports all transactions
to senior management. Any share purchases must be reported to management.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Littlechild bids 3% in power poker game: Electricity review
aims to cut costs; Investment plans reduced; Dividend growth predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new electricity price controls announced yesterday emerged after what
can only be described as a high-stakes game of poker between the electricity
industry and its regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild.
The aim of the review was to bring down electricity bills by forcing
electricity companies to become more efficient and cut costs.
But the consultations between Prof Littlechild and company managements
inevitably focused on where and how cost savings could be achieved. It was
in the companies' interests to exaggerate their costs and to convince the
regulator that it would be difficult to bring them down. It was up to the
regulator to call their bluff, then set targets which were demanding but
fair.
After more than a year of consultation and bargaining his key conclusion is
that companies should be able to cut their costs by 3 per cent a year on
average - slightly less in sparsely populated areas to allow for unavoidable
costs such as the extra expense of distributing electricity. He originally
proposed 4 per cent, but was persuaded that this was unrealistic.
The 3 per cent level, which some companies still think is too high, compares
with the 2 per cent annual cost saving target recently set for the water
industry, which is generally judged to be more bloated than electricity.
Prof Littlechild also decided to cut the companies' investment plans. These
showed large increases over past budgets, and, with a total Pounds 6.2bn for
the five years up to 2000, seemed to be more than was required to maintain
and expand the system. So he trimmed them by 10 per cent to Pounds 5.6bn
overall, with some companies suffering cuts of 25 per cent.
He also put the companies' cost of capital at 7 per cent. Although Prof
Littlechild says that he used evidence from a variety of sources to
determine this statistic, he does not say how he actually reached it, other
than to note that it is in the middle of the 6.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent
range which has been proposed for British Gas. The level set for water was 5
per cent to 6 per cent.
In setting the price controls Prof Littlechild decided that some electricity
companies had already reaped greater rewards than others from efficiency
improvements. So he divided them into three categories with progressively
tougher targets. But companies and analysts complained yesterday that it was
not clear how he had selected the 'winners and losers'. Mr Nick Pink,
analyst at SG Warburg, said: 'The result is a fudge'.
The last stage in the process was to decide whether to introduce price cuts
all at once or over a number of years. The outcome - big cuts of 11 per cent
to 17 per cent in the first year followed by a succession of small 2 per
cent cuts - is essentially a compromise, although it also suits the
electricity companies because they can afford to take a big hit now, and
will then have easier targets in the more uncertain future.
Many factors complicated the process. One is the National Grid Company,
which the electricity companies own jointly but intend to sell next year.
The value of this company, estimated at up to Pounds 4bn, and the effect of
disposal on the companies' balance sheets had to be taken into account.
So did the fact that full competition will be permitted in the electricity
market in 1998, after which price regulation should have less meaning.
However, Prof Littlechild has decided to extend the new regime up to 2000
because he believes it needs that long to have its full effect.
A further factor is the strong possibility that electricity companies will
merge or be taken over now that the uncertainty of the review is out of the
way. Prof Littlechild seemed unclear yesterday about how this might affect
the controls on companies involved.
Although the regulator's main aim was to trim prices which he believed had
reached unacceptable levels, he also had to bear in mind the return for
shareholders. He thinks there is enough leeway in the new controls to allow
companies to continue to pay adequate dividends. This was certainly the view
of the stock market, where analysts were predicting strong real growth in
payments to shareholders.
The one issue on which Prof Littlechild was powerless to take direct action
was the most inflammatory of all - chairmen's salaries. By unfortunate
timing his announcement coincided with newspaper headlines on the Pounds 1m
pay-off for Mr Bryan Weston, the two-days-a-week chairman of Manweb.
Executive salaries 'were a matter for the companies, not the regulator,' he
said. But he stressed that his new controls assumed that companies would
have to cut wage bills, and any extravagant pay deals would have to be at
the shareholder's rather than the consumer's expense.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Review starts champagne corks popping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chief executives of most of the regional electricity companies made a
'gentleman's agreement' some time ago that whatever the outcome of the
distribution review they should not accept the regulator's verdict on the
day it was announced. One said: 'We felt it might be a bit unseemly to snap
it up immediately.'
But behind closed doors yesterday the celebrations were well under way - the
champagne corks had started popping as early as Wednesday morning, almost as
soon as the companies had time to digest Prof Littlechild's report.
The City yesterday expected all 12 electricity distribution companies for
England and Wales to follow the lead of East Midlands Electricity, Yorkshire
Electricity and Seeboard and accept the report. The long months of
uncertainty were all but over and, as one analyst put it, 'none of the
companies are in trouble'.
The rises in share prices and the revised forecasts of analysts suggest that
may be an understatement. UBS was expecting the sector to show real dividend
growth of 8 per cent annually until the end of the decade, with real growth
in earnings per share of 6 per cent a year.
Hoare Govett pushed its forecasts for real dividend growth for the sector
from 6 per cent to 8 per cent to the end of the century. SG Warburg
predicted 6.5 per cent. Most houses also expect the companies to be
cash-positive for most of the five-year review period, taking the businesses
as a whole, rather than just the distribution divisions which were the
subject of Prof Littlechild's review.
Analysts differed, however, on which companies had won and lost the most.
The companies that were initially judged to have come out worst were the
three whose allowed price caps Prof Littlechild said should be revised
downwards by 17 per cent. As a result Chester-based Manweb; Swalec, serving
south Wales; and Northern Electric saw relatively low increases in their
share prices.
There were signs, however, of a rethink later in the day. Some analysts
believed that the scope for Manweb and Swalec to cut costs might mean that
they were not as disadvantaged as at first appeared. There was less
enthusiasm for Northern's position.
Manweb also pointed out that the 17 per cent reduction was from the full
prices it could have charged under the existing formula - since Manweb was
not recovering its full entitlement, the effect was a one-off drop in
nominal charges of just 10 per cent.
The chief executive of another company - one of the six which will be
suffering cuts in allowed revenues of 14 per cent - said it was too
simplistic to judge companies simply on the revenue cut being applied to
them. He said: 'You have to take a variety of factors into account including
the size of the existing price cap, the capital-expenditure requirements and
the asset base.'
Southern Electric, which serves south-east England, was one of the few
companies thought to have come out well by virtually all analysts. Other
companies which saw relatively high rises in share prices included London
Electricity.
Shares in London Electricity have performed relatively poorly in recent
months because of fears that the regulator would not approve its explanation
that its cost base is higher than most as a result of being based in the
capital.
Several analysts said that its appearance among the six companies which have
to cut price caps by 14 per cent next April meant that the regulator had
accepted London's arguments.

Cumbria county councillors decided yesterday to ask Mr John Gummer, the
environment secretary, to call in the planning application by Nirex, the
nuclear industry's waste disposal company, for a Pounds 120m rock laboratory
beneath Sellafield.
The council believes consideration of the plans, which would study the
geology of the site for Nirex's proposed Pounds 2b underground nuclear waste
repository, should be part of a wide-ranging public inquiry into the whole
issue of nuclear waste disposal.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Barclaycard to build Pounds 45m HQ on business park site
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclaycard, the credit-card issuer owned by Barclays Bank, is to spend
about Pounds 45m on building a new headquarters at the Northampton Business
Park, Paul Cheeseright writes.
The headquarters will bring together, on the outskirts of Northampton, staff
split between three leased buildings in the town centre. Barclaycard's 2,600
employees make it Northampton's largest employer. Barclays said contracts
had been exchanged for the purchase of 18 acres at the business park, where
the asking price for land is Pounds 350,000 an acre.
Northampton Business Park is in the hands of the receiver, Mr Robin Addy of
Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Mr Addy was appointed by a consortium of banks, not
including Barclays, when UK Land, the property company developing the park,
collapsed in 1991.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Value of foreign contracts rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The value of overseas construction contracts won by British companies jumped
16 per cent last year to Pounds 3.25bn. Orders were almost 50 per cent more
than in 1991, according to figures published yesterday by the Department of
the Environment.
The biggest rise was generated from other European Union countries, where
orders increased from Pounds 70m in 1992 to Pounds 234m last year in spite
of a general decline in European construction output.
The department said the rise reflected successful attempts by British
companies to break into EU markets through acquisitions, mergers and joint
ventures rather than the award of any single big contract.
The total value of European contracts, including those from non-EU
countries, increased 48 per cent to Pounds 273m from Pounds 184m. There was
also a big increase in Middle Eastern work where the value of new contracts
increased to Pounds 400m from Pounds 235m.
Sir Paul Beresford, construction minister, said: 'Most of the contracts were
won against stiff competition in North America and the Far East, but it is
also encouraging to see signs of increased success in Europe.'
North America was the biggest single market for British contractors working
overseas with the value of new contracts rising from Pounds 998m to Pounds
1.24bn - the first time since 1990 that orders from the region have topped
Pounds 1bn.
The rise reflected a general improvement in US construction markets where
British companies have longstanding interests.
Orders from the Far East, the world's fastest-growing construction market,
fell last year to Pounds 752m from Pounds 862m. This reflected a slowing in
the pace of contract awards for Hong Kong's new airport rather than any
general loss of market share by British companies.
The value of Hong Kong orders fell to Pounds 471m from Pounds 723m, a
decline of 35 per cent. The value of work carried out by British contractors
in Hong Kong rose last year to Pounds 409m from Pounds 190m, reflecting the
high value of orders won in previous years.
The value of work done by British companies in all international markets
rose 18 per cent last year to Pounds 2.76bn from Pounds 2.33bn. At the end
of the year British contractors had Pounds 3.39bn outstanding international
orders, a 14 per cent increase on the Pounds 2.97bn at the end of the
previous year.
The increase in international contracts comes when UK construction orders
have also been rising. The department said that domestic orders in the three
months to the end of May were 12 per cent higher than in the corresponding
period last year, while the Pounds 2.1bn value of orders in May was the
highest monthly total for four years.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Growers chip away at potato board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Andrew Cullen learnt that potato growers were to be balloted on
whether to keep the Potato Marketing Board, he saw it as a chance to 'settle
an old score'.
He is voting to wind up the 60-year-old board after years of resentment
about its system of quotas and intervention buying, which he believes
penalised efficient growers and allowed imported potatoes to steal their
markets.
'The Potato Marketing Board is a misnomer,' complained Mr Cullen, who grows
40 hectares of potatoes near Harwich, Essex. 'They don't market a single
damn spud. The only thing they do is to be a fairly efficient gatherer of
statistics. But anyone could do that. It doesn't need an army of
bureaucrats.'
The potato industry has been split since a group of 420 producers exercised
its right to call a poll of the country's 15,000 growers last month on the
future of the board and its potato marketing scheme. Voting closes today and
the result should be known on August 23.
If the vote goes against the board, the services it provides will be wound
up overnight and its 170 staff will be given three months' notice.
Government plans to replace the board in 1997 with a promotional and
research body will end. Growers will have to set up their own 'industry
council' if they want to develop and market a product which brings farmers
Pounds 325m in annual sales.
Twenty miles from Mr Cullen's farm, Mr Tony Evans grows 15 hectares of
potatoes. He criticised the board as old-fashioned and slow to recognise
'that the consumer is king', but wants to keep it.
He said: 'If you've got something, you should make it better rather than
abandon it. If we let it go now, I don't think we'll have anything in three
years' time.'
The battle started last November when the government announced that the
board would lose its statutory power to support prices by buying potatoes in
a glut. The system of quotas which confined growers to a fixed output each
year was loosened and the board was slimmed down. The potato marketing
scheme was to be wound up over three years and producers would decide the
functions of a successor body. But the government's action brought
disenchantment to the surface. Once the main function of the board -
intervention buying - disappeared, many growers were reluctant to continue
paying high levies, even when these were cut by 44 per cent to Pounds 48 a
hectare this year.
Mr Graham Solari, the Shropshire grower who heads the 420 rebels under the
banner of the Potato Producer Poll Campaign, said his supporters agreed that
the potato industry needed research, promotion and market information. 'We
do not believe, however, that those tasks should cost growers Pounds 7m a
year via the PMB. The board was created, equip-ped and staffed for a bygone
age. It is no longer relevant to modern potato production.'
He said he had discussed with the government plans for a 'lean and
efficient' successor body which would hire consultants as needed and should
cost no more than Pounds 2m a year - about Pounds 15 a hectare.
The board, backed by the National Farmers' Union, argues that this level of
spending would be a waste of growers' money. Mr Alasdair Fairbairn, its
chief executive, said: 'It would be impossible to fund effective programmes
on such a flimsy, shoestring budget, therefore weakening growers' ability to
compete in national and international markets.' He proposes a levy of Pounds
35 a hectare for the successor body.
Mr Cullen is convinced that British growers can compete with Continental
rivals without the board. But he is pessimistic about the outcome of the
vote: 'I think they'll hang on by the skin of their teeth.'

FT  12 AUG 94 / Passports plan for export cattle
</HEADLINE>

The government is to consider issuing passports for cattle destined for
export, Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, said yesterday.
The move follows the imposition of tighter European Union rules on the sale
of beef carcasses to the Continent because of fears over 'mad cow' disease.
The EU introduced regulations three weeks ago saying that beef carcasses
cannot be exported from Britain unless traders can show certificates proving
that the animals have not been exposed to bovine spongiform encephalitis
(BSE) for the past six years. This is an increase from two years.
Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, and
representatives of the meat trade met Mr Waldegrave yesterday to highlight
the problems caused by the new rules.
Many farmers had in effect been cut off from the export market because of
the difficulties involved in providing the necessary certificates.
Mr Waldegrave said cattle passports could be introduced on a voluntary basis
to speed up the checking of cattle for export.
The document would record the name and address of each owner of an animal as
well as any auction markets through which it had passed.
The agriculture ministry will help exporters to trace the history of animals
by releasing names and addresses of farms which have not had a case of BSE
in the past six years.
Sir David said the measures were a step in the right direction 'but there
are still many practical steps that need to be taken to ensure a continual
flow of the maximum amount of beef eligible for export'.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Waldegrave to argue for fish compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES

<TEXT>
Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, yesterday said that the
government would consider compensating Cornish fishermen whose nets had been
cut by their Spanish rivals.
The agriculture minister said that the government would take up the issue of
compensation for the fishermen with the Spanish government and that the door
for interim compensation by the British government 'was not entirely
closed'.
Meeting Cornish fishing representatives, he stressed that the Royal Navy was
present in the Bay of Biscay to protect British boats from the actions of
Spanish fishermen.
He said: 'I emphasised that the first duty of the navy and the government is
to ensure that our fishermen are not driven from the fishing grounds by
harassment or illegal action of any kind.'
The Cornish fishermen had earlier complained about being harassed by British
navy inspectors over the size of their drift nets. Spanish fishermen say
that the British are using nets which are longer than the legal limit.
Mr Paul Tyler, Liberal Democrat MP for Cornwall North, said Mr Waldegrave
was in effect admitting that the system for enforcing the European Union
rules on net size had not worked properly and that the fishermen had a
justifiable concern.
The navy has so far sent two British trawlers back to port for allegedly
fishing with nets longer than the legal limit. Mr Waldegrave said yesterday
that the government had decided not to take legal action against either of
those boats and that one of them, the Charisma, had received a caution.
Mr Waldegrave said he had tried hard to clear up 'misunderstandings' between
the navy and trawlers over measuring nets. Fishermen will now have their
nets measured on-shore before they set sail. They will then let them out at
sea in the presence of navy and EU inspectors who will be briefed on the
measurements.
'If the inspector knows what he's expecting to find, it will make it
easier,' Mr Waldegrave said.
He stressed that he would consider interim compensation although this would
be an unprecedented and difficult action.
'It is the Spanish who should pay for illegal actions against our ships,' he
said.
