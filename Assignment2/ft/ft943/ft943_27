FT  12 AUG 94 / Schools minister backs performance-pay link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Eric Forth, the schools minister, is calling for teachers' pay to be more
decentralised, and linked more closely to performance.
His intervention sparked the first dispute between the government and the
teachers' unions since Mr John Patten was replaced by Mrs Gillian Shephard
as education secretary last month. It came in a letter to the School
Teachers' Review Body, the quango which advises the government on setting
teachers' pay.
Mr Forth was acting in Mrs Shephard's absence. He said he wanted the body to
report on 'how the pay of all school teachers might be more closely related
to individual performance, and what measures might be taken to ensure that
pay discretions are used for this purpose'.
He also wanted to ensure that schools had 'adequate flexibility to recruit
and retain teachers and to reward the taking on of extra responsibilities'.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said
that this was 'a further indication of the review body's lack of
independence'. If teachers still had their negotiating rights such a
worthless scheme could not be forced on the profession, he said.
He added that performance-related pay 'has no place in education'.
The National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers also
opposes performance-related pay. Mr Brian Clegg, the union's assistant
secretary responsible for pay and conditions, said: 'Every year since 1991
the review body has been asked to look at performance-related pay.
'It's particularly annoying at the moment because the review body have
looked at it and done some research over the last couple of years. Instead
of waiting for the review body to carefully research things step by step, I
think the government are being a little greedy.'
The Association of Teachers and Lecturers said Mr Forth's letter showed 'a
short-sighted concentration on flexibility, along with insufficient
resources'.
But the association suggested that it was more prepared to countenance
performance-related pay than the other teachers' unions. It wanted the
review body to provide 'new long-term opportunities, including promotion in
the classroom'.
Last September the Department for Education announced that it was to
introduce a pilot performance-related pay scheme in 14 schools.
Mr Michael Portillo clashed with health secretary Mrs Virginia Bottomley
while he was chief secretary to the Treasury over privatising the National
Health Service's supplies authority, according to letters leaked to the
Health Service Journal.
In the letter, written in December, Mr Portillo said the housing and
distribution arm of NHS supplies should be contracted out 'as early as
possible in 1994', along with market testing of information technology
facilities.
But Mrs Bottomley replied that implementation should be over a 12- or
18-month period starting this summer. She said: 'This is not an area where a
big-bang approach seems sensible.'
Mrs Bottomley's department has decided that market testing for NHS supplies'
distribution arm will not now start until 'the early part of next year'.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Estate agents see fall in house sales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
House sales last month fell by almost a 10th compared with July last year,
says a survey of more than 4,000 estate agency offices handling about a half
of all sales.
The survey by the Ombudsman for Corporate Estate Agents provides further
evidence of the slowdown in the housing market which has occurred since
early spring. It said potential purchasers were concerned about possible
rises in interest rates.
Sales were also 12.1 per cent lower than June this year.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Labour warns on shopping centres
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authorities which suffered financial loss because their objections to
out-of-town shopping centres were overruled should be compensated by the
government, Mr Keith Vaz, a Labour environment spokesman, urged yesterday.
He called on Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, to follow up the recent
policy U-turn towards keeping shops in town centres by autho-rising higher
regeneration grants to areas whose once-thriving high streets had started to
resemble ghost towns.
Mr Vaz said a survey showed that, since 1989, 290 out-of-town developments
opposed by local authorities on planning grounds had been allowed on appeal
to the environment secretary.
Mr Vaz said the government's U-turn had resulted in a 'lame-duck policy'
which left councils footing the bill.

<TEXT>
John Laing, the UK construction group, has won the main contract to
refurbish London's NatWest Tower, which was severely damaged in a terrorist
bomb attack in April 1993, Andrew Taylor writes.
The contract for work on Britain's second-tallest building is thought to be
worth about Pounds 80m.
The 42-storey property, previously housed the headquarters of National
Westminster's high street banking operations.
Mr David Edmonds, NatWest's property and central services general manager,
said yesterday that a decision on how the building was to be reoccupied
would not be taken until closer to the completion of the refurbishment in
December 1996.
The bank intends to reclad the exterior of the building in its original
style. It will, however, redesign the interior.
Schmidlin UK has been awarded the cladding sub-contract. Crown House
Engineering has been awarded mechanical and electrical and public health
sub-contracts. The architects are GMW Partnership, assisted by Richard
Seifert and Partners, the original architects of the tower.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Rosy vista with thorns for government: The middle class is
sceptical over the recovery and refuses to 'feel good'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's news that manufacturers in every region are increasing output
and orders was just the latest piece of data to paint a rosy picture of the
economy. Figure after figure has been pointing to steady, non-inflationary
growth.
Unemployment is falling, mortgage rates are at a 25-year low, economic
growth is ahead of the trend and underlying inflation is in the lower half
of the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range.
Producer price numbers, announced this week, showed that rising commodity
prices are not yet being passed on by manufacturers.
But if Conservative Central Office staff were to imitate President Clinton's
campaign team, they would have a sign on the wall saying 'It isn't the
economy, stupid'.
In spite of the signs of economic success, and the conventional assumption
that this should translate into support for the government, Labour had a
record 33 percentage-point lead in a recent opinion poll.
It is not only political indicators that are signalling a lack of British
joie de vivre. Although the economic recovery is two years old, and output
is now above the 1990 peak, Gallup surveys show that consumer confidence has
failed to regain pre-recession levels.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has lamented the lack of a 'feel-good
factor'.
In part, this downbeat mood is due to the nature of both the recovery and
the recession which preceded it.
According to Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, there were
two unusual features of the last recession. 'First, there was a drop in
nominal house prices,' he said. 'Secondly, when the labour market had its
shakeout, it hit the service sector and white-collar employees.'
Both factors particularly affected the middle classes - a key Tory
constituency. And the upturn has not restored their position.
For a start, this recovery is not as robust as its predecessors. Mr Douglas
McWilliams, chief executive of the Centre for Economics and Business
Research, points out that the pace of economic growth in the present
recovery is only about half the average for the second calendar year of an
upturn.
Furthermore, the new flexibility in the labour markets means that 'people
are prepared to accept terms they would not have accepted before', Mr
McWilliams said. 'Some have traded down their jobs.'
Middle-class jobs used to be almost a sinecure, he said, but now
professionals faced constant career uncertainty.
Nor have consumers been able to enjoy a feel-good factor from rising house
prices. According to Mr James Barty, UK economist at Morgan Grenfell, 'this
is one of the first recoveries where the housing market hasn't played much
of a role'.
There are some upbeat signs, however. Mr Gardiner said: 'What consumers are
saying is not what they are doing. They are reducing their savings ratios
and taking out more credit.'
He points to figures published on Monday which show that year-on-year growth
in consumer credit is running at 12 per cent. In spite of widespread fears
this year's tax increases have not derailed the recovery, although they may
have slowed its pace.
Most economists believe that there is still scope for consumer spending to
grow, as the savings ratio - savings as a proportion of personal disposable
income - is still relatively high at 10.4 per cent.
So while the economic end-results may be good, it is possible that consumers
still resent the means by which the government has achieved those results.
Mr Barty of Morgan Grenfell said: 'In people's perceptions the recovery is
not due to the government's good management but to an accident - our
departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism. And a government that got
re-elected on the basis that it was the party of low taxation then hit
voters with one of the largest tax increases in history.'
The Conservative party's agony may thus be that, even if the voters
eventually feel good about the economy, they may still feel bad about the
government.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Post Office support for sell-off rapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party yesterday attacked Post Office chiefs who announced that
they backed government plans to sell 51 per cent of the Royal Mail and
Parcelforce to the private sector.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said that yesterday's
response from the Post Office to the government's green paper had 'more to
do with the best interests of the board members than it has to do with the
best interests of a public service Post Office'.
He added: 'As in every other privatisation, I am sure the directors of the
Post Office would do very well out of a sell-off. The same can't be said for
the rest of the workforce or for the consumers.'
Mr Hugh Dykes, one of the Tory MPs opposed to Post Office privatisation,
also criticised the management's public stand. He said: 'The suspicion is
bound to linger in the public mind that senior executives are not only in
favour of full privatisation for what they perceive as genuine operational
objectives, but also as an opportunity to reward themselves like some water
company chiefs.'
Mr Michael Heron, Post Office chairman, urged ministers to decide on the
future of postal services as soon as possible after the consultation period
on the green paper ended on September 30 and warned that the business could
'go into decline' if it did not secure commercial freedom.
Mr Bill Cockburn, Post Office chief executive, denied that post offices were
at risk of closure with the proposed move to 51 per cent private ownership.
He accused opponents of 'scaremongering'. Under the proposed option, he
said, post would continue to be delivered to every address from Monday to
Saturday in a uniform tariff structure. Postal counters would remain in the
public sector but be free to provide a wider range of services.
The Post Office also sought to deny suggestions that privatisation would
lead to higher prices.
It said: 'When market forces are increasing and customers have more choice
than ever before, it is in Royal Mail's commercial interests to keep a tight
control on prices.'
The UCW communications union accused the Post Office of 'irresponsibly
ignoring the overwhelming views of their workforce, many major mail users
and above all the British public'.
Mr Derek Hodgson, UCW deputy general secretary, said: 'Commercial freedom
for an integrated Post Office in the public sector is practical, popular and
achievable. Other European postal administrations operate in this way.'
The Department of Trade and Industry has commissioned audio-tape and braille
versions of the green paper.

The contract for work on Britain's second-tallest building is thought to be

About two thirds of the windows in the tower were blown out in the

ceilings and wall partitions.
The bank intends to reclad the exterior of the building - which was opened
in 1981 - in its original style. It will, however, redesign the interior.
The design of the building dates back to the early 1960s and many of the

After the explosion the bank's staff were re-housed in other buildings -
mostly at its neighbouring Drapers Gardens offices in the City.

<TEXT>
C&amp;G's plan will mean that:
Borrowers will get no cash payments.
Investors - savers who are members of the society - who opened accounts
after December 31 1992 will get no cash payments.
Investors of more than two years' standing at the end of this year will get
about 13 per cent of the balance of each investment account up to a maximum
of Pounds 100,000, provided the account is still open on completion day. The
sums will be on the basis of the lower balance on either completion day or
April 20 this year. Those with more than Pounds 100 at the end of 1994 get
an extra Pounds 500.
Holders of deposit accounts who maintain an account open at the end of March
until completion day will get about 13 per cent of the lower balance of each
account on March 31 this year or the completion day. Those who had more than
Pounds 100 at the end of March will get an additional Pounds 500.
Holders of Pibs - permanent interest bearing shares - and C&amp;G Channel
Islands accounts will qualify for the flat payment of Pounds 500.

FT  12 AUG 94 / C&amp;G plays democratic numbers game: The pitfalls facing the
building society's revised deal with Lloyds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is one of the oddities of democracy in building societies that the board
of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society should be encouraging even those
who oppose its plan to join the Lloyds Bank group to express their views by
voting.
The C&amp;G board is right to do so - in the interests of its plans to accept
the Pounds 1.8bn cash offer from Lloyds as well as the proper exercise of
rights in a mutually owned organisation.
Its revised scheme for sharing out the cash which was published yesterday is
more likely to hit the hurdle of stringent requirements on the turnout among
investing members approving the deal than it is to fall at the necessary
majorities of those voting.
In terms of borrowing members, a simple majority of those voting is all that
is required. If only three of the 370,000 or so borrowers voted, and two
were in favour, that would be enough.
But the position of investing members causes more problems, particularly
since the High Court ruled in June that the original proposals were
unlawful.
The investors' resolution must be approved by at least 75 per cent of those
who vote. It must also be approved by at least half of the number of
investors eligible to vote, or investors holding 90 per cent of the total
balances of those eligible to vote.
So if opposition to the plan appears almost non-existent many investors who
favour the Lloyds bid could conclude that the deal will go through without
their bothering to vote.
This would carry the risk that the resolution would fall not because the
majority was too low among those voting, but because too few supporters cast
their votes.
C&amp;G's original scheme addressed this by giving a cash handout to every
member which would have acted as an incentive to vote. Investors could have
received up to Pounds 10,000 each and borrowers would have received Pounds
500 cash.
But the ruling by Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, that cash could
be paid neither to investors of less than two years' standing at the
qualifying date nor to any borrowers has made members' reaction to the
current scheme more doubtful than if the first plan had not been put
forward.
First, borrowers who thought they were going to get a cash sum will now have
to be content with hints about the good life they will enjoy as part of
Lloyds Bank. But the absence of a turnout requirement makes this less
significant than it would otherwise be.
Second, investors who became members of the society after the end of 1992
will have had the prospect of cash payments snatched from them, but will
still be entitled to vote.
Even if they blame the law rather than the society, they may think it is
worth trying to stymie the deal on the basis that by the time another one
comes along they are likely to have been members long enough to qualify for
cash.
But this group of disappointed C&amp;G members will not be anything like as big
as the 27 per cent it would have been had the original cut-off point of the
end of 1991 been retained. It may amount to less than 10 per cent of the
potential electorate. If that is so, they would not be able to stop the deal
on their own.
There is, however, a third aspect which may cause C&amp;G to pause for thought.
The months of discussion about the offer have been a consciousness-raising
experience for C&amp;G members. There are those who believe that the offer
undervalues the society and who would like to see a competing bid, or who
want more discussion of floating the society as an alternative strategy.
Mr Paul Rivlin and Mr Peter Nicholson, who organise a group of C&amp;G members
wanting to consider an alternative to the Lloyds offer, are seeking the
support of 100 members to call a special general meeting. Mr Nicholson said
yesterday that at such a meeting they would demand further information from
C&amp;G - including the number of members who were not eligible for cash but
could vote, and the length of the 'shut-out' period during which C&amp;G has
agreed not to talk to other potential bidders.
Yesterday's announcement may give the group enough impetus to force a
general meeting by October.
But the history of building society members' quiescent involvement in the
organisations they own suggests that even this would be a hiccup in the
process rather than a hammer blow to the deal.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Mayhew to look at objections to Hualon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday said he would
examine objections from leading British industrialists to a move by Hualon,
the Taiwanese group, to build a textiles factory in Belfast.
In a meeting with Mr Nicholas Winterton, Tory MP and chairman of the
Manufacturing and Construction Industries Alliance, and other textile
industry chiefs, Sir Patrick said that he would 'give full consideration' to
claims that the Hualon project could lead to substantial losses in the
textile industry on the mainland.
He would not, however, commit the government to reviewing its decision to
give Pounds 61m in aid to the Taiwanese company to build its plant.
Sir Patrick also pointed out that the potential for job displacement had
already been taken into account by ministers, and that state support for
Hualon had been ap-proved by the European Commission.
Textile manufacturers say that the Hualon project would lead to job losses
because of existing overproduction of textiles in Europe.
Although Hualon could employ more than 1,300 people, the project has been
described as a 'Trojan horse' which could give the south-east Asian textile
industry a foothold in Europe.
Mr Winterton emphasised at yesterday's meeting that existing textile
companies in Northern Ireland risked losing jobs if the project went ahead.
He also claimed that one Northern Ireland company feared it could be
'deskilled' as a result of Hualon taking its trained operatives.
The Northern Ireland Office restated yesterday that there was scope for
Hualon to sell products to mainland Europe and the US, and to substitute
products which are now imported to Britain from south-east Asia.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Watchdog clears travel operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading yesterday cleared the package travel industry of
anti-competitive behaviour and said no formal action was needed.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said consumers had a
wide choice of competitively priced holidays in spite of ownership links
between big tour operators and travel agents. He said the links did not
prevent smaller companies from selling their holidays.
Sir Bryan added: 'Vertical integration may make it more difficult for
newcomers to enter the market, but there is no evidence at the moment that
any of the leading operators with agency links have been able to insulate
themselves from competition.'
He was concerned that customers might not be aware of links between travel
agents and operators, and urged companies to make customers aware of such
links.
The findings were welcomed by Thomson and Airtours, the two largest
operators. Thomson owns Lunn Poly, the largest travel retail chain. Airtours
owns Going Places, the second largest. Both said their branches already
carried signs explaining their links with the operators which owned them.
The Association of Independent Tour Operators attacked the findings. Ms Sue
Ockwell, chief executive, said: 'It's bad news for independent tour
operators and travel agents and that, in turn, means it's bad for the
public.
'When you go into a travel agent you expect a choice, you expect independent
travel advice and you don't get that from the big companies. The OFT have
just sat back and said they find that acceptable.'
Sir Bryan said, however, that the watchdog had examined the practices about
which small companies had complained. These included the payment of
discriminatory rates of commission to different travel agents, the refusal
by some agents to carry the brochures of certain tour operators, and agents
promoting their parent companies' holidays. Sir Bryan said he had paid
particular attention to Thomson and Lunn Poly.
He said the central issue was 'whether any such practices significantly
damaged the ability to compete fairly of independent travel agencies or
operators who do not hold shares in travel agencies.' He added: 'Bearing in
mind the relatively large number of tour operators and travel agents and the
evidence of vigorous competition, I do not consider the allegations of
anti-competitive behaviour to be substantiated.'

FT  12 AUG 94 / City regulator imposes life ban on former investment
advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regulators yesterday barred two former investment advisers from the industry
for life, bringing to four the individuals banned under section 59 of the
Financial Services Act.
The Securities and Investments Board earlier this year made convicted
fraudster Mr Roger Levitt the first target of its barring powers.
The two named yesterday are Mr Peter Glennie - the target of a High Court
injunction last year preventing him from collecting insurance premiums for
policies that did not appear to exist - and Mr John Charles Miles, who was
convicted in 1989 of theft and sentenced to five years in prison.
Mr Miles, who also operated as John Carrington Miller and Jonathan Charles
Miles, later became an independent financial adviser associated with Knight
Williams, a chain of independent financial advisers, providing false
references to facilitate his employment.
Knight Williams filed a writ last year against Mr Miles seeking damages for
fraudulent misrepresentation of his employment history and providing
fraudulent references.
While employed by Knight Williams, the writ alleged, Mr Miles induced his
clients to invest funds in a company which he controlled. That investment
business was not authorised under the Financial Services Act and violated
the terms of his employment by Knight Williams.
In the case of Mr Glennie, who traded as John Allen and Co, SIB
investigators had been looking into the cases of an estimated 200 clients
for whom insurance premiums had been collected but not passed on to the
relevant insurance company.
The second of the four to be barred came earlier this year when SIB also
made a permanent disqualification order against Mr Christopher Fallon, a
financial adviser jailed for nine months for conducting unauthorised
investment business after having been the subject of a High Court injunction
barring him from doing so.
After the injunction was served on Mr Fallon he took Pounds 24,000 from two
individuals. This was not recovered and because the investment business was
unauthorised, they could not seek compensation under the Investors
Compensation Scheme.

FT  12 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Eximbank financing to include defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US House of Representatives has passed legislation which would allow
Eximbank, the US government export credit agency, to broaden financing to
include 'non-lethal' products produced by US defence manufacturers. An
identical bill is to be introduced in the Senate.
The bill represents an attempt by the Congress to give a boost to defence
companies which are converting their factories to civilian uses.
Eximbank's charter prevented it supporting defence sales in developing
countries. It was changed in 1992 to prohibit military sales everywhere, the
exception being for drug interception equipment.
The current change arose from the loss of a US bid to sell an air traffic
control system to Hungary. Eximbank refused to fund it because the system
would also be used by the military. The bill, if passed by the Senate, would
allow the financing of equipment and services, primarily for civilian
purpose but occasionally used by the military.
Eximbank is undergoing a number of changes, as it becomes increasingly a key
instrument of US foreign economic policy. Foreign aid is no more popular
than it ever was, so it has been up to the bank and the Overseas Private
Investment Corporation to take the lead in conveying US adjustment
assistance to eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics.
It has signed a series of 'project incentive' pacts with Russia,
Turkmenistan, Belarus and Kazakhstan, and it is moving into limited recourse
project finance.
This lending does not require the guarantee of the borrowing company's
government. Instead repayment is guaranteed from the revenue stream of the
product itself.
Another provision of the House bill authorises a Dollars 35m fund to promote
the sale of environmental goods and services from small US companies.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Cross-border deals show strong rise: US reclaims role as
magnet for foreign capital, survey reveals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mergers and acquisitions of companies across international borders reached
Dollars 77bn (Pounds 50bn) in the first half of 1994, according to a report
published yesterday. That represents a 10 per cent increase on the sums
spent on deals in the second half of last year but is still below the
Dollars 90bn of deals made in the first half of 1993.
One of the most striking trends revealed in the report by KPMG Peat Marwick,
the accountancy and consultancy firm, is that the US has returned to 'its
traditional role as a magnet for foreign capital' helped by the weakness of
the dollar and the resurgence of economic growth.
In the first six months of the year, foreign companies spent Dollars 26bn on
more than 300 acquisitions, joint ventures and minority investments in US
companies.
Foreign spending in the US is 'on track to surpass last year's total by
almost 50 per cent', the survey says.
That marks a reversal of the pattern of the last two years, when US
companies spent more on acquisitions abroad than foreign companies did in
the US. In 1992, US companies spent Dollars 22bn on 824 foreign deals, and
imported Dollars 14bn through 528 transactions. Last year, US companies
spent Dollars 38bn on 942 deals but foreign companies spent only Dollars
33bn on 570 deals.
However, despite the dollar's weakness this year against sterling, the
historically strong level of deals between US and UK companies fell by 30
per cent to around Dollars 16bn in the first six months of 1994, the survey
says.
Last year, UK companies were responsible for four of the six largest foreign
takeovers of US companies. But so far this year, SmithKline Beecham's
acquisition of Diversified Pharmaceutical Services from United Healthcare
has been the only UK deal to figure in the top six foreign takeovers by
value as ranked by KPMG.
It also notes a 70 per cent drop in spending by Japanese companies on
foreign acquisitions, which may reflect political and economic uncertainty.
But the drop in the value of US companies, measured in yen, is likely to
tempt Japanese companies back into deal making, the survey predicts.
The survey also notes that there were sharp drops in spending in acquisition
investment in Russia and China, from a combined total of Dollars 22bn in
both countries in 1993 to only Dollars 5bn in the first half of 1994. It
attributes this to the collapse of the Russian economy and to human rights
tensions in China.
Following last year's successful completion of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, deals across the borders of Nafta countries - the US, Mexico and
Canada - appear to be sharply up in the first half of 1994. Despite
political unrest in Mexico, deals total Dollars 7bn so far this year,
compared to Dollars 11.4bn in the whole of 1993 and Dollars 2.5bn in 1991.
The 1994 figures - and the bidding for Del Monte and Westin Hotels - reflect
the new aggression of Mexican buyers, the survey notes. Already, in the
first six months of 1994, Mexican purchasers have spent as much as they did
in the past three years.
However the survey comments that, in theory, the lowering of trade barriers
through deals such as Nafta 'reduces the need to acquire cross-borders'.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Producer prices edge up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The underlying rate of US inflation at the wholesale level remained modest
in July, in spite of the producer price index's largest increase in 15
months, writes Jurek Martin in Washington. The index's 0.5 per cent advance,
after no rise at all in June, was almost entirely the result of higher
energy and coffee prices, with the core element up only 0.1 per cent.
For the year to date, wholesale prices have risen at an annual rate of 2.2
per cent, which constitutes some recent acceleration as the rise over the
last 12 months has been only 0.6 per cent.
The Commerce Department also reported yesterday a 0.1 per cent decline in
retail sales in July, following a revised 0.8 per cent rise in the previous
month. The drop was largely attributable to a 1.7 per cent fall in vehicle
sales.
Although the jump in wholesale prices exceeded most expectations, equities
initially took the new data in their stride, but in the afternoon followed
bond prices down.
Merrill Lynch's economic commentary yesterday said the latest data 'should
be read as encouraging news for the financial markets and for the Fed'.
Nevertheless, it continued, 'we still expect the Fed to tighten monetary
policy next week, probably raising the Fed fund rates by 25 basis points to
4.5 per cent.'

FT  12 AUG 94 / Senators back community banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration has completed the first item on its banking
legislation agenda with a Senate vote to pass the Community Development Act,
which will set up a Dollars 382m (Pounds 246.4m) fund to spur the creation
of local development banks and partnerships in economically distressed
communities, writes George Graham.
But a more far-reaching bill to allow banks to open branches outside their
home states, overturning decades of US banking tradition, remains blocked in
the Senate. Although its supporters believe they will easily win a vote on
the measure, which passed the House of Representatives last month, the
debate on healthcare reform has pushed it off until at least September.
The Community Development Act was a significant component of President Bill
Clinton's economic programme, and administration officials say it should
improve access to credit for communities which have found it difficult to
obtain financing.
Mr Frank Newman, a Treasury undersecretary, said he hoped within a year not
only to establish the fund but to make the first investments. The fund may
offer equity, loans or grants to community development banks, as well as
providing credits to traditional banks which increase community lending.

FT  12 AUG 94 / World Trade News: PBN boosts aerospace tie with Romanian
company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pilatus Britten-Norman (PBN), the manufacturer of maritime patrol,
surveillance and small commuter aircraft, is planning to strengthen its ties
with the Romanian aircraft industry by either forming a joint venture or
taking a stake in Romaero, the Bucharest-based aerospace company.
Romaero has been the main subcontractor of PBN, the Isle of Wight-based
company owned by the Swiss Oerlikon-Buhrle group since 1979, for 26 years.
It builds the basic airframe of the Islander and the Defender, the military
version of the twin engine propeller aircraft.
Mr Anthony Stansfeld, PBN's chief executive said PBN was about to launch a
larger version of its Defender surveillance aircraft at next month's
Farnborough Air Show. The launch comes at a time when governments are
stepping up their fight against illegal immigration and narcotics and are
showing increased interest in patrol aircraft to monitor fishing zones. The
fishing dispute in the Bay of Biscay has highlighted the role of maritime
patrol aircraft.
Demand is also expected to increase with the ratification next November of
the Law of the Sea Convention, which will encourage maritime countries to
step up protection of their 200-mile so-called Exclusive Economic Zones
(EEZ).
PBN is also attempting to penetrate the Russian and Chinese markets by
negotiating manufacturing agreements with Russian and Chinese aerospace
companies. The company believes there is strong potential for its short
take-off and landing commuter aircraft in both those markets.
'The idea is for our aircraft to be built in Russia and China,' Mr Stansfeld
said.
Although PBN now employs only about 190 people, its Islander aircraft has
been one of the best-selling commercial aircraft produced in western Europe.
Since it was launched in 1967, more than 1,200 aircraft have been sold in
120 countries and about 1,000 aircraft are still in service.
The Defender was subsequently developed to expand the Islander's market base
into the government agency and military markets.

Vietnam has said it will fine the growing number of foreign companies that
are abusing representative office licences issued by the government.
Representative offices are often an investor's first step into Vietnam but
their licence only allows marketing and liaison. They are not allowed to
receive income in Vietnam.
However, an increasing number of foreign investors are using them for
trading and carrying out business transactions. They say this is because the
rules applying to representative offices are not in keeping with the present
investment climate.
'They were essential in the early years (of foreign investment) when people
came to do feasibility studies,' said one US consultant based in Hanoi. 'But
now people are actually trying to do business.'
Foreign representative offices found violating their charter will be fined
Dollars 50,000 and will be subjected to surprise inspections by the ministry
of trade, which grants the licences, the government said. A further fine of
Dollars 20,000 would be imposed for offices operating beyond expiry of their
licence.
Vietnam's chamber of commerce and industry says there are 964 representative
offices with 629 in the southern industrial hub of Ho Chi Minh City and the
rest in the capital, Hanoi. Most of those breaking the law are understood to
be small Asian companies.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Chile knocks on all trade doors: An export-based economy is
seeking partners everywhere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When it comes to seeking out trade agreements, Chile is gaining the
reputation of a bit of a flirt.
Not only is Santiago courting the US in the hope of consummating a
free-trade pact, but it has also sealed an agreement with Mercosur that is
expected to lead to associate membership of the emerging customs zone that
covers Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.
As if this were not enough, Chile is later this year due to join the Asia
Pacific Economic Co-operation group (Apec), which it hopes will coalesce
into a preferential trading area.
'We have come to the conclusion that the only way to gain access to other
markets is by bilateral or regional negotiations,' says Mr Juan Salazar,
director of international economic relations at the Foreign Ministry. 'After
we had unilaterally opened up our economy, we supported the multilateral
negotiations through Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and the
Uruguay Round, but this has not been enough - not all the world's markets
have opened up as fast as ours.'
Chile, with a domestic market of only 13m people, relies heavily on exports
which account for nearly a third of its gross domestic product. It considers
itself a 'global trader', dividing exports evenly among Europe, the Americas
and Asia.
'That's the reason we have all these simultaneous tracks, because we don't
want to depend exclusively on one region, one partner or one country,' says
Mr Salazar. He admits, though, that wooing several partners at once is not
without its risks. 'Sometimes the message gets confused and people wonder
what we're up to.'
There is also evidence that the Foreign Ministry resents being excluded from
high-profile talks with the US; the official view is that Nafta falls more
logically to the Finance Ministry.
Whatever the complications, most exporters - ravenous for better market
access - believe Chilean tactics strike a good balance. 'It's right that we
have different alternatives and discuss these issues at the same time - I
see no problem with that,' says Mr Claudio Garca, president of the
Chilean-American Chamber of Commerce.
Mr Garca rejects arguments that the deal with Mercosur could jeopardise
negotiations with the US: 'I think the Americans know exactly what a free
trade agreement with Chile means and I doubt that any other negotiations
Chile may be carrying out will change their attitude.'
Mr Garca says that, as well as stimulating trade, accords also provide
arbitration mechanisms through which commercial disputes can be settled.
Chile is still smarting from the 1989 poisoned grape fiasco when the US
imposed a three-week embargo on Chilean fruit after discovering two grapes
laced with cyanide. Such an incident, said to have cost Dollars 212m in lost
revenues, is more readily avoided if there are 'clear rules of the game', Mr
Garca says.
Chile signed its first free-trade agreement with Mexico in 1991, after which
trade between the two countries grew from Dollars 158m to Dollars 340m last
year. This spurred the signing of similar accords with Venezuela in 1992 and
Colombia in 1993, and the opening of talks with several other regional
states.
Although Chile had long been suspicious of Mercosur, its attitude slowly
changed as it came to realise that it could not ignore Brazil and Argentina,
its third and fourth largest trading partners respectively. The relationship
was sealed last week with a protocol expected to lead to associate
membership for Chile.
Through Mercosur, Chile in turn hopes to win better access to European
markets. 'We have to belong to one of these major regional schemes so as to
negotiate with Europe as a bloc,' says Mr Salazar. 'It would be very
difficult for us to achieve a bilateral Chile-European Union agreement.' The
view of 'fortress Europe' looms large, and Santiago is painfully aware that,
alone, it lacks negotiating clout.
In the case of Asia, where Japan is challenging the US as Chile's principal
trading partner and where trade is blossoming with countries such as Taiwan
and South Korea, Santiago has opted to join Apec. Its hope is that this bloc
too will develop into some kind of free-trade area.
That leaves Nafta, the biggest prize of all. Here Chile is hostage to
political wrangling in Washington and can do little but wait and see whether
the US Congress passes the fast-track authority needed to start formal
talks.
'If President Clinton does not get fast-track authority before congressional
elections in November, I think we're doomed to take more time. If he does .
. . there is a probability an agreement will be signed next year,' says Mr
Garca.
Mr Joaqun Vial, top adviser to the Finance Ministry, agrees that Chile must
recognise its limited negotiating muscle and take its chances as they come.
'Opportunities present themselves according to a timetable beyond our
control. We are not in a position to say: First Mercosur, then Nafta and
then Apec.'
If the door is open, he says, one must run towards it. Like many officials,
Mr Vial believes that flirting with all and sundry is not just an option -
it is a 'necessity'.

offices in the country, with 629 in the southern industrial hub of Ho Chi
Minh City and the rest in the capital, Hanoi.
There are no official estimates of how many foreign companies are breaking
the rules but local press reports citing violations have appeared more
frequently this year. Most are understood to be small, Asian companies.
Many foreign companies, particularly lawyers, sidestep the restrictions by
negotiating business contracts in Vietnam but actually sign them and receive
fees at branch offices elsewhere in Asia.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Guatemala's chance not to 'shoot it out': Elections for a
congress that is intended to help bring peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former general accused of thousands of human rights abuses has emerged as
the central figure in congressional elections in Guatemala on Sunday.
The election is for a reduced congress of 80 members who will serve only
until January 1996. But they will have to legislate on commitments made by
the government and left-wing guerrillas who are hoping to sign a peace
agreement to end 34 years of civil war.
Leading the polls are two right-wing parties, the Partido de Avanzada
Nacional (PAN), which has strong backing from much of the business
community, and the Frente Republicano Guatemalteco (FRG), led by retired
General Efrain Rios Montt, a former coup leader and rabid Christian
fundamentalist whom human rights groups accuse of being responsible for
thousands of political killings during his 18-month regime in 1982-83.
The government, which has already begun to lobby prospective deputies, is
hoping that the new congress, unlike its predecessor, will be more receptive
to what is expected to be a heavy legislative load.
But the election is also being seen as providing political parties with the
opportunity to improve the abysmal reputation for venality and personal
advancement that they currently enjoy.
'This is a last chance. If we don't make this work we'll have to shoot it
out,' says Mr Jorge Skinner Klee, a veteran congressman who is standing for
re-election.
The PAN and the FRG are perceived as the parties least to blame for the
political impasse which has characterised relations with the executive over
the last year.
While the rise of Mr Rios Montt has alarmed human rights groups, popular
organisations and intellectuals, his campaign, which emphasises honesty and
a tough stance on law and order, has struck a chord with Guatemalans who
feel besieged by the high levels of crime and are sickened by apparently
endemic institutional corruption.
'Every time somebody's car gets stolen, a girl gets raped or a bus gets held
up, that's another vote for Rios Montt,' says Mr Skinner Klee.
The fact that two mass graves, with remains of civilian victims of massacres
carried out by the security forces during Mr Rios's regime, are being
exhumed appears to have had no effect on the electorate.
Supporters of the general admit that this is the beginning of a campaign for
presidential elections in November 1995. His prospects then may hinge on
whether his party gains a large representation in congress. 'If the FRG wins
a landslide, obviously it will strengthen his chances,' says Mr Gustavo
Porras, an analyst.
The election was brought forward by 15 months as part of a compromise
constitutional reform package agreed between the government and congress in
November after President Ramiro de Leon failed to muster enough political
support to force a clean-out of a corrupt congress.
Mr De Leon, who says he has high hopes that he will be able to work amicably
with the new congress, needs congressional approval before the end of
September on a favourable deal struck with Paris Club creditors on
rescheduled debt.
The government is also keen to push through fiscal reforms, blocked by the
current congress, which would strengthen sanctions for tax evasion, and are
intended to increase Guatemala's tax take from 8 per cent to 10 per cent of
GDP.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Energy costs lift producer index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The underlying rate of US inflation at the wholesale level remained modest
in July, in spite of the producer price index's largest increase in 15
months. The index's 0.5 per cent advance, after no rise at all in June, was
almost entirely the result of higher energy and coffee prices, with the core
element up only 0.1 per cent.
For the year to date, wholesale prices have risen at an annual rate of 2.2
per cent, which constitutes some recent acceleration as the rise over the
last 12 months has been only 0.6 per cent.
The Commerce Department also reported yesterday a 0.1 per cent decline in
retail sales in July, following a revised 0.8 per cent rise in the previous
month. The drop was largely attributable to a 1.7 per cent fall in vehicle
sales.
Although the jump in wholesale prices exceeded most market expectations,
Wall Street took the new data in its stride, with the stock market climbing
modestly in morning trading. This week's sharp drop in coffee futures
removes one large element of the July increase.
Greater attention will be paid to the consumer price returns due to be
published today, to the industrial production returns out on Monday and to
next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee, which
may well result in the fifth increase in short-term interest rates since
February.
Merrill Lynch's economic commentary yesterday was representative of market
analysis. The latest data, it said, confirmed that the economy was on a path
of moderate growth and low inflation and 'should be read as encouraging news
for the financial markets and for the Fed'.
'Nevertheless,' it continued, 'we still expect the Fed to tighten monetary
policy next week, probably raising the Fed fund rates by 25 basis points to
4.5 per cent.'
On the wholesale front, energy prices rose 2.5 per cent in July, led by
petrol, up 8 per cent, and heating oil, 6.4 per cent higher. Coffee prices
were 42.8 per cent higher as a result of frost damage in Brazil. Overall
food prices rose by 0.5 per cent.
The Labour Department also reported a small (6,000) weekly increase in the
number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits. This now stands at a
seasonally adjusted 321,000.

FT  12 AUG 94 / US nears sweeping telecoms reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US is now just two steps away from the most sweeping changes to its
telecommunications law for 60 years, after the Senate commerce committee
yesterday agreed to a bill that would allow long-distance and local
telephone companies, as well as cable television companies, to enter one
another's markets.
'This legislation is as important to the economy as the healthcare
legislation,' said Senator John Danforth, the senior Republican on the
committee. 'Millions of dollars hang on every comma.'
But the bill still needs to pass the full Senate, and must then be
reconciled with similar legislation passed by the House of Representatives
in June. The legislation would set the terms under which the seven regional
Bell operating companies - known as 'Reeboks' or Baby Bells - would open up
their local telephone network monopolies in exchange for being allowed to
enter other markets.
The Bells now face severe restrictions on their activities under the court
order which broke up the original AT&amp;T monopoly 10 years ago, in order to
prevent them from abusing their local monopolies. They are barred not only
from offering long-distance services but also from making telephone
equipment.
Although yesterday's committee vote of 18-2 suggests widespread support,
several senators plan to propose controversial amendments when the bill
comes to the floor of the full Senate. Some supporters of the bill fear it
will not be possible to set aside enough time for debate before congressmen
go home to fight the November mid-term elections.
One of the fiercest fights is expected to be over a measure that would
require the Bells to manufacture telephone equipment in the US and buy most
of their components from US suppliers. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, has warned that this domestic content requirement conflicts
with the US's obligations under Gatt and the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
The bill drafted by Senator Ernest Hollings, the commerce committee
chairman, represents a delicate compromise over when the Bells will be
allowed to expand from local telephone services to the long-distance and
other markets.
Mr Hollings dropped his original requirement that the Bells must face
'actual and demonstrable competition' in their local market before they may
start to offer long-distance services. Instead, they must open up networks
to other suppliers and obtain the permission of both the attorney-general
and the Federal Communications Commission.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Senate backs community banks: Legislation will allow easier
access to credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration has completed the first item on its banking
legislation agenda with a Senate vote to pass the Community Development Act,
which will set up a Dollars 382m (Pounds 246.4m) fund to spur the creation
of local development banks and partnerships in economically distressed
communities.
But a more far-reaching bill to allow banks to open branches outside their
home states, overturning decades of US banking tradition, remains blocked in
the Senate. Although its supporters believe they will easily win a vote on
the measure, which passed the House of Representatives last month, the
debate on healthcare reform has pushed it off until September, at the
earliest.
The Community Development Act was a significant component of President Bill
Clinton's economic programme, and administration officials say it should
improve access to credit for communities which have found it difficult to
obtain financing.
Mr Frank Newman, undersecretary for domestic finance at the US Treasury,
said he hoped within a year not only to establish the fund and set out the
criteria on which it would judge applications, but also to make the first
investments. The fund may offer equity, loans or grants to community
development banks, as well as providing credits to traditional banks which
increase their community lending.
If, as Mr Newman hopes, the Senate passes the Interstate Branching Bill this
year, the administration still has unfinished business on its banking agenda
when a new Congress comes to Washington next year.
Mr Newman lists the securities activities of US financial institutions,
issues of fair lending and community responsibility for financial services
companies which are not banks, and an overhaul of the Federal Home Loan Bank
system as priorities.
But the issue which bankers will be watching most closely is the
consolidation of the various agencies which now supervise banking activity.
Treasury proposals to consolidate federal bank regulators into a single
agency were put off this year in the face of opposition from the Federal
Reserve, which has supervisory responsibility for a large portion of the
banking industry. Mr Newman said the Treasury was 'pretty far along' in its
efforts to resolve the disagreement with the Fed.

Several Latin American governments are to send a mission to Haiti in an
attempt to persuade the country's military leaders to step down and prevent
a US-led military invasion to restore the exiled president, diplomats in
Port-au-Prince said yesterday, writes Canute James in Kingston.
The move will come 'in a few days' despite earlier doubts about its
effectiveness.
The mission, which had seemed unlikely last week, would offer Haiti's
military governors a 'last chance to save themselves', by leaving office. If
they did not, several countries which were now reluctant to support military
intervention might change their minds, the envoys said.

The Philippines recorded a Dollars 906m (Pounds 585m) trade deficit in June,

record Dollars 4.07bn, National Statistics Office data published yesterday
showed, Jose Galang reports from Manila. The six-month deficit was 41.6 per
cent higher than the year before.
The gap resulted from a much faster increase in imports, which rose by 26
per cent to Dollars 10.14bn, while exports grew by 17 per cent to Dollars
6.07bn. In June alone, imports reached Dollars 2.02bn, more than double the
Dollars 1.34bn in the same month last year.

New Zealand's National party should continue to govern even if it loses its

from Wellington. Mr Anderton has said the opposition parties would simply
insist the government acted in a consultative manner.
Financial markets have begun to react negatively to opinion polls which
suggest the Alliance could win the election. This is being held because of
the retirement of former finance minister Ruth Richardson from the former
National stronghold in the Selwyn electorate.
The prospect of a loss has caused signs of panic within National, with
Premier Jim Bolger warning of 'economic chaos' if the Alliance wins.
Financial markets reacted to his comments, with the New Zealand dollar
falling, interest rates rising and the share market dropping, a Bankers'
Trust economist said.

rods, they added. Wider negotiations on plans for North Korea to switch to a
safer type of nuclear power technology were proceeding slowly and nothing
more than a 'modest' agreement was expected.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's exports continued to grow more strongly than imports in the seven
months to the end of July, indicating a smaller trade deficit for the year
than forecast, Tony Walker reports from Beijing. According to Chinese
customs statistics, exports reached Dollars 58.74bn (Pounds 39.1bn), an
increase of 31.2 per cent over the same period last year. Imports totalled
Dollars 58.81bn, up 19 per cent. In July exports grew much faster than
imports: they were up by 35.7 per cent compared with a rise in imports of
just 9.7 per cent.
This indicates imports continue to slow in response to tight restriction on
credit imposed in July last year and tightened in the early months of this
year.
China last year recorded a Dollars 12.2bn deficit on its trading account
compared with a surplus of Dollars 4.4bn in 1992. Chinese economists had
forecast a Dollars 10bn trade deficit this year, but it now seems likely it
will be less. Chinese customs reported that to the end of July, Japan was
China's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching Dollars
23.15bn compared with Dollars 20.98bn for Hong Kong and Dollars 17.2bn for
the US.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Outspoken chairman quits HK company: Resignation of Jimmy
Lai 'not connected' with virulent criticism of Chinese PM

<TEXT>
Giordano, the fashion retailer whose Beijing store was closed by China on
Monday, yesterday announced the resignation of Mr Jimmy Lai, non-executive
chairman. His successor, Mr Peter Lau, said the closure of the Beijing shop
triggered Mr Lai's decision to quit.
However, directors said there were no grounds to connect the closure with Mr
Lai's virulent criticism of Chinese premier Li Peng in his popular weekly
Next Magazine.
'In the interests of the company we would separate personal views from the
view of the board. The board do not share Jimmy Lai's views; therefore we
found it would be beneficial for him to resign,' the company said.
Although widely expected, the departure has delivered a jolt to the business
community in Hong Kong, by far the bulk of whom are engaged in activities on
both sides of the border. For those who refuse to accept the coincidence of
the Beijing shop's closure and Mr Lai's open letter to Mr Li, this is the
first blatant instance of Beijing dictating to Hong Kong business. However,
few are prepared to voice their fears publicly.
Privately, a government official said: 'This is going seriously to worry the
community here in Hong Kong if they think Lai was forced to stand down
because of political reasons, because such an action would strike at the
heart of Hong Kong's future autonomy in terms not only of freedom of
expression but non-interference in commercial affairs too. And these are the
twin bedrocks on which the success of Hong Kong has been built.'
Announcing the board decision yesterday Mr Lau, chief executive, said: 'As
far as the Giordano board of directors is concerned our primary
responsibility is to all shareholders. If one (shareholder) happens to hold
certain views which we may not think are beneficial to certain markets, then
it is the directors' responsibility to bring this up in discussion with
shareholders.
'As a non-executive chairman or as a shareholder who also holds an official
position, I think the views he continues to express in his other businesses
are not compatible at times with the markets that we operate in. The views
he makes have no benefit to the company in these markets, and could hurt
it.'
The fate of voting rights - attached to his 36 per cent shareholding - was
still under discussion with the securities regulator last night.
Initial plans to assign all voting rights to three executive directors,
including Mr Lau, were quashed by the Securities and Futures Commission as a
breach of the takeover code, which stipulates that a transfer of a holding
in excess of 35 per cent be accompanied by a general offer. One option is
for Mr Lai to abstain at all shareholder meetings.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Most companies unprepared for HIV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Most multinational companies will find themselves inadequately prepared if
an employee is diagnosed HIV positive, according to a Harvard study
presented in Yokohama yesterday at the end of the 10th international
conference on Aids.
The survey received responses from 27 large companies with headquarters in
15 countries. It concluded that while nearly all had briefed their managers
on the issue, and two thirds had an employee programme for Aids prevention,
the application of policies was largely left to the initiative of local
managers.
Training of these managers was not systematic, and big western companies
appeared to be motivated as much by fear of potential litigation - whether
on the part of their staff, suppliers or customers - as by any overriding
concern for the well-being of their workforce. Some 30 per cent thought they
would suffer direct costs through increased medical or insurance expenses.
The findings were announced in the final hours of a conference which has
served largely to emphasise the long haul ahead to any cure or vaccine.
Among the few breakthroughs unveiled were the role of the AZT treatment
produced by Wellcome of the UK in reducing the risk of a pregnant woman
transmitting HIV before or while giving birth to her child, and the success
of a three-drug cocktail in halting the virus - but so far only in the
test-tube.
The event - which this week brought together some 10,000 scientists,
pharmaceutical executives, health workers and Aids activists - is the last
annual conference of its kind. The next is not due to take place until July
1996 in Vancouver.
It was, however, the first such session to have been held in Asia, which
epidemiologists expect will soon have the highest rate of new infections.
The Japanese government drew criticism yesterday from campaigning groups for
an immigration policy which would exclude visitors known to be HIV positive,
unless they arrived this week as a delegate. But it also gained plaudits for
using the conference to heighten Aids awareness among its own population.
Only a handful of Japanese are openly HIV positive, and 97 per cent of the
620 Tokyo listed companies which responded to a survey backed by the labour
ministry said they had never encountered any problem related to the virus.
But the study, conducted among others by representatives of Sanwa Bank and
the Nippon Express transport company, reported that 37 per cent had taken
some action to counter the spread of the disease.
Of those, more than nine out of 10 said they had provided preventative
education, and over half added that this was also aimed at reducing
discrimination or prejudice.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Sri Lankan business fears poll upset
</HEADLINE>

Sri Lankan businessmen are bracing themselves for the possible defeat in
next week's general election of the ruling United National party which has
governed the country for 17 years.
They fear victory next Tuesday for the left-leaning opposition People's
Alliance, an eight-party coalition, could bring political and economic
uncertainty.
'Uppermost in the minds of most Sri Lankans in this election will
undoubtedly be the maintenance of political stability,' says the current
issue of the Sri Lanka Exporter, a pro-government business magazine.
The opposition parties have given public assurances that they would not
abandon the pro-market economic reforms carried out by the UNP over the past
three years. Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunge, the opposition leader, has called
for 'structural adjustment with a human face'. But businessmen fear her
allies, which include the Communist party, will demand more radical shifts
in economic policy.
Shares on the Colombo Stock Exchange fell sharply earlier this year when Mrs
Kumaratunge began attracting huge crowds at rallies. But it has since
stabilised.
The political uncertainty began in March with the ruling party's defeat in
March in provincial polls - the UNP's first electoral setback in 17 years.
Mr DB Wijetunga, who succeeded the assassinated president, Ranasinghe
Premadasa, last May, tried to win back support with a string of populist
financial hand-outs, including tax cuts and food-stamps for schoolchildren.
But he failed to take the steam out of the opposition, especially the
centrist Sri Lanka Freedom party, headed by Mrs Kumaratunge, the daughter of
Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike, the former prime minister.
The general election was not due to be held until next year, after a
presidential poll in November, but Mr Wijetunga has called an early general
election in the belief that the UNP will do better in a party-based contest
than in a head-to-head presidential battle between himself and Mrs
Kumaratunge.
The UNP in its campaign is reminding voters that, under Mrs Bandaranaike's
leftist government, the pre-UNP 1970s were for Sri Lanka 'an era of ration
cards, queues, quotas and shortages'. Mrs Kumaratunge, herself a generation
younger than Mr Wijetunga, appeals to voters who are too young to remember
the 1970s and who believe that 17 years in power is long enough for any
party.
Mrs Kumaratunge is also trying to exploit the fact that even though Sri
Lanka has successfully opened its economy to international trade and
investment, unemployment (standing at 12.6 per cent) and inflation (running
at an annual rate of 11.4 per cent) remain persistent problems.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Japan's credit crunch threatens anaemic recovery: For the
first time on record the economy has suffered a contraction in lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Japan's anaemic recovery shows any sign of strengthening in the next
year, it will not be thanks to the country's banks.
Figures published this week by the Bank of Japan show the economy is
suffering from a severe credit crunch. Credit creation has been on a steeply
declining path since the end of 1990, when the economy began its long
recession, but in June and July, for the first time on record, the economy
suffered credit contraction.
In June lending by domestic banks contracted by 0.1 per cent over the same
month a year ago; for July the contraction was 0.4 per cent.
'Instead of injecting purchasing power into the economy, the major banks are
actually withdrawing money,' said Mr Richard Werner, chief economist with
Jardine Fleming in Tokyo.
The figures have renewed concerns that financial institutions, weighed down
by their own bad debt burden, are increasingly reluctant to lend even to
financially secure prospects.
The banks' defence is that they are simply helpless spectators at a beggars'
banquet. The problem is not shortage of supply, they argue, but a lack of
demand, as companies express little interest in borrowing to finance new
investment.
Indeed, they point out, so severe is the dearth of demand for bank lending
that they have in recent weeks pared interest rates to the bone for their
larger corporate customers to entice them back, even at the risk of cutting
further their slim profit margins.
But critics of the banks say their willingness to lend is increasingly
selective. The prodigality that characterised the late 1980s so-called
'bubble economy', when asset prices surged, has given way to a
hyper-conservatism that is stifling investment and recovery.
The truth lies somewhere in between. There is certainly limited demand for
credit from the larger companies. The Bank of Japan's last quarterly survey
of business sentiment published in June revealed that most large companies
were finding banks more, not less, accommodating than they were a year ago.
Their own reluctance to invest is striking. In the boom years, companies
indulged in an excess of capital spending that resulted in widespread
over-capacity when the recession took hold. Most of them now say they can
meet a revival in demand without having to increase investment, and are
therefore not in the market for bank loans.
Even if they were, the growth of raising finance in the security markets
would enable them to overcome any reluctance on the part of the banks by
simply issuing bonds or equities.
'Corporate demand for capital investment remains very weak,' said a
spokesman for the Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan. 'It may be
true that banks have tightened lending criteria, but that's certainly less
important than the lack of demand for borrowing.'
That is not the experience of Mr Takanobu Matsuda. Mr Matsuda is the
president of a small electronics manufacturer in Nagano in the Japan Alps.
Earlier this year he needed funds to finance the sort of restructuring
Japanese companies are being urged to undertake - to pay for severance
payments as he cut the company's payroll - but was turned down. His business
barely survived the experience and he is bitter about the episode.
'Small companies like ours, with little capital, are dependent on the banks
for funds. Even though we have now completed the restructuring process and
are growing again, we still find it difficult to borrow.'
Mr Matsuda's case is typical of small companies. Banks may be willing to
lend to larger ones, but see small businesses as too risky.
The reason, said Mr Werner, is that the collapse in property prices in the
last few years transformed banks from aggressive lenders into models of
parsimony.
'The assessment of credit risk is largely based on the archaic method of
assessment of the value of collateral, mainly land,' he said. While large
companies, sitting on substantial land holdings, have no difficulty
borrowing, small businesses are unable to convince banks that their
collateral will hold its value, even if their cash flow and other business
indicators are healthy.
Several banks have already had their own near-death experiences as a
consequence of an expanding non-performing loan portfolio and are anxious
not to repeat them.
Apportioning blame for the implosion of credit is ultimately an unproductive
exercise. What matters is that money is now being drained from the economy.
At the same time, public sector liquidity is also parched. Since credit
creation represents purchasing power, the implications for the economy are
disturbing. Without an early upturn in lending, whether supply- or
demand-led, Japan's nascent recovery may prove short-lived.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Nigerians dig holes for jet fuel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria has gold in the north, marble in the middle belt and oil in the
south-east but in Lagos people are digging for jet fuel.
For the past month crowds have arrived in a patch of bush next to the
international airport, carrying jerry cans and scooping the fuel out of pits
they have dug in the ground or out of pools forming on the surface.
The jet fuel has leaked out of an underground pipeline running from the
outskirts of the city to the hydrant installation at Lagos international
airport. Jet fuel is a substitute for kerosene, which millions of Nigerians
depend on for cooking but supplies are running out.
The place is called Mafoluku, but has been nicknamed 'Bakassi', after the
peninsula where troops from Nigeria and Cameroon clashed earlier this year,
because it is full of oil and soldiers.
A platoon of soldiers guarding an office of the state-owned Pipelines and
Products Marketing Company (PPMC) next to the pipeline shows no sign of
interest while the people mill around shallow pits underneath two government
signs which say 'Safety on the job begins here' and 'No smoking'.
Mafoluku shows the extent of the break-down in the public sector and what
many Nigerians will do just to get by in life. 'There has been a leak there
for about two years and despite repeated attempts PPMC have still not fixed
it,' says an executive for one of the oil companies which run the jet
fuelling operation at the airport.
'It is not dangerous to use this for cooking, it's basically the same fuel.
These people are getting it for free. There is no kerosene around because it
is all being used as jet fuel to keep flights going.'
Domestic fuels are supplied by PPMC and officially sold at a subsidised
price of some 4 pence sterling a litre, but for most of this year it has
been scarce. Long queues of women and children with their kerosene cans have
become a normal sight outside petrol stations.
The six-week political strike by the oil workers' unions Nupeng and
Pengassan has made fuel almost unobtainable except at a 1,000 per cent
mark-up on the black market. Kerosene and LPG cooking gas can be bought only
at black market prices 12 times the official price (around 50 pence a litre
of kerosene).
Many manual workers are paid the equivalent of about Pounds 10 a week and
cannot afford these prices.
Those who wish to play it safe are reduced to searching for firewood.
The unions are demanding the end of Gen Sani Abacha's regime and release of
Mr Moshood Abiola, banned winner of last year's presidential election, who
has been jailed for treason.
Last week's general strike is suspended until next Tuesday's hearing of the
court trying Mr Abiola in Abuja. But the Lagos branch of the Nigeria labour
congress has stayed out, bringing the commercial capital in Mr Abiola's
Yoruba heartland near to standstill. A bank strike, just ended, delayed
payments of July salaries; public transport is scarce; and power cuts are
worse than usual. But some people have cooking fuel, unorthodox though it
is.

FT  12 AUG 94 / PM given plans for new constituencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Japanese advisory panel yesterday submitted a draft to Prime Minister
Tomiichi Murayama for redrawing constituencies for the lower house, one of
the main pillars of a political reform package, Emiko Terazono reports from
Tokyo.
The last phase of the reforms that have dominated Tokyo politics in recent
years, the redefining of the boundaries of 300 single member constituencies,
aims to eliminate discrepancies of voter representation.
Politicians have for long seen the old multi-seat system as the root cause
of a string of funding scandals. Candidates, often from the same party, felt
obliged to compete on the basis of lavish campaigns rather than on policies.
At present, there is a huge difference in the size of urban and rural
constituencies. The plan presented yesterday reduces the level of disparity
between the most populated electoral district in the northern island of
Hokkaido and the least populated constituency in Shimane, western Japan, to
2.1 times, down from as much as three times.
As a result, rural areas will lose seats while cities will gain. Mr Jeff
Young, political analyst at brokers Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, says the
changes will eventually lead to more consumer oriented policies, and boost
deregulation efforts.
Electoral reform will also reduce the number of seats in the lower house
from 511, which are elected in multi-member districts to 500, of which 300
will be elected in single member constituencies and 200 will be decided by
proportional representation in 11 regional blocks.
The passage of electoral reform legislation through parliament, which could
come as early as next month, will pave the way for the government to enact
the political funding bill, which will regulate the distribution of public
subsidies to political parties. While parties in the ruling coalition -
Social Democrats, Liberal Democrats and New Harbingers - are seen as wanting
minimal changes in electoral boundaries, because of fears of losing their
old support bases, they are not expected to haggle over electoral reform
because they need funds.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Germans pass free time in 'free' toil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
West Germans spend 60 per cent more time working for nothing than in their
paid jobs, according to the results of a statistics-stretching exercise,
published yesterday.
Official data on how people in the region pass their time show 47bn
person-hours are consumed every year in paid employment, compared with 77bn
in labouring unrewarded in the house, garden and toolshed.
For reasons which are not immediately obvious, the latter figure includes
holiday and sick leave from paid jobs.
For equally obscure reasons, the federal statistics office has calculated
that if bills for all this 'free' toil were presented, based on an average
housekeeper's net pay of some DM11 an hour, the region's gross domestic
product would expand by at least DM860bn (Pounds 355bn).
Counting in the 'added value' generated by using the washing machine, car
and other appliances, the figure inflates to DM1,000bn.
The data constitute 'important and long-overdue recognition of the value of
unpaid work to the community', Mr Hans Gunther Merk, office president, said
in a statement accompanying the release of a brochure entitled, 'Where does
the time go?'
The brochure contains the initial findings from a study in 7,200 households
during 1991 for which all family members aged 12 and above filled in a log
of how they spent their time for two consecutive days.
At a more accessible level, Mr Merk's team of analysts discovered that even
west German men deliver 20 hours' free labour a week at home, while women in
the traditionalist 'kids, kitchen and church' society work an average 35
hours unpaid.
The average unrewarded working stint for the whole group was 28 hours a
week. At the going rate for housekeepers this was worth DM2,550 per
household per month.
Leisure consumed an average five hours a day, with the media, including two
hours in front of the TV set, accounting for half the total. Adults devoted
an average 30 minutes to sport and play, 15 minutes to 'culture', and the
rest to gossiping and entertaining.
All in all, the study found employed men put in a nine-hour working day,
including jobs at home, while home-bound married women with small children
worked the same length of time but without the benefit of a pay packet.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Balladur's bulldog refuses to be muzzled: Mr Charles Pasqua,
France's pugnacious interior minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even the most ardent French conservative could scarcely deny that Mr Edouard
Balladur's cabinet is, well, somewhat staid. Yet there is an exception: Mr
Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, who, whatever else he has been
accused of, could never be called boring.
The pugnacious Mr Pasqua, 67, with his bulldog features and booming voice,
is rarely far from the headlines in France. Yet this week 'Charlie' - as he
is widely known - has attracted the attention of the international media
over his clampdown on Algerian militancy which has involved more than 110
detentions, thousands of vehicle checks and the banning of five Islamist
publications, culminating yesterday with the Socialist opposition lodging a
formal complaint against him with the prime minister.
To the French, who still remember his first stint as interior minister
during Mr Jacques Chirac's premiership from 1986 to 1988, this week's events
simply represent a continuation of his characteristically draconian stance
on immigration and terrorism.
In other countries, they act as an eerie reminder of the heavy policing in
France under General de Gaulle during the 1960s.
Mr Pasqua is almost certainly flattered by such allusions. He loves to brag
about being 'the son, brother and nephew of policemen' and 'Charlie's boys'
have returned the compliment by regarding the interior minister as one of
their own.
Moreover, Gen de Gaulle was the man who brought him into politics in the
1960s and has remained his idol ever since.
'Pasqua might toy with Balladur and Chirac but he's only ever recognised one
political master and that's De Gaulle,' said a senior conservative.
'Besides, one of his strengths is that he couldn't care less what anyone
thinks of him.'
Mr Pasqua, after all, has had a much tougher trajectory than his cabinet
colleagues, most of whom conform to the Gallic political cliche of
comfortable careers as civil servants after graduating from the elite
Grandes Ecoles. He was born near Marseilles, leaving him with a rasping
Marseillaise accent with which he terrorises his posher fellow
parliamentarians. He became a Resistance courier during his teens, working
for a network led by his latterday foe, Mr Francois Mitterrand, the
Socialist president.
He spent the 1950s and 1960s travelling up and down France as a sales
director for Ricard, the drinks company, but also helped to found the
infamous Service d'Action Civique, a militia that helped Gen de Gaulle's
secret service fight against North African terrorists. He entered parliament
in 1966 and has since relished his role as the Gaullist tough guy railing
against everything from European union to Germany's inclusion in this
summer's D-Day commemorative march along the Champs-Elysees.
Mr Pasqua, who once said 'politics is like journalism, you've got to be a
thug to get things done', frequently falls foul of other ministers, notably
Ms Simone Weil, the influential health minister. 'But Balladur knew exactly
what he was doing when he appointed him,' said one political analyst. 'He
needed someone to do his dirty work. Charlie was just the guy for the job.'
Charlie is also an invaluable weapon for the Gaullists in curbing the
popularity of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen's extreme right-wing National Front. He
has recently become a little too popular for the taste of Mr Balladur and Mr
Chirac, both of whom have their eyes on the conservative presidential
candidacy for next year's elections, although even Mr Pasqua's most ardent
supporters suspect he is likelier to be a 'king-maker' than a serious
contender.
Yet he is still making the most of the publicity generated by this week's
clampdown. Charlie was in fine form on French radio earlier this week when
he dismissed criticism of his tough tactics with: 'You can't catch any fish
if you don't go fishing.'

FT  12 AUG 94 / Tangled mesh of corporate debt ties down Russia's economy:
How powerful enterprises are protecting themselves from the harsh realities
of the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like the sorcerer's apprentice, thousands of Russian enterprises have been
furiously churning out goods they are unable to sell and taking delivery of
goods they cannot pay for.
This absurd practice has built up, by conservative estimates, a Rbs30
thousand billion mountain of inter-enterprise debt which presents so serious
a threat to the Russian economy that an 'emergency commission' established
last week to address the issue has been reporting weekly to the president
and prime minister.
'This problem is a very big and complex issue which it is difficult for a
person from a normal country to understand,' explains Mr Peter Karpov,
deputy director of Russia's federal bankruptcy agency. 'It is a product of
our old system in which goods were traded according to a central plan, and
money was like an amusing but insignificant little musical accompaniment.'
The convoluted web of inter-enterprise debt is now threatening to paralyse
the Russian economy. Workers at the Smolensk nuclear power plant yesterday
continued their two-week-old strike, sparked by the power station's failure
to pay wages for the past four months, which in turn has been caused by the
Russian power grid's failure to pay the Rbs5.5bn it owes the plant.
Thousands of workers in less vital and potentially volatile industries have
also been hit by the payments crisis. But to untangle the massive network of
debt the government will have to take a fundamental, and potentially
painful, decision about Russia's economic future.
The debt issue is the first and most fundamental test of the Russian
government's commitment to economic reforms since this spring, when Mr
Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, impressed western financial
institutions and halted the country's runaway inflation by introducing
tighter fiscal and monetary policies. Gone were the soft credits which
insulated many enterprises from the harsh realities of the market in the
first few years after the collapse of communist central planning.
However, thousands of factory directors have found a way to evade the
government's new austerity. They have continued to operate in their
habitual, inefficient fashion, but have stopped paying their suppliers and
their employees. In turn, their purchasers have stopped paying them.
'As one of the most powerful classes in Russia, the directors have a strong
corporate mentality, and by not paying one another and accumulating huge
debts they are protecting themselves from market reforms,' says Mr Dmitri
Vasiliev, deputy head of the state privatisation agency and a leading market
reformer. 'Their position today is simple: they are going to the government
and, as always, asking for fresh credits to liberate them from the payments
crisis.'
A more nefarious motivation for the accumulation of inter- enterprise debt
is suggested in a document circulating within the Russian government and
obtained by the Financial Times. Based on an investigation of 15 companies,
the report, written by the bankruptcy agency's Mr Karpov, argues that
corruption, in the form of bribes given to factory managers to induce them
to ship goods for which their enterprises are unlikely to ever be paid, is
the principal source of mounting inter-enterprise debt.
The report accuses specific companies, among them the Yaroslavnefteorgsintez
oil refinery in central Russia, which has arrears of Rbs375bn, of receiving
'invisible commissions' from their debtors. In person, Mr Karpov is even
more blunt. 'There's a criminal element involved. Imagine I want to buy some
oil from you on credit. You say fine. Then I lay some cash on the table and
I'm happy and you're happy but the enterprise has an unpaid debt.'
Mr Karpov maintains that about a thousand large enterprises, most of them in
sectors with the ability to export, engage in these sorts of practices and
bear the lion's share of the blame for the debt crisis. When these giants
fail to pay their own suppliers 'the creditors are either too embarrassed to
say anything or too scared. They realise that if they complain too loudly
they could wind up with bullets in their foreheads.'
In his report Mr Karpov concludes that, as the non-payments crisis mounts,
indebted enterprises are trying to portray themselves as 'innocent and noble
producers, victims of the arrears crisis, while the facts and scale of their
immoral business are carefully concealed'.
As reformers in the government concede, these indebted enterprises form a
powerful lobby which is pushing for an old-style solution: lower taxes, easy
credits and perhaps a freeze on some prices. If the government manages to
stand up to the directors and take the option preferred by market reformers
 -to force them into bankruptcy - it would be the clearest sign yet that
Russia is committed to building capitalism.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Discount rate increases to 7.5%: Italian central bank moves
as lira hit by political uncertainties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<TEXT>
The Italian central bank unexpectedly raised its discount rate yesterday in
defence of the lira, which has been hit by political uncertainty.
The half-point increase to 7.5 per cent, the first since September 1992,
will take effect today. The Bank of Italy said the move was intended to
prompt 'a return to expectations coherent with the general economic
conditions', end speculative activity and 'avoid the build-up of
inflationary tensions'.
But the immediate effect of the rate rise appeared to be negative. The lira
weakened against the strong German currency, reaching a new record of L1,016
against the D-Mark in trading after the early-evening announcement.
Evidence of rifts in the coalition government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi,
following a series of political misjudgments, have also unsettled investors
in Italian bonds and equities, in spite of attempts by the prime minister's
supporters to dispel tension.
Yesterday the Christian Democrat Centre, smallest member of the Italian
coalition, added its criticism of Mr Berlusconi to that of the populist
Northern League, headed by Mr Umberto Bossi.
Arriving in Sardinia for a brief break on Wednesday night, Mr Berlusconi
told Italian television he could not take a full vacation because
'unfortunately, as you know, there are many people pulling against the
interests of the country'.
Yesterday Mr Antonio Tajani, the prime minister's spokesman, said on a radio
phone-in programme that 'attacks on the government are first and foremost
attacks on the country. These midsummer controversies within the majority
can't hide today's figures from Istat (the national statistics office)
showing a strong industrial recovery.'
The Istat figures showed that Italian industrial production grew by 5.3 per
cent in June, compared with the same month of 1993, a particularly gloomy
year for Italian companies. In the first six months of the year the
production increase was calculated at 2.6 per cent.
In spite of the production figures, however, the Comit index of Italian
stocks closed at 669.17, down 5.5 per cent over the last week. Analysts
believe shares may suffer further today in the light of the Bank of Italy's
announcement, which came after the market closed.
In the longer term, the rise in interest rates will also increase the cost
of servicing Italy's large public debt, which stands at almost 120 per cent
of GDP. Analysts estimate that each percentage point added to interest rates
increases the annual cost of servicing debt by L15,000bn (Pounds 6.7bn),
although it takes three years for such an increase to work through.
The interest rate rise will be unwelcome news for Italian companies.
Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, yesterday said that corporate Italy
reported an overall loss of L17,000bn in 1993, double the figure for the
previous year. Medium-sized companies were in deficit for the first time in
the last decade.

Western Germany's annual inflation rate in July slipped below 3 per cent for
the first time since April 1991, the federal statistics office said.
Confirming a figure of 2.9 per cent calculated earlier from preliminary
data, the office said the rate was 2.7 per cent if seasonal goods were
excluded. Housing costs were 4.6 per cent higher than a year earlier, while
services were 4 per cent dearer, although the month-on-month rate of
increase had slowed this year. Car running costs were 4 per cent up on the
year, thanks largely to fuel tax rises, while the index of retail prices was
only 1.1 per cent higher. The annual inflation rate in eastern Germany was
unchanged in July at 3.2 per cent, the office added.
French gross domestic product rose by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of
1994, the state statistics institute Insee reported. This compares with an
initial estimate of 0.5 per cent. The increase partly reflects a change in
Insee's methods, but also an unexpectedly strong performance by the service
sector and, to a lesser extent, by manufacturing.
The Danish government has upgraded its growth forecast for this year to 4.4
 per cent from 4 per cent in May. However, it has revised down its 1995
forecast to 3 per cent from 3.4
Spain's registered unemployment fell by a record 85,000 in July,  but 16.5
per cent of the workforce is still idle, labour ministry figures showed.
The jobless rate in the Czech Republic rose 3.2 per cent in July from 3.1
per cent in June. The total number of registered unemployed stood at
160,202.

Tension mounted in the embattled Chechen republic yesterday, when Chechen
President Dzhokhar Dudayev ordered total mobilisation of the region's men to
prevent a possible invasion by Russia. Mr Dudayev's control over the
breakaway region, which appeared on the wane early this month when Moscow
stepped up its political and financial support of Chechen opposition forces,
has appeared to strengthen recently. Local reports claim the threat of an
invasion by Russia, which lost control of the area nearly three years ago,
has rallied the fiercely clannish Chechens to their leader. Mr Dudayev has
warned Russia that it would become entangled in 'a second Afghanistan' and
Moscow itself could fall victim to a 'jihad' launched by the Moslem
Chechens, who are renowned for their military prowess. These threats
appeared not to be lost on Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who yesterday
backed down from recent public sabre-rattling.

A Russian court yesterday acquitted one of the leaders of the failed 1991
coup of treason. The court ruled that General Valentin Varenikov, former
Soviet deputy minister of defence, and his colleagues had been 'guided
exclusively by the state interests of the USSR'. The verdict is an
indication of how starkly public opinion has shifted since August 1991, when
Muscovites took to the streets to oppose the coup. In a further revision of
the general interpretation of the events as they were unfolding in 1991, the
court also ruled that former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was not a
victim of the coup but, at the very least, a tacit supporter. This week's
trial, during which even the prosecution argued for Gen Varenikov's
acquittal, was another step in the public transformation of Russian hardline
politicians from accused traitors to popular heroes.

Mr Michal Kovac, Slovak president, yesterday called a referendum for October
22, three weeks after national elections, to decide whether to require all
Slovak citizens buying state property in the country's privatisation
programme to state the source of their funds. The move was forced on the
government by the parliamentary opposition, who claimed that a similar law
passed by the government earlier this week did not go far enough. The law
already passed, requiring potential buyers to give documentary evidence of
the origins of their funds, was made just ahead of a second round of
sell-offs due to start next month. The referendum is being used as a
political weapon by the former prime minister, Mr Vladimr Mecr, who lost a
confidence vote in March.

The beleaguered Mr Bernard Tapie yesterday won a rare victory against Credit
Lyonnais, his bank which is pressing him over his FFr1.3bn (Pounds 156m)
debts, when a Paris court decided that the left-wing entrepreneur did not
have to repay a FFr300m loan. Credit Lyonnais had claimed that Mr Tapie, a
Euro-MP, had breached the terms of the loan, which the bank made last year
to Olympique-Marseille, his football club. However the court concluded that
there was no reason to force Mr Tapie to redeem the loan given that, under
the terms of the original agreement, repayments are not due until September
this year.

Italy's anti-trust authority yesterday gave the formal go-ahead to Telecom
Italia, the telecommunications operator created from the fusion of five
state-owned companies. But the authority warned the Italian government that
if problems in certain areas of telecoms liberalisation were not dealt with
quickly, 'the competitive development of the markets could be compromised'.
The authority urged Rome to accelerate implementation of the EU's directive
on liberalisation of telecoms data and added-value services, guarantee free
and non-discriminatory access to networks, promote alternative networks, set
up an effective independent regulator, and end potential discrimination in
the maritime communications sector. Trading in Telecom Italia shares - which
replace shares in Sip, the domestic telecoms operator - will begin next
Thursday in Milan.

Germany's federal postal service aims to offer a first tranche of around 25
per cent of its shares on the stock market in 1998, Mr Klaus Zumwinkel,
chairman, said yesterday. In the meantime, it plans to develop new customer
services, which could generate some DM5bn (Pounds 2.06bn) in annual sales
and create up to 30,000 jobs. These include in-house postal deliveries for
corporate customers and electronics-based services. Mr Zumwinkel said the
service was negotiating with several large companies, offering to deliver
mail not only to central post-rooms, but also to individual offices.
Electronic post offices, which receive transmitted messages and print them
out before delivery, also looked promising, he said. This service has been
available in Berlin, Frankfurt, Leipzig and Berlin since last year. In the
mainstream parcel delivery business, officials said the state-owned service
had a 26 per cent share last year of the national parcels market, when it
increased volume 3.6 per cent to 667m deliveries.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Swedish rate rises surprise markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's central bank yesterday announced an unexpected increase in interest
rates, jolting Swedish financial markets, surprising markets elsewhere and
heightening political tensions ahead of next month's general election.
The move, meant to stop signs of resurgent inflation, was the first increase
in official interest rates since the krona was floated during a currency
crisis in November 1992.
It ended a steady downward trend that has helped Sweden emerge from its
deepest recession for 50 years. The Riksbank raised two of its three key
rates. It increased its repurchase rate, the main short-term interest rate,
by 28 basis point to 7.20 per cent and its lending rate by 50 points to 8.00
per cent. It left its deposit rate unchanged at 6.00 per cent.
Swedish markets, already nervous over the threat to economic recovery posed
by the perilous state of public finances and uncertainty surrounding
government policy after the election, reacted with alarm. The Stockholm
stock exchange general index fell by 1.89 per cent, while market interest
rates rose sharply. The yield on five-year government bonds jumped by more
than 50 basis points past 10.90 per cent and the yield on 12-month treasury
bills rose by 80 basis points to 9.60 per cent.
Mr Urban Backstrom, the Riksbank governor, said the increase was needed to
counter a tendency towards higher inflation during the spring and summer as
the krona weakened, the international economy strengthened and Swedish
industry approached capacity ceilings.
The consumer price index showed an annual rise of 2.6 per cent in June, up
from 1.8 per cent in March, threatening the Riksbank's long-term target
ceiling of 3 per cent. 'Inflation must not be allowed to re-emerge,' Mr
Backstrom said. 'This view has broad-based support. The Swedish economy has
paid a considerable price for the inflation of the 1970s and 1980s.' He also
cited 'uncertainty related to the problems surrounding the public finances'.
Economists in Stockholm said the rise appeared to be intended as a strong
signal to political parties to enact tougher policies to deal with the big
budget deficit and fast-growing public debt.
With government debt soon due to exceed 100 per cent of gross national
product, Swedish market interest rates had already pushed up well ahead of
European rates, leading the government to lower its GNP growth forecast for
1995 from 3 per cent to 2 per cent.
The centre-right coalition sought to blame the interest rate reverse on the
imprecise economic policy proposals of the opposition Social Democratic
party, which holds a lead in the opinion polls ahead of the September 18
election. 'The markets have reacted with concern because they do not know
what will happen if the Social Democrats win the election. Therefore
interest rate increases are necessary to show that high inflation will not
be acceptable,' said Mr Bo Lundgren, the minister for taxation.
Mr Goran Persson, Social Democratic shadow finance minister, responded that
the Riksbank measure 'is the final rejection of the incumbent government's
policies'. But he refused to commit the Social Democrats, who have
emphasised tax increases as well as savings to narrow the budget deficit, to
greater cuts in public spending, which now accounts for some 70 per cent of
GNP.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Rail dispute set to worsen as union calls fresh strike: BR
chairman warns of 'dangerous' alternatives if stoppages continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Both sides in the increasingly bitter rail signalling dispute blamed each
other's intransigence last night for the failure to reach a settlement as
the network faced its longest period of disruption since the conflict began
nine weeks ago.
The latest bout of disruption will affect an estimated 5m travellers around
this weekend. Today's stoppage ends at midnight. While the network will run
normally over tomorrow and Sunday, this will be followed by 48 hours of
strikes ending at midnight on Tuesday.
The RMT transport union executive yesterday announced that a further strike
by signal workers was planned from noon on Monday, August 22, to noon on
Tuesday, August 23.
Last night Railtrack, the state-owned infrastructure operator, said it hoped
that up to 37 per cent of the network would be open for services over the 72
hours of the present strike.
The two sides seem determined to persist with a battle of attrition in what
is now one of the longest industrial conflicts since the miners' strike of
1984-1985.
Last night Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, said he was
'bitterly disappointed' at what he described as 'yet another lost
opportunity' to settle the dispute. Railtrack's current offer of a 6 per
cent supplement plus a Pounds 250 lump sum payment was 'as unacceptable
today as it was four weeks ago when it was first made'.
'I hope the public will recognise all the initiatives to try and resolve the
dispute have come from the union. This weekend's disruption could have been
avoided if Railtrack had shown some realism and flexibility.
'Railtrack's stubbornness is losing them their holy grail of restructuring.
Without an agreement on RMT's claim, Railtrack are not going to get
agreement on restructuring.'
In a letter to Mr Knapp, Mr David Armstrong, Railtrack's industrial
relations director, accused the RMT of inflexibility and intransigence. He
said the union's peace proposals were not acceptable and warned that there
were 'only seven weeks' left to complete the restructuring deal for the
signal workers if the RMT was not to make them 'disadvantaged in pension
terms'.
He added: 'I don't need to remind you that September 30 is the last date for
new pay deals to be taken into account under the reshaping of the present
railway-wide pension scheme.'
Mr Armstrong called on the union to have five days of talks to hammer out a
final package for the signal workers.
Sir Bob Reid, chairman of British Rail which operates services, said
yesterday some of his staff could be called in to help operate signal boxes
if the dispute was not settled soon. BR would have 'no alternative but to
look for a different, much more dangerous solution'. He added: 'We have got
to help people to run the boxes. I don't want to see our business
disappear.'
It is estimated that about 100 BR staff are qualified to operate signal
boxes, but so far have not been asked to do so. BR said this was not likely
during the latest strikes. It was up to Railtrack to request help.
With the conflict deepening, Railtrack's options include the introduction of
individual contracts for signalling staff, but this is not being considered
immediately. It prefers to open more of the network while keeping pressure
on the union's members to persuade it to re-enter talks.
The company is concerned the RMT may call strikes over the August bank
holiday. But there is no sign of the union contemplating such action, which
could destroy public support.

FT  12 AUG 94 / Electricity shares jump despite crackdown on profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in the regional electricity companies of England and Wales rose
sharply yesterday as investors welcomed a regulatory review which consumer
organisations and opposition parties dismissed as inadequate.
Prof Stephen Littlechild, director-general of the Office of Electricity
Regulation, said he was cracking down on the companies. He said the price
controls would save families, on average, a total of Pounds 70-Pounds 90
over the next five years.
His prices formula, through which allowed prices in power distribution
businesses will fall next April by 11-17 per cent, were accepted immediately
by three of the 12 regional electricity companies to which they apply.
Although the other nine could still appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, they are expected to follow the lead of Yorkshire Electricity,
East Midlands Electricity and Seeboard inaccepting the regulator's decision.
After next year's price cuts, electricity companies will be required to
restrict annual distribution price rises, which make up more than a quarter
of final bills, to 2 percentage points below inflation.
The stock market was pleased by the review. Share prices in the companies
rose by up to 10 per cent with London Electricity, up 61p to 645p, leading
the way. Southern Electric, up 51p to 714p, was also among the day's strong
gainers. Eastern Electricity rose 30p to 739p, a new high.
The National Consumers' Council, however, said the cuts did not go far
enough and failed to redress the balance between companies and consumers
after recent excessive profits.
Environmental groups were angered by the absence of stronger measures to
encourage energy efficiency. Although Prof Littlechild gave companies new
incentives to save electricity, he decided not to provide new funding for
the Energy Savings Trust, the government-sponsored agency which is supposed
to promote energy efficiency projects.
The lower prices will also blunt the effect of the recent introduction of
value added tax on electricity bills which is supposed to cut consumption.
Greenpeace, the environmental group, said last night that the result would
be higher atmospheric emissions and a greater danger of climate change.
Prof Littlechild said the package would produce savings to consumers
totalling Pounds 2.5bn over five years. Average household bills would be
Pounds 12-Pounds 16 a year lower because of the controls.
He said present prices in the regional companies' distribution businesses
were too high, but added: 'If companies are going to make significant
profits they're going to have to work much harder than at present.'

FT  12 AUG 94 / Rate rises in Sweden and Italy hit European markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, PHILIP GAWITH and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Surprise interest rate rises in Italy and Sweden threw European financial
markets into turmoil yesterday and triggered speculation other continental
central banks might follow suit.
The Bank of Italy raised two short-term rates, with the key discount rate
increasing from 7 per cent to 7.5 per cent. In Sweden, the Riksbank raised
its lending rate to banks from 7.5 per cent to 8 per cent, and the important
money market repurchase rate from 6.92 per cent to 7.2 per cent.
Although the moves by the two central banks were widely seen to be motivated
by domestic concerns, they sent shock waves through European bond markets
because some investors saw them as confirmation that continental interest
rates were on the rise.
The move was also felt in the US currency market where the dollar ended
sharply lower against other leading currencies on similar expectations of
rising European rates.
Markets are also nervous ahead of next week's meeting of the US Federal
Reserve's open market committee, which many expect to lead to higher US
interest rates.
The Bank of Italy also increased its Lombard, or fixed-term advances, rate
from 8 per cent to 8.5 per cent, citing the need to defend the lira from
speculative attack. However, initially the change was counter-productive.
Yesterday evening, the lira was quoted at a record low of L1,016.50 against
the D-Mark, compared with a London close of L1,005 10 minutes before the
rate move was announced.
The Riksbank said its move was designed to counter inflationary pressures.
However, the foreign exchange markets were unimpressed, saying that both
central banks had failed to address the main issue worrying the markets -
the large fiscal deficits of the two countries.
The Swedish krona was quoted in London at SKr4.987 against the D-Mark, off a
low of SKr5 earlier in the day, but well below Wednesday's close of
SKr4.940.
Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Markets,
stressed the detrimental impact of the moves. 'Putting up rates doesn't make
your currency stronger . . . and it will be harder for the governments to
fund,' she said. She cited the case of the Italian national debt, much of
which is financed on a short-term basis. Yesterday's change would add
L3,000bn (Pounds 1.2bn) to the cost of debt service in the first year.
European markets were surprised by the changes although Mr Keith Skeoch,
chief economist at James Capel, said the rate rises were a 'timely reminder
that we are close to the turning point in world interest rates'.
Mr Sanjay Joshi of Daiwa Europe said markets reacted badly over 'the fear
that some of the smaller central banks will be forced to follow suit'.
Bond prices, which tend to move in the opposite direction to interest rates,
fell sharply. In Italy, 10-year government bonds lost 2.6 points, pushing
the yield to 11.26 per cent from 10.77 per cent on Wednesday. The yield on
Swedish nine-year bonds rose by just over half a percentage point to 11.28
per cent.
In the UK, the price of 10-year gilts fell 1 1/2 points, pushing the yield
to 8.67 per cent from 8.42 per cent, while in Germany, the yield on 10-year
bunds rose to 7.20 per cent from 7 per cent.

FT  12 AUG 94 / C&amp;G unveils new payout plan to smooth takeover by Lloyds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new scheme put forward yesterday by Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building
Society for sharing out the Pounds 1.8bn cash bid from Lloyds Bank would
increase payments to members to up to Pounds 13,500 for each qualifying
account.
If the revised arrangements - which exclude from payments investors who
opened accounts after 1992 and all borrowers - enable C&amp;G to secure the
approval of its members, completion of the deal could sharpen the interest
of other financial organisations in acquiring a building society.
The original announcement in April sparked renewed speculation that banks
and others would court societies for agreed takeovers, since it appeared to
overcome some of the difficulties previously associated with such bids.
But a High Court ruling in June, which restricted cash payments, showed that
some of the hurdles to obtaining the necessary high levels of support from
society members for such a deal remained in place. The need to revise the
payment scheme has delayed the original timetable by about three months. The
meeting at which members will vote is now planned for March 1995, and
completion is intended to take place next summer.
Under the new arrangements, borrowers will not receive the Pounds 500 cash
included in the earlier scheme. Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G chief executive,
said he was sure they would bear in mind the rationale for the Lloyds/C&amp;G
deal, which was to be able to reduce costs and so offer more competitive
rates.
While investors who joined the society after the end of 1992 will not
qualify for payments, those who do qualify will benefit more.
For example, flat rate payments of Pounds 500 will be on the basis of each
account, rather than each member; and those who receive percentages of their
balances up to a maximum of Pounds 100,000 will receive about 13 per cent
instead of the 10 per cent or so the first scheme would have provided.
C&amp;G said the average total payment to an individual would be about Pounds
2,000.
Mr Longhurst said he was confident the necessary approvals from members
would be achieved. He refused to say, however, how many of the society's
members would be able to vote on the Lloyds' bid but would not be eligible
for cash. This could be important because of the high proportions of members
who must actively back acceptance of the offer.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at stockbrokers UBS, estimated that
the proportion of investors able to vote but not eligible for cash was less
than 10 per cent - not enough to stop the deal on their own even if they all
voted against it.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Cubans face questioning in US over hijacking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AP
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KEY WEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty-four Cubans accused of hijacking a Cuban government boat were brought
to a Florida resort city by the US Coast Guard yesterday to face questioning
about its voyage, AP reports from Key West.
The group, which included young men wearing shorts and at least two small
children, walked off the Coast Guard cutter early in the afternoon having
been detained at sea since they were picked up on Tuesday afternoon.
The Cuban government claimed a naval lieutenant was killed in the boat
hijacking on Monday night. But a US Coast Guard official said the refugees
insisted no-one was killed and that the purported victim was among those who
arrived in Key West.
Doubt was cast on the initial Cuban government claim that a death was caused
by the boat hijacking when Mr Alfonso Fraga, head of the Cuban diplomatic
mission in Washington, declined to repeat it yesterday at a news conference.
Asked repeatedly about the incident, Mr Fraga said he had received no
instructions about it from Havana.
The boat hijacking on Monday was the fourth in three weeks, Cuban officials
said.
The growing tide of Cubans fleeing the island continued, meanwhile, when a
single-engine Cuban utility aircraft carrying 14 members of the same family
landed safely in a thunderstorm at Marathon, about 75 miles north of Key
West in the Florida Keys. A sheriff's spokeswoman said the pilot had worked
for a Cuban crop-dusting company and stole the aircraft from his employers.
All of the Cubans were to be turned over to the US Immigration and
Naturalisation Service.
US officials have not prosecuted any Cubans on hijack-related charges since
1980, when three Cubans who seized a fishing vessel at knifepoint were
acquitted of kidnapping.
Cubans who have forcibly overpowered crews of boats or aircraft - usually
government-owned - are routinely released in south Florida.
Some Cuban exile leaders are speculating that the US government may be
cracking down on hijackers because of President Fidel Castro's recent threat
to allow unlimited emigration from Cuba to the US, as he did for some
120,000 people in 1980.

FT  11 AUG 94 / India's Schweik fights the rich and strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Govind Rago Khairnar, 52, son of a poor peasant, who rose to become deputy
municipal commissioner in the Bombay Municipal Corporation which administers
India's richest city, is a national hero.
In a country where corruption is rampant, almost accepted as part of the
political system, this gaunt bureaucrat has started a crusade against one of
India's most powerful politicians, Mr Sharad Pawar, chief minister of
Maharashtra, where Bombay is located.
While he has produced no evidence, Mr Khairnar accuses Mr Pawar of
corruption and of having links with underworld dons. Mr Pawar has big
business interests in Maharashtra, and is one of the country's richest sugar
farmers. He is also one of the country's strongest contenders for prime
minister.
Mr Khairnar, who belongs to one of India's lowest castes, has become a
veritable Good Soldier Schweik, a little man fighting officialdom and power,
with all the odds against him.
As the chief officer of the Bombay Municipal Corporation squad charged with
demolishing illegal buildings in the city, Mr Khairnar's course inevitably
collided with the underworld dons, film stars, and powerful
businessmen-politicians who all contribute to make Bombay the rich, ruthless
and powerful commercial capital that it is.
It is not the first time someone has sought to establish a nexus between the
underworld, Bombay's tinsel world and politicians. But no bureaucrat has
gone as far as Mr Khairnar, openly attacking someone as powerful as the
chief minister. The common man identifies completely with him.
Mr Khairnar is not everybody's saint. Many powerful bureaucrats have felt
that he has gone too far, especially when he has no proof to back his
allegations. 'My only job is to shout at the top of my voice, whatever I
have experienced,' he says, adding that it was 'not his intention to collect
proof against any individual'.
Mr Khairnar may not have been able to substantiate his charges against Mr
Pawar, but whether they are true or not, they have stuck. The chief minister
was exercised enough to meet the prime minister to discuss the matter with
him. Opposition parties and the anti-Pawar lobby in the Congress(I) party
that have tried to use Mr Khairnar to fling dirt at their opponents have not
succeeded. He has no political links, hardly any money, and is not afraid if
his life is in danger.
After his suspension from service in July, Mr Khairnar spends much of his
time addressing public gatherings, responding to invitations to travel to
cities towns and villages all over India, addressing frenzied crowds of
supporters .
At his meetings, men break the security cordon (the government has given him
an armed escort and top-level security) just to be able to touch him. Women
want him to bless their babies. India's most prominent social reformers have
joined him in his crusade. His snowballing anti-corruption campaign is
developing into a national phenomenon, even if nothing tangible has come of
it yet.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Filipinos wrestle with message of birth control: The church
is countering a government campaign with demonstrations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Juan Flavier, the Philippines' health secretary, has long been worried by
runaway population growth in the Philippines, where four-fifths of the
inhabitants are Roman Catholics forbidden by doctrine to use artificial
methods of birth control.
His campaign is to be challenged on Sunday with a big demonstration, called
by Cardinal Jaime Sin, Archbishop of Manila, to express opposition to
artificial contraception and abortion. The Cardinal's supporters say that 1m
people are expected to take part and that the protesters will burn condoms
and literature promoting safe sex.
Dr Flavier has said people are welcome to listen to what the church has to
say at the demonstration.
But he believes that unrestricted population growth damages the health and
wealth of parents and their numerous children (an estimated 60,000 mothers
and babies die each year from problems encountered during pregnancy and
childbirth) and depletes the country's already stretched natural resources.
The Philippines' population of 66m is growing by about 2.5 per cent a year,
one of the highest rates in Asia. Families with eight or more children are
not uncommon.
Palawan, one of the few islands in the archipelago where the forest has not
been destroyed, is being invaded by thousands of migrants from other islands
searching for farmland.
'Our mountains are denuded, devastated,' Dr Flavier said in an interview.
'We have erosion. Our rivers are getting polluted, our seas are getting
polluted and now our watersheds are being damaged.'
Far from being downcast by this gloomy picture, the extrovert Dr Flavier has
energetically used every level of the media to put his health messages
across - whether they concern birth control, Aids, immunisation or cancer.
He plays the buffoon in lowbrow situation comedies on television, is
interviewed on serious radio talk shows, and has a column in one of Manila's
leading newspapers.
He has often been compared with his friend, Mr Meechai Viravaidya, a former
Thai government minister credited with helping to curb Thailand's population
growth and the spread of Aids by publicising contraceptives and making them
socially acceptable.
His media antics and his family planning propaganda have sometimes enraged
conservative Roman Catholics - including the powerful Opus Dei faction - and
been criticised by his colleagues for threatening the dignity of the
administration.
'The other government officials sort of frown on it,' Dr Flavier said. 'But
my answer is: 'The hell with it, it's effective.''
Commenting on his television comedy appearances, he adds: 'People find it
funny and so human that now they identify with our health programmes.'
Dr Flavier is popular with the local press and with Filipinos in general,
partly because they love show business and partly because he has no
background in the corrupt world of what Filipinos call 'traditional
politics'.
For 31 years - until he was appointed by Mr Fidel Ramos two years ago - he
worked as a doctor and promoted rural development programmes.
His work in the countryside, where two-thirds of the people live, convinced
him that most Filipinos - including, discreetly, many Roman Catholic priests
 -supported artificial methods of birth control, a view endorsed by recent
opinion surveys.
Dr Flavier also discovered how to teach family planning to farmers with what
he calls an 'agricultural analogy approach'. The spacing of children is
likened to the spacing of rice plants that allows each plant to prosper.
Acronyms and slogans are popular in the Philippines and Dr Flavier is adept
at using them. The best-known is probably the ABC of safe sex. A is for
Abstinence; if that does not work, then B is for Be faithful; if fidelity
fails as well, then C is for Condom.
With little government money at his disposal, Dr Flavier has turned without
hesitation to big businesses to finance some of his projects. Soap companies
sponsor hygiene campaigns, and Dr Flavier himself has appeared in a fast
food chain's television advertisement that managed to publicise immunisation
and hamburgers at the same time.
But only the bravest of corporations would risk the wrath of the church in
the Philippines by advertising contraceptives, and much of this family
planning work is funded by foreign donors.
The church has been quiet on the topic of contraception in recent months,
but Dr Flavier and his allies know that next month's United Nations
population conference in Cairo and the Pope's visit to the Philippines next
January will be used as a rallying point by anti-birth control activists.
During the last years of the previous administration of Corazon Aquino, a
devout Roman Catholic, family planning in the Philippines suffered a
setback. Dr Flavier says that 70 per cent of married women of reproductive
age either want no more children or want to wait a couple of years before
the next child, but only 40 per cent have access to contraceptives.
Mr Ramos is from the Protestant minority, and Dr Flavier goes to church with
his Protestant wife, but he says he does not want to make it a religious
issue. He advertises natural as well as artificial methods of birth control
and allows people make their own choice.
'I've won the media battle,' he says. 'I will go and work in the field now,
and shy away from controversy in the upper crust of society because it's
very divisive. At the top we're getting this flak, but below I'm not. Down
there in the countryside I have no problem with priests; I have no problem
with nuns.'

FT  11 AUG 94 / Diplomat tells of Saudi dissidents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mohammed Khilewi, a senior Saudi diplomat trying to defect to the US,
said this week he is part of a underground organisation of more than 75
dissidents working toward democracy in Saudi Arabia.
'We have one ministerial official and more than five ambassadors, all
well-educated people working with us,' the former second-in-command of Saudi
Arabia's diplomatic mission to the United Nations said in a telephone
interview.
Mr Khilewi said the underground group wanted to topple the Saudi regime,
which he has accused of being financially corrupt and guilty of countless
human rights violations.
'Human rights is a small goal compared with the democracy,' he said. 'We are
seeking to have a democracy and a civilised society.'
In addition to human rights abuses, Mr Khilewi, who filed for political
asylum in June, alleges his country gives financial backing to international
terrorists - including the radical Moslem group Hamas, which opposes
Arab-Israeli peace - and ordered its diplomatic missions to spy on US Jewish
groups.
He also said the Saudi government was attempting to acquire nuclear weapons.
Mr Khilewi further alleges Saudi officials in the US secretly diverted
government funds to their own pockets. He says he has 14,000 documents -
some of them classified - in his possession that prove his claims, but few
have been released to the media. In a meeting on Capitol Hill two weeks ago,
Mr Khilewi briefed an unnamed member of the House of Representatives on the
charges he has levelled against the Saudi government.
'Members of Congress have approached us to meet with them in an effort to
expose the blatant human rights violations that are occurring in Saudi
Arabia,' Mr Michael Wildes, Mr Khilewi's attorney, said. 'We have been asked
to testify before Congress and Mr Khilewi has been asked formally by a
member of the House of Representatives to come forward and collaborate all
the information that has been provided thus far.'
Mr Khilewi, who has been in hiding since June, is worried he will be refused
asylum because the US does not want to damage its close ties to the Saudis,
Mr Wildes said.
Mr Wildes said he was contacted on July 22 by special agents from the the
Federal Bureau of Investigations who said there was an 'imminent' threat to
kidnap Mr Khilewi and take him back to Saudi Arabia reported by a 'credible'
FBI source. But the FBI has not offered Mr Khilewi protection, Mr Wildes
said.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Both sides in Bosnia threatened with UN air strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The United Nations threatened yesterday to call in air strikes on both Serb
and Bosnian positions for exchanging artillery fire within the weapons
exclusion zone around Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital.
Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, accused both
sides of 'serious breaches' and estimated that 400 artillery shells and
mortar rounds had landed within and just outside the exclusion zone which
surrounds the city.
UN officials say that Moslem-led government forces fire into the
12-mile-wide zone from the north, while Serb gunners return fire from within
the zone, aiming at Bosnian-held Visoko and other targets.
This is the first time that the Bosnian government has been warned since the
zone was first established last spring and is a reminder that both sides are
expected to honour it.
However, Bosnian forces have become more assertive since Belgrade cut ties
with the Bosnian Serbs last week following the latter's refusal to accept a
western-brokered peace plan.
The Bosnian Serbs have faced increasing military pressure from Moslems, who
appear to be gaining ground.
The battle focused on the main highway linking Sarajevo, which is again
under siege, and the central town of Olovo. For Sarajevo, the road is an
important supply link especially during the hard - and approaching - Balkan
winter.
Confirming an improvement in morale and organisation, the Bosnian army
yesterday cornered the breakaway Moslem enclave of Bihac. Troops advanced
further into the northwestern zone as several thousand refugees continued to
flee into Croatia.
Mr Fikret Abdic, Bihac's leader, rejected Bosnian amnesty offers. His chief
military commander was killed by a tank shell yesterday as Bosnian troops
built on gains made on Tuesday, when it captured two towns on the Croatian
border.
Mr Abdic, a former Bosnian president, broke with Mr Alija Izetbegovich, the
current president, last year by urging peace with Serbs and Croats. Their
split exposed the deep fissures within the Bosnian Moslem community.
The Bosnian Serb media also reported an offensive on Brcko in northern
Bosnia at a narrow point of an east-west supply corridor controlled by the
Serbs.
A frequently violated ceasefire expired yesterday and the UN said it would
not attempt to negotiate a new one.
Sniper fire and shelling on Tuesday killed three civilians in Sarajevo but
the UN has resumed the halted food airlift into the Bosnian capital.
Snuffing out a separatist movement will only strengthen the Bosnian hand.
The army apparently cornered Mr Abdic, the Bosnian president's main rival,
in Velika Kladusa and met little resistance.
The refugee flight has raised fears that Serbs in the potentially volatile
Serb-held Krajina region of Croatia, who had supported Mr Abdic after his
break with Sarajevo, could step in to oppose the Bosnian army.
Mr Abdic vowed to fight on in Bihac. 'I will stay with my people to fight
for autonomy,' he said. 'We cannot be defeated. We are unbeatable.'

FT  11 AUG 94 / Russian GNP 'to fall by 10%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A decline in industrial production of between 35 and 38 per cent in 1994 was
predicted in a report issued this week by the Russian Central Bank. However,
because industry accounts for a decreasing portion of the Russian economy,
the bank predicted that GNP will decline by only 10 per cent. In the report,
which has become the central bank's annual public declaration of its goals,
bank officials said that their target is to bring inflation down to 8 per
cent a month by the end of the year.
Earlier this year the Russian Central Bank, whose chairman was once
described as 'the worst central banker in the world' because of his
enthusiastic extension of soft credits to Russian industry and agriculture,
considerably tightened its monetary policy. This change in policy has had
moderate success in reining in runaway inflation, but the Russian economy
now faces a new inflationary threat. Unable to easily obtain credits from
the government, Russian enterprises have extended loans to one another,
creating a growing mountain of debt which threatens to paralyse the
country's financial system.
In this week's report the central bank suggests that commercial banks be
asked to participate in the increasingly urgent efforts of the Russian
government to find a solution to the issue of inter-enterprise debt.

FT  11 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Pinault's plan to take over
Fnac hits snag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Francois Pinault, the French entrepreneur, yesterday hit a snag in his
plans to take control of Fnac, the retailing group, when Compagnie Generale
des Eaux, one of the existing shareholders, delayed a decision on exercising
its pre-emptive rights over the shares.
Artemis, the company that controls Mr Pinault's family interests, last month
struck a deal with Altus Finance, a subsidiary of the troubled Credit
Lyonnais banking group, to buy the latter's 64.6 per cent shareholding in
Fnac for just under FFr2bn (Dollars 370m)
However, Generale des Eaux, the utility and media group that last year
joined forces with Altus to acquire Fnac from the ailing GMF insurance
company, has pre-emptive rights over the holding. Under the terms of the
deal, Generale des Eaux has a month to decide whether to exercise those
rights.
Generale des Eaux yesterday said Altus had agreed that it could postpone its
decision for another week.
Generale des Eaux, which was originally expected not to exercise its
pre-emptive rights, refused to comment on whether it was now considering
doing so.
Mr Pinault, who has in recent years emerged as one of France's most
aggressive businessmen by building up the powerful Pinault-Printemps
retailing empire, must also secure the French finance ministry's agreement
to complete his attempted takeover of Fnac, which dominates the French music
and books market.

FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Greyhound chief resigns as
losses mount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chief executive of Greyhound Lines, the struggling US long-distance bus
operator, has resigned in the face of the company's continuing losses and
plunging share price.
Mr Frank Schmieder, 53, who led the company out of bankruptcy protection in
1992, stepped down late on Tuesday. He has been temporarily replaced by Mr
Thomas Plaskett, previously a non-executive member of the company's board,
pending the appointment of a successor.
Greyhound is the only nationwide provider of inter-city bus services in the
US, but fares and passenger numbers have been driven down by increasing
competition from low-cost airlines.
In the quarter to June it made net losses of Dollars 45.4m, its third
successive quarter of losses.
Last month Mr Schmieder unveiled a five-point plan aimed at turning the
company around. Its main feature was a move to axe long-distance routes and
concentrate on more intensive short-haul services where it could more easily
compete with the airlines.
The strategy, however, had failed to placate restive shareholders such as
Connor, Clark, a Toronto-based investment firm that holds 18 per cent of
Greyhound's stock. Connor, Clark had reportedly been seeking three seats on
Greyhound's board and the replacement of Mr Schmieder.
Greyhound said the strategy put in place by Mr Schmieder, which also
involves sweeping lay-offs and the disposal of surplus assets, had been
reaffirmed by the board.
The shares fell Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 5 3/4.

reshuffle

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWA, the seventh biggest US carrier, yesterday signalled the launch of an
attempt to stave off a looming financial crisis and restore the struggling
airline to profitability.
Announcing the latest in a series of management changes, it said the new
management team had 120 days to achieve three business goals: to produce a
new business plan, secure new labour agreements with its unions, and to
negotiate a restructuring of its debts.
TWA emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November last year but
has not made a profit since. All its credit facilities are drawn, virtually
all its assets are pledged, and it has insufficient cash to repay Dollars
190m worth of debt falling due for repayment in January.
Last week it announced that it was shedding 500 jobs immediately and up to
2,500 more within 30 days. It also announced the closure of its operations
in Geneva and Zurich, Switzerland, and the suspension of polar flights
between Los Angeles and Paris for the winter.
Yesterday it said it had promoted Mr Jeffrey Erickson from chief operating
officer to chief executive. Mr Donald Craib, previously chairman and chief
executive, remains chairman. Mr Robert Peiser, a former TWA manager now
working for a consultancy, returns to the vacant post of chief financial
officer.
Mr Erickson said the business plan inherited from TWA's Chapter 11
reorganisation was 'not realistic' and another would be finished within two
weeks. The company was also involved in discussions with union leaders over
new labour agreements.
United Airlines of the US and National Airlines of Chile said they had
signed a marketing agreement including code-sharing arrangements and joint
frequent-flier benefits, initially applying to flights in and out of the
Chilean cities of Arica and Antofagasta.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Pay-off to Manweb chairman under fire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The potential Pounds 1m retirement package that Mr Bryan Weston, the
non-executive chairman of electricity company Manweb, will receive later
this month came in for heavy criticism yesterday.
Mr Weston, who was executive chairman from 1985 to 1992 but now has a
two-day week, has compiled the package of share options in the four years
since the Chester-based company, which provides electricity to Merseyside,
Cheshire and north Wales, was privatised.
But Mr Frank Dobson, the Labour party's campaigns co-ordinator, attacked the
size of the pay-off, saying: 'This is just another round in the
privatisation rip-off.'
Mr Weston holds 121,878 ordinary shares in the company, which at one stage
yesterday were trading at Pounds 7.24 each, making them worth Pounds
882,396.
He also has an option under an executive share scheme for directors to buy
47,945 shares at Pounds 3.65 each.
Under a savings scheme Mr Weston also has the option to buy another 3,128
shares at Pounds 1.75 each.
The disclosure is the latest in a series of revelations of high rewards for
executives in the privatised electricity companies.
The Consumers' Association said schemes which rewarded executives of
utilities companies with shares did not benefit customers.
Manweb said yesterday: 'Share options are an accepted part of the
remuneration package . . . they provide an incentive to ensure that the
share price and the company perform well.'

FT  11 AUG 94 / Elderly give approval to health reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Endorsements and rejections flew thick and fast yesterday, as the US Senate
entered its second day of what was still mostly civilised debate on
healthcare reform.
Supporters of the bills proposed by the Democratic leaders in both chambers
of Congress were grateful for the strong backing of the American Association
of Retired People, representing 33m people.
The AARP, though long sympathetic to the Clinton administration's broad
approach, had not endorsed any bill. It warned: 'If either bill is defeated,
healthcare reform will be dead for years.'
The version sponsored by Senator George Mitchell, the Senate majority
leader, also secured the qualified approval of the Congressional Budget
Office. It found that the Mitchell bill would 'slightly reduce the federal
budget deficit', but expanded insurance coverage would 'add to national
health care expenditures' in the aggregate.
The CBO calculated that Mr Mitchell's proposed subsidies to the poor and
small businesses would cost Dollars 420bn (Pounds 272bn) by 2000 and Dollars
1,100bn by 2004, but that this could be more than offset by higher taxes on
such as cigarettes and by savings on the Medicaid programme for the
indigent.
It thought his goal of 95 per cent insurance coverage could be achieved
earlier than its target date of 2000, but it raised doubts about his
subsidies. It said these would be vulnerable in the event of an increase in
the budget deficit.
On the other side, big and small businesses lined up to fight the Mitchell
bill. But attempts on the Senate floor to delay debate, instigated by
Senator Jesse Helms, the right-wing Republican from North Carolina, were
voted down.
For much of yesterday, senators tried to maintain the tone of debate
established on Monday night by the two principal protagonists, Senator
Mitchell and Senator Robert Dole, the Republican minority leader.
his political toughness. He has, after all, threatened to keep the Senate
sit ting throughout the summer, if necessary, to complete action on his
bill.
Mr Mitchell kept insisting that his proposals were there to be improved
upon. Healthcare reform was 'a matter of simple justice', its purpose 'the
wellbeing of American families', the approach of his bill essentially
'voluntary', with 'nothing political' in it.
Mr Dole repeated three times the Republican mantra: 'America has the best
healthcare system in the world'. But he, too, offered conciliation of a
kind: 'We believe there is a lot in our bill, a lot in Senator Mitchell's
bill, a lot in other bills. We could go in a back room and in two or three
days get a bill that could pass 99 to one.'

Ford Motor Company is considering reinvesting in South Africa, six years
after it severed ties with its South African holdings, in a move which
reflects international companies' increased confidence in the country's
government, Bronwen Maddox reports from New York.
Ford officials have been in talks with Anglo American Corporation and Anglo
American Industrial Corporation, the industrial conglomerates, about taking
a stake in Samcor, which assembles Ford, Mazda and Mitsubishi vehicles in
South Africa. Ford, which created a South African subsidiary in 1933, merged
those businesses with those of Anglo American and AMIC in 1984, forming
Samcor. In 1988 Ford divested its holding in Samcor, mainly to the
business's employees.
General Motors said last night it had no plans to follow suit. In 1986 it
sold its South African businesses to local management.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Economic Watch: Domestic economic confidence improves
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
French household confidence about the outlook for the economy continued to
improve, the national statistics institute said. 'Continuing the trend seen
since the beginning of the year, the (seasonally-adjusted) opinion of
households on the general economic situation and on their personal situation
improved in July.' However, its July monthly survey showed expectations
about future living standards remained unchanged and that more people than
in June expected unemployment to rise.

FT  11 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Hoogovens leads Dutch blue
chip gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street gains, warmer bond markets, and corporate news gave bourses a
lift yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
AMSTERDAM featured some impressive rises among the blue chip stocks, none
more so than a 4.6 per cent advance in Hoogovens after the metals group
pleased investors with first-half results at the top end of analysts'
expectations. The market was also encouraged by the company's forecast that
second-half results would see a considerable improvement from the first six
months.
The AEX index added 0.79 at 417.62.
Other strong gains came from DSM, up 2.5 per cent at Fl 144.10 and Elsevier,
ahead 2.3 per cent at Fl 174.00.
Heineken, off Fl 3.30 at Fl 232.50, announced after the close of trading
that it was to lift its stake in Spanish brewer El Aguila to 64 per cent
from 51.2 per cent.
FRANKFURT reflected a volatile bond market, said Mr John Blackley at James
Capel, running twice through the cycle of weakness followed by recovery
during the official equity session, and the post-bourse.
The Dax index closed the session 3.83 down at 2,160.37 after a day's low of
2,153.70, and eventually recovered to 2,166.51 after hours, 5.59 higher than
it was at the end of Tuesday afternoon.
Turnover stayed low at DM5.5bn after DM5.4bn, and in these illiquid
conditions a number of shares reversed sharp movements which they had seen a
day earlier.
Degussa, for example, saw profit-taking after earlier gains on a good
half-year result, and the chemicals to gold refining group's shares dropped
DM11 to DM502.50 after a DM6.50 rise on Tuesday.
Siemens followers, meanwhile, decided that Tuesday's resumption of a Hanau
plutonimum plant project, following a favourable court decision, was good
for the shares, which rose DM8 to DM688.50 by the post-bourse close after
Tuesday's session fall of DM9.10.
PARIS suffered an interruption in trading as lightning hit the bourse's
computer system, but the system came back on stream before the end of the
session, leaving the CAC-40 index down 10.31 at 2,064.17.
Turnover remained weak at FFr2.7bn.
A raft of first-half sales figures did nothing to excite interest,
especially as most of the data had been well flagged in advance. LVMH was
among those companies providing figures, the shares slipping FFr3 to FFr865
as it announced a near 20 per cent rise in year-on-year sales.
ZURICH stayed interested in bank shares, but the market benefited as UBS
regained its equilibrium after its falls on its own poor results and
Tuesday's bond market weakness. UBS, the most active stock, ended SFr3
higher at SFr1,112 after an early low of SFr1,095, and the SMI index closed
5.9 firmer at 2,591.4.
Ciba registered rose SFr4 to SFr815 following its acquisition of the
ophthalmic pharmaceutical product line of Johnson &amp; Johnson. Swissair added
SFr21 at SFr851, taking its cumulative gain to SFr101 in August so far.
Dealers said Swissair rose on a short-term buy recommendation by a British
broker, following UBS's recent upgrade to 'buy' from 'hold'. They saw US
investors, which recently had shown interest in the shares in European
carriers, as buyers.
MILAN lost 2 per cent in the Comit index as sell programs took their toll of
blue chips. The index dipped 14.81 to 674.52, with turnover reported as low.
Traders noted that if the index fell below the 670 support mark, the next
level of resistance would be 620-640.
Olivetti was among the stocks being sold, with the shares down L50 at
L2,175, while Fiat slipped L65 to L6,575 and Pirelli L20 to L2,710.
COPENHAGEN receded 1.1 per cent after the market was disappointed by weaker
than expected six-month results from Novo Nordisk, the drugs and
biotechnology group. Novo reported profits of DKr550m, against market
expectations of above DKr600m, as the share price fell DKr50, or 7.5 per
cent, to DKr616.
The KFX index finished 1.13 down at 103.41.
ISTANBUL rallied 5 per cent as domestic investors supported the market and
foreigners continued to make selective purchases. The composite index
advanced 1,249.68 to 23,954.57.
Mr Stuart Harley of Schroders in London commented that the market's momentum
had been building up following better than expected first-half results, a
stable dollar and lower interest rates. Second-line stocks had been pushing
the market forward, rather than blue chips, he added.
TEL AVIV gained 1.6 per cent as the strong market sentiment from the
political peace process continued. The Mishtanim index closed 3.13 up at
197.32. Analysts expected the market to stabilise before it challenged the
230 level at the end of the year.

FT  11 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Standard weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The worst individual performance in the FT-SE 100 came from Standard
Chartered, the banking group, whose shares fell almost 6 per cent in spite
of top of the range half-year profits. The market was concerned about
pressures on margins in the group's Hong Kong business, a factor which also
took its toll of HSBC shares. The latter is scheduled to report interims on
Monday.
One dealer said Standard's underlying figures were 'OK but unspectacular;
the lack of good news at the analysts' meeting put more pressure on the
shares'. At the close Standard shares were 16 down at 259p, having touched a
day's low of 255p. Turnover of 9.4m shares was the highest single day's
business since mid-June. HSBC Holdings fell 16 1/2 to 778p on volume of
5.8m.
Lloyds Bank rose 6 to 555p ahead of a press conference called for this
morning at which Lloyds will give details of its revised offer for the
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society.
Turnover in British Steel rose to 16m, making it the day's most active
stock, and the shares firmed 2 1/2 to 164 1/2 p as sentiment was boosted by
favourable results from Dutch steel group Hoogovens.
Engineering concern GKN advanced 6 to 657p in trade of 3.2m as brokers
upgraded full-year profits expectations after it reported interim figures
ahead of the best market forecasts.
Profits jumped 62 per cent to Pounds 97m, with analysts impressed by the
rise given the small increase in sales and improvement in margins in the
automotive division.
The list of brokers upgrading included Mr Robert Speed at Henderson
Crosthwaite, a long time bull of the stock. He raised his full-year forecast
by Pounds 22m to Pounds 190m, while NatWest Securities lifted its estimate
by Pounds 28m to Pounds 205m.
A Smith New Court recommendation continued to support Rolls-Royce, which
closed 5 ahead at 201p.
Profit-taking in Transport Development Group left the shares 8 adrift at
227p, after the company reported improved first-half figures.
Marketing services group WPP declined 3 1/2 to 119 1/2 p on profit-taking
following figures at the high end of expectations. The market is awaiting an
injection of 190m shares into the market as the banks which bailed out the
group two years ago unwind the rest of their debt-for-equity swap.
Positive comment on Courtaulds' fibre operations and talk of a
recommendation by Robert Fleming Securities saw the shares add 10 at 548p.
The soap detergent war between household products groups Procter &amp; Gamble
and Unilever hit Hickson International as it announced first-half figures.
Hickson makes Accelerator, the bleach ingredient at the centre of the
washing powder wrangle. The shares retreated 9 to 168p.
International conglomerate Hanson added 3 1/4 at 266 3/4 p following a
detailed analysis of the group in conjnunction with BTR, Williams Holdings
and Tomkins from Credit Lyonnais Laing. The research looks at prospects for
the groups in the US and highlights Hanson as offering the best value. BTR
and Williams were flat at 387p and 370p respectively. Tomkins gained 1 1/2
at 236p.
The recent strong showing by Bass prompted a couple of switch
recommendations, with Whitbread being the chief beneficiary. Hoare Govett
and James Capel were said to be recommending the move to clients. Bass
declined 7 to 563p on 1.3m shares traded, while Whitbread managed a rise of
11 to 543p on turnover of 2.1m. Scottish &amp; Newcastle suffered from similar
moves, the shares dipping 4 to 523p.
The hot weather showed through to soft drink sales at JN Nicols (Vimto) and
the shares gained 3 at 233p. Interim profits increased from Pounds 3.40m to
Pounds 3.76m. Other statistics, Page 29

FT  11 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs mixed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The regional electricity (recs) stocks came under substantial selling
pressure in midsession but began to pick up during the late afternoon as
rumours concerning the distribution review, due to be announced this
morning, circulated in the market.
Shares in the recs rocketed last week as the market picked up hints that the
review would be much more lenient to the companies than had previously been
expected.
Dealers said the late surge saw stock being taken aggressively from the
inter-dealer broker screens, but they warned that much of the expected good
news, as far as the market was concerned, was already in prices of the recs.
They did, however, expect a burst of switching activity among the 12 recs
after the review news is made public.
Utilities specialists said the market had already factored in an average
price reduction of 15 per cent plus a price formula giving the companies
price rises of inflation minus 3 to 4 per cent. 'The review will have to
produce something exceptional to trigger any further big gains in the short
term,' said one specialist.
However, there were suggestions late yesterday that the price formula could
come in as low as inflation minus 2 per cent. If so, analysts predicted a
further series of strong rises in the sector.
Eastern Electricity was an exception to the general rule, making good
progress throughout the day to close 5 higher at 709p after strong buying
interest from the US.

FT  11 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo in demand from US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heavy US buying of Glaxo ensured that the pharmaceuticals group was the
market's star performer yesterday. The buying reflected technical
position-taking rather than an investment response to a new version of
Zantac, its headline anti-ulcer treatment.
The shares saw continuing support from a more positive stance taken by
Goldman Sachs at the end of last week. Also, there was a rush of what one
dealer described as 'panic covering' by US hedge funds. The leveraged
investment funds had sold stock on concern over slowing sales growth for
Zantac, which represents about 44 per cent of group profits.
Apparently the short position in the US had reached 15m Glaxo American
Depositary Receipts, the equivalent of 30m shares. The feeling that the
stock had run down too far saw the bears scurrying for cover. The squeeze
sent the shares racing up 20 at one stage before closing a net 17 higher at
629p on turnover of 6.4m. One international arbitrage dealer said: 'I think
the panickers have panicked enough and Glaxo could consolidate at this chart
level.'
The buying of the shares reignited the bid speculation that now hovers over
Wellcome and Zeneca, which firmed 2 to 678p and 5 1/2 to 823p respectively.

FT  11 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures recovered in late trading to finish on a firm note after
following bonds lower amid uncertainty over the outlook for US interest
rates, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 was
struck at 3,175 but was quickly followed by active selling as dealers
followed the movements in the bond markets.
The contract fell to a day's low of 3,155 in the late morning before
steadying over the lunchtime period as a recovery began in other markets.
In the second half of the session, a firm opening on Wall Street and a
strengthening US dollar which was reacting to comments by Mr Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve, attracted buyers back to September and it
continued to claw back some of the earlier loss. It ended at 3,174,
unchanged on the day but at an 8-point premium to cash. Turnover reached
9,384 lots.
Volume in the traded options was heavy, at 52,555 contracts, as the August
stock options expired. Lasmo, a subject of expiry, led the way among the
stock options as some 8,599 lots were dealt, with the August 154 calls the
busiest series. It was followed by Tesco at 3,148 contracts and Hanson at
2,986, both with series that ceased trading yesterday. The FT-SE 100 option
traded 15,941 lots.

FT  11 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities rally after challenging
support level - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London traders continued to watch the US closely yesterday, and both
gilt-edged securities and shares again staged a cautious rally towards the
close as the dollar improved following first reports from the Congressional
appearance of Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board.
However, London traders went home still waiting for the outcome of the
auction of Dollars 12bn Federal bonds.
An early loss of 16.4 points on the FT-SE 100 Index was cut to a mere 1.6 at
the final reading of 3,167. The low of the day saw a challenge to the
Footsie 3,152 area, which is regarded as an important support level.
But trading volume was very low in the early part of the session and a later
improvement reflected in part the completion of Monday's trading programme,
which is now thought to have been close to Pounds 200m worth of equities
across the range of the market.
The market continued to focus on prospects for US markets as they take
aboard Mr Greenspan's testimony and this week's heavy funding programme
which continues tomorrow, and will be preceded by important statistics on US
retail sales, producer prices and unemployment claims.
On the domestic front, equities were also subdued at first by release of the
minutes of last month's meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of
the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. The
governor's comment that base rates should be raised 'sooner rather than
later' reinforced market views that base rates will be lifted from their
present 5 1/4 per cent level well before the end of the year, and perhaps as
soon as next month.
However, many analysts believe that a quarter point, or even half point rise
in base rates might be taken in its stride by a market still responding to a
steady flow of good company profits and higher dividends.
UK government bonds staged a good recovery to close firmer on the day, and
this buttressed the rally in equities. The second line stocks were less
responsive than the blue chips and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 9.5 off at
3,716.9.
Non-Footsie stocks made up around 57 per cent of the day's Seaq total of
593m shares. On Tuesday, 669.9m shares in UK companies were traded, bringing
a strong retail total by value of Pounds 1.52bn. The London market appears
to have continued to attract investors from Europe and the US throughout its
recent sluggish trading period.
Strength in the pharmaceutical and oil sectors, both well supported from the
US, helped to rally the market as well as to offset weakness among far
eastern banks despite good half time figures from Standard Chartered. The
insurance sector was subdued, the exception being Commercial Union as the
half-time results and the details of the bid for Groupe Victoire of France
were absorbed by the market.
UK banks turned in a mixed performance, with Barclays giving back a few
pence of the gain which greeted the half time profits announced in the
previous session. Company trading reports brought a number of features
elsewhere in a generally subdued market.
Market strategists were beginning to focus on next week's meeting of the US
Federal Open Market Committee which will be discussing interest rate policy
against a background of the latest data on inflation and economic growth in
the US.
At home, similar factors apply, and yesterday's publication of the early
July meeting of the chancellor and the governor of the Bank has turned the
market's attention to next week's heavy list of UK data on domestic
inflation and unemployment.

FT  11 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Program buying helps Dow to
modest rise
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
Early computerised program buying, strong demand for technology shares and a
moderately successful auction of new government securities in the bond
market helped US equity prices post modest gains across the board yesterday,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 11.00 at 3,766.76. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.37 at 460.30, while the
American Stock Exchange composite finished 1.75 higher at 443.97 and the
Nasdaq composite 5.60 ahead at 728.21. Trading volume on the New York SE
totalled 279.5m shares.
As during the first two days of the week, there was little interest in
buying stocks among retail investors at the opening yesterday, primarily
because they were waiting for a lead from the bond market, which was in the
middle of digesting billions of dollars of new government securities.
The second leg of the Treasury's quarterly refunding round - the sale of
Dollars 12bn in 10-year notes - was due during the afternoon, and bond
prices were subdued ahead of the auction. Share prices were also little
changed, but some selected program buying helped stocks edge higher at
mid-morning.
Prices held on to their gains later in the day when the 10-year auction
passed off uneventfully, with demand from investors for the new paper
slightly stronger than expected.
Sentiment, however, stayed unsettled, primarily because of concern about the
July inflation data. The figures, due out today and tomorrow, are nervously
awaited by the markets because, if inflation is shown to be gathering pace,
the Federal Reserve could decide to sanction another interest rate increase.
Such a move would depress stock prices, although growing expectations of
another monetary policy tightening mean that the impact of a rate increase
has partly already been priced into the market.
Technology shares were in demand for the second consecutive day, with Texas
Instruments climbing Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 84 1/8 , Hewlett-Packard
Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 82 1/4 and Compaq Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 35 1/8 .
Procter&amp;Gamble, which reported a 24 per cent jump in second-quarter
underlying earnings yesterday, advanced Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 54 7/8 .
Among the biggest losers of the day was Dillard Department Stores. Shares in
the retailer dropped Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 26 5/8 in volume of 3.9m as
investors reacted harshly to news of second-quarter earnings that were below
market expectations.
Reports that Kidder, Peabody, the troubled Wall Street investment bank, lost
between Dollars 50m and Dollars 60m in the month of July, mostly because of
problems in the mortgage-backed securities market, unsettled the shares of
its parent group, General Electric, which shed Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 48 1/8
in heavy trade.
On the Nasdaq market, Lotus forged ahead Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 40 1/4 in
volume of 4.1m shares after the company said that it was entering into a
world-wide marketing and product development pact with leading chipmaker
Intel. The latter put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 59 3/4 .
Canada
Toronto finished solidly higher, supported by recent strength in the
Canadian dollar. The TSE 300 index closed above 4,200 with a rise of 18.3 at
4,205.1. Advances outpaced falls by 389 to 304 after volume of 62.2m shares.
Eleven of the 14 sub-indices were higher, led by transportation, up 1.5 per
cent. Financial services and industrial products each rose 1.2 per cent.
Nova firmed CDollars 1/2 to CDollars 13 1/2 on the day's heaviest volume of
some 5.8m shares. The company attributed the strong interest in its stock
partly to an explosion earlier this week at an ethylene plant of Exxon, a
key competitor of Nova in the US ethylene market.
Mexico
Stocks ended moderately easier, with profit-taking continuing to determine
market movement. Traders said short-term investors sold off shares for the
third successive session, with not even a cut in primary interest rates
giving much support to the market.
A 65 basis-point fall in the bellwether 28-day Cetes rate to 15.15 per cent
at the weekly auction yesterday boosted shares only briefly in opening
transactions. Equities soon moved into reverse as profit-taking dominated
transactions, and falling prices of New York-traded American Depositary
Receipts (ADRs) of Mexican blue chips also dragged the local market down.
The IPC index lost 20.29 at 2,574.67.

FT  11 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia): Nikkei improves on bond market
rally
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices gained ground on arbitrage buying and purchases by public
funds, and the Nikkei 225 average closed higher in spite of a lack of news,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index was finally ahead 180.03 at the day's best of 20,770.25, after
dipping to a low of 20,584.82 in the morning session but supported
throughout the day by buying orders from domestic financial institutions and
arbitrageurs.
Volume, however, remained low as investors other than public fund managers
stayed on the sidelines. A total of 274m shares changed hands, against
Tuesday's 256m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 5.35 at 1,661.50 and the
Nikkei 300 firmed 1.14 to 302.15. Advances led declines by 549 to 398, with
203 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.83 to
1,349.66.
A rally in the bond market, depressed since last week on the rise in the
dollar and prospects of an imminent economic recovery, relieved some
traders. Some investors feared that a sell-off in the bond market would
prompt profit-taking in equities to cover losses on bond portfolios.
Overseas investors stepped up their buying of chemical shares on
expectations of higher ethylene prices, although some of the gains were
trimmed by selling by domestic institutions. Sumitomo Chemical rose Y10 to
Y554 and Showa Denko added Y5 at Y372.
Steels, leading the day's activity, were supported by public funds. Nippon
Steel, the most active issue of the day, gained Y2 at Y370, while NKK moved
up Y4 to Y285 and Kawasaki Steel Y3 to Y418.
Maruha, a fishing company, forged ahead Y26 to Y452 on reports that it will
start the world's first tuna fish farming project.
Mitsumi Electric dropped Y160 to Y1,550 on reports of a decline in half-year
operating profits, while prospects of falling CD-ROM disk drive sales hit
Matsushita-Kotobuki Electronics, which lost Y90 at Y3,130.
Speculation that overseas investors will sell blue chip electricals
depressed leading high-technology stocks. Toshiba dipped Y8 to Y768 and NEC
Y10 to Y1,240. But consumer electronics stocks were higher, with Matsushita
Electric Industrial up Y10 to Y1,780 and Sony adding Y80 at Y5,980.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved ahead 36.32 to 23,053.52 in volume of 71.6m
shares. The index was supported by a rise in retail and drug stocks.
Roundup
The region's markets generally improved yesterday.
HONG KONG advanced as strong general buying pushed stocks up sharply
following a good rally in Hong Kong issues in London. The Hang Seng index
moved forward 171.65, or 1.8 per cent, to 9,618.08.
Turnover was a preliminary HKDollars 4.28bn, against Tuesday's adjusted
HKDollars 2.99bn.
BOMBAY closed at a 27-month peak on general buying by speculators, with the
BSE index strengthening 45.92 to 4,365.00. Brokers said the rise was fuelled
by across the board purchasing by investors who believed that the market was
poised to climb on the back of excellent corporate results and good monsoon
rains.
SHANGHAI's A share index for domestic investors shrugged off Tuesday's
losses to soar on expectations of an infusion of bank liquidity. The index
finished 95.23, or 14.35 per cent, ahead at 759.17 in turnover of Yn9.72bn.
Shanghai's B share index rose 1.84 to 78.87 as market sentiment remained
good.
SEOUL moved up, helped by reports that the central bank would loosen its
tight grip on monetary policy. The composite index improved 12.71 to 930.21
as a technical rebound following recent falls further strengthened
sentiment.
KUALA LUMPUR gained 1.8 per cent in the strongest market volume since
mid-June, of 425m shares. The composite index closed at a five-month high,
up 19.2 at 1,092.8.
Plantation shares were in demand as funds rerated the stocks to reflect firm
palm oil prices. United Plantations appreciated 70 cents to MDollars 7.10.
MANILA saw share prices stage a good rise, spurred by investors positioning
for an expected surge next month when Petron shares are listed.
The share index advanced 61.82 to 2,944.19 in volume of 9.03bn shares worth
1.57bn pesos.
TAIPEI remained concerned about the central bank's tight monetary policy as
share prices weakened amid profit-taking. The index finished 106.90, or 1.5
per cent, down at 6,838.01. Turnover was a heavy TDollars 106.2bn.
SYDNEY ended lower as investors stayed on the sidelines because of
uncertainty over US interest rates. The All Ordinaries index slipped 10.3 to
2,076.5 in turnover of 175.4m shares. Analysts expected investors to remain
undecided until the US interest rate situation was resolved.
JAKARTA rebounded on buoyant sentiment and bargain hunting. The JKSE index
rose 1.77 to 471.69.

While the Brazilian equity market continues to make substantial headway
following the introduction of a new currency at the start of July - the
third phase of the government's economic stabilisation programme - the
attention of many investors has been directed recently to Mexico. Last week,
a number of brokers raised the weighting of the market in their asset
allocation portfolios to reflect the generally positive attitude towards the
forthcoming presidential elections. Salomon Brothers was among those to
change its stance, increasing its allocation by 2 percentage points to 40
per cent, and said it expected equities to gain momentum as the August 21
elections approached. 'We continue to believe the elections will be seen as
the freest and fairest in Mexico's history, and that post-election disputes
will be manageable,' it added.

FT  11 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Analysts worry as South Africa climbs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg closed sharply higher once again, although analysts detected a
conflict between the bullish sentiment and the feeling that price gains were
outstripping strength in underlying economic fundamentals amid a lack of
quality stocks. The market, they noted, was drawing in retail buyers,
looking to take advantage of this week's major rally.
The overall index was up 95 at 5,918, a closing high, the industrial index
by 39 at 6,694 and the golds index by 65 at 2,222. Analysts said the weaker
commercial and financial rands, a firmer bullion price and mostly steady
world equities had offered support, export-orientated shares posting the
biggest gains.
Gencor jumped 80 cents to R12.60 in steady trade as it shrugged off recent
lethargy which followed sharp gains ahead of its Billiton purchase. Joel ran
out of steam after its recent bullish run, slipping 10 cents to R7.15.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Political woes hit lira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ongoing woes of the Berlusconi government yesterday prompted further
weakness in the Italian lira, writes Philip Gawith.
The dispute about a series of government advertisements on television
reminded markets of the political risks in Italy, and drove the currency
lower to a London close of L1,008 against the D-Mark from L1,001.
The lira's weakness came against a general background of D-Mark strength.
Most currencies, however, traded in fairly narrow ranges and volumes were
low as the market lethargy of the past few days persisted.
The dollar was slightly weaker in London ahead of the US Treasury's 10 -
year note auction following the disappointing three-year auction on Tuesday.
The currency ended at DM1.5745 from DM1.582 and Y101.155 from Y101.2. But it
closed higher in New York at DM1.5843 and Y101.425 following a moderately
successful note auction.
The pound lost nearly a pfennig against the stronger D - Mark to end at
DM2.4253 from DM2.4349. It was slightly firmer against the dollar at Dollars
1.5404 compared to Dollars 1.5392. The trade - weighted sterling index
closed at 79.3 from 79.4.
The background to the relative strength of the D - Mark is a spate of firmer
growth figures recently which have led some observers to conclude that the
German interest rate cycle is nearer to the bottom than originally thought.
Mr Tim Stewart, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley in London, said some
of the weakness in the peseta, lira and Swedish krona could be attributed to
market concerns 'whether the rest of Europe is going to be able to keep pace
on the upside as they did on the downside'.
Economists at SG Warburg note in their latest currency brief that political
resistance, or the need to maintain lower borrowing costs in the face of
escalating government debt, could inhibit interest rate increases in
countries, such as Spain and France.
'For many countries, Bundesbank tightening will come too early in the
business cycle and in a situation where real rates are already very high. It
will therefore be tempting to tolerate a weaker currency against the D -
Mark . . .'
Economists disagree whether a turning point has yet been reached with German
interest rates. SG Warburg argues that 'the Bundesbank clearly lacks
economic justification for a further monetary relaxation now', but
economists at Nikko Europe in London think there will be a final discount
rate cut in September to 4 per cent.
There was no fresh evidence to account for the lira's renewed weakness. Mr
Stewart attributed it to a dawning realisation of the 'fractured' nature of
Italian politics.
'The market has now woken up and a lot of longer term holders of Italian
assets, who bought the political revolution story, are now having their
faith tested. The risk still is that they are not going to get the job
done,' he said.
Mr Stewart contrasted the situation of countries such as Italy and Sweden,
where the currencies were weak and governments faced considerable problems,
with New Zealand, where the Kiwi dollar has been under pressure on fears
that the government might lose its parliamentary majority if it fails to win
Saturday's Selwyn by-election. Whether the government loses or not, Mr
Stewart noted: 'There really isn't a big job on the table to be done. They
have done the hard work. Now it is just a question of managing at the
margins.'
Yesterday the 'Kiwi' currency slipped further to close in London at Dollars
0.5978 from Dollars 0.6007 on reports of an opinion poll which showed the
ruling National party to be trailing the opposition Alliance.
The dollar had little news to trade on, save for the appearance before
Congress of Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, to discuss monetary
aggregates. The dollar gained more than  1/2 pfennig on his comment that it
was crucially important for the currency to be strong and viable.
The market's main focus remains on whether or not the Federal Open Markets
Committee will raise interest rates when it meets next week. The tenor of
recent comments from Fed officials have hinted as much, but a lot will
depend on the retail sales and inflation data due today and tomorrow.
Activity in the interest rate futures markets was again very subdued. The
December short sterling contract traded 15,455 lots to end at 93.43 from
93.44. The December Euromark contract saw 18,181 lots dealt to close at
94.96 from 94.95.
In the cash markets, UK rates were unchanged, with three-month sterling
LIBOR closing at 5 9/16 per cent.
In its daily operations, the Bank of England provided UK money markets with
Pounds 200m assistance at established rates after forecasting a Pounds 300m
shortage. Overnight money traded between 3 and 5 1/8 per cent.
In Germany, call money rates eased to 5/5.1 per cent from Tuesday after the
Bundesbank allocated DM2.3bn in its weekly repo tender. The market had been
hoping for a more generous allocation and rates firmed from 4.94/5.05 per
cent before the tender.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cautious increase in coffee
futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee futures prices bounced back again yesterday after recent falls as
traders covered short positions in the market ahead of a report from the US
department of agriculture assessing the frost damage to Brazil's coffee
trees which is due on Friday.
Soft commodities prices in general moved ahead partly as a result of
technical buy signals motivating traders, but also based on fears about crop
supplies in coffee, cocoa and sugar.
The November coffee futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange rose
by Dollars 91 a tonne to Dollars 3,283 a tonne yesterday, but trading
remained light and market participants were cautious. New York prices
slipped in late trading after London's close as the market remained in limbo
ahead of the crop report. 'There's no rhyme nor reason to the way this
market is trading at the moment until the news about the crop report is
out,' said Ms Judy Ganes, soft commodities analyst at Merrill Lynch in New
York.
The USDA report will be released after the close of trading on Friday which
means that prices will not be affected by its findings until trading next
Monday.
Cocoa prices jumped in London trading on some technical buying and
short-covering. The market closed Pounds 24 a tonne higher at Pounds 1,054 a
tonne as some traders reported a growing interest from speculators and
investment funds in cocoa trading.
'We're seeing lots of inquiries and a growing involvement of hedge funds in
the cocoa market in the past few weeks,' said a commodities director at a US
investment bank.

FT  11 AUG 94 / World Commodities Prices: Russian threat hits nickel -
Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NICKEL continued its plunge on the London Metal Exchange yesterday as the
threat of large second-half Russian shipments undermined market sentiment.
Support developed around the Dollars 5,800 a tonne level, after an early
fall to Dollars 5,760, and at the close nickel was Dollars 5,816.50, down
Dollars 38.5 from Tuesday.
LEAD was another metal on which fears of further stock increases - following
recent deliveries of Russian, Polish and Macedonian metal into LME
warehouses - took their toll. Trade selling swamped initial commission house
buying and touched off sell-stops down to Dollars 565 before the price
recovered to close at Dollars 574.25 a tonne, down Dollars 9.25.
ALUMINIUM benefited from a further fall in IPAI stocks which complemented
recent steady falls in LME stocks. Three-months delivery closed at Dollars
1,470.75 a tonne, up Dollars 6.75. Traders said aluminium could test
resistance at Dollars 1,485 during the current advance.
OIL prices fell as traders' attention shifted from the Nigerian oil workers'
strike to worries about European over-supply. September Brent crude oil
futures slid 17 cents to Dollars 17.68 a barrel. The Nigerian strike has
boosted oil prices by Dollars 2 over the last month as the country's output
of 1.9m barrels a day has been cut by 20 per cent.

survey

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China, faced with increasing shortages of oil, gas, copper and other key
minerals, plans a huge geological survey in the hope of boosting reserves,
the official Xinhua news agency said, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The ministry of geology and mineral resources said it planned to survey 2m
sq km of China's land mass before the year 2000, and 1m sq km more from 2001
to 2010.
Geological surveys should have been completed on 1.35m sq km of China's
total land area of 9.6m sq km by 1995, ministry officials said, because
existing deposits of oil and gas were insufficient.
Oil reserves of 15.9bn tonnes have been found in China over the past 40
years and, of the 4.49bn tonnes that can be extracted, 2.42bn have been
pumped out, they said.
Prospecting for oil and gas will be intensified over the next 20 years in
west China, in the hopes of finding large deposits in areas such as the
Tarim and Junggar basins.
China has enough uranium deposits to meet its immediate needs and, because
more nuclear power stations are planned, a general survey of uranium
deposits will be launched into the next century, the officials added.
China's annual steel output will exceed 100m tonnes by 2000.
Domestic iron ore is mostly low grade so China will continue to import rich
ores, while finding more economical ways to treat low-grade ore, they said.
The ministry also plans to step up efforts to find new deposits of copper,
for which China depended on imports for half of its needs.
The officials gave no more details.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Worm may turn India's exports -
Kunal Bose on moves to revolutionise the country's silk production and limit
imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India, a distant second to China in silk production, is hardly able to use
15 per cent of the indigenous silk yarn for making exportable silk goods.
While there is a big domestic market for silk saris and dress materials in
India, much of the local yarn is not good enough in terms of strength and
lustre for producing exportable items.
'Our export of silk goods is pathetically dependent on imported yarn,' says
Mr S. Shah, spokesman for the Silk Association of India. 'We are importing
over 3,000 tonnes of yarn to sustain the production of exportable goods. Our
principal source of import is China,'
In spite of the structural weakness of the Indian silk sector, the export of
silk goods was up 7.8 per cent to Rs7.92bn during the year to March 31.
In the past few years, however, India had recorded a much higher rate of
export growth. The most important destination for Indian silk goods was
western Europe, with a share of 43.5 per cent, followed by the US (39.4 per
cent) and Asia (15.4 per cent).
The structural weakness resulting from over-dependence on the import of silk
yarn cannot be overcome in the immediate future. The Central Silk Board is,
however, banking on a Japanese government-funded project to develop a race
of acclimatised bivoltine silkworms producing a stronger fibre than India's
multivoltine worms. The richness of Chinese silk is due to the practice of
bivoltine sericulture on a large scale.
China produces nearly 55,000 tonnes of silk yarn a year, of which as much as
85 per cent is exported. Mr PSS Thomas, secretary of CSB, says: 'The
laboratory work on the development of bivoltine silkworms has been quite
encouraging and we should be ready for field trials later this year.'
In India, the cocoon created by multivoltine worms has a silk content of
about 17 per cent. But the silk content could go up to 24 per cent if it is
formed by bivoltine worms. But a breakthrough in sericulture cannot be taken
for granted until the field trials are over. Bivoltine silk worms do well in
temperate zones, but most of India has a tropical climate.
For the the bivoltine project to succeed, the sericulturists must also be
exposed to sophisticated rearing and reeling practices. In spite of the many
uncertainties surrounding the project, Mr Thomas says it should be possible
to produce 1,000 tonnes of bivoltine silk in 2 1/2 years.
Self-reliance in raw silk is not a high priority in a regime of free trade
where the import of silk yarn is allowed on condition of the export of silk
goods (after a high degree of value addition). Nevertheless, the industry
believes that if India is able to produce 'a respectable quantity of
good-quality bivoltine silk', then its silk trade will become stable.
According to industry officials, the past 18 months have shown how much the
Indian trade in silk is influenced by Chinese prices. When China made a
drastic cut in silk prices early last year, the bottom fell out of the
Indian trade and growers started losing interest in silk. Fortunately, the
cocoon and yarn prices have once again become remunerative. But this is also
seen as a reaction to the revision in silk prices by China.'
While the Central Sericulture Research Institute at Mysore is responsible
for the development of bivoltine silkworms, the Indian Institute of Science
at Bangalore has created the country's first genetically engineered
silkworms. The scientists behind the IIS project say a proper selection of
genes 'could revolutionise the Indian sericulture'.
The genetically engineered silkworms should be able to withstand a virus
attack, and it should be possible to produce coloured silk from them.
But Mr Thomas is not expecting a breakthrough overnight. 'Anything to do
with biotechnology needs time and investment,' he says. 'What the CSB is
planning to do is to involve a number of national and foreign institutes to
work on the development of new races of productive and disease resistant
silkworms.'
The challenge before India is to improve the growers' return from
sericulture. With the productivity of raw silk stagnating at less than 40kg
a hectare (2.471 acres) compared with more than 80kg in China, the growers
may switch to crops such as sugar cane, cotton and oilseeds, industry
officials fear.
Because of the comparatively high returns from the other crops, sericulture,
under a six-year project funded by the World Bank, could make little headway
in non-traditional silk-growing states such as Rajasthan and Gujarat. But
progress in the five traditional silk producing states of Karnataka, Andhra
Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Jammu &amp; Kashmir, as well as in some
non-traditional areas, in bringing new areas under sericulture and changing
silk growing practices is encouraging.
The CSB is hopeful that by 1996-97 when the World Bank project is over,
India's production of mulberry silk will have increased to 16,000 tonnes.
When the project was launched in 1988-89, India's production of mulberry
silk was only 9,500 tonnes and much of it of inferior quality. This year,
India is expecting a mulberry silk production of 14,425 tonnes.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Maize price slump expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fine weather and favourable rains over the past month are expected to
produce a near-record maize harvest in the US which could force prices down
by as much as 20 per cent.
The US department of agriculture this morning is expected to forecast a
maize crop of about 9.3bn bushels (1 bushel=56lb).
That figure would come close to equalling the harvest of 1992, when US
farmers produced 9.5bn bushels.
It would also be well above last year's meagre 6.3bn bushel crop, which was
affected by flooding during the growing season.
'We've got a big crop in super condition, and that typically means low
prices and big demand,' said Mr Bill Biederman, an analyst with the research
firm Allendale, Inc.
This is good news for companies which store and handle grain, and for the
railroads and barge lines that transport the crop.
Grain analysts predict that the price of a bushel of maize traded for
December delivery at the Chicago Board of Trade could fall below Dollars
1.89 - nearly 20 per cent lower than today's prices.
However the price of maize has fallen steadily since early July, and other
analysts are less bearish in their outlook.
'The US supply will be up, but the world supply will be almost unchanged,'
said Mr Daniel Basse, a principal with Agresources in Chicago.
On the demand side, the USDA report is expected to reflect heavy maize
consumption by the US livestock industry.
The USDA will also report on US soyabean production data today, and the
average trade estimate is a harvest of around 2.3bn bushels.
That is also a much larger crop than last year, and producers will face
competition from what promises to be a record Canadian Canola harvest.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium pact success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More evidence came yesterday that the unprecedented international trade
agreement encouraging aluminium producers to cut output is having an
increasing impact on the huge surplus that depressed prices for so long. The
International Primary Aluminium Institute said producer stocks fell for the
fourth consecutive month in June, by 12,000 tonnes to 1.993m tonnes.
Since February, when delegates from six big aluminium producing areas signed
a 'memorandum of understanding' about production cuts, producer stocks have
fallen by 141,000 tonnes or 6.6 per cent.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, said London Metal Exchange stocks
also fell in June - the first time in nearly four years that both stocks had
fallen.
He suggested: 'The memorandum of understanding clearly is working. But the
industry still has a big task ahead.' Stocks were still equivalent to 16
weeks of consumption and they needed to be 6 1/2 weeks before producers
could relax. So another 2.85m tonnes - or 40 per cent - had to be cut from
combined IPAI and LME stocks of 4.8m tonnes.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries firm as auction goes well

<TEXT>
US bond prices were flat-to-firmer across the maturity range yesterday after
a moderately successful auction of 10-year notes - the second leg of the
Treasury's quarterly refunding round.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was unchanged at 84
1/2 , yielding 7.569 per cent. The two-year note was firmer, up 3/32 at 99
29/32 , to yield 6.158 per cent.
After Tuesday's disappointing three-year note auction, there were worries
yesterday that the sale of Dollars 12bn in 10-year notes would also attract
weak demand from retail investors. This kept most investors on the sidelines
in the morning, leaving prices moderately lower in early trading.
The auction subsequently passed off without a hitch, with retail demand
proving stronger than expected. The 10-year notes were sold at an average
yield of 7.33 per cent.
But the market remained subdued, with dealers and investors apprehensive
about the July inflation data, due for release today and tomorrow.
European government bond markets experienced one of their quietest days this
year as the summer holiday season got into full swing. Dealers said
yesterday's testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan
before a House Commerce subcommittee had no impact but results of the US
auction of 10-year paper later in the day could give markets a fresh
direction.
Some analysts expect next week's heavy programme of supply in Germany,
France and Italy to put renewed downward pressure on those markets, as
dealers bidding for the paper hedge themselves by taking out short positions
in the futures market.
The only market to offer any signs of life was Spain, where investors gave a
favourable reception to the latest auction of one-year treasury bills. This
means the Bank of Spain has now raised three-quarters of this month's
funding requirement.
Yields on the Treasury bills fell to 8.08 per cent from 8.18 per cent while
at the longer end of the curve, yields on 10-year bonds eased three basis
points to 10.39 per cent. The September bond future rose to 91.07 from
90.58.
The weakness in the lira and the continual political concerns kept the
Italian market under pressure, which caused the spread between Italian and
German 10-year bonds to widen to more than 400 basis points from around 380
basis points a week ago.
The German market was little changed with yields on 10-year bunds staying at
7 per cent. Dealers detected some switching out of Dutch bonds into bunds,
reflecting investor uncertainty over the delay in forming a government. This
caused the spread between 10-year Dutch bonds and bunds to widen to five
basis points from three basis points.
UK gilts were unmoved by the publication of minutes of a meeting between the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke and the Bank of England
governor, Mr Eddie George. On Liffe, the September long gilt future rose
13/32 to 102 1/4 in thin volume.

The Tokyo stock exchange is to introduce measure to curb excessive price
movements in Japan Tobacco shares which are scheduled to be listed on
October 27.
Stock exchange officials are wary of repeating the chaos following the
listing of East Japan Railway (JR East) shares last October, when the TSE's
computer system broke down due to mass sell orders of the stock, which later
affected the whole market.
On the first trading day, price fluctuations will be limited to within 30
per cent of the public offering price, the TSE said.
If JT shares become bid-only or ask-only at prices deviating more than 30
per pent from the public offering price, trade in JT shares will be halted
immediately.
In addition, the exchange will require first-day investors to settle on the
same day rather than allowing the usual four days delay.

FT  11 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Arguments grow for muffling
open outcry - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After-hours screen trading for options on Liffe, scheduled for the end of
the year, is set to give a new kick to the argument that open outcry should
be muffled.
The traditional practice whereby traders in gaudy jackets crowd into a pit
the size of a boxing ring to bid for contracts is seen by supporters as the
most efficient way of dealing. But some of the biggest marketmaking firms in
the UK say it is strangling trade in stock options - instruments giving the
right to buy or sell shares at a fixed price.
Mr Gerald Freedman, director of derivatives at integrated securities house
Smith New Court, says change must come: 'The truth is that the market has
been so rotten for the past four or five years that there is not much to
lose.'
The case against open outcry boils down to transparency. A big investor
might want to buy call options which give the right to buy shares at a later
date. The marketmaker has the duty to provide those shares if the option is
exercised, and has to buy them in the stock market in order to hedge the
position. However, because rivals have seen the initial option trade they
will immediately mark the share price higher.
Smith New Court argues that if option dealing were screen-based, details of
the deal would be instantly available as before but the identity of the
dealer would not.
'As far as the big integrated houses are concerned it has to be anonymous.
The market itself would benefit enormously from the extra volume that
anonymity would generate,' says Mr Freedman.
While volume in FT-SE 100 futures and options has boomed, stock option
turnover has refused to budge. Many of the UK's biggest companies see the
daily equivalent of less than 100,000 shares changing hands in the form of
options. Average turnover was more than 40,000 contracts a day (equivalent
to 40m shares) in 1987, the year of the crash, but subsequently fell back to
around half that level.
The other side of the argument comes from agency brokers whose principal
duty is to clients. Mr Nigel Croft, head of derivatives at Kleinwort Benson
says: 'I can see why dealers want to go screen-based but for the broker
(open-outcry) means that all the marketmakers are in one place at one time
and can be reached with one phone call. It makes for a level playing field.'
There is also a frisson of unease among the independent traders, known as
'locals', who trade their own capital on Liffe. Although locals are not very
active in options, they worry that if stock options go to open outcry then
other contracts might follow.
But Ms Karin Forseke, director of equity products at Liffe, says the
automated system being developed will not be ready until either the end of
this year or early next year and will then only be used for after-hours
dealing.
'Open outcry is an effective way of trading some of the world's most
successful products,' she says. 'There is nothing that has proved to me that
an automated environment will be better.' She claims that the problems with
the options market relate to a lack of transparency in the underlying stock
market where big trades can be hidden for between 90 minutes and five days.
The poor growth of the listed stock options market in London has been one of
the reasons behind the development of over-the-counter options, which are
tailor-made by securities houses and banks for clients.
But OMLX, the Swedish-owned derivatives exchange which offers a screen-based
system in Swedish companies, claims that turnover in Astra, the
pharmaceuticals group, was the highest of any stock option traded in the UK
in the first six months of this year, topping Hanson by more than 23,000
contracts.
No one doubts that the start of after-hours screen-based trading will
provide a much needed fillip for Liffe's equity option, but many feel that a
more drastic shift will be required in the long run.

FT  11 AUG 94 / International Bonds: First offer backed by aircraft leases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lehman Brothers yesterday launched the first global offering of notes backed
by aircraft leases, a Dollars 1bn nine-tranche deal for Aircraft Lease
Portfolio Securitisation.
The issuer is a special purpose vehicle which has bought the leases from GPA
Group, now owned by General Electric of the US. The servicer of the leases
is GE Capital Aviation Services.
Only a small number of companies, including GPA and Northwest Airlines, have
so far securitised aircraft leases, but the drying-up of tax-driven lease
financing in the Japanese market has made securitisation appear more
attractive.
The Royal Bank of Scotland tapped the sterling sector with a structured
floating-rate note via SG Warburg Securities. The deal is structured in such
a way that interest will not accrue on days when six-month Libor exceeds 15
per cent; in return for that risk, investors receive a coupon of 6-month
Libor plus 40 basis points. The deal met with good demand from banks,
corporates, insurance companies and money market funds, said an official at
the lead manager.
Colombia's Banco Ganadero made its eurobond market debut with Dollars 125m
of 9 3/4 per cent five-year bonds. Priced at a yield of 290 basis points
over the US Treasury note, the deal saw good interest from international
institutions, lead manager Citibank said.
In Japan, another emerging-market borrower, Mexico's Pemex, announced it
would postpone a planned Y20bn Samurai bond issue after market participants
felt the pricing was out of line with market conditions.
The issue, with Daiwa Securities as lead manager, was to be made up of 5.35
per cent five-year bonds priced at par. 'The pricing was way too tight,'
said an official at a Japanese house, which, along with other underwriters,
had declined Daiwa's invitation into the deal.
Elsewhere, Bayerische Landesbank issued Dollars 200m of 7 per cent four-year
bonds via Swiss Bank Corporation.
Yielding 12 1/2 basis points over the US Treasury note at its 99.94 re-offer
price, some dealers said the pricing was too tight, but the lead manager
reported demand from Swiss, German and Benelux investors.

FT  11 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: SEC urged to widen rules on
'soft-dollar' disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two prominent US legislators called on the Securities and Exchange
Commission yesterday to introduce new rules requiring investment managers to
disclose more information about their so-called 'soft dollar' arrangements
with securities brokers and dealers.
In a letter to Mr Arthur Levitt, the SEC's chairman, Mr Edward Markey,
chairman of the House of Representatives' telecommunications and finance
subcommittee, and Mr Jack Fields, senior Republican on the subcommittee,
urged the SEC to 'give high priority to enhancing disclosure' in the
soft-dollar business.
They claimed the business raised conflicts of interest questions about
investment managers' activities, and potentially interfered with the
execution of customer orders on financial markets.
Soft dollars, known in the UK as 'soft commissions', is the term given to
the practice of institutional investors channelling a portion of their
securities trading business through particular brokers in return for
services such as the provision of brokerage research or electronic data
products, or for discounts on other transaction fees.
The value of commissions with such strings attached is estimated to exceed
Dollars 1bn a year in the US.
Although the two legislators acknowledged in their letter that the SEC was
about to introduce new rules requiring mutual funds to disclose soft-dollar
relationships with broking firms, they asked Mr Levitt to broaden the
requirements to include not just mutual funds but all kinds of investment
advisers.
The SEC is expected to issue its new rules for mutual funds today, but there
was no indication yesterday that the agency would broaden the edict on soft
dollars.
The legislator's concerns, however, are likely to be met sympathetically at
the SEC. Mr Levitt has expressed his dissatisfaction with the soft dollar
business on several occasions.

FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Second-term downturn at
Federated Stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Federated Department Stores, the US retailer that last month succeeded in
winning rival R. H. Macy's agreement to a merger, suffered a sharp downturn
in profits in its second quarter to July.
The company blamed costs associated with the integration of 10 Joseph Horne
stores acquired during the period.
Net profits fell to Dollars 3.8m from Dollars 8.9m, but Federated said that
without the one-time costs relating to the Horne acqui-sition, they would
have more than doubled to Dollars 19.9m.
Turnover rose 6 per cent to Dollars 1.6bn, while increased efficiency helped
the group lower operating expenses to 33.5 per cent of sales from 36 per
cent.
Earnings per share fell to 3 cents from 7 cents, but would have risen to 16
cents without the one-time costs.
Federated Department Stores' net income for the first six months was Dollars
36m with the one-time costs and Dollars 52.1m without them. The comparable
figure was Dollars 30.6m before an extraordinary item.

Air Canada continued its strong recovery in the second quarter, turning in
net profits of CDollars 27m (USDollars 19.5m), or 22 cents a share, up from
CDollars 14m, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier.
But the 1993 quarter included a special CDollars 46m fuel tax rebate, so the
underlying upswing was CDollars 59m.
Operating income was CDollars 61m, up CDollars 40m (excluding fuel tax
rebate).
Mr Hollis Harris, chairman of Canada's biggest airline, said the air travel
market was strengthening in Canada and on international routes.
Second-quarter operating revenues were CDollars 966m, up 7 per cent from a
year earlier, with a 4 per cent gain in passenger traffic and a 4 per cent
rise in yield, or revenue per passenger mile.
For the first half, Air Canada posted a net loss of CDollars 5m, against a
deficit of CDollars 279m, including restructuring charges a year earlier.
Operating income was CDollars 49m, against an operating loss of CDollars
12m.
Excluding all special items, the improvement in net earnings totalled
CDollars 169m and operating income was up CDollars 100m.

UK operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confederation Life, Canada's fifth largest insurer, is to sell off its
entire UK operation.
The financially troubled insurer said talks were under way with a 'financial
services company of significant financial strength' for the sale of
Confederation UK Holdings, which made pre-tax profits in 1993 of Pounds
27.9m (USDollars 43.24m) against Pounds 14.2m in 1992.
Premium income last year was Pounds 629m, compared with Pounds 715m.
Mr Alec Wright, communications manager for the UK operation, said the sale
would be used to restore the parent company's capital base which had
suffered as a result of falls in property values since the late 1980s.
Confederation's UK arm, which began trading in 1906, is one of the leading
providers of pooled pension products for medium-sized companies.

Yesterday Mr Alan Questrom, Federated's chairman and chief executive, said
he expected the reorganisation and merger to be completed by the end of the

Mr Questrom added that the existing operations would seek to improve
profitability further in the second half by keeping costs under control
while focusing on an acceleration in store-for-store sales growth in the 3
to 4 per cent range.

FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Thailand's distribution
revolution - Cash-and-carry group Siam Makro is floated today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With their warehouse-like interiors, computerised stock management systems
and vast car parks, Makro cash-and-carry stores look much the same in
Thailand as they do in Europe, even if they sell more noodles than potatoes.
But in Thailand they are still a novelty. Siam Makro, the joint venture
between SHV of the Netherlands and Thailand's CP group which is being
floated on the Thai stock exchange today, is at the forefront of a
revolution that is transforming distribution of food and other consumer
products in south-east Asia.
Makro's first store in Asia opened in Bangkok only five years ago. Open-air
markets, small shops and traditional distribution networks still dominate
wholesale and retail trade in Thailand, including Bangkok with its estimated
population of 9m.
Over the next two years, however, the capital will see the opening of
numerous superstores, hypermarkets and modern convenience stores and some of
the world's largest shopping malls.
In the wholesale cash-and-carry sector, Siam Makro is investing furiously to
maintain its dominance and is going public - the first Makro unit worldwide
to do so - in order to finance its rapid expansion. Speed is important in
provincial towns which may be able to support only one such store and where
land costs are rising sharply.
'If we can get there first, it will be profitable for us,' says Mr Ian
Hamilton, Siam Makro president. 'If our competitors get there first, it
won't be profitable for either them or us.'
Siam Makro has raised nearly Bt2bn (Dollars 80m) with its initial public
offering of 40m shares - just over 18 per cent of the company - at Bt50 a
share.
The offering is regarded as a test case by SHV and could be emulated
elsewhere if the flotation is deemed to be a success; Makro runs 120 stores
in 16 countries.
There are already eight stores in Thailand, and Siam Makro intends to expand
at the rate of two or three stores a year to counter expected competition. A
local cash-and-carry company, Saveco, recently opened its first outlet and
is poised to open more.
Siam Makro expects to increase sales this year to more than Bt18bn and to
make a net profit of more than Bt300m. Two of its stores in Bangkok are in
the top five Makro stores worldwide measured by sales per square metre, a
remarkable record given that average purchasing power is still much lower
than in the west.
The balance of power in Thailand appears to be shifting to consumers.
Previously manufacturers have been able to dictate prices to small
distributors, but now find themselves dealing with powerful chains such as
Makro. Siam Makro says it takes 6 per cent of Unilever's products in
Thailand, and the share is growing.
'We are the first one in town really to break into what was a supplier's
market,' says Ms Yaovanee Tulyasathien, Siam Makro finance director.
Siam Makro will avoid competing head-on with the emerging superstore retail
sector and focus on its core business of wholesaling high volumes of food to
small retailers - all 450,000 Makro members in Thailand have business
licences - but the company's managers have been surprised by the success of
non-food products sold to customers for personal use.
About 45 per cent of Makro's turnover in Thailand is currently accounted for
by sales of these items, such as televisions and clothes, and the gross
profit margin of 12 per cent is double the margin for food items, the
company says.
This partly reflects the inefficiency of the existing retail sector in
Thailand and may not last. But Siam Makro is confident enough to be planning
to open separate retail outlets for office equipment, starting in the first
quarter of next year.
Small businesses will remain the main customers of Siam Makro, Mr Hamilton
believes. If corner shops are squeezed by big retailers as they have been in
Europe, there will be new customers for cash-and-carry stores as service
industries such as bars profit from the country's growing wealth.

FT  11 AUG 94 / An Internet for business users: IBM sees global networking
as the new trend in IT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines has put global networking to the fore. The
US computer company is setting up business units for networking services and
applications, signalling its intention to leap-frog competitors in what it
believes is a new trend in information technology.
'Network-centric computing will be the next big thing in information
technology,' says Mr James Cannavino, IBM senior vice-president of strategy
and development.
Like previous shifts from centralised data processing to desktop computing
in the 1980s and later to distributed computing, the trend to
network-orientated computing could shape the industry for years to come, IBM
believes.
It sees this change as an opportunity to reassert its competitiveness, and
is moving quickly to avoid a repetition of its failure to keep pace with
market trends such as the shift to client-server computing.
The 'IBM Global Network' business unit will pull together the activities of
its networking services groups around the world. The new group will
initially offer voice and data services for business-to-business
communications.
IBM already provides data network services in about 700 large cities around
the world. These networks are being linked to provide worldwide
communications capabilities. IBM sees its networks as a platform for a broad
range of services.
Today, most information processing applications are based on a company's
computers - word-processing on desktop computers or payroll processing on a
mainframe computer, for example. Increasingly, however, networks provide
generic services such as electronic mail and Mr Cannavino maintains that
more sophisticated and customised applications will be provided via
networks.
'The computing environment of the future is one where networks will do much
more than transport information. It is one where applications and services
are embedded in high-speed voice and data networks. In IBM's vision of
network-centric computing, users have access to information anytime,
anywhere, in the form that they want.'
For example, 'intelligent agents' will be a boon for office computer users
and consumers. These are programs which can search for information on
databases linked to a network and automatically sort and deliver such
information to pre-arranged computer addresses.
In the workplace, intelligent agents might perform different kinds of
searches. 'They will enable you to follow up ideas - things that you don't
have time to do yourself,' says Mr Cannavino. With such network applications
'you can create very powerful new mechanisms for increasing business and
personal productivity'.
IBM's recently formed Network Applications Services division will create
applications such as directory services, electronic marketing, trading and
shopping for networks. In addition, IBM's new vertical market groups will
develop network applications for specific industries.
In the public domain, the Internet has demonstrated the value and popularity
of global computer links, with millions of computer users subscribing to
services providing Internet connections.
The IBM Global Network will become 'the business person's Internet', says
IBM. It says it will provide ubiquitous access like the Internet without the
shortcomings, such as lack of security.
But IBM is not alone in seeing the potential of high-speed multimedia
networks and is likely to face competition from telecoms and cable TV
companies as well as traditional rivals.
Mr Cannavino concedes that the telecoms and computer industries appear to be
on a collision course as each moves into the other's traditional territory.
He maintains, however, that IBM approaches this market with the benefit of
experience in data processing.
Moreover, unlike the telephone companies IBM does not aim to build a vast
physical network infrastructure.
Instead, IBM will focus on providing information services via its own and
other networks. 'Are we itching for a fight with AT&amp;T? No, but we are not
going to run away either,' says Mr Cannavino.

foreclosure proceedings
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Creditors of the US arm of Olympia &amp; York, the failed Canadian property
group, said they no longer intend to pay O&amp;Y Dollars 3.5m under the terms of
a deal struck in March.
The unofficial committee of the creditors, who hold Dollars 200m in bonds
secured by a property in lower Manhattan, added they would begin foreclosure
proceedings this week to gain ownership of the building.
The move was prompted by 'Olympia &amp; York's unwillingness or inability to
address in a timely manner major substantive issues' of its reorganisation,
the committee said.
In March, the holders of mortgage notes secured by the property, 59 Maiden
Lane, agreed to pay O&amp;Y Dollars 3.5m in return for an agreement to transfer
ownership.
The deal was seen as quietening a combative group of creditors at a time
when the group was is struggling to restructure Dollars 5bn of debt.
The creditors say they are taking a 'non-consensual approach' to securing
ownership. They plan to file a foreclosure complaint, the first step of
proceedings, with the Supreme Court of New York state later this week.
NationsBank of Tennessee, the trustee for the mortgage notes, which will
pursue foreclosure proceedings under the committee's direction, will
distribute Dollars 7m to note-holders on August 22 from excess cashflow
generated by the building, the committee said.

FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Confederation Life to sell UK
arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confederation Life, Canada's fifth largest insurer, is to sell off its
entire UK operation.
The financially troubled insurer said talks were under way with a 'financial
services company of significant financial strength', for the sale of
Confederation UK Holdings, which made pre-tax profits in 1993 of Pounds
27.9m (USDollars 43.24m) against Pounds 14.2m in 1992.
Premium income last year was Pounds 629m, compared with Pounds 715m.
Mr Alec Wright, communications manager for the UK operation, said the sale
would be used to restore the parent company's capital base which had
suffered as a result of falls in property values since the late 1980s.
Confederation's UK arm, which began trading in 1906, is one of the leading
providers of pooled pension products for medium-sized companies.
The mixed pooled fund is the second largest in the UK with assets of Pounds
2.8bn and the investment management division has Pounds 5.4bn of assets
under management.
Its team of 850 direct sales agents markets a range of unit-linked
individual insurance contracts, including standard term and savings
products.
The announcement follows year-long talks with Great-West Life Assurance,
which is controlled by Montreal-based Power Corporation, about a capital
injection and the disposal of part or all of the UK operation.

<TEXT>
Portugal's securities exchange commission (CMVM) yesterday suspended shares
in Banco Portugues do Atlantico amid heavy buying attributed to core
shareholders defending the bank from a hostile bid by Banco Comercial
Portugues.
A group of 13 Portuguese companies, BPA's core shareholders, are believed to
have bought up to 2m shares over the past few days, increasing their stake
from 27.4 per cent to more than 29 per cent.
BCP, Portugal's fifth largest bank, is offering Es132bn (Dollars 821m) for a
controlling stake of 40 per cent of BPA, the country's second biggest.
BPA shares were quoted at Es2,650 before the CMVM suspended trading
indefinitely. They had gained 31.8 per cent since BCP announced its cash
offer of Es3,000 a share on July 26. Dealers said the main sellers were
investment funds and small shareholders.
The executive board at BPA, on which the core shareholders are not
represented, has formally rejected BCP's offer.
The CMVM did not specify its reasons for suspending BPA shares but dealers
said the move had been expected.

<TEXT>
Cathay Pacific Airways, Swire Pacific's Hong Kong-based international
airline, yesterday reported first-half 1994 earnings of HKDollars 803m
(USDollars 104m), up 18 per cent from the HKDollars 681m reported for the
same period last year. However, the dividend is being held at 10.5 cents.
The results, which come after a 23.8 per cent drop in profits in calendar
1993 and a flat 1.9 per cent growth in 1992, were lower than the market had
been expecting and reflected continuing difficulties in the airline
industry, Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, said. Business to Europe remained weak,
as did the Hong Kong market.
'The boycott of tours to China by Taiwan travel agents (prompted by the
murder of Taiwanese tourists at a Chinese beauty spot) reduced passenger
numbers in one of our most important markets in the second quarter and led
us to suspend nearly 100 round-trip flights between Hong Kong and Taiwan,'
Mr Sutch said.
'Downward pressure on yields and overcapacity in the air transport industry
generally, compounded by high inflation in Hong Kong, continues and shows no
sign of ending soon,' he said.
Cathay Pacific is tackling these areas by increasing its focus on customer
needs and identifying means of improving productivity.
Earlier this week pilots agreed to sign new contracts increasing their
working hours, and senior and middle management structures have been
streamlined. Staff numbers overall have swollen by 543 people year-on-year.
Earnings per share rose in line with overall profits, to 28 cents for the
interim, compared with 23.8 cents in the same period last year.
Revenues on passengers and excess baggage rose 12.5 per cent in the first
half of this year compared with the same period last year, although yields
slipped 1.9 per cent.
The number of passengers carried increased 12.9 per cent to 4.6m.
Analysts said May and April yielded disappointingly low traffic, especially
in the light of a big jump in Japanese arrivals to the colony.
Net finance charges increased by HKDollars 139m year-on-year; however, the
drop in interest earnings from managed funds more than offset the decrease
in interest charges.
Mr Sutch said the group traditionally enjoyed a better second half, and
expected this to remain true for 1994.

FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Banesto loss less than expected
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), the Spanish bank which came under the
control of Banco Santander in April in the final phase of a rescue
operation, reported a lower-than-expected loss of Pta21.8bn (Dollars 168m)
in the first half of the year and forecast that it would almost break even
for the year.
Initial estimates made at the time of the auction were that the bank was
losing some Pta55bn a year, indicating a first-half loss of around Pta27bn.
Banesto said there was no comparable figure for the same period of 1993.
Following the Bank of Spain's intervention and a revision of Banesto's
accounts, losses for the whole year were put at Pta577bn.
The bank said the half-year performance reflected improved management
following the intervention rather than the impact of financial support for
the bank, which would be more evident in results for the second half of the
year.
The rescue package involved a Pta180bn capital injection, the purchase of
Pta285bn worth of non-performing assets by the Deposit Guarantee Fund, and a
Pta315bm zero-interest loan to offset current losses.
The bank said it had recovered most of the customer deposits lost during the
crisis. In June and July deposits increased at a rate of Pta150bn a month.
The half-year figures, showing an operating margin of Pta58.6bn for the
parent bank, are the first evidence of the impact of the chairmanship of Mr
Alfredo Saenz, who was appointed by the Bank of Spain and kept in place by
the new controlling shareholder.
More detailed figures are expected at the bank's annual meeting on August
22.

FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Investigation into share dealing
at Fust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A preliminary inquiry has been launched into suspicions of insider trading
in the shares of Fust, a Swiss household appliances retailer part-acquired
by Grands Magasins Jelmoli, a leading department stores group, in a
controversial deal announced last Friday.
Shares in Fust soared to SFr440 last Thursday from SFr390 a week earlier,
prompting Jelmoli to bring forward the announcement of its bid by about a
week and to consider asking for an investigation.
The Zurich prosecutor's office announced yesterday that it had started a
preliminary investigation to discover whether people with inside knowledge
of the impending deal were buying.
Insider trading became a criminal offence in Switzerland in 1988 but so far
no one has been successfully prosecuted on an insider charge.
Meanwhile, a row continues to simmer over the terms of the deal because
Jelmoli has paid a higher price to the controlling Fust family for their
shares than it is offering to minority shareholders.
Jelmoli, in which UTC International of Basle has a 50.01 per cent voting
stake, has acquired 34 per cent of the capital and 51 per cent of the voting
rights in Fust from the controlling Fust family for SFr141.5m (Dollars
107.1m) in shares and cash.
The purchase was based on an average market price of SFr410 for the group's
bearer shares between February and May this year.
Jelmoli said that in deference to minority shareholder protection provisions
in a new stock exchange law coming into force next year it would make an
offer to buy shares from other Fust shareholders, but only at SFr390 per
share.
Mr Peter Leumann, finance director of Jelmoli, said that Mr Walter Fust,
chief executive of Fust, had not wanted any offer to be made to minority
shareholders because he was afraid so many shares might be turned in that
the company could no longer be publicly traded.
Both Jelmoli and Fust are recommending that minority shareholders hang on to
their shares. Mr Leumann said Fust profits were set to rise rapidly and
shareholders should do very well.
He said that the groups' financial advisers argued strongly for an offer to
minority shareholders. In the end, it was equivalent to the strict minimum
provided in the new stock exchange law, that is, the market price for the
shares.
The bearer shares were traded at SFr390 on July 28, the day the deal was
concluded. Mr Leumann said that was purely a coincidence. The price was
selected because it was the average market price between May and July.

FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Steel puts Hoogovens in the
black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A strong turnround in steel enabled Hoogovens, the Dutch metals group, to
swing back into a net profit of Fl 63m (Dollars 35m) in the first half-year
from a net loss of Fl 189m in the same period of 1993.
The company's second biggest business, aluminium, saw a marked improvement
in the period but it remained in the red overall.
Hoogovens forecast a further 'considerable' rise in the second half, before
any extraordinary items. It said steel profits should see a substantial
rise, while losses in aluminium should narrow.
The first-half results were at the top end of analysts' expectations. The
company's shares jumped by 4.7 per cent to close up Fl 3.60 at Fl 80.70,
helped in part by Hoogovens' optimism for the rest of the year.
Commenting on the turnround, Hoogovens said the pace of European economic
recovery had been quicker than forecast earlier in the year. 'The
improvement is due, among other factors, to increasing exports, with the
strength of the US economy having a beneficial influence,' it said.
Group turnover was up 4.1 per cent at Fl 3.67bn, while operating profit
surged to Fl 209m compared with a loss of Fl 42m a year earlier.
The steel division, which had already begun to emerge from losses in the
1993 second-half, posted pre-tax profit before extraordinary items of Fl
163m against a loss of Fl 70m a year earlier.
Hoogovens attributed the rise to cost-cutting measures, a rise in selling
prices, and stable prices in Dutch guilders for raw materials such as iron
ore and coal.
In aluminium, losses were halved to Fl 64m from Fl 128m. Although sales of
rolled and extruded aluminium products rose, selling prices fell compared
with early 1993.
Hoogovens' results were also helped by a decline in financial charges to Fl
96m from Fl 121m a year earlier. A string of divestments of smaller
subsidiaries and associate companies reduced net borrowings by more than Fl
300m.

FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Dresdner advances 11% to
DM1.04bn at midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Operating profits at Dresdner, Germany's second-biggest bank group, rose 11
per cent in the first half to DM1.04bn (Dollars 660m) in spite of a 2 per
cent decline at the parent, Dresdner Bank AG.
Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chairman, yesterday forecast an above-average rise in
earnings for the full year - at least 10 per cent more than in 1992, the
last 'normal' period. Record profits in 1993 included extraordinary items of
DM240m.
As with the other leading banks which have reported in the past two weeks,
Dresdner's own-account trading suffered badly from market turbulence.
Income from financial transactions slumped 90 per cent to DM39m, mainly
because of heavy write-downs on its bond holdings, according to an interim
report.
However, lending and financial services were strong, helped by persistent
demand for mortgages. Net interest income rose 14 per cent to DM3.4bn and
commission earnings were up 17 per cent at DM1.63bn. Group interest earnings
were bolstered by results from derivatives operations, especially those of
BIP, the bank's French subsidiary.
In line with other German financial institutions, Dresdner reduced its
provisions for bad and doubtful debts. Across the group, the total set aside
fell just over 1 per cent to DM747.5m. Provisions at the parent were down
11.5 per cent at DM491m, reflecting rising domestic optimism over industry's
recovery prospects.
However, Mr Sarrazin stressed, no-one should conclude that the risk
situation had been defused.
Corporate and private demand for credit, particularly long-term loans,
improved slightly in the review period, the report said.
This tendency is consistent with industry's apparent reluctance to invest in
the early part of the year. But since most economic indicators are pointing
steeply upwards and domestic orders for capital goods have increased lately,
German banks seem likely to benefit from rising demand for loans as the year
progresses.
According to Dresdner's calculations, the west German economy grew 2 per
cent in the first half, while the east recorded a 10 per cent surge. For the
year as a whole, it said it expected real pan-German growth of 2.5 per cent
growth.

disappoints

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Novo Nordisk slid 7 per cent yesterday after the Danish
pharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes group disclosed lower first-half
profits and a reduced forecast for the full year.
The group blamed the costs of merging two US companies and unrealised bond
losses for the 7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to DKr734m (Dollars
117.76m) from DKr788m.
It said falling bond prices meant it no longer expected 1994 profits to
increase at a relatively faster pace than last year, when the pre-tax result
climbed 11 per cent to DKr1.86bn. This year's increase will be 'slightly
lower' than last year, it stated. The group's shares fell DKr49 to DKr617 in
heavy turnover.
Novo stressed that its underlying businesses had performed in line with
expectations, with sales climbing 15 per cent to DKr6.58bn due to larger
volumes, an improved product mix and currency factors.
But costs rose more than sales - climbing 18 per cent to DKr6.07bn - due to
efforts to build up the company's international production and sales
organisation.
The results were also hit by a DKr80m provision for the planned merger of
two US companies in 1995 as well as a DKr75m unrealised loss on the group's
bond portfolio. The US provision relates to relocation and severance costs
and property write-downs.
Healthcare sales climbed 15 per cent to DKr4.37bn. Diabetes sales accounted
for DKr3.08bn of the total, a 9 per cent rise helped by an improved insulin
product mix. Enzymes sales climbed 14 per cent to DKr1.77bn while ferrosan
sales were 32 per cent higher at DKr310m.
Net income fell to DKr550m from DKr595m, while earnings per share fell to
DKr14.66 from DKr15.87. Second half sales are expected to be higher than in
the first half.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JN Nichols (Vimto), the soft drinks manufacturer, yesterday said that local
production of its core product - the mixed fruit juice drink beloved in the
Midlands and north of England - had started in Moscow.
Exports have previously centred on teetotal markets such as Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait, but thirst for the product in the Russian capital and St Petersburg
had been 'exceptional' since its launch in cans into the former Soviet
Union.
'This is the culmination of six months of strong export performance around
the world,' said Mr John Nichols, managing director.
The announcement accompanied results for the six months to June 30 showing
an 11 per cent expansion in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds
3.76m, on turnover from continuing operations up a commensurate amount at
Pounds 26.8m. Growth in international markets was backed by higher domestic
sales reflecting good weather and increased market penetration via the new
Vimto Soft Drinks division.
Mr Nichols added: 'We are delighted with the performance during a period of
change. Early indications are that the recent divisionalisation and the
commencement of production in Russia will reap further rewards in the
future.'
The interim dividend is 2.25p (2.16p), payable from earnings of 6.32p
(5.76p).

<TEXT>
Beales Hunter, the electrical and refrigeration equipment group which is
also involved in the manufacture of men's clothing, lifted pre-tax profits
by 18 per cent in the year to May 31.
On turnover up from Pounds 47.8m to Pounds 51.6m, including Pounds 1.31m
from acquisitions, profits moved ahead to Pounds 2.63m (Pounds 2.24m)
pre-tax with a Pounds 117,000 contribution at the operating level from
acquisitions. The pre-tax figure was after net interest charged of Pounds
275,000 (Pounds 108,000).
Mr David Tittle, chairman, said the results were satisfactory against a
background of difficult trading conditions. The refrigeration and electrical
divisions had increased profits but the textile side's results 'continued to
disappoint'.
He said there were continuing signs of a slow but sustained recovery in the
economy but indications of an upturn in activity needed to be set against
growing pressure for price increases from the group's supply base. Unless
that pressure could be resisted or passed on in price increases to
customers, he warned that margins would come under pressure.
Earnings per share worked through at 19.2p (16.2p) and the dividend for the
year is lifted to 9.7p (9.4p) with a proposed final of 7.15p.

Mr Brian Jolly, the chief executive who helped build Capital Shopping
Centres into the UK's leading regional shopping centre company, is to retire
due to ill health less than 5 months after the group's flotation.
The announcement was made as CSC issued its maiden results, showing interim
pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.3m for the period to June 30 - effectively for
only three months.
The retirement came as a shock for investors. Mr Jolly was one of two key
executives from Capital &amp; Counties, the TransAtlantic subsidiary which built
the CSC portfolio.
Mr Donald Gordon, chairman, said a replacement should be in place by 'the
end of the holiday season'.
CSC demonstrated strong growth from its core portfolio of seven shopping
centres. On a pro-forma basis, rental income increased by 17 per cent from
Pounds 17m to Pounds 19.9m, although this included a substantial impact from
the phasing out of rent free periods.
Lakeside at Thurrock, its flagship property, saw income rise 18 per cent to
Pounds 10.6m, with tenant turnover recording double digit growth.
Mr Gordon expects Lakeside to be a substantial beneficiary of Sunday
trading, which begins on August 28 and should improve income from turnover
rentals.
The Harlequin Shopping Centre in Watford, its second largest property,
increased profits from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 4m and reduced bad debts from
Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 800,000.
CSC has Pounds 120m of cash, and Mr Gordon said it was looking for
opportunities to invest in other substantial regional shopping centres.
He said there had been no discussions, but it would be logical for CSC to
look for a tie-up with Blue Water Park, the shopping centre development
across the Thames from Lakeside.
The 230 acre site was recently purchased by an Australian property company
and could impinge upon Lakeside's client base, although CSC argues that with
11m people within an hour's drive, competition is hardly a problem.
Earnings per share were 1.9p; no interim dividend is declared but the
company intends to pay a final of at least 5p.
COMMENT
CSC's main problem, which it perceives as a virtue, is its total absence of
gearing. With a net cash position, it will struggle to offer more than
pedestrian increases in net asset value. Brokers expect a year end net asset
value of 216p, leaving the shares at a premium of 4 per cent, based on
yesterday's close of 225p, down 2p. Net profit for 1994 should be about
Pounds 25m. Management has the dilemma of needing an acquisition, at a time
when competition is pushing up prices. Investors should defer judgment until
they see what the management can deliver.

FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Shirescot net asset value declines 5%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shires High-Yielding Smaller Companies Trust reported a fully diluted net
asset value of 139.4p per ordinary share as at June 30, a decline of some 5
per cent on the year end value of 146.3p.
The trust reported a 3.5 per cent fall in its total return for the six
months, outperforming the FT-SE-A All-Share Index, which dropped 11.3 per
cent over the same period but lagging the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies
Index, down just 1.7 per cent.
Some Pounds 7.1m of June's Pounds 10.8m placing and offer offer of C shares
had been invested by end-July.
Net revenue amounted to Pounds 406,000 (Pounds 388,000) for fully diluted
earnings of 2.79p (3.05p) per share.
A second interim dividend of 1.2p brings the total to date to 2.4p; the

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Redrow Group, the house-builder which came to the market earlier this year,
is to further extend its operations in the south of England with the
acquisition of the majority of the assets of Gudgeon Homes for Pounds 4.6m.
The deal will add some 200 plots to the land bank of Redrow Homes (South
East) and strengthen the company's regional presence established through the
acquisition of Costain Homes in July 1993.
The acquisition contains a large amount of work-in-progress at the
redevelopment of the former Royal Marine barracks at Eastney, near
Portsmouth. Further new sites at Portsmouth and Fareham are included in the
deal.
The schemes will have an overall development value of about Pounds 18m and
provide an immediate profit contribution. This will further utilise tax
losses available within Redrow Homes (South East).

FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Westminster Health Care shows sharp gain to
Pounds 11.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westminster Health Care, the nursing homes group, completed its first full
year as a listed company with pre-tax profits more than doubled at Pounds
11.2m, compared with Pounds 4.3m.
The results were at the top end of analysts' expectations and the shares
rose by 4 per cent to 338p.
The strong profits performance was fuelled by price increases, cost controls
and a Pounds 4m drop in net interest charges to Pounds 768,000 following the
flotation last year. Profits before interest and tax for the year to May 30
were 33 per cent higher at Pounds 12m, on sales ahead 36 per cent to Pounds
50.4m. Gross margins were stable at 32 per cent.
Mr Pat Carter, chief executive, was bullish about prospects for the current
year, which had started 'very encouragingly'. Westminster intended to step
up its nursing homes expansion programme and would begin to examine new
opportunities arising from changes in the health market.
Any expansion outside nursing homes would only be taken after a close study
of the group's skills, however, and have to be cash generative, Mr Carter
said.
Westminster intended to add some 1,000 beds a year for the foreseeable
future, he said. This compared with 704 last year, of which 26 per cent were
dedicated to the group's growing speciality business of caring for patients
with dementia.
Westminster finished the year with 3,947 beds.
Prices were increased by 6 per cent last year, partly due to new
developments in the more expensive market of south-eastern England.
Occupancy levels fell slightly from 93 per cent to 92 per cent as a result
of the implementation of the Community Care Act.
The final dividend is 2.75p, for a 4.5p total. This is 20 per cent higher
than the pro forma dividend included in the flotation prospectus. Earnings
rose by 46 per cent to 18.7p.
COMMENT
Westminster is careful to manage the balance between the lucrative and the
secure by mixing private and state-funded patients. The fruits of that
strategy are showing through and could bring interesting bonuses as the
health system contracts out tasks which could fit the group's skill profile.
Westminster's experiments with the Woodmill Hospital - virtually dedicated
to NHS patients seeking hip, knee or cataract operations - appear to be
paying off, but it is still early days. Fears of a rights issue to fund
expansion appear to be premature for the moment, although the group is
certain to come back to shareholders within the next two years. This should
only cause concern if the management story begins to unravel. Forecasts are
for Pounds 14.1m this year, for a prospective p/e of 15 times. The premium
rating appears to be well-deserved.

FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Flying Flowers leaps 89%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The acquisition of DPA Direct in March helped fuel growth at Jersey-based
Flying Flowers, which saw pre-tax profits jump 89 per cent from Pounds
312,000 to Pounds 589,000 in the six months to July 1.
DPA, which specialises in reader offers in the UK national press,
contributed Pounds 2.52m to group sales of Pounds 6.25m (Pounds 2.99m) while
its pre-tax profits of over Pounds 190,000 were more than it achieved in the
previous full year.
Mr Walter Goldsmith, chairman, said the acquisition was proving encouraging.
'DPA's strong relationship with certain national newspapers has produced
excellent results and we are exploring opportunities in database development
and other activities which will benefit all areas of the group,' he said.
He cautioned that the company, which joined the market a year ago, did not
expect the first-half growth rate to continue 'at quite the same level'.
However, with all divisions doing well, he looked forward to another
successful year.
A continuing healthy level of off-peak orders for postal packs more than
offset lower-than-expected order levels for Mothers' Day in the UK, which
this year was earlier than usual requiring orders to be received in February
rather than March.
In northern Europe, the introduction of a delivery facility had produced a
good response and an experimental service for Mothers' Day in France had
produced 'encouraging results'.
Half-year earnings per share rose from 1.54p to 2.36p; an interim dividend
to UK holders of 0.76p gross, net of Jersey tax, is declared.

FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Unlikely asset in search for income growth
 -John Gapper explains how banks' finance houses are assuming a new role,
helped by structural shifts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Midland Bank's 3m credit card customers were told last month that they
could lease a car for up to two years, and either return it at the end of
the period or buy it for an extra fee, they were being offered more than a
finance deal. It was a token of a significant change within their bank.
Although the offer was made by Midland, it was structured by Forward Trust,
the bank's finance house. It was the latest example of a Cinderella sector
within banks assuming a new role. The results of such initiatives will be
shown next Monday when Midland announces its half-year results.
Forward Trust is expected to follow the lead of other bank subsidiaries
which offer leasing and structured finance for personal customers and small
businesses to show healthy growth in profits and assets. As banks complain
of poor demand for other forms of loans, finance houses are growing in
importance.
Lombard North Central, National Westminster Bank's finance house, last week
disclosed a 59 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Pounds 111m for the first
half. This came after UDT, the motor finance house of TSB Group, reported
that a 32 per cent growth in new business had helped to double interim
pre-tax profits.
Such figures mark a turnaround for operations which caused headaches at the
turn of the decade. Lombard's profits on an Pounds 8bn book fell to just
Pounds 3m in 1991. The finance houses have not only recovered from past
problems, but now appear a valuable asset in banks' search for income
growth.
The problems of the finance houses at the turn of the decade were due to
three factors:
Broad-based finance houses involved in a range of operations, such as
Lombard and Forward Trust, were heavily exposed to the froth of the last
boom. They financed office equipment and plant leasing for smaller companies
in the south-east. This meant that bad debts rose sharply in the recession.
Finance houses tended to boost profits by mismatching assets and
liabilities, using short-term variable rate money to fund long-term fixed
rate assets. Interest rate rises in the late 1980s 'taught them they had to
be a lot more careful,' says Mr Graham Picken, Forward Trust chief
executive.
The finance houses tended to be poorly-managed and focused businesses, which
grew rapidly in the mid-1980s and allowed costs to escalate. Lombard has cut
its staff from 5,500 to 4,000, in a restructuring that split its business
into three operating sectors.
Not all finance houses survived such travails. Mercantile Credit, Barclays'
former finance house, was split in 1990 and the vehicle finance and personal
sector arms were sold to GE Capital.
A combination of asset re-pricing, cost-cutting and more cautious treasury
policy has since enabled the survivors to re-build on a sounder footing.
'There was some re-grouping, which meant that competitive pressures lessened
somewhat,' says Mr Brian Carte, chief executive of Lombard.
This should logically be a good time in the cycle for finance houses, since
they usually gain from small and medium-sized companies re-tooling for
expansion. 'Naturally, as the economy comes out of recession, we are
involved in forms of finance that go along with asset acquisition,' says Mr
Carte.
This effect can be seen clearly in motor finance, where the pent-up demand
is emerging in higher fleet sales. Finance houses which have partnerships
with big motor manufacturers have benefited. 'When the economy picks up, the
car market is the first to grow,' says Mr John Davies, managing director of
UDT.
Yet the finance houses' success cannot simply be ascribed to a cyclical
turn. Companies have been cautious about investing in new equipment, and
industry figures show only a modest growth in business finance and leasing.
Those involved say they are still straining to sell products.
Mr John Callender, managing director of Barclays Mercantile, the bank's
leasing arm, says companies are still cautious about taking on leases.
'Demand is flattish across the board, and companies are still talking about
demanding higher returns before they can invest,' he says.
However, finance houses appear to be gaining from some structural shifts.
One is manufacturers' use of point-of-sale finance. Customers have been
offered low and zero interest finance, where a finance house provides a
loan, and the manufacturer pays the interest subsidy.
Finance houses have started to build on this in the vehicle sector by
devising structured deals similar to Midland's where customers can pay off
the depreciation on cars rather than the capital sum.
'The more such deals are offered, the less banks can compete with straight
loans,' says Mr Davies.
Banks are happy to allow their own finance houses to offer such products,
providing they can achieve a viable return. Yet they are having to strive
harder to integrate the products that finance houses offer with the
mainstream loans, with which branch managers are more familiar.
At the moment, finance houses seem a useful asset for banks at a time when
demand for most assets is slack. But there are signs of narrowing margins as
the finance houses compete more strongly. 'We will probably see margins
easing because there is an over-supply in the industry,' says Mr Picken.

<TEXT>
Independent Newspapers, the Irish publishing group controlled by Mr Tony
O'Reilly, has lifted its stake in Argus Newspapers, the largest newspaper
group in South Africa, from 30.1 per cent to 34.98 per cent, the maximum
level permitted without triggering a full bid.
The additional 2.2m shares, taking Independent's stake to a total of 15.8m
shares, were bought for R25.8m (Pounds 4.5m), or R11.74 per share.
This brings the total investment in the Argus group by Independent
Newspapers to R181m since last July, when it bought its initial stake in a
share-swap deal with Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company and
Anglo-American Corporation.
Independent Newspapers is the largest single shareholder in Argus
Newspapers. The only other significant shareholder is the Argus pension
fund, which holds 10 per cent.
Mr James Parkinson, group finance director of Independent Newspapers, said
yesterday that a full bid for Argus Newspapers was not being contemplated.

FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Soap wars may affect Hickson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hickson International, the speciality chemicals group, yesterday warned it
could be dragged into the 'soap war' between Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble.
The group said the controversy had 'reduced the upside potential' of
PharmaChem, its detergent and chemicals subsidiary that supplies the
manganese bleach used in Unilever's new soap powder.
Procter &amp; Gamble has mounted a high-profile campaign against the so-called
accelerator, claiming it leaves some clothes holed and faded.
While admitting a possible short-term impact on PharmaChem, Sir Gordon
Jones, Hickson's chairman, said: 'It is not yet possible to evaluate the
extent to which this will constrain profit recovery in 1995.'
The group has a contract to supply Lever Brothers, the UK detergents
subsidiary of Unilever, until mid-1995. But analysts warned that the row
could hit orders.
Lever Brothers, however, said the ingredient would be used in its restyled
Surf and Radion brands, although no mention of the accelerator would be made
in adverts.
Shares in Hickson, meanwhile, fell 9p to 168p yesterday as the group
announced pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 virtually unchanged
at Pounds 12.1m on turnover ahead 5 per cent at Pounds 208.6m (Pounds
198.5m).
Profits at performance products, a core division which manufactures
agrochemicals, sulphur-based products and personal care ingredients, fell 20
per cent to Pounds 4.7m despite increased sales of Pounds 76.3m (Pounds
69m). The decline was due largely to difficulties at Kerley, the division's
US subsidiary, which was hit by low sulphur prices and over-capacity.
Pricing pressure in North America also affected the protection and coatings
business. It reported operating profits of Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 6.6m) on
sales of Pounds 81.8m (Pounds 82.1m).
Group operating profits, however, rose 9 per cent to Pounds 16.7m following
an improved performance at Fine Chemicals, including a full-year
contribution from PharmaChem. It helped lift divisional profits to Pounds
7.5m (Pounds 3.9m).
Earnings per share rose to 5.6p (4.8p) and the interim dividend is
maintained at 2.85p.
COMMENT
Hickson has prepared for the possibility of Unilever pulling the plug on its
acclerator product. Its PharmaChem plant can be used for other products, and
the group has devoted increased resources to improving coatings sales in
Europe and reducing its overcapacity at Kerley. Better divisional management
and reduced operating costs are also expected to help full-year profits
reach Pounds 23m. On a forward multiple of 16 the shares look demanding
enough given the uncertainty over PharmaChem.

FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: WPP defers research float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WPP, the marketing services company, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 36.2m for the half year to June 30 - up 50 per cent and in line with
expectations - and put the flotation of part of its market research business
onto the back burner.
In March WPP said the flotation, intended to help cut debt, was likely this
year and would yield up to Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m). The group had been
saying more recently that adverse market conditions meant that the timing
was being kept under review.
Yesterday the board said it was continuing to consider various forms of
financing and ways of strengthening the capital structure, but 'the
improvement in profitability and cashflow and the achievement of the group's
financial objectives so far this year has lessened the need to examine these
alternatives'.
Revenue fell by 1.3 per cent to Pounds 690.5m (Pounds 699.7m), mainly
because of disposals. However, on a like-for-like and constant currency
basis, revenues rose by more than 4 per cent. Operating margins improved
from 6.1 per cent to 7.3 per cent. Mr Martin Sorrell, chief executive, said
that margins were ahead of the group's financial objectives, but still below
the benchmark of 10 to 11 per cent achieved by WPP's best-performing
competitors.
Fully-diluted earnings per share rose to 2.6p (1.7p). An interim dividend of
0.385p (0.35p) is declared.
A statement on future prospects was cautious: the group said May and June
had been the best two consecutive months for two-and-a-half years, but
overall the first six months had been 'patchy and inconsistent'. The
uncertain pattern of activity 'may reflect tax increases on both sides of
the Atlantic and continued concern about job security among consumers and
management'. Plans, budgets and forecasts of revenues were being made on a
'conservative basis'.
Net debt averaged Pounds 280m in the first half, down 25 per cent from
Pounds 372m. The group benefited from a Pounds 85m rights issue in March
1993.
The beginning of next month will see the banks, which bailed WPP out two
years ago in a Dollars 271.6m debt-for-equity swap, free to sell their 190m
shares, which represent 26.5 per cent of the enlarged share capital.

FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;G to reveal new plans to share Pounds
1.8bn bid cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A revised scheme for sharing out the Pounds 1.8bn cash offered by Lloyds
Bank for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society will be announced today.
The agreed bid suffered a setback in June when the original scheme was found
by the High Court to be unlawful. The Building Societies Commission, the
sector's statutory regulator, had argued that it contravened the 1986
Building Societies Act. C&amp;G, the UK's sixth-largest society, had planned to
split the Pounds 1.8bn among its 1.4m borrowing and investing members, with
most receiving a minimum of Pounds 500 and a maximum of Pounds 10,000 per
investment account.
The Act does not allow cash payments to investing members of less than two
years' standing as a way of trying to prevent speculative flows of money
between societies on takeover rumours.
Since C&amp;G said last month that it did not intend to appeal against the
judgment, attention has focused on the setting of a new date at which the
two-year period starts, the most likely way of making the scheme lawful
while still attractive enough to achieve the high levels of member approval
needed.
Borrowers are unlikely to receive payments under the new scheme.
The Commission is expected today to say only that it will consider the new
scheme, but that will be taken as a sign that it does not intend to
challenge it in court.

FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: UES moves back into the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UES Holdings, the Rotherham-based engineering steels and forgings group in
which GKN has a 39.1 per cent stake, returned to profit in the second
quarter after its record Pounds 48.1m pre-tax loss for the full 1993 year.
For the first half, however, UES was still in the red, and Mr Don Ford,
chairman, said returns were still 'totally inadequate'.
GKN's share of a much reduced first-half net loss at UES was Pounds 1m,
compared with Pounds 2m for the first half of 1993 and Pounds 8m for the
whole of last year. British Steel owns the rest of the company.
External sales at UES rose slightly to about Pounds 300m. The trading profit
was not available, but UES is trading in the black, and Mr Ford said that
'by and large, we are on a better trend than at any time in the past two or
three years'.
Market conditions were improving and prices were continuing to rise slowly.
Recent rationalisation and cost reduction was continuing to pay off.
Steel demand was quite strong, helped by better conditions in the automotive
sector, which is a large user of engineering steel. UES is the dominant
producer of engineering steels in the UK, and Mr Ford said its domestic
market share had improved. Its forgings business had also done 'quite well'.

FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Union reverses to Pounds 0.79m deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union, the City discount house, yesterday recorded pre-tax losses of Pounds
793,000 for the first six months of this year. The result reversed its
return to profitability at the 1993 year end after two unprofitable years.
In particular, Union suffered trading losses of nearly Pounds 2m on its
holdings of long-term gilt-edged securities and has decided to withdraw from
running positions in those securities for its proprietary trading book.
'Having got it wrong for the best part of the first half of the year, we
have decided that this is a business we should not be in, at least for the
time being,' said Mr Ian Martin, managing director.
He added that while all discount houses were involved in similar risk-based
activities, Union's had been somewhat larger relative to its capital base.
However, those losses were offset partly by profits of more than Pounds 1m
in the group's traditional money market operations and newly developed
arbitrage activities, which would be expanded further.
'Although we anticipate a profitable second half, the overall performance of
the group will continue to be influenced by the underlying volatility of the
markets while Union remains in this period of transition,' Mr Robin Herbert,
chairman, said.
Union, which raised Pounds 11m in a 2-for-5 rights issue in March, said it
planned to diversify into financial services.
The interim dividend is restored via a 1.5p payment. The shares lost 8p to
128p.

FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: SCI given go-ahead in Great Southern battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Service Corporation International was yesterday assured of winning Great
Southern Group, the UK funeral company, when the Takeover Panel refused an
attempt to block its revised offer of 775p per share.
Loewen, the Canadian funeral group, was trying to prevent SCI from raising
its bid because the US company made a 'final' 680p offer which omitted a
standard clause allowing this to be raised in the event of competition.
The Panel decided this omission by SCI's advisers, led by Schroders, was
attributable to 'a genuine mistake, however regrettable that might be'.
Given these exceptional circumstances, the Panel judged that SCI should be
allowed dispensation from the rules. Loewen has been refused the right to
appeal the decision.
The decision drew some criticism for setting a precedent whereby a financial
adviser could benefit from a mistake through special pleading.
However, SCI agreed to recompense all shareholders who sold shares under the
misconception that the offer could not be increased. This made it awkward
for the Panel to block an offer so clearly in the interests of all
shareholders.
The decision will be a relief to Schroders, SCI's merchant bank, which might
have faced action from SCI had the bid failed due to the mistake.
Loewen had offered 690p cash, 10p higher than SCI's earlier bid. The Loewen
bid had a clause requiring 90 per cent approval for their offer - an
impossibility given SCI's 29.8 per cent holding - but they had given
assurances that this would be reduced.
The clock will now be reset for SCI's bid, but the outcome is now certain.
JD Field has given irrevocable assurances on behalf of its 56 per cent
holding of Great Southern's ordinary shares, so the US largest burial
company will now become the third largest UK funeral business.

FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Signet frees itself of Salisburys in Pounds
3m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Signet, the jewellery group formerly known as Ratners, is selling its
lossmaking Salisburys luggage and handbag chain for Pounds 3.18m to Mr
Stephen Hinchliffe, former chairman of James Wilkes and Lynx Holdings.
Signet is receiving Pounds 2.75m immediately in cash and Pounds 430,000
later relating to inter-company debt.
The jewellery group made a Pounds 87.1m provision in its full-year results
in May to cover the proposed disposal of the 174-store chain, including a
Pounds 10.8m write-down of the value of its assets to Pounds 3m.
Mr James McAdam, Signet chairman, said that despite efforts to turn it
around, Salisburys had incurred a Pounds 5.3m loss on sales of Pounds 54.4m.
Signet will keep an interest in a warehouse in Crawley, West Sussex, which
will require a provision of up to Pounds 1.5m to cover carrying and disposal
costs.
Mr Hinchliffe is funding the purchase himself and has formed a new company,
Salisburys Stores, to run the outlets.
'We can return to profits a lot faster than people imagine,' he said. 'There
is nothing wrong with the fabric of the business'.
Mr Hinchliffe has successfully restored a retailing business to
profitability before. In 1987 he joined a management buy-out at Wades
department stores from Associated Dairies, and later sold the company to
Waring &amp; Gillow.

FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Upton may take legal action over Reject buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Upton &amp; Southern, the department store group, said yesterday it was
considering legal action not only against some former directors of the
Reject Shop but also against its financial advisers.
Upton said on Tuesday that the financial and trading position of Reject
Shop, the household goods retailer it bought in February, was materially
worse than represented at the time of the deal. That news sent Upton's
shares plunging by 12p to 14p, and they fell a further 2p yesterday.
Upton is contesting the valuation of the Reject Shop's inventory stocks at
the time of the acquisition. It said yesterday that about one third of the
expected stock was found not to be there. 'We expected the cupboard to be
fairly empty but not bare,' it said.
Upton's lawyers, Nabarro Nathanson, and auditors Coopers &amp; Lybrand, are
studying a report by Mr Ian Steven, its finance director, to decide whether
to institute proceedings against 'certain former directors' of Reject Shop.
The company is also considering action against the Reject Shop's accountants
Stoy Hayward and stockbrokers Smith New Court. Smith New Court had no
comment yesterday.
Mr Jeffrey Gould, Upton's chief executive, declined to disclose how due
diligence was conducted before the deal or how the problem had arisen. 'Once
you get involved in the company and you understand it a lot more, these
things become more apparent to you, rather than on the outside.'
Upton said part of the difficulty lay in the need for confidentiality in
quoted company deals. In order to avoid market rumours information from the
other side had to be accepted. 'You're dealing with public companies, both
should be ethical and give true valuation.'
Mr Gould said he did not regret the purchase. The former Reject Shop stores
still represented 'an opportunity', but the less than expected value of
their stock had set back his turnround plans by six to seven months.
Upton bought Reject Shop in a Pounds 2.5m all-paper deal in March. This week
it said a cash shortage of about Pounds 2.75m had resulted from the worse
than anticipated financial and trading position.

FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Slimmer TDG advances to Pounds 17m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Transport Development Group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 17m for the six
months to end-June, compared with Pounds 3.5m in 1993, but exceptional items
masked sharply reduced profits from the core distribution division.
Profit margins from UK distribution almost halved to 4.4 per cent because of
increasing competition, the loss of some profitable contracts and the
non-recurrence of strong profits from its French drinks distribution arm.
Turnover fell 9 per cent from Pounds 277m to Pounds 251m, although the
decline from continuing operations was only 5.4 per cent. Operating profit
after interest was only marginally lower at Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 15.9m).
The results were distorted by the impact of business disposals and closures
during both years, as TDG restructured in the wake of an increasingly harsh
operating environment.
The company made a Pounds 1.31m exceptional profit at the interim stage,
which came from the sale of businesses in the UK, Australia and France. This
compared with a Pounds 12.3m exceptional loss in 1993.
TDG has completed its disposal programme with Pounds 29m of this reported in
the first half, which boosted profits by Pounds 350,000.
It has reduced gearing to 0.5 per cent, and is now looking for acquisition
opportunities. A further Pounds 12m of disposals will be recorded in the
second half.
The distribution division is putting emphasis on the 'saturated' industrial
market, where it has won significant new business. The company plans to
invest Pounds 17.5m this year to support this organic growth.
The hire division has performed more profitably, being an earlier
beneficiary of economic recovery. The group invested Pounds 8.5m in the
first half and plans to invest a similar amount in the second.
The transport division has been the focus of disposals of lossmaking
operations, and it saw a resultant turnround. However, storage declined,
because of the reduction of some of the European Commission's food
mountains.
Overall, the management said it was confident that its spread of businesses
'gives us a sound and broad base from which to move ahead steadily.'
TDG is paying an unchanged interim dividend of 3p, payable from earnings per
share of 7.62p (1.66p losses).
COMMENT
For what was considered a bellwether stock, TDG is having problems matching
the economic recovery. Its hire division has benefited from increased
industrial activity, but distribution remains bogged down by competition.
The second half will remain tough, and profits of about Pounds 34m are
expected, putting the shares on a p/e of 14.7. As gearing falls to zero,
thoughts are turning towards acquisitions, and investors would be wise to
see what management comes up with before backing a recovery, which still
appears some way hence.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Upsets dismissed as Standard Chartered rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Chartered, the UK-based international bank, insisted yesterday that
upsets in the Hong Kong securities market and its bullion trading arm
Mocatta had not affected profits and were unlikely to be repeated.
It said the incidents, which led to a ban on it underwriting new securities
issues in Hong Kong, and allegations that its staff bribed officials in the
Philippines and Malaysia, had come to light due to tightening of its
internal audit procedures.
The bank increased its interim dividend 20 per cent to 2.25p, against
1.875p, as it disclosed a rise in pre-tax profit for the first six months to
Pounds 237m, compared with Pounds 170m. Earnings per share rose to 14.7p
from 9.3p.
Mr Patrick Gillam, chairman, said that the ban on Hong Kong underwriting
until next April had 'no effect on these figures of any significance at all'
because the market in initial public offerings in the UK colony was going
through a lull.
Mr Gillam did not expect such incidents to occur again, although this could
not be guaranteed. 'I cannot say we will never find anything else. We employ
30,000 people in a lot of countries, and people are people.'
Loans and advances to customers were flat at Pounds 17.1bn, and Mr Malcolm
Williamson, chief executive, said Standard Chartered was running down assets
linked to commercial property in Hong Kong and other Asia-Pacific countries
because of the risk.
Profits in Hong Kong fell to Pounds 108m from Pounds 122m, partly due to a
20 per cent narrowing of its net interest margin. Mr Peter Wood, finance
director, said this had mostly been caused by it taking on some Dollars 2bn
(Pounds 1.2bn) in longer-term liabilities to match assets.
African profits rose to Pounds 18m from Pounds 5m, and growth in India
contributed to a Pounds 30m profit in the Middle East and south Asia,
compared with a Pounds 7m loss. Standard Chartered is appealing against a
Pounds 7.3m fine over its part in the Bombay securities trading scandal.
Income from foreign exchange and securities dealing fell marginally to
Pounds 103m from Pounds 104m. Net revenue rose to Pounds 812m from Pounds
779m, and expenses rose 7 per cent to Pounds 518m. Provisions for bad debts
fell to Pounds 69m from Pounds 128m.
The tier 1 capital ratio of shareholders' funds to assets weighted by risk
rose to 7 per cent from 5.4 per cent. Although this is at the top end of UK
bank ratios, Mr Gillam said it wanted to establish a record of retained
earnings.
The shares closed 16p down at 259p.

FT  11 AUG 94 / No longer the faithful followers of the family: Hugh Carnegy
finds Swedish institutions getting tough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The snub dealt this week by Swedish institutions to Charter, the UK
industrial group, over its bid for Esab, the world's leading supplier of
welding equipment, was a strong reminder that minority shareholders in
Sweden are no longer content to play the role of faithful followers to big
owners such as the Wallenberg family.
The rejection by five institutions of a Pounds 260m bid, recommended by the
Esab board, carried echoes of the shareholder revolt which last December
blocked the merger between Volvo and France's Renault - to date the most
spectacular flexing of Swedish institutional muscle.
This week it was the turn of the Wallenberg empire to suffer an
institutional rebuff - albeit a much less violent one. Esab has been
controlled by the Wallenbergs through the industrial group Incentive. In
June, Incentive accepted Charter's offer of SKr345 per share for its near 50
per cent stake with alacrity to help pay for its SKr8.4bn (Pounds 700m)
takeover of Cardo, an industrial investment offshoot of Volvo. But Esab's
share price then shot up, wiping out the 20 per cent premium in Charter's
offer.
When Esab's strong half-year results sent the share price even higher this
week, institutional shareholders decided the bid was underpriced. Incentive
and Charter, on the other hand, still insist that the offer is fair.
It was not the first time this year that institutions have held out against
Incentive. In June, three Cardo shareholders objected to the original terms
for the Incentive takeover of shares not held by Volvo and won a revision of
the bid.
A non-Swedish investment banker involved in the Volvo-Renault negotiations
says the days of 'sweetheart deals done in the sauna - and never mind the
other shareholders' are over. 'You have to demonstrate to shareholders that
you have done everything right.'
Analysts in Stockholm say the Wallenbergs have taken this on board. It would
no longer be possible to push through a deal like that in 1991, when they
shifted Incentive out of Asea, forcing minority shareholders to accept a
dilution of their stake in the half-owner of the Swedish-Swiss combine Asea
Brown Boveri.
In Charter's case, the UK company appears to have miscalculated the extent
to which Swedish institutions now defend their interests. Having reached
agreement with the Esab board and Incentive, Charter executives proclaimed
that the rising Esab share price - usually on low volumes - was nothing more
than a brazen attempt to squeeze more out of the bidder. When Mr Jeffrey
Herbert, Charter's chief executive, and colleagues arrived in Stockholm on
Tuesday, they were met by a series of public announcements of bid
rejections. This snookered Charter, which needed 90 per cent acceptances.
Undoubtedly, a perception among the shareholders that Charter was behaving
arrogantly did not help. This, and a trade union campaign portraying Charter
as an unwelcome foreign predator, was also reminiscent of the more
hysterical moments in the Volvo-Renault affair. The institutions insist
their objections lie simply in the bid price.
In the case of the Renault merger, the institutions did have strategic
objections to the plan to shift Volvo's core car and truck making operations
under the wing of a state-owned French company. 'Since then the
consciousness of the ownership role we play has risen substantially,' said a
senior institutional shareholder.
But the new-found assertiveness of the institutions has mainly applied to
deal terms, rather than seeking real influence over corporate strategy. The
power exercised by the Wallenbergs over their companies - often through less
than majority stakes - has not been seriously challenged.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Review sets the scene for cutting and dealing: Michael Smith
finds the Recs poised for a bout of change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regional electricity companies (Recs) in England and Wales are expected to
undergo a series of profound changes, with takeovers among the
possibilities, following publication today of the industry regulator's
pricing review.
Takeover talks and stake building could begin within weeks, according to
some analysts. The 12 Recs in England and Wales have a market value of about
Pounds 15bn, while their two Scottish counterparts - the review of which
will be completed later this year - total Pounds 4.6bn.
The review covers the distribution business, which provides the companies
withof their annual profits. While the regulator has been scrutinising the
sector, plans for change have often been put on hold. So whatever his
conclusions, the review's completion should trigger activity. The Recs are
likely to:
consider acquisitions to help transform them into more broadly based utility
groups;
make more job cuts and changes to working practices. Staff cuts of 10-25 per
cent have been common in the four years since privatisation; decide what to
do with the National Grid, the transmission company which they own. Valued
at Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn, it is expected to be floated on the London Stock
Exchange next spring.
Some of the companies will become bid targets. Their attractions include
their financial strength - most have net cash or low borrowings - and their
conservative accounting. New management might see the potential for reducing
tax charges and releasing provisions made for eventualities which may never
happen. Several companies, for example, put aside money years ago to cater
for the possible adverse effects of a European Court ruling on pensions.
Potential predators, or suitors, include overseas utilities groups and
UK-based conglomerates. However, it is also possible that some of the Recs
will get together voluntarily.
Some analysts believe Scottish Power and Northern Electric would make a good
fit. Others mentioned as potential takeover candidates tend to be the
smaller concerns such as Manweb, Seeboard, South Wales Electricity and South
Western Electricity.
Obstacles to deals are likely to include the unwillingness of managements to
give up their power bases. Since the City rates most of the companies
similarly, it is unlikely that one of the Recs will go for another without
prior agreement. Any contested bid is likely to come from outside.
The second obstacle is the government's ownership of a 'golden share' in
each company. This limits other stakes to a maximum of 15 per cent. However,
the government has shown flexibility in the past and, in any case, the
golden shares expire in the English and Welsh companies next March.
This puts pressure on the companies to reform from within. One way of
lessening attractions to a hostile bidder would be to unlock hidden value
before a predator points to it. Flotation of the National Grid is an obvious
example.
The Recs could also make themselves less digestible to some predators by
making large acquisitions.
Norweb and Yorkshire Electricity have already made overseas purchases. Other
companies are likely to tread cautiously, partly because of City wariness
about utility companies' diversification. For that reason the companies may
prefer to concentrate on improving internal efficiency.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Procter &amp; Gamble up 24% in quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, reported a 24 per cent
surge in underlying fourth-quarter profits, helped by a 7 per cent rise in
the volume of goods sold and lower costs.
Net earnings in the three months to June were Dollars 406m (Pounds 262m)
compared with an underlying Dollars 327m last time - though the figure
reported last year was a loss of Dollars 1.55m because of restructuring
charges.
Turnover was up 2 per cent at Dollars 7.5bn. The company said the rise would
have been 4 per cent but for shifts in exchange rates and lower pricing.
Earnings per share were 56 cents against last year's underlying 44 cents.
Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman and chief executive, said the results reflected
significant progress in cost reduction objectives, along with a unit volume
growth of 7 per cent worldwide.
For the year as a whole, net profits were affected by the Dollars 102m
charge taken in April to cover losses on an ill-fated foray into
derivatives.
This left net earnings at Dollars 2.21bn, or Dollars 2.91 a share. The
previous year, the company made net profits of Dollars 2.02bn, or Dollars
2.81 a share, before the restructuring charge.
'This was a good year, and if not for the derivatives loss, it would have
been a great year,' said Mr Artzt.

FT  11 AUG 94 / GKN upbeat after interim advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at GKN, the automotive components and defence engineering group,
rose 62 per cent to Pounds 97m in the first half of this year.
The strong profits rise, from Pounds 60m in the first half of 1993, came
despite a turnover increase of only 9 per cent to Pounds 1.52bn.
Sir David Lees, chairman, was upbeat about prospects for the full year. 'We
now expect that 1994 will turn out to be a much better year than was thought
likely at the end of 1993.'
Much of the improvement was due to cost-cutting and an upturn in several of
GKN's businesses. The advance was even more notable when Westland, the
recently acquired UK helicopter maker, was excluded. Without it, operating
profits rose 29 per cent while turnover increased only 3 per cent.
Margins improved in the automotive components business as manufacturing
costs were cut in Germany and the UK, and the continental European car
market started to recover. Sir David said the French and Spanish car markets
had been lifted by government tax incentives for new car purchases. The UK
and US car markets were continuing to recover, while the important German
market was still depressed. The company expects western European car
production to grow by 7 per cent this year.
GKN is still cutting costs and spent a further Pounds 10m on redundancy and
restructuring in the first half.
Production of the Warrior armoured vehicle fell as a contract for the
British Army neared completion. It should pick up later this year when GKN
starts manufacturing the Warrior for Kuwait. Profits in the automotive and
engineered products division, which includes defence, rose 29 per cent to
Pounds 62m.
Sir David said prospects for helicopter orders at Westland were good, with
the company's Apache model a strong contender to win the Pounds 2bn
competition for a new British Army attack helicopter. GKN is making
provisions after its acquisition of Westland which includes a Pounds 46m
write-down of stocks at Westland Aerospace and a Pounds 19m loss on
revaluation of Westland properties.
After strong cash inflows from the Pounds 190m settlement of Westland's
legal battle with the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation, the group had
net cash of Pounds 75.5m at the half year, including customer advance
payments.
Earnings per share rose 73 per cent to 16.6p (9.6p) and the interim dividend
is maintained at 8.0p. The shares closed 6p higher at 657p.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Further rises for Esab shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Esab yesterday rose further ahead of Charter's bid price amid
speculation that the UK industrial group would raise its offer. Esab B
shares rose SKr5 to SKr360. Senior Charter executives yesterday met Swedish
shareholders whose rejection of the offer has derailed the UK group's
intention to take complete control. 'There is still room for us to get a
better price and for them to get a good deal,' said one shareholder. The
deadline for the offer is Friday.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Greenspan urges broad view of monetary policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, warned yesterday that
central banks could not rely on any single rule or indicator in setting
monetary policy.
'What has become increasingly clear is that no simple guide would enable us
to put monetary policy on automatic pilot,' Mr Greenspan said in a
wide-ranging discussion of the difficulties of economic forecasting before
the House of Representatives government operations committee.
When asked whether he put more weight on financial indicators or on
statistics in gauging the real economy, Mr Greenspan answered: 'All of the
above.'
The Fed chairman's testimony was closely watched by financial analysts and
bond market traders, because it fell in the middle of the Treasury's
quarterly refunding operations and less than a week before a meeting of the
Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed body which sets monetary policy,
which is widely expected to raise short-term interest rates.
But Mr Greenspan's discussion of the shortcomings of the consumer price
index and the difficulties of conceptualising output proved too arid for
most in the market.
The Fed's approach to monetary policy might be 'closer to monotheism', Mr
Greenspan said, if its statute set it a single goal, such as price
stability. Instead, the Fed's founding statute lays out multiple goals,
including high employment and a stable financial system.
Mr Greenspan said it was regrettable that M2, one of the monetary aggregates
the Fed had traditionally used to measure the money supply, had 'veered off
quite significantly in recent years' and was no longer a very useful
indicator. He hoped that the structural changes in the economy which have
caused M2 to swing wildly would end at some point and allow M2 to
re-establish itself as a predictor of economic activity.
Bronwen Maddox in New York adds: Senior US regulators are considering new
requirements on banks to disclose regularly their exposure to risky
financial instruments such as derivatives.
Regulators have been searching for ways to improve disclosure of banks'
exposure.
The proprietary trading desks of some banks were among heavy traders of
highly leveraged financial instruments last autumn, and were hit hard by the
rise in US interest rates on February 4 and the subsequent fall in markets.
Regulators are considering asking banks to report their exposure quarterly
or even monthly to enable investors and counterparties in trades to assess a
bank's risk.

FT  11 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Standard Chartered
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's interim results from Standard Chartered will come as something
of a shock to investors who have grown used to thinking of it as a
high-growth, high-risk stock. Standard has been making commendable efforts
to reduce risk in its balance sheet, but the cost appears to have been
considerable in terms of growth. Operating profit in Hong Kong actually
fell. Across the Asian region as a whole, operating return on gross assets
fell by 10 basis points. The market will need time to be convinced that
risks have been reduced, especially while the  - admittedly non-financial -
echoes of Mocatta and the Hong Kong authorities' censure continue to
reverberate. The danger meanwhile is that Standard will appear a high-risk
low-growth enterprise. Hence yesterday's 6 per cent fall in its share price.
Standard itself has a number of explanations for its Hong Kong result.
Dealing profits were down; the bank was bidding up for deposits to secure
funding beyond 1997; it was pulling back from riskier types of lending, for
example in property. If one strips out merchant banking activities,
operating profits in the territory were strongly ahead. The trouble is that
none of this is quantified. The suspicion that banking margins are coming
under pressure in Hong Kong also took its toll on HSBC yesterday.
Given its strong retail franchise in Asia's newly affluent markets,
Standard's longer-term growth prospects ought to be good. Its strategy will
be more convincing, however, if it can quickly show an ability to generate
income growth from the more secure base which it claims to have created. It
cannot rely much longer on falling bad debt provisions to boost earnings
growth.

FT  11 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: WPP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The second coming of WPP has been far more striking than that of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi, its great advertising rival. From a low point of Pounds 18m at the
end of 1991, WPP's market capitalisation has risen to Pounds 640m. With its
share capital due to be increased by 26 per cent next month - as the banks
which were left holding preference shares two years ago convert into equity
 -that valuation will rise further. Although the placing could be a drag on
the share price through the autumn, WPP could end the year with a market
capitalisation twice that of Saatchi.
Shareholders who suffered massive dilution as part of the financial
restructuring will not be celebrating.
But fund managers who thought they had seen the last of Mr Martin Sorrell's
media conglomerate will have to decide whether to use the share placing as a
means of climbing aboard. Judging by yesterday's figures, the foundations
for a solid period of earnings growth are in place.
Revenue growth of around 4.5 per cent is unspectacular but well up with
industry averages, in contrast to Saatchi. The target of 10 per cent
operating margins - from 7.3 per cent now - looks within reach.
The group's Pounds 280m debt burden also looks less threatening now cash
flow is improving and earn-out commitments are tailing off. Plans to float a
minority interest in the market research side have been shelved as a result.
If WPP can work off more debt and negotiate a better deal on the remainder -
it is currently paying the banks a whopping 2 per cent margin over interbank
rates - earnings will benefit further. With a sensible capital structure and
tight control of costs, advertising need not be the boom-to-bust business of
old.

Investors must clearly learn not to take at face value a company's
recommendation of a bid. When the board of William Low recommended Tesco's
initial offer, it did so in the hope that it would start an auction. The
board of Scholes also found themselves in a corner last month and decided
that only by recommending Hanson's offer could they provide shareholders
with all the facts they needed to make a sensible decision. Scholes cannot
withdraw its recommendation and still describes Hanson's price as fair. But
it has now made it clear that it would be in the company's best interests to
switch technology partners to Felten &amp; Guilleaume rather than stay with ABB
as under the Hanson terms. Its figures have also shown the scope for further
profit recovery once sales turn, which may just tempt other bidders into the
ring. Scholes' version of events directs no criticism at Hanson but its
difficult relations with ABB are a reminder of how fraught relations between
big companies and small ones can sometimes be.

FT  11 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: GKN drives forward
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market had a long hard look at GKN's shiny new figures and could find
hardly a blemish. Even the huge writedown of Westland's assets raised barely
a murmur. Not merely was the 62 per cent bounce in profits well above
expectations; virtually all areas of the business are moving strongly in the
right direction. Even UES is back in the black. Moreover, the improvement
accelerated in the second quarter with volume growth returning to the
automotive components business and the resulting surge in profit showing the
value of tough cost-cutting in Europe. GKN also increased its share of its
main automotive markets and is optimistic that the trend will continue. As
pressure on the major manufacturers lifts, they may find it easier to follow
Fiat's example and outsource to GKN all their constant velocity driveshafts.
True, GKN has had some luck, not least with Westland which following the AOI
settlement must rate as a real bargain. But maybe after the years of hard
graft, the company and its shareholders deserve the odd break. The shares
have risen nearly 150 per cent since December 1991 and the former high-yield
stock is now paying out just 3.9 per cent. Those who argue the shares are
still cheap point to forecasts that GKN's earnings could reach up to 100p
over the next few years. At the very least, though, that would require all
its markets to peak at the same time.
With the US car market already showing signs of slowing, that appears
unlikely. But investors are now being forced to take a long-term view - a
rating of about 15 times next year's likely earnings is pretty demanding
even for a company in GKN's commanding position.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Builders reluctant to hire jobless staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers are very reluctant to hire professional and managerial staff
unless they have a job already, says a leading construction industry survey
published today.
It will make depressing reading for middle-ranking executives who lost their
jobs during the recession and are hoping to return to work as the economy
slowly recovers.
Montrose Technical Recruitment, the industry's biggest recruitment agency,
said that 93 per cent of construction employers 'would rather appoint
candidates who are currently employed elsewhere even though the recession
has forced redundancy upon many through no fault of their own'.
Many companies are prepared to wait for staff to serve notice rather than
hire an unemployed person with no recent experience.
Employers said jobless managers and professionals would have a better chance
of being re-employed if they could show that they had been prepared to take
a lower grade job such as labouring - one employer even suggested busking -
rather than remain out of work. Some said unemployed job seekers should
'offer to work for no pay to get back into the job market'.
Mr Robert Smith, Montrose managing director, said employers preferred to
take on managers with recent experience, even though salaries were rising in
the industry because there was a shortage of experienced staff.
More than 500,000 jobs are estimated to have been lost from the construction
industry since 1989, according to employers. Montrose has filled more than
18,000 labouring, managerial and professional jobs in the past 12 months.
Of the 75 employers questioned by the agency, more than half said being made
compulsorily redundant could make it even more difficult for an applicant.
'Jobless applicants have to show extra initiative and commitment to give
themselves an equal chance with those who have held down a job throughout
the recession, even though salaries and demand for staff are growing again,'
Mr Smith said.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Surrender values of endowment mortgages criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most people taking out endowment mortgages are significantly worse off than
those taking out repayment mortgages if they surrender the policies in the
first five years, according to a survey by the Office of Fair Trading.
The figures will give fresh impetus to the OFT's campaign for a
self-regulatory requirement for lenders to offer the most suitable advice to
customers.
The campaign was revived last year by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general
of fair trading, but the revised code of banking practice published in
February did not address the issue.
Banks and building societies receive commission from life insurance
companies for selling endowment mortgages rather than ones that simply repay
the loan at the end of the term.
With an endowment, the monthly charge is split between an interest payment
to the lender, and a premium to a life company which invests the money and
also provides life insurance. At the end of the term, the endowment is
supposed to cover the loan and provide an additional lump sum.
The OFT survey, due to be published this autumn, is expected to show that if
an endowment is surrendered at the end of the first year, someone paying
Pounds 100 a month for a policy would on average be Pounds 600-Pounds 800
worse off than if they had taken out a repayment mortgage.
If the surrender occurred at the end of the fifth year, then the relative
disadvantage would be Pounds 1,600-Pounds 1,800 on average. In the worst
cases the disadvantage can be almost twice the average.
Among the policies examined, only one company is thought to have offered an
endowment that gives a better deal than a repayment if it is surrendered in
the first five years. Figures from one lender are said to suggest that about
one-third of endowment policies are surrendered in the first four to five
years.
The report on mortgage surrender values will make it harder for lenders to
ignore the calls for some form of 'best advice' requirement, especially as
it will be followed with further work on the subject early next year.
Last month, the Council of Mortgage Lenders raised the prospect of
introducing a voluntary code of practice. This would include sending a
'reason why' to a borrower, setting out the type of mortgage and explaining
why it was appropriate.
In June the OFT published figures on life company savings plans. Sir Bryan
said the life industry should now have 'a bit of time to settle down' after
significant regulatory changes.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Fewer bangs for less bucks: The US defence industry is
restructuring in response to deep cuts in weapons procurement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a 'bottom up review' of US defence requirements last year, Mr Les
Aspin, the then secretary of defence, invited industry bosses to the
Pentagon. He explained that, despite the recent slimming by defence
companies, the industry was still too big for Pentagon orders to prop up.
Defence companies would have no choice but to retrench and consolidate
further. As the industry chief executives headed for the door, they turned
to each other and said with one voice: 'Well, I guess you guys really have a
problem.'
There is no doubt that the US defence industry faces a testing time. In the
past decade the defence budget has been cut by a third in real terms from
Dollars 401bn to Dollars 269bn, and the number of military personnel will
have fallen from 2m in 1985 to 1.5m by 1997. But the cut in weapons
procurement, and hence the impact on companies, has been even more
significant.
From the peak of the Reagan arms build-up in 1985, the US budget for weapons
purchases is almost two-thirds lower in real terms, down from Dollars 132bn
to Dollars 48bn. In 1985, the US bought more than 31,000 new missiles, this
year it will buy fewer than 2,500. The continually rising price of military
technology has added an extra turn of the screw. In 1975, a slack period of
defence spending following the end of the Vietnam war, the Pentagon could
still afford to buy 293 fixed-wing combat aircraft. Next year it will get
just 28.
Companies have had to respond rapidly to the constraints. At McDonnell
Douglas, the company which makes the F/A-18 and F-15 fighters as well as the
C-17 transport aircraft and commercial airliners, the workforce has almost
halved in four years from 133,000 to 66,000. Most other large defence
companies have made similar cuts. According to Bankers Trust, a US bank,
employment in the industry has fallen from 1.35m in 1990 to 800,000 now and
may hit 600,000 within three years.
To combat the squeeze, companies have also been buying and selling
subsidiaries in an effort to cut the number of aircraft, electronics and
missile manufacturers. Yet as the meeting at the Pentagon suggested, most
chief executives think their companies will survive, and most want to
increase their presence rather than shrink it.
This bias is reflected in the pattern of transactions since the end of the
cold war in 1989. Several of the deals, such as IBM's sale of its defence
computing business to Loral, and General Electric's sale of its aerospace
division to Martin Marietta, have been of predominantly non-defence
companies deciding to leave a difficult market to the specialists.
Of those running companies predominantly in defence, only Mr William Anders,
chairman of General Dynamics between 1991 and 1993, has so far taken the
strategic decision to quit the field. He sold his F-16 fighter plant to
aerospace company Lockheed, his missile business to missile specialists
Hughes Aircraft, his space launch business to Martin Marietta, and his
non-military aircraft business to Textron. General Dynamics is left with
only its tanks and submarines operations, where it is the sole US
manufacturer, and which Mr Anders said last year he 'probably could not sell
even if I wanted to'.
Other large defence companies, most notably Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas and
Martin Marietta, are probably big enough and have a sufficient backlog of
orders to be sure of remaining in the defence business. They can afford to
wait for the right buying opportunities. Mr Daniel Tellup, chairman of
Lockheed, says: 'There is much more consolidation ahead. Everyone is looking
at everyone else, and we will have to be opportunistic.'
Pressure is most acute for small and medium-sized companies with weak
finances and products that are nearing the end of their production runs.
Northrop has made the B-2 stealth bomber since the late 1980s, but as each
aircraft cost more than Dollars 850m, production was stopped at 20 last
year, though efforts are being made to restart the programme. Aircraft maker
Grumman was also short of current products and the two merged earlier this
year. Mr Kent Kresa, chairman of Northrop Grumman, says: 'Most people have
so far perceived themselves as buyers, yet as the options narrow some will
be forced to become sellers.' His merged company hopes to mitigate the
misery by reducing central overhead costs, and draw on its stealth
technology - which makes aircraft hard to see with radar - for the next
generation of weapons.
Mr Tellup thinks that over the next 10 years the US will be down to two
military aircraft manufacturers, two space and missiles companies and two
big electronics groups with a smaller number of component suppliers. Since,
for example, McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed, Boeing and Northrop Grumman all
still make aircraft, that implies some painful decisions to come.
Such a radical concentration has also raised fears that the US Federal Trade
Commission or Justice Department may try to block mergers on antitrust
grounds. Many in the industry think that the idea of a fully competitive
market in weapons procurement is alien when there is only one buyer, the US
government, and a couple of sellers, locked together in 30-year projects.
Most regard fully competitive tendering for large weapons systems as a
luxury the US can no longer afford. Mr Wolfgang Demisch, defence expert with
Bankers Trust, says: 'The US has already taken the emotional decision that
it is prepared to accept monopolies. We have a monopoly in tanks, in
submarines and in strategic bombers. Now the combat aircraft business is
imploding rapidly. We are simply not prepared to carry the cost of propping
up artificial competition.'
Fortunately, however, boiling down the bones of defence contracts is not the
only option open to the industry, and many hard-pressed companies are hoping
for overseas sales to maintain production. Yet here too defence budgets are
being cut, and the international market is becoming increasingly
competitive. Buying effective weapons from strong political allies may still
be a priority for purchasing governments such as Gulf states, but value for
money now counts too.
That can leave US companies at a disadvantage. Their equipment often
incorporates the highest technology and is correspondingly expensive. The US
industry is also tooled up for long production runs, so as volumes have
shrunk in recent years its huge research and development costs have had to
be spread over smaller numbers. As a result, unit prices for US equipment
have risen compared with their competitors.
Rising prices not only hurt potential sales abroad, at home they threaten to
price the most sophisticated weapons out of existence - as they have with
the B-2 bomber. 'We have to learn to cut fixed costs and do research more
economically,' says a defence executive. 'The escalating price of the B-2
marked the point where the US could no longer afford to buy bombers, and we
cannot let that happen to other weapons systems.'
The industry is making an effort to cut fixed costs, as the heavy
redundancies show. Yet some companies are reaching the point where they
cannot cut further and still retain the capability to build complex systems
such as fighters or nuclear submarines. In certain cases, the US government
has accepted the strategic case for retaining some central technologies. It
will almost certainly order a Dollars 2bn Seawolf submarine from General
Dynamics which the navy neither wants nor needs, simply to keep the Groton,
Connecticut, yard going into the next century.
More innovative ideas are also being tried. McDonnell Douglas has
established a 'Phantom Works' advanced engineering laboratory, along the
lines of Lockheed's longstanding 'Skunk Works'. The Phantom Works is
experimenting with production techniques which could revolutionise aircraft
manufacture and cut the tooling cost of setting up a production line. The
aim is to cut the fixed cost of any operation so that high-tech systems can
be manufactured economically in small numbers. Computer-controlled
high-speed cutting, for example, allows complex parts to be machined from a
single piece of metal at a quarter of the cost of traditional methods.
Cheap, disposable moulds for composite materials can be aligned using lasers
and 'software tools' to do away with the expensive metal tooling which the
industry usually relies on to assemble aircraft.
Lockheed too has proved the worth of advanced engineering in small
production runs. The company made the F-117 stealth fighter at its Skunk
Works in conditions of great secrecy during the early 1980s. Despite the
fact that only 59 were built, Lockheed managed to keep the cost below
Dollars 45m per aircraft. 'Some overseas companies are gambling that the US
will not become a cost-effective manufacturer for export,' says one insider.
'I wouldn't bet my business on that.'
While the F-117 project gained from advanced techniques, it also had the
huge advantage of a trouble-free (and secret) passage through the
congressional procurement mill. As companies are cutting costs to help
themselves, and getting some orders from the government to ease the
contraction pains, they still have to navigate the cumbersome US budget
process each year. This is the single biggest factor limiting the
competitiveness of the US defence industry.
Since procurement works on a system of annual budgets, every development or
manufacturing programme is up for debate every year, regardless of how far
it has progressed. As a result, the development or manufacture of any system
can be stopped or started at any time, and often for political reasons, such
as protecting jobs, which have little to do with military need. Companies do
not help their case, however, by lobbying congressmen to support their
programmes and undermine those of rivals.
Horror stories about the budget process and procurement abound. Mr Norman
Augustine, chairman of Martin Marietta, tells one about an incident where 30
companies working in three teams had responded to a government invitation to
bid on a contract, only to be told 24 hours before the bids were due that
the government had changed its mind and no bids would be accepted. The
companies had spent more than two years and Dollars 100m on their proposals
and had to drop them.
The current secretary of defence, Mr William Perry, is committed to
reforming procurement. However, his efforts are mainly aimed at simplifying
the labyrinthine contracts between the Pentagon and defence groups. Most
industrialists think this is a useful reform, but that it does not attack
the worst problem: congressional interference.
Some projects - notably the controversially expensive C-17 transport
aircraft - have been stopped for years in the development phase and then
restarted. Others, such as the F-22 fighter aircraft, have slipped behind
their original development and production schedules. Both cause huge
disruption to the companies and, because the Pentagon requires detailed
budgets at all times, involve large amounts of management time.
'What the Congress does not seen to realise,' says one exasperated
executive, 'is that you are not simply altering one thing by stretching a
programme out. Thousands of other decisions are dependent on timing and we
have to rework all of them. In the end that just adds to the cost which the
US government has to pay.'
With Congress determined not to limit its freedom of action to decide
federal spending, the horse trading at the annual budget is unlikely to
change. Congress seems prepared to accept that some weapons systems, such as
the B-2 bomber and potentially the C-17 transport aircraft, can be priced
out of production by a mix of botched development at the companies involved
and politics.
As the economic pressure for consolidation into a few global defence
companies increases, the US is still best placed to lead. US companies
operate in a unified defence market twice the size of that in Europe. They
can consolidate more easily than their European counterparts. They have the
technological edge.
Yet unless the industry can engineer more consistency and less political
manoeuvring into its planning, it may not be able to take full advantage of
its strong position. As Mr Demisch of Bankers Trust puts it: 'Overseas arms
manufacturers are fortunate indeed that the US procurement process is not
yet as well organised as it should be.'

<TEXT>
Is Sir Michael Edwardes beginning to make a habit of this sort of thing? If
Charter, the industrial group of which he is chairman, has to walk away from
its Pounds 260m bid for Esab of Sweden, despite having 53 per cent of the
target already in the bag, Edwardes will have been there before.
Five years ago Sir Michael, as deputy chairman, was leading Minorco's Pounds
3.5bn bid for Consolidated Gold Fields. Minorco had bought shares and won
acceptances that added up to more than 50 per cent of Gold Fields. But it
had to admit defeat because the whole business became mired in US litigation
and could not meet deadlines imposed by the UK Takeover Code.
On that occasion a New York judge proved to be the insuperable barrier. This
time it is a few big institutional shareholders in Esab who are causing all
the trouble.
But the common thread, some would suggest, is that, had Edwardes offered a
little more, he would have sailed through without opposition.

Two different worlds. A fortnight ago, water industry regulator Ian Byatt
was unveiling new and highly market-sensitive price controls for the water
companies. Today Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator,
will perform the same task for electricity companies in England and Wales.
In both cases, the companies were advised of the results 24 hours before
they were released to the market. In the case of water, not a single detail
seeped out, and Byatt was able to reveal all to a waiting world.
No such luck for Littlechild; the stock market has been certain for days
what he is up to. By yesterday, dealing rooms were abuzz with the details,
and excerpts from the report were even doing the rounds.
Maybe it's just that electricity executives are bigger gossips than their
water colleagues. But another difference is that Byatt held a special
briefing session for stock analysts. Littlechild declined to do so - which
did not please the scribblers . . .

Has Brenda Dean, a working Labour peer who used to run the Sogat printing
union, given up all hope of political office, or is she the shape of things
to come?
The question is prompted by her appearance on the board of Chamberlain
Phipps, the shoe company which is just about to get its shares listed on the
stock market. A few months ago she went on the board of Inveresk, the
Scottish paper company.
In Labour's good old days it would have been heresy for her to be seen
mixing with the bosses. Admittedly, she is no longer a working trade
unionist, but she seems to be much more comfortable in accepting positions
around the boardroom table than most of her fellow Labour peers.
Former Labour chancellor of the exchequer Lord Healey, for example, probably
could have had a clutch of well-paid non-executive directorships if he'd
wanted.
That Baroness Dean is prepared to tread where the likes of Lord Healey would
not may say something about the way Tony Blair's new-look Labour party is
cosying up to big business.
Then again, it is hard to see the likes of Jimmy Knapp, the RMT boss, ever
taking a retirement job on the board of ScotRail.

The pressure is on Mike Atherton, England's beleaguered captain of cricket.
Just when he might have hoped that the hullabaloo over his involvement in
this summer's cause celebre - the case of the tampered ball - was over, US
newshounds have picked up the scent.
Sports Illustrated, the bible of the US sporting fraternity, has decided to
add Atherton to its roll call of fallen sports stars around the world.
Although the sports weekly does not normally show much interest in cricket,
when it comes to ball-tampering US baseball players lead the world.
However, Sports Illustrated's attempt to get to the bottom of the Atherton
case has been hampered by a certain unfamiliarity with cricket. It was on
target with its description of the English cricket team as 'woebegone', but
erred in calling captain Atherton the team's 'best bowler'. Then again,
judging by England's recent attack, the man from Sports Illustrated might
not be far wrong.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Ratifying EU agreements
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union is in a mess over ratification of its international
agreements. This week the European Court of Justice has ruled that an
antitrust agreement between the European Commission and the US government is
void. More seriously, there is disagreement over how to ratify the Uruguay
Round. The EU must find a way of resolving these disputes in ways that allow
it to play its role on the global stage.
Underlying both controversies are the vexed issues of EU-versus-member-state
competence, and member-state suspicion of the Commission's ambitions. Nobody
doubts the need to ratify the Uruguay Round agreement. The question rather
is how. But if it is not answered sufficiently swiftly, ratification may be
delayed until next year. In that case, the EU might not be a founder member
of the World Trade Organisation. Worse, delay on this side of the Atlantic
might encourage delay on the other, increasing the risk that the whole
process will go awry.
The Commission argues that it should be possible to ratify the Uruguay
agreement under article 228 of the Maastricht treaty. Parliament will then
have powers, similar to those of the US Congress, to vote yea or nay on the
package. Parliament's new role, however distasteful to some, has not been
challenged by member states. Nor do they seem to have a basis for doing so.
It is also agreed between the Commission and member states that, whatever
the technical requirements, ratification should be unanimous. In some cases,
this will require consent by national parliaments.
Divisive issue
The divisive issue is what other treaty articles should provide the basis
for ratification. The Commission argues for Article 113 alone, which gives
it sole negotiating power under the common commercial policy. But member
states insist that the Uruguay Round covers articles in the treaty where
competence is divided between the EU and member states. Those other articles
relate, in particular, to services, transport and intellectual property.
As yet, the member states have reached no consensus on which legal basis to
adopt. But the Commission has already asked the Court of Justice for a
ruling on the question, arguing that this is vital not so much for
ratification, as for the EU's subsequent role within the WTO. If there were
no assignment of competence to the EU, argues the Commission, it would be
unable to negotiate effectively. This would create disorder within the WTO
and frustration among the EU's trading partners.
Against this, member states insist that the EU lacks not just the exclusive
competence claimed by the Commission, but still more such competence in new
areas on the WTO agenda, like labour standards and the environment. Divided
competence is inescapable. The solution is to make it possible for the EU to
negotiate effectively, without the member states conceding powers it lacks.
Compromise required
A compromise is required, not least because the Court is unlikely to reach
its decision before November. Member states are proposing a code of conduct
that would govern negotiations in areas of divided competence. The code
would grant the Commission its role as sole negotiator on matters covered by
the WTO. Such a code of conduct could be agreed as early as September.
Thereupon, the Commission should withdraw its application to the Court. The
question of the legal allocation of competence in controversial areas should
then be left to member states at the inter-governmental conference due in
1996.
The Commission cannot claim sole EU competence for all matters that might
fall under the WTO. What it can - indeed must - insist upon is the power to
negotiate effectively. Member states now blame the Commission for the delay
in ratification. This is somewhat unfair, since the issue of competence is
important. But it must not be resolved legalistically. The powers granted to
the Commission under Article 113 are sweeping, while the areas covered by
the WTO are sensitive. To insist that all of the latter already fall under
the former is bound to exacerbate suspicion of the Commission. What is
needed is an operationally effective compromise - and early ratification of
the Uruguay Round. The German presidency should do everything it can to
achieve both.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Making sanctions work in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sanctions can work. They played a part in convincing white South Africans
that apartheid was not a tenable long-term solution for their country; and
President Milosevic would not even be pretending to apply them to the
Bosnian Serbs unless he were seriously anxious to get them lifted from
Serbia. In Iraq, sanctions are clearly 'biting'. Western visitors report a
bleak economic picture, with minimal activity and no hope of change.
Moreover, Iraq has complied, to a surprising extent, with the conditions
imposed on it by the UN Security Council, including acceptance of long-term
monitoring of its nuclear and chemical disarmament.
With Iraq, as with Serbia, the question arises whether compliance should be
rewarded by a partial lifting of sanctions. For the moment there seems to be
a consensus among the five permanent Security Council members that lifting
the sanctions now would be 'premature'. All agree that Iraq must accept
Resolution 833, demarcating the Iraq-Kuwait border, and co-operate in
investigating the disappearance of Kuwaiti subjects on Iraqi territory, in
addition to concessions it has already made.
But whereas France and Russia might be satisfied with this, and advocate
setting a fixed timetable after which the council should consider allowing
Iraq to resume oil sales, the US and UK have a longer list of demands,
including an end to human rights violations and to alleged sponsorship of
assassinations. They fear that to set a fixed period would fatally undermine
the sanctions by encouraging both Iraqis and foreigners to assume that they
are being phased out.
Undoubted hardship
There is no humanitarian argument for lifting sanctions on Iraq. The
undoubted hardship suffered by the Iraqi people is caused not by sanctions
(which specifically exempt food and medicine) but by Saddam Hussein's
refusal to sell oil under the terms of Resolution 706, which would place the
proceeds in an escrow account and spend part of them on humanitarian relief
in Iraq under UN supervision. To let him sell oil and use the proceeds at
his discretion would be the opposite of humanitarian: it would increase his
ability to oppress the people of Iraq and to undermine the liberated area in
the north with car bombs and other forms of sabotage.
The strongest pressure for lifting sanctions comes from Iraq's neighbours,
notably Turkey and Jordan. They have a case in that sanctions bear much more
heavily on them than on the members of the Security Council. This is true
also of Yugoslavia's neighbours. Article 50 of the UN Charter provides for
states 'confronted with special economic problems' arising from measures
taken against another state to 'consult the Security Council with regard to
a solution of those problems'. The council needs to respond much more
imaginatively if it wishes to maintain sanctions long enough for them to
work.
Broader strategy
Here as elsewhere, though, sanctions can only work as part of a broader
strategy. The lack of such a strategy is made painfully obvious in the Iraqi
case by the fact that sanctions are being applied not only to the area under
Saddam's control but also to the north from which western powers have
obliged him to withdraw. The argument is that to treat different parts of
Iraq differently would infringe its territorial integrity, by giving de
facto recognition to a separate Kurdish state. But there is a way out of
this, which is to give support to the Iraqi National Congress (INC). This
body represents Iraqis from all parts of the country, and aspires to
liberate Iraq as a whole. It has established a temporary base in the north,
and its authority has been strengthened by its mediation between the Kurdish
parties during their recent clashes.
Last year King Fahd of Saudi Arabia urged the INC leaders to proclaim a
provisional government in the area they control. It is a suggestion they can
only take up with western support, but that support should be forthcoming.
So long as it is withheld, the impression persists that the west does not
really wish to see Saddam replaced, and that sanctions are intended not to
drive him from office but to punish the Iraqi people as a whole.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Cereal story with a wholesome ending: UK farmers have not
gone organic, but are profiting from going green
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unusual phenomenon has occurred across the UK's farmland this summer  - a
scattering of poppies has appeared amid the regimented rows of golden wheat.
The poppies would normally be wiped out by liberal doses of herbicide, but
this year they are evidence of a trend by European farmers towards
curtailing the use of chemicals.
'There's a growing mood that we don't mind seeing the odd weed or two amid
our cereals - a few years ago that would be a matter of shame,' one producer
commented.
The change has been brought about partly by public demands for farmers to be
more environmentally sensitive and reduce their use of pesticides,
herbicides and artificial fertilisers. The trend has been strengthened by
the pressure on farmers to cut costs, as European Union subsidies are
reduced under reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.
As well as cutting subsidies, the CAP reforms are designed to give financial
incentives to farmers who adopt measures to safeguard the environment.
Already some payments under the CAP depend on farmers taking action such as
limiting grazing in environmentally fragile areas.
While only 5 per cent of CAP payouts currently depend on meeting
environmental standards, a further 'greening' of EU agriculture policy seems
likely. Mr Rene Steichen, farm commissioner, is among those wanting change:
'Environmentally compatible production methods should be introduced as
quickly as possible into general practice,' he said recently.
In the UK, some large producers and environmentalists have joined forces to
lobby for changes to the CAP, to bring it more into line with
environmentally friendly methods of farming. The Gay Hussar group, named
after the London restaurant where it first met, was officially launched last
month at the Royal Show, organised by the Royal Agricultural Society of
England, in Stoneleigh, Warwickshire.
Many farmers in the group advocate a concept called 'sustainable farming',
which encourages producers to cut their use of agrochemicals - but not
eliminate their use completely as in 'organic' production.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, before she moved from agriculture minister to
education secretary last month, was keen to encourage sustainable methods -
a system under which, she said, 'crops must be profitable, meet the needs of
consumers and the environment and conserve the soil'.
Under such a system, farmers cut their use of weedkillers, artificial
fertilisers and pesticides and, as a consequence, suffer a small drop in
production. But they remain profitable because, by using fewer chemicals,
they can reduce costs.
A research project, partly sponsored by the EU, at the Long Ashton Research
Centre in Bristol is currently investigating how much farmers can cut
chemical use and still remain profitable. It estimates that, if the use of
chemicals was reduced such that crop yields fell by 8 per cent, costs would
fall by 32 per cent - meaning the holding would remain profitable.
Mr Mike Calvert is one of the pioneers of the sustainable approach. As
general manager of CWS Agriculture - an arm of the Co-operative Wholesale
Society - he is one of Britain's biggest farmers with a total of 45,000
acres under his care. Keen to address the concerns raised by
environmentalists, Mr Calvert initially tested organic farming methods. Five
years ago he converted 300 acres of his 5,200-acre holding in
Leicestershire, but soon found it was not profitable.
While conventional farming methods have given him an average profit of
Pounds 150 an acre at the Leicestershire farm over the past three years, the
organic part has made losses - last year it lost Pounds 9,000.
Mr Calvert said his organic holding needed a large investment of costly
labour to control weeds. He reckoned that in organic farming the overheads
per unit of production were double those of conventional methods because so
much manpower was used and crop yields were lower.
This year, Mr Calvert is testing sustainable farming on 130 acres of his
land. He described it as 'integrated farm management'. Instead of using
labour-intensive organic methods, he is devoting the man-hours to drawing up
plans for using chemicals and artificial fertilisers more efficiently.
Instead of spraying chemicals on all crops, he and his team spend up to six
hours a day inspecting wheat fields for patches of disease or poor fertility
to target later. Mr Alastair Leake, who manages the test area, said: 'You're
looking at specific problems and treating them, rather than blanket spraying
as in normal farming. We're abandoning the blunderbuss and picking up a
rifle.'
Sustainable farming also offers a chance to break a vicious circle in
conventional farming, whereby producers often need to step up their use of
chemicals to deal with problems created by an earlier application of other
chemicals. For example, said Mr Leake, wheat that has had its growth
enhanced by chemical fertilisers is susceptible to a problem called
'lodging' - when the straw is battered flat by the rain. If this happens,
the crop does not mature and is hard to harvest. To avoid this, farmers
apply a growth regulator which causes the wheat to grow shorter, so making
it less vulnerable to lodging.
Mr Leake's solution is to be more careful in the initial use of fertilisers
so that the wheat does not grow so high and thus requires less growth
regulator.
It is the sort of common sense which was often lacking in British
agriculture in the 1980s, when the use of chemicals peaked as farmers sought
to maximise food production.
Now the conventional wisdom has changed - to such an extent that the large
agrochemical producers and their trade organisation, the British
Agro-Chemicals Association, have co-sponsored with supermarket groups a
pressure group, Linking Environment and Farming (Leaf), which campaigns for
sustainable methods. The chemical companies appear to have decided that it
is better to promote the use of chemicals at a lower level, rather than risk
organic farming becoming widespread. By promoting sustainable farming,
chemical producers may also be able to head off the threat that CAP reforms
will lead to severe restrictions on the use of their products.
Leaf, which has set up a number of demonstration farms, has attracted 100
members and affiliated organisations - of which CWS is one - in the UK and
more on the Continent, including 800 in Germany. It encourages farmers to
carry out environmental audits based on a questionnaire it has compiled.
Leaf reports strong interest in its audit system: it has sold 1,000 copies
of the questionnaire at Pounds 20 each. But that represents less than 1 per
cent of the UK's 250,000 farmers. It is a hard message to sell to the
majority of producers, who are being encouraged to farm in a totally
different way than they were 10 years ago.
Mr Fraser Hart, an arable and pig farmer in Gloucestershire who has adopted
sustainable methods, said the transition was not easy. 'It's more difficult
to farm this way, and what do you do when you're faced with a major epidemic
of pest?'
For example, the orange blossom midge threatened to cut wheat yields by 30
per cent this summer. 'That's bankruptcy for some farmers and I'm afraid we
chickened out. We didn't want to spray, but we did it to save our crops,' he
explained.
At the same time, farmers trying to stick to environmental guidelines can
still be their own worst enemies, Mr Calvert said. 'You have to change your
perception of what is pretty. Pretty to a conventional farmer is wheat which
is dark green and lush in straight rows, whereas to the public it may look
much better with poppies in it. Farmers may have to lose their obsession
with neatness and tidiness. We were the scruffiest place in Leicestershire
for a time.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professor Wynne Godley (Letters, August 8) claims that a Bank of
England chart cited by Lex on August 1 is misleading. The chart - contained
in my article on company profitability and finance in the August Quarterly
Bulletin - shows the development of industrial and commercial companies'
investment as a percentage of gross domestic product since 1975.
Prof Godley claims that it is misleading because the sector now includes
privatised industries which were previously nationalised.
Indeed, the sector has become wider, as the article fully acknowledges, but
the national accounts data do not identify separately investment by
privatised industries.
Nevertheless, the chart is not misleading: an alternative chart of whole
economy non-residential investment, covering both private and public
sectors, in relation to GDP would show broadly the same pattern.

POLITICAL JOURNALISM'S CRIME AND PUNISHMENT (Seiji janarizumu no tsumi to
batsu) By Hiroaki Tase
Shinchosha, Y1,250 in Japanese, 207 pages
The unexpected return to power of Japan's Liberal Democratic party in a
three-party co-alition led by the Social Democrats has sent executives and
commentators at some of the nation's leading television networks and
newspapers scrambling for cover.
The LDP is angry at media organisations which branded its former leadership
corrupt and dishonest once the party had fallen from grace last year, while
heaping praise on successive new administrations for their programmes of
reforms. Many media chiefs are now trying to restore former links with
leading LDP members who, still seething, are threatening to cut some news
organisations off from news emanating from the party.
Such fawning behaviour by the media is hardly a surprise: since its
establishment early this century, the Japanese press has been part of the
status quo and has sidled up to those in power. It has never been given -
nor has it taken on - the role of political critic. Moreover, the static
quality of modern Japanese politics has meant the media have seldom been
called upon to choose sides in any deep ideological or other conflicts.
Hiroaki Tase, a senior reporter at Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the leading
business daily, says one of the main reasons for the confused state of
Japanese politics is the unhealthy proximity between the media and
politicians. The country's immature press has failed to check the excesses
of politicians, who are widely seen as being preoccupied with securing
favours for their constituencies while party power brokers have dispensed
patronage among favourites.
Tase says his book, un-Japanese in its critical tone, is partly a confession
of his own past 'sins' as a political reporter. He says he realised that
something was wrong with Japanese journalism when he was Washington
correspondent for the Nikkei between 1985 and 1989. He found western
journalism much more open, analytical and critical.
One of the main problems in Japan, he says, is the kisha club, or the
reporters' cartel, which is attached to and usually funded by each ministry,
political party or faction, and business organisation. A journalist arriving
in Japan for the first time faces a bewildering array of more than 600 kisha
clubs accommodating more than 160 media organisations. Instead of commuting
to the office, reporters from Japan's mainstream newspapers, wire services
and television networks virtually live in these clubs, which resemble
permanent newsrooms, waiting for announcements or briefings.
It is a cosy arrangement for both sides, allowing government and business
officials to establish close links with the media while controlling
information. Diversity and competition are sacrificed, as reporters, who
know exactly what the competition will write, simply rewrite press releases.
Another factor contributing to the low standards of Japanese journalism,
says Tase, is the lack of bylines for reporters. This, he says, has dampened
competition between journalists and hence quality (although he fails to
consider the case of a publication such as The Economist, which does not
give its writers bylines). He also blames a lack of analytical skills among
reporters on the way news organisations tend to promote journalists for
their respect for hierarchy or for working long hours, rather than for their
intellect. 'After working from early in the morning to late at night,
political reporters come home tired as a rag. They don't even have time to
read books,' he says.
He points out that the closeness between the press and politicians extends
abroad. He describes a press conference hosted by the foreign ministry at
the Group of Seven summit in Munich in 1992 for Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the then
prime minister. The government official chairing the press conference
ignored questions by non-Japanese reporters, allowing only approved
questions by Japanese kisha club members travelling with the prime minister.
But the Japanese mainstream media are not scared to kick someone when he is
down, says Mr Tase. Mr Shin Kanemaru, a power broker in the LDP and a
political legend created by the media, is a case in point. After he had been
arrested and indicted in 1992 for receiving bribes from a trucking company
in exchange for political favours, the media engaged in near-hysterical
condemnation of him. The case against him is pending.
Tase warns that, if the media do not go back to the basics of journalism,
scrutinising the political establishment and writing the truth, they will
lose what remains of their credibility among the Japanese public.
Even though Tase's book has been received with resentment among some, his
views are gaining support among journalists, particularly the younger
generation. His solutions to the problems of Japanese journalism seem
straightforward. He calls for the abolition of kisha clubs, the greater use
of journalists' bylines, and the development of a media culture which
nurtures the development of more analytical journalists.
Yet, if Tase's prescriptions are correct, it may be a while before Japanese
journalism improves substantially and plays a leading role in forming public
opinion, rather than merely regurgitating the government or corporate line.
Although Tase has been following his own prescriptions, writing analytical
and critical features under his own name, he remains in a minority within
the press and even within his own newspaper. He argues convincingly that, in
a culture where open debate is new, analytical and lively journalism may
still take some time to establish itself.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nuclear states and the
non-proliferation treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr DAVID LOWRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In their otherwise admirably informative review of the current
developments in nuclear proliferation and its control ('Tick, tick, tick,
tick them off', August 5) Jimmy Burns and Bronwen Maddox make two
presentational errors that deserve correction.
First, in the accompanying map on the spread of nuclear weapons capability
they entirely overlook Canada's significant nuclear infrastructure.
According to the 1994 edition of Nuclear Engineering International's World
Nuclear Industry Handbook, Canada has 22 nuclear reactors operating at seven
different sites. Additionally, it has a nuclear research centre at Chalk
River, where scientists worked on the Manhattan atomic bomb project, whose
technically successful outcome has just been marked with the 49th
anniversary of the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Canada also has very significant uranium deposits, as has Australia, a
country identified as having large civil nuclear capability, although it
only has two small research reactors and no commercial reactors planned or
operating.
Second, your specialist writers misrepresent the text of the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty (NPT) in saying that it 'permits five countries to
have nuclear weapons programmes'. It does not. The NPT text defines a
nuclear weapons state as one which has demonstrably tested a nuclear weapon
(which interestingly itself remains undefined in the treaty) by January
1967.
It is to conflate the definition of a nuclear weapons state with the
proposition that the NPT 'permits' such a status where both your authors,
and the foreign office, are inaccurate. Indeed, under article VI of the NPT
each of the states party to the treaty - including the nuclear weapons
states - are committed to entering into negotiations in good faith and at an
early date towards nuclear disarmament under strict and verifiable
international control.
This is hardly a permissive commitment to the retention of nuclear weapons.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not only New York funds drive gold
price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TIMOTHY GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The analysts at Bear Stearns &amp; Co argue that the gold price is too high
at Dollars 380 an ounce (Letters, August 5). This may be the view in New
York, which often forgets the wider world in which the interplay of many
markets makes the price.
Although one driving force in gold recently has been the ubiquitous 'funds'
in New York, the underlying strength of the gold market continues to be
strong physical off-take for jewellery and industry in places as diverse as
India, Indonesia, Italy, China and the US itself. This demand alone
outstrips, even at Dollars 380, new mine production and scrap. At Dollars
330 in early 1993, gold was perceived as so 'cheap' that it triggered demand
not seen since the metal was at Dollars 35 an ounce 25 years ago.
Which brings us to Bear Stearns' remarks about the Fed (where, of course,
Wayne Angell was a board member until recently). The Federal Reserve Bank of
New York has been out of the gold market since it closed its gold 'window'
in 1971, no longer handing out gold for dollars at Dollars 35 to any passing
central bank. Unlike the Bank of England, it has not maintained its
expertise in the gold market. So how is the Fed to 'get' the price back
between Dollars 320-Dollars 340? Start selling US reserves at those prices
to all-comers? Has it been forgotten that in the 1960s the central banks'
gold pool tried in vain to hold gold at Dollars 35? Or that the US Treasury
sales in the late 1970s were seen as a vote of no confidence in the dollar?
The Treasury got Dollars 255 an ounce for its gold; the price pressed on to
Dollars 800.
Moreover, markets now regard the gold price as a moveable feast. When
historically it was principally a monetary metal, the benchmark offered by
the stability of its price was crucial. But the world of gold has moved on;
the cocktail of forces determining its price today means that any central
bank trying to 'stabilise' it to suit its own convenience does so at its
peril.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Role in Italian rail wages deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PUBLIO FIORI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to the article by Andrew Hill, 'Italian rail deal raises wage
cost fears' (August 9). In this the author does not state that I absolutely
refused to take part in the negotiations and only asked the Italian state
railways to honour the agreement made two years ago between it and the
drivers' union when I was not a minister.
When the Italian courts, for which I have great respect, decided that the
agreement was valid and ordered the state railways to pay interest on
outstanding payments and legal costs, I intervened as guarantor of those
rights.
I am surprised that as authoritative a paper as the Financial Times did not
take the trouble to try to seek my views before writing an article which
could be used to political gain, which is outside the scope of your
newspaper.

status inquiry system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TERRY THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You reported ('Credit check plan on hold', August 8) that banks and
some of their customers are experiencing practical difficulties following
the introduction of a new procedure for status inquiries.
The new system was devised following the Co-operative Bank's refusal to
answer inquiries without the express consent of its customers.
I hope that, despite any teething problems being experienced with the new
system, everyone will accept that customer confidentiality must remain
paramount, and that we can now all be confident that no one can gain
information about our accounts without our permission.

<TEXT>
TRUE LIES (15) James Cameron
BABY'S DAY OUT (PG)Patrick Read Johnson
GETTING EVEN WITH DAD (PG) Howard Deutsch
For about a third of True Lies - the middle third - Arnold Schwarzenegger
attempts to play a troubled human being. You can tell this by the sound of
machinery winding down behind the Arnold face. The brows furrow; the voice
and features are rearranged, by elaborate computer technology, into a broody
quietude. Our hero Harry Tasker, a spy working for a secret agency charged
with what the film's publicity calls the 'intervention of nuclear
terrorism,' suspects his wife Jamie Lee Curtis of having an affair. Or as
Arnold more menacingly pronounces it, an 'affee-ah'.
Soon Harry is unleashing all the agency's know-how and manpower on Jamie's
nocturnal wanderings, eventually having her caught in what seems a clear
case of flagrante. Then he interrogates her to the point of tears through a
one-way mirror and voice-distorting intercom. Later still, again incognito,
he subjects her to a humiliating strip routine.
After True Lies the comedy of domestic jealousy, we return to True Lies the
comedy adventure. Only we wonder where we mislaid our sense of humour. For
much of this two-hour 20-minute movie, the Austro-American superstar's bid
to bounce back from his Last Action Hero debacle resembles Last Action Hero
with added misogyny and schadenfreude. Lots of stunts - here a blown-up
Swiss chateau, there a pyrotechnic pile-up on a Florida bridge - and lots of
quippy one-liners: 'Have you ever killed anyone?', 'Yeh, but dey were all
bad.' But there is also a new, worrying sense of let's-pump-up-the-drama.
When the Schwarzenegger machismo begins to turn serious, there is something
nightmarish about this man. As a paid-up if part-time subscriber to the
Arnold Fan Club - call me a country member - I admire his work in peak pulp
form: the Terminator movies, Commando, Total Recall. These are comic books
made celluloid, with Arnold a perfectly-tooled Nietzschean machine whose
ability to seem humanly non-human can also stretch to comedy. (He is funnier
 -advertently funnier - than Danny De Vito in Twins.)
But True Lies is a pile-up of confused intentions. Directed and scripted by
James Cameron, it cost a reported Dollars 120m, beating Cameron's own
Terminator 2 to the costliest-film-ever record. If the money went partly on
Arnie (Dollars 15m), it went mostly on stunts and special effects that are
used like a heart doctor's electric clamps to shock life into a tired,
paranoid patient: the plot. In part one, Arabs threaten to blow up America
with a nuclear bomb. Part two: Arnold investigates his wife. Part three:
back to fighting the Arabs with reconciled spouse in tow.
This is clearly the star's bid to be James Bond for the 1990s. (Even the
production designer Peter Lamont is a veteran of five Bonds.) All the fun of
the espionage romp, with a bit of PMT thrown in - pre-millennial tension -
in the form of topical geo-politics and career-stressed marriages. But
Schwarzenegger's mega-muscled way with the gore and gags is different from
the more dandyish 007's; and even less is it suited to black-comedy biopsies
on an ailing relationship.
Zombie implacability is the man's speciality, accompanied by the boom of
death-dealing epigrams. We cheer him here when he pilots a Harrier jump jet
in and out of a skyscraper window; or when he crashes on horseback into a
hotel's scenic elevator to pursue a fleeing baddie; or when he sepulchrally
quips 'You're fired' to the same baddie, dispatched while clinging to the
end of a fighter plane's rocket. Schwarzenegger is a great star in two
dimensions. Try to add a suaver third, let alone to extend his style of
casual brutality into real life, and the charismatic cut-out becomes a
faintly sinister hologram.
Baby's Day Out and Getting Even With Dad are the week's self-styled
Hollywood 'comedies'. Each has a plot you could sell in five seconds to an
excitable mogul. 'Kidnapped baby escapes and has life-endangering adventures
across big city.' (Mogul: 'Great] Maisie, pass me a contract form.') And,
'Neglected son stumbles on ex-convict Dad's new crime plot and blackmails
him into being a new and caring father.' (Mogul: 'Great] What's Macaulay
Culkin's schedule?')
Master Culkin, alas, is free. But he is now a long-in-the-tooth twelvish and
the voice is descending from pre-pubescent high C to middle A-flat. As for
the face, so animated in Home Alone, it seems to have seized up almost
completely. Perhaps he has had plastic surgery.
He is, of course, re-running his earlier succes d'infantilisme here. Much of
Getting Even With Dad involves a knockabout burglar duo (Gailard Sartain,
Saul Rubinek) and their 'hilarious' humiliations at the hands of Master
Smartypants. That serves for sub-plot. The sob plot is in the hands of Ted
Danson as Dad, who must choose between keeping a priceless cache of stolen
coins and holding on to the love of Master Culkin. We are amazed he takes so
long to make up his mind; and even more amazed that he makes the wrong
decision.
Baby's Day Out comes to us from the writer-producer of - guess what? - Home
Alone. And it has much the same plot about a tearaway infant and his
distraught and sundered parents (Lara Flynn Boyle, Matthew Glave).
Only difference: the new John Hughes-scripted romp does not feature a
knockabout burglar duo. No, in a daring departure from precedent, the
burglars here are kidnappers and they are a trio. Joe Mantegna is their
leader, mugging gallantly away even when Baby, concealed under a coat on his
lap in a public park, is busy with a lighter setting the man's trouser-fly
on fire. Later, a fellow gang member puts the flames out by stamping
violently on the affected area.
Laugh? I thought I had contracted Macaulay Culkin's facial paralysis. This
scene proves that misogyny is not the only option in modern American sexual
attitudes. The country's puritan legacy lingers on at all behavioural
levels, affecting both sexes.
But Baby's Day Out is an odd movie in every sense. While the comic
opportunities offered by Hughes's story are legion - Baby in a department
store, Baby on a building site, Baby at the zoo - the opportunities taken by
Hughes's own script and Patrick Read Johnson's direction are almost zero.
Scenes are either too short to make an impact at all (department store) or
so long (building site) that they stretch a slapstick conceit into a form of
serial concussion.
The only person to emerge with credit or dignity is the butler Andrews - no
relation - and even he, to judge by the two-and-a-half lines of dialogue
John Neville gets to utter, seems to have done most of his buttling on the
cutting-room floor.
By the way, there is also a new Hollywood comedy in town called Blank
Cheque. This was not shown to the press but deals, I understand, with a
small boy, his neglectful parents and a knockabout burglar with whom he
becomes amusingly involved . . .
Oh for the wings of a dove. Or the wings of aeroplane, at least, to get us
to the Edinburgh Film Festival. There, if you have any time between August
13-28, you should drop by to enjoy the riches. They include: a pair of
exotically matched retrospectives (Japan's Shohei Imamura, Hollywood's Andre
'House Of Wax' De Toth), a gala lecture or two (including a masterclass by
Bertrand Tavernier) and a whole lot of hits from the year's previous
festivals, including the opening film, Australia's runaway drag comedy
Priscilla Queen Of The Desert. Oh, and you can also catch Arnold
Schwarzenegger in True Lies.

There seems to be a belief in television that if a thing is worth doing, it
is worth doing over and over again. Or is it just a question of being
pre-empted by your competitors? On Saturday BBC1 showed the first of a
two-part documentary about Hammer horror films. Today Channel 4 begins a
series called The World Of Hammer which runs for 13 episodes, no less
(12.25). A few weeks ago Channel 4 ran a long sequence of programmes about
the troubles in Northern Ireland. Now BBC2 is running a long sequence on the
same topic. Today we are offered a 10-minute look at 'some of the surprising
economic factors', Consequences; and a 40-minute look at comedians in
Northern Ireland, The Empire Laughs Back (11.15). Have there not been
previous programmes showing the activity inside a blue tit's box as the nest
is lined, the eggs laid and the demanding chicks fed? Was there not a whole
series of programmes including just such material quite recently from the
BBC's Bristol unit?  So why is Channel 4 beginning another run of Wild
Britain with life inside a blue tit's box? (8.30).

FT  11 AUG 94 / Arts: Three sisters in search of their roots - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just as Muriel Spark's novel The Girls of Slender Means recalls a time 'when
all the nice people were poor', so sophisticated pre-war American films
evoke an era when all the nicest Americans sounded English. Reminded of this
by The Sisters Rosensweig, I was amused by a coincidental reference to
Muriel Spark in Wendy Wasserstein's comedy. This is an Anglo-American affair
par excellence.
The action amiably unfolds in the Holland Park home of Sara (Janet Suzman),
a high-powered American in international banking who reads 'very good'
pieces in the Financial Times (as who does not?). The time is the recent
past, when the Soviet Union was collapsing and Dollars 400 were worth Pounds
200. As old alliances crumble and the world takes on a new shape, the
characters too try to focus on themselves, their context and their
identities.
Sara's visiting sisters are Pfeni, traveller and author, involved with a
bisexual English theatre director (whose hit musical based on the Scarlet
Pimpernel sounds all too plausible), and Gorgeous Teitelbaum, self-styled
'housewife, mother and radio personality' who enjoys fame as an agony aunt
of the air waves back home, a cross between Doctor Ruth and Clare Rayner.
Gorgeous is the sister who succeeded: she married a lawyer, had children and
moved to the suburbs. She insists on lighting the candles and covering her
head with a tea-towel for the Jewish sabbath ('A seance?' asks the
teenager's boyfriend as he enters). The secular Sara is thoroughly
anglicised, after two divorces coolly keeping emotional commitment at bay,
and intends her teenage daughter for Oxford.
None are - or is, as a stickler for grammar reminds us on stage - as secure
as we think. Gorgeous's husband Henry, it is revealed, is out of work and
aspires to write Chandleresque thrillers which he researches in mean streets
and low dives, somewhat hampered by an adherence to Diet Coke. Theatre
director Geoffrey, having turned to Pfeni on the rebound from a gay affair
and desolation at the Aids striking his circle, ultimately decides he misses
men though he envisages himself and Pfeni as 'the most remarkable friends'.
And Sara's defences are breached, to her resentment, by the nice and the
ordinary: a widowed furrier, or rather a politically correct purveyor of
'synthetic animal protective coverings'.
The most articulate of the three, Sara finally describes herself (unjustly)
as 'a cold and bitter woman who has turned her back on her family, her
religion and her country.' Even her daughter backs out of a nationalist
adventure with her Lithuanian boyfriend.
It falls to the daughter to ask the question that might apply to all of
them: will they always be watching, never belonging? They puzzle ruefully
about their identities, taken to extremes in the young girl's lament that
she is neither European nor English nor American nor Jewish.
Of course, some might think this points the way to the new internationalism;
but the play's message seems to be gently in favour of roots and a cultural
identity - if you can find them. It sounds rather sombre, but the writing is
literate, amusing and wryly resigned to the uncertainties against which
Chanel suits and financial tycoonery are no protection, and international
luvvidom no defence - as the director admits, he has no sense of who he is
except in the darkened theatre where he makes it all up.
A success in the US, the piece, for all its humorous Jewish self-deprecation
and family argument (none of it very intense), is less Neil Simon than
Philip Barry, the pre-war American author of such comedies as Holiday and
The Philadelphia Story: urbane, concerned, the heartbeat belying the shrug
of the well-heeled and grudgingly self-aware.
A good cast could be better; Michael Blakemore's production could give more
thrust to these over-controlled and emotionally slightly languid characters.
But Janet Suzman brings her intelligence to Sara, and the younger generation
are sweetly and convincingly portrayed by Hellena Schmied and James Arlon.
About Maureen Lipman as Gorgeous I have a problem. Ten seconds into any
Lipman performance I begin to giggle helplessly. While this might - should
she opt to play Medea, Phaedra or Hedda Gabler - suggest in one or other of
us an unsuitability for our chosen profession, as long as she plays comedy
our relationship goes swimmingly.
'The Sisters Rosensweig' is at the Greenwich Theatre (081-858 7755).

FT  11 AUG 94 / Arts: Maxwell Davies' new Fifth - The Proms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Tuesday's Prom, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies conducted the Philharmonia in
the premiere of his Symphony no. 5. He will be 60 next month. The Prommers
received it with warm, vociferous enthusiasm: quite rightly, I thought.
Yet one might have expected otherwise; for Max's atonal idiom is as
uncompromising as ever, whereas popular post-modernist fashions in 'new
music' have clutched back at tonality as to Nanny's apron-strings. Max
learned early that advanced, theory-conscious music went down better with
lacings of Expressionist drama: hence the 1960s Mad King songs, and the
inspired Revelation and Fall. Then he moved to Orkney, where his fascination
with the seascape and the light turned his palette toward neo-Impressionism
 -though the detailed workings-out of the music were formally rigorous, even
arcane.
Embracing Sibelius was a natural next step (Nordic is Nordic, after all). It
was not surprising that Max's First Symphony (1978) should declare
inspiration from the Sibelius Fifth, in respect of large-scale form - not to
mention its stark, long-sighted vistas. When asked why he should call his
latest work a Symphony, Max allowed that it contained nothing like
traditional 'development', just like the later Sibelius, but earned the
title in virtue of hard-wrought density.
Fair enough: this new Fifth, in a single movement, is dense, but also
transparent and accessible. At well under half an hour it is less than half
the length of his First, but it is superbly compact, and exercises a
relentless symphonic grip. A near comparison would be a late- or
post-Romantic Passacaglia, where a repeated ground-bass ensures the unity of
disparate variations which may trace their own dramatic trajectory. (Earlier
Matthias Bamert conducted Webern's early Passacaglia, which is just such a
piece, with rare, sensuous subtlety.)
Max's symphonic sections succeed one another like close links in a
consecutive chain. From the bated-breath prologue for two flutes and a
clarinet, many things expand in parallel and in contrast: brass chorales,
soft wind-dialogues, frenetic tuttis (with brilliant surges from trumpet and
horn) and introspective solos. It ends with a long, elegant, dying fall,
from pianissimo strings and a moving cello line to formulaic high winds and
a final, measured string-droop, barely audible.
One reason why it all tells so strongly is that Max has adapted himself to a
more consonant vocabulary. Not tonal, of course; but far less profligate
than before with minor seconds and major sevenths, which in dissonant
profusion confound the ear. Where we used to need the big theatrical effects
as guideposts through his scores, the Fifth Symphony says quite directly
what it means - which does not preclude knowing evasions, bursts of formal
rhetoric, or gravely honest solo utterances. It works, and I look forward to
hearing it again and again.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Technology: Triple therapy offers high-cost hope -
International Aids conference / A look the struggle for resistance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At nearly every presentation on the effectiveness of HIV drug therapies at
the 10th International Conference on Aids this week, one of the biggest
concerns to have emerged is resistance.
The rapid speed at which the virus replicates, and the frequency with which
it mutates, mean that HIV can alter itself extraordinarily fast and can,
therefore, side-step the drugs administered to stop it. The result is that
even the latest and most promising medicines, such as protease inhibitors,
are likely to work for only a limited time.
Joseph Vacca of Merck explained that his company's protease inhibitor
L-735524 can almost eliminate the virus from the blood within two weeks.
But after only four weeks, the levels start to rise again as the virus
builds up resistance.
One possible solution is to use a combination of drugs. Miklos Salgo,
director of virological therapeutic research at Roche, showed that when
saquinavir, the protease inhibitor also known as Invirase, was used on its
own, resistance built up quite quickly. But when used in combination with
other medicines, the deterioration in performance was much less rapid.
The theory is that the chances of the virus finding the right mutation to
overcome two drugs is less than those of overwhelming one. And the chances
of the virus beating three treatments are even smaller.
Pharmaceuticals groups are now busy preparing to test such triple therapies.
The main problem with such treatment, however, even if it does turn out to
be effective, will be one of cost.
In those countries able to afford available therapies, many patients are
only able to gain access to such medicines with the assistance of
governments, or by means of compassionate programmes set up by the drugs
groups themselves.
The already large gap between cost and financial resources is likely to
widen. Stefano Vella of the Istituto Superiore Di Saneta in Italy has
suggested that the development of polymerase chain reaction technology,
which permits doctors to estimate the level of virus in the blood, could
allow physicians to monitor regularly the effectiveness of treatments. That
would allow them to chop and change multiple therapies for maximum effect.
While such therapy may improve the survival and quality of life of Aids and
HIV-positive patients, the cost implications of such individual therapy are
horrific and could undermine many governments' recent healthcare
cost-containment efforts.
The cost of available therapies is already beyond the means of the vast
majority of HIV-positive and Aids patients - those who live in the
developing world.
Retrovir, the leading Aids therapy, costs more than Dollars 2,500 (Pounds
1,600) a year. That compares with annual healthcare expenditure of between
Dollars 5 and Dollars 10 per capita.
The most cost-effective form of healthcare is undoubtedly vaccination. But
the international Aids vaccine programme has hit the buffers because the US
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases decided this summer
not to go ahead with large-scale trials that would prove the effectiveness
of an HIV vaccine. The reasons for the institute's decision were
complicated. However, recent data suggested that although the vaccines could
create immunity for HIV strains in the laboratory, it was unlikely to
disable those in the real world.
The institute decided the risks of the trial - possible HIV infection by
administering the vaccine, and the danger that those vaccinated might assume
they were immune and so undertake more risky behaviour - outweighed the
benefits.
Dani Bolognesi of Duke University Medical Centre in North Carolina said the
consequences of the decision were far reaching. For the US, it meant that
trials would be delayed for between one and three years.
For the rest of the world, and particularly for the developing world, the US
decision has created a desperate dilemma. The WHO had been planning to test
the vaccine in Brazil, Thailand, Uganda and Rwanda (which is now
impracticable).
The Brazilian government initially refused to participate because it was
worried its citizens were being used as guinea-pigs. Its concerns, and those
of other countries, that vaccines not safe or effective enough for the first
world could be dumped on third world volunteers, are likely to be
heightened.
However, African speakers were vehement in their support for the trials.
Edward Mbidde from Mulago Hospital in Uganda said the risk-benefit equation
was different in Africa from the US. In Africa there was no alternative to a
vaccine: increased use of condoms, clinics for sexually transmitted
diseases, education and counselling would never be affordable in Africa, he
said. A vaccine was the continent's only hope. The only way to test whether
it worked was to start trials.
Natth Bhamarapravati of Mahidol University at Salaya, Thailand, said the
only way to test whether a vaccine worked was to start trials. Testing on
animals gave no indication of a human vaccine's effectiveness.
The trials clearly had to be ethical, he said, or the companies and
organisations involved would be accused of human experimentation.
The cost of a three-year trial involving 9,000 people to test the
effectiveness and safety of a vaccine would be only Dollars 45m - less than
the cost of a single F16 fighter jet.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Technology: Promise of power - Tom Foremski looks at the
next generation of computers which will have vastly increased performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You can never be too rich or too thin, the saying goes. And in the computer
world you can never have too much computer power or memory - which forces
microprocessor manufacturers into an increasingly expensive quest for
technologies that will bring greater performance.
The ambitious goal of the recent alliance between US electronics giants
Intel and Hewlett-Packard is to develop a microprocessor that will perform
10 times faster than current microprocessors.
These next-generation microprocessors will be used in PCs with the
performance of today's supercomputers. Computer-intensive tasks such as
speech and handwriting recognition will allow people to communicate easily
with their computers, while the machines process vast volumes of data in the
form of three-dimensional, high-resolution graphics and manipulate massive
database files. Virtual reality systems will be as common in business
settings as they will be in home entertainment systems. And the new computer
power available will create applications not yet envisaged.
But to reach this stage, vast investment in research and development and
expertise in a large number of different areas will be needed. It will also
mean correctly identifying the technologies to enable such a large increase
in performance.
The alliance of Intel and HP has focused attention on a little-known
technology called Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW). Both companies say VLIW
may be one of the technologies included in their future microprocessors.
Most PCs use a type of microprocessor design called complex instruction set
computer (Cisc), a design with its roots in the 1970s. As memory chips
became cheaper in the 1980s, researchers found they could make
microprocessors more efficient if they simplified the design and let the
system software handle more of the complexity in analysing and executing the
programs. These types of microprocessors are known as reduced instruction
set computer (Risc) and are typically found in high-performance workstations
and are gradually emerging in PCs through products such as Apple Computer's
Power Macintosh computers.
VLIW offers to take this process a step further by making the microprocessor
design very simple and using special software known as software compilers to
analyse the programs and feed the code rapidly into the microprocessor.
HP has made the biggest investment in VLIW, which was first pioneered by the
now defunct computer company Multiflow in the mid-1980s.
HP's focus is to improve superscalar functions in microprocessors.
Superscalar means that a microprocessor can handle more than one task or
instruction within a time period or cycle. Some CISC microprocessors can
take several cycles to process a single instruction. But superscalar
microprocessors, such as the Intel Pentium or the PowerPC from IBM and
Motorola, can handle two or more instructions in one cycle, greatly
improving microprocessor speeds.
HP is hoping to go beyond current superscalar designs with a microprocessor
design it calls 'super parallel'. Super parallel microprocessors could
process as many as 32 instructions per cycle.
Intel and HP are not the only companies interested in VLIW. IBM says it has
several patents on VLIW technology and is considering including the
technology in its future microprocessors.
But not everyone is convinced that VLIW is the way forward. IBM, Motorola
and Apple Computer formed an alliance, called PowerPC, three years ago to
develop high-performance RISC microprocessors. The alliance created the
Somerset Design Centre in Austin, Texas, staffed with several hundred top
chip designers.
Russell Stanphill, co-director of the Somerset Design Centre, says that
developing radically different microprocessor architectures may be
premature. 'I believe that RISC technology has a long way to go before we
run into limitations - Risc is still in its infancy. There are also
questions about whether VLIW is a good approach. Does it make sense to give
the compiler such a massive task to do?'
Linley Gwennap, industry analyst and editor of The Microprocessor Report,
claims other companies might ignore VLIW and take a different approach. 'You
could choose a multi-processor chip approach that would ensure easier
backward software compatibility. Or reconfigurable microprocessors where you
use gate array technology to reconfigure your microprocessor for specific
tasks.'
But whichever technology is chosen, developing new microprocessor designs
and manufacturing them is increasingly expensive. Apart from the R&amp;D
expense, building a microprocessor factory can cost Dollars 1bn (Pounds
600m) It is a job that Intel, the world's richest and largest microprocessor
manufacturer, cannot handle alone. Its alliance with HP gives Intel access
to HP's Risc microprocessor technology, its software compilers and its large
customer base - while HP taps into Intel's chip manufacturing skills.
'This alliance raises the stakes in the microprocessor market. It will be
very expensive to develop the next generation of microprocessors and it's
clear that some companies won't make it,' says Gwennap.
Microprocessor manufacturers must not only develop faster designs but also
ensure they can get the economies of scale to match Intel which intends to
manufacture tens of millions of microprocessors.
Sun Microsystems has already teamed up with Fujitsu, with the two companies
pledging to spend more than Dollars 500m improving the Sparc microprocessor
architecture.
Digital Equipment Corporation's Alpha microprocessor faces the biggest
challenge, according to Gwennap: 'Digital lacks the economies of scale
needed.' For Alpha to survive into the next decade, Digital will need to
find able partners.
Silicon Graphics, which produces the Mips Risc microprocessor, is hoping to
obtain the economies of scale required by designing its microprocessor into
a potentially large market for set-top TV boxes that will act as gateways to
'information superhighways'.
Intel clone manufacturers, such as Advanced Micro Devices and Cyrix claim
they will be able to match whatever Intel produces. But while microprocessor
design moves towards less complexity, paradoxically, the size of the
microprocessor chips grows larger as additional system functions are placed
on the same chip.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Accountancy: Nostalgia is a poor bottom line for auditing -
David Maister argues that survival means moving from the traditional base to
a wider range of services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MAISTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The biggest problem with the accounting profession today is that there are
too many auditors and not enough accountants. What auditors are increasingly
coming to realise is that an audit is a product, not a career.
Saying you are an auditor is akin to stating that you know how to make - or
supervise the making of - one thing and one thing alone: an audit. You are
effectively betting your career on a single product, a risky move at best.
This wasn't a bad bet back in the good old days when demand for that one
product was great, when the market placed a high price on it, and clients
did not shop for your product predominantly based on price.
All this has changed. Now the question is: what else can you do for me to
justify the high income I've been paying you auditors for all these years?
Someone who is a pure auditor rather than an accountant has a serious career
problem. Every year, all of the accounting firms are working furiously to
train vast numbers of younger people to know how to do what the auditor
knows how to do: supervise an audit. So, each year, the poor auditor's
existing knowledge and skill is becoming less scarce and less valuable. His
or her asset is rapidly depreciating in value.
Of course, this sad situation is true of all professionals. They must
continue to build new skills to stay ahead of the pack. But how does the
poor auditor who wants to remain an auditor do this?
The great business virtue of auditing - that it is annually recurring work -
is also the greatest career trap for the auditor. He or she is not going to
learn new things rapidly by auditing the same companies year after year.
Keeping up with the latest changes in accounting regulations helps, but
could hardly be called rapid skill building.
The best and most obvious way to continue to build skills is to stop
auditing the same clients and trade up to doing the audit of larger, more
complex client organisations which pose stretching, challenging audit
issues.
It is not a bad solution, but unfortunately one that is available only to a
tiny percentage of those trying to earn a living as auditors. Not every
partner can audit British Telecom or its equivalent. In fact, it is fairly
safe to say that the vast majority of auditors, if they are to keep their
skills and knowledge valuable, will have to start doing something besides
auditing.
They will have to become accountants] They will have to start providing
accounting and finance-related services that clients view as worthy of high
fees. While it is true that accounting has long provided these services,
that is not the point.
The auditors themselves will have to be involved in providing these
services. It may be nice for the client and your firm if one of your other
partners provides these services, but where does that leave you? With a
depreciating asset and a declining career.
Firms keep telling their auditor to cross-sell the services of other
partners, but that is not really the individual's need. What the auditor
needs to do is sell additional services that he or she can perform, and
thereby learn something new.
Accounting firms have long talked about turning their audit partners into
'business advisers' - for so long in fact that the mere use of the phrase
inside most firms elicits automatic grins and groans. But action has been
limited.
As a simple test, I often ask groups of audit partners: 'How many of you
regularly read the trade magazines of your top one or two clients?' The
answers around the world (I have tried this in Europe, North America and
Australia) are always less than 10 per cent. So much for being business
advisers.
Some changes are observable. Firms and individuals are beginning to get
serious about industry specialisation, finally responding to explicit client
pleas that 'If you want to be more valuable to me, get to know my business
and give me business ideas'.
Firms are also beginning to put pressure on their partners to keep up their
learning and not just 'cruise' on existing skills. If there is an
'up-or-out' system for those trying to become partners, there is now
increasingly a 'grow-or-go' system for those who have made it.
More and more, firms are looking at ways to re-engineer their audits, not
only to reduce cost but to generate the kind of business-diagnostic
information that will allow auditors to spot the need for additional
value-added services. They are making use of executive education training
for their partners to try to give them 'mini MBAs'.
All of these actions are sensible, but they still leave open the most
important question of all: is there a future in auditing? The more firms
push to create the 'full-blown value-added audit', the more they raise
concerns about the question that strikes at the heart of their existence:
independence.
If there are already regulatory and legislative questions being raised in
the EU and the US Congress about auditing firms providing advisory services,
how will it look if the actual auditors start rendering these services?
Any way you look at it, auditing cannot continue much longer as it is. It is
a business full of paradoxes. To begin with the obvious, the providers think
they are offering one thing (an attestation that financial accounts are in
accordance with generally accepted principles). Meanwhile, the users of the
service (despite the profession's best efforts to tell them otherwise)
continue to believe that the service is something else: guaranteeing against
fraud, affirming the financial health of the enterprise being audited, and
so on. Years of debates and lawsuits have failed to bring these mismatched
perceptions closer together.
The paradoxes go deeper than that. Viewed from a business portfolio
perspective, the auditing product line appears to be a very unattractive
component of the portfolio. It is a low-growth, declining profit business
with a high exposure to litigation. Why would a firm that had options want
to nurture this product line?
The firms reply that it is a good regular, dependable cash flow, year after
year, an annuity. This reminds me of the old joke of losing money on each
item you sell, but making it up on the volume.
They say that the value of the audit is that it is a base from which they
can cross-sell other services. I would believe this more if the firms had a
better track record of cross-selling additional services, and if the
regulators were not after the firms to stop them doing it.
Most firms' consulting and tax departments tell me firstly that they bring
in most of their business themselves and do not rely on audit clients; and
secondly that their most troublesome clients are the audit clients, because
they expect the same low fee levels the auditors charge.
Is there a future for audit? There will always be a need for audits, and
someone will have to do them. However, I think the profession has a long way
to go in completing the transformation it has only just begun.
Most accounting firms today still think of themselves (or did until
recently) as audit firms which happen to provide a range of other services.
If they are to survive, they must drop their nostalgia and realise that they
have become accounting-and-finance-advisory firms for which the audit is
just one of their products, and a diminishing, ever-less attractive one at
that.

FT  11 AUG 94 / People: Sheard's mystery departure from F&amp;C
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fund management community is now pondering exactly what internal rules
were broken by 26-year-old Daniel Sheard, the rising star at Foreign and
Colonial who ran its high-profile Higher Income Plan.
Last Friday, F&amp;C sent a letter to independent financial advisers, who have
been selling the product particularly to elderly clients, advising them that
Sheard had 'committed a breach of well-established procedures' and, as a
result, had resigned.
Moreover, Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry,
has been notified of the breach and may have to decide whether Sheard ought
to be drummed out of the industry as 'not fit and proper'.
The fund, which aims to give investors roughly 9 per cent return on their
investments, invests in equities, cash and debentures with equity kickers.
F&amp;C informed the advisers because it feared that word of the sacking of a
high-profile fund manager would leak out and the salesmen would be inundated
with calls from concerned investors, according to Simon James, F&amp;C's
managing director.
But Sheard's offence still remains a mystery. James says 'it wasn't a
fingers-in-the-till kind of thing,' and that no investors have lost money as
a result. The 'action' was a single event which was spotted by a colleague
who noticed something was not quite right. When confronted, Sheard owned up
immediately.
'He has behaved impeccably,' James says, adding: 'We feel Daniel is a very
talented guy.'
Management of the fund is to be taken over by Sheard's boss John Monckton,
and by a colleague who ran a parallel fund for offshore investors.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Chunky Monkey
invasion - A look at the speedy arrival of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream in
Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only four months after its launch in Selfridges, a top London store, Ben &amp;
Jerry's, the popular US ice cream, seems well on the way to becoming the
'other' premium brand in the UK.
Since May, flavours such as Chunky Monkey, New York Super Fudge Chunk and
Rainforest Crunch have leapt into more than 300 independent speciality food
shops, convenience stores and news agents within the greater London area and
more than 60 J Sainsbury supermarkets around the country.
The company's socially-conscious, wacky image, combined with its recent
decision to compromise its idealistic pay policy as it searches for a new
chief executive, has propelled Ben &amp; Jerry's into the limelight during one
of the hottest UK summers on record.
But the company's quick success in penetrating the premium, or adult, ice
cream market has come largely at the instigation of Britain's Loseley Ice
Cream, currently the second largest brand in the sector after Haagen-Dazs,
though with a declining share.
Loseley is the sole importer and main distributor for Ben &amp; Jerry's in the
UK. Through its established relationships with specialist food shops in
London and the south-east, plus department stores and supermarket chains,
Loseley has been able to help Ben &amp; Jerry's break into the Pounds 113m
premium market.
The decision to act as distributor for a product which at first glance
appears to be a direct competitor may seem foolhardy. But Tudor Dairies, a
non-dairy ice cream manufacturer which acquired Loseley in January, believes
that Ben &amp; Jerry's complements, rather than competes with, the Loseley
brand.
Where Loseley produces quintessentially English, fruit-based flavours, Ben &amp;
Jerry's concentrates on chunks, preferably chocolate. 'As far as I am
concerned, the only way I get into fruit is if you mix it with some
chocolate,' says Ben Cohen, co-founder and chairman.
Loseley's ready-made distribution network gave Ben &amp; Jerry's a leg up on
Haagen-Dazs, which built its retail relationships from scratch when it
entered the UK in 1989. 'In order to come in as Haagen-Dazs did five years
ago would have cost a fortune and taken a considerable amount of time,' says
David Rapkins, managing director of Loseley Ice Cream. 'We could offer
immediate access.'
For Loseley, selling Ben &amp; Jerry's is the best way to become an important
player in the premium ice cream market. 'This is part of our strategy to
become a specialist ice cream distributor as much as a manufacturer,' says
Rapkins, a member of the original management buy-out team which bought Tudor
Dairies in 1990.
'Whilst there was a lot of potential for the Loseley brand, we thought we
needed to compete directly with Haagen-Dazs by developing the American end
of the market, and we knew Ben &amp; Jerry's was its closest competitor in the
US.'
For Ben &amp; Jerry's, 'it is not possible for us, being based in the US, to
physically get the ice cream direct to grocers, so we need to work through a
distributor,' says Cohen.
Selfridge's negotiated an exclusive launch deal for the month of April but
Loseley took over as the roll-out continued through independents,
convenience store chains and Sainsbury's, which is currently the only
supermarket chain to carry Ben &amp; Jerry's.
Loseley has contracted out the distribution of the ice cream to convenience
stores such as Europa, Cullens and 7-Eleven to Regale Foods, a Kent-based
food distribution company. But Loseley's six-person sales team has made all
the deals with independently owned shops.
Haagen-Dazs leads the UK premium sector with more than 30 per cent of the
market, with Loseley coming in second at around 9 per cent. Loseley believes
that Ben &amp; Jerry's will hit sales in excess of Pounds 3m and, having
expanded to the Midlands in the next few months, command around 4 per cent
of the UK market by the end of the year.
Nicola Chilton, marketing manager for the UK and Scandinavia at Haagen-Dazs,
says it is much too soon to assess the Ben &amp; Jerry's effect. 'We are having
one of our best summers yet,' she says.
In the US, Ben &amp; Jerry's 'caring capitalist' image has helped increase
business.
The company donates 7.5 per cent of its pre-tax profits to non-profit
organisations. It is already transferring that policy to the UK, where
Sainsbury's yesterday launched a campaign to donate 10 per cent of the
profits from sales of Ben &amp; Jerry's during the next two weeks to the
Children's Society.
'The charity element is what has got them a lot of coverage and we are happy
to share Ben &amp; Jerry's commitment,' a Sainsbury's spokesman said.
'But I suspect it is not a real motive for buying ice cream. It is just ice
cream without the guilty conscience.'

FT  11 AUG 94 / People: They're all coming to Cymru
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
All but one of the top jobs at the revamped Welsh Development Agency have
been filled with the appointment of Derek Perkins (right) as head of its
North American operation.
Perkins replaces Ivor Simpson, whose three-year contract is not being
renewed. North America is a crucial target in the government-funded agency's
attempts to woo inward investment. There is a presumption that the new
senior management has been dissatisfied with the US performance.
The headquarters is to be moved from Princeton to Boston. James Turner,
managing director for the WDA's international division, explains: 'Our
research has shown that Boston and the north-east seaboard area is one of
the best regions for potential inward investment to Wales. It contains the
largest concentration of any US region of large, growth-minded companies in
the high-technology field.'
Turner himself is a recent arrival at the agency - he joined in May after a
career which included working for Mars GmbH in Germany, Citibank and
Prudential Assurance, where he was sales development director.
Perkins, who was the WDA's regional director for south-west Wales and
previously responsible for the North American inward investment team in
Cardiff, takes the title of executive vice-president.
His appointment means that the new brooms at the WDA, chairman David
Rowe-Beddoe and chief executive Barry Hartop, who have the task of restoring
the agency's damaged reputation, are close to completing a slimmer and more
devolved structure. With the exception of Perkins, they have recruited from
outside the agency for all the senior posts.
About 60 of the 400 staff have been warned that they may lose their jobs.
Among the confirmed casualties is David Farnsworth, whose job as director of
the development projects division disappeared under the restructuring. Ian
Rooks, formerly marketing director, who was disciplined after the Commons
public accounts committee criticised the agency last year, has also left.
Two of the three managing directors for the new regional structure in Wales
 -which is intended to allow for the delegation of more responsibility from
the WDA's headquarters in Cardiff - have been appointed.
Elfed Evans, formerly district general manager for British Gas, has been
made managing director of the west Wales division. Enid Rowlands, who was
chief executive of Targed, the training and enterprise council in north-west
Wales, becomes managing director for the north region. The post of the south
Wales managing director has yet to be filled.
Two other senior appointments have been made this week. Susan Hughes, from
Shreeveport, a management and marketing consultancy, becomes marketing
services director. Julie Banfield, business development manager at National
Westminster Bank, becomes customer services director.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Granting an end to
food trade gap - Farmers and markets are drawing closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the first lorry load of lettuces passed through the Channel tunnel in
early July, Michael Jack, Britain's horticulture minister, hailed a
breakthrough for the UK's vegetable industry.
The lettuces and celery from G's Fresh Salads in Cambridgeshire were bound
for a Belgian supermarket, Delhaize le Lion, as one of the company's and,
indeed, the UK's first deliveries of fresh produce direct to a continental
chain.
The export order grew out of an effort by John Major, the prime minister. A
seminar at 10 Downing Street in January last year tried to bridge the UK's
Pounds 5.6bn food and drink trade gap. Grants from the Ministry of
Agriculture, to help farmers' co-operatives and small food companies get
closer to the market, followed.
G's Fresh Salads received a grant of Pounds 105,000 for three years. The
grant helps pay for a full-time export manager. The company's sales overseas
have grown from Pounds 2m last year to an expected Pounds 3m this year.
'It has enabled us to be much more highly organised and to get out and see
our customers to find out what they want,' says John Shropshire, managing
director. 'We have taken on people with language skills to cover virtually
the whole of the continent.'
Long insulated from the vagaries of the marketplace by guaranteed prices
under the Common Agricultural Policy, Britain's farmers are often out of
touch with what their customers want.
'Primary producers are masterly at planning production, but their marketing
skills are undeveloped, particularly when they are producing an
undifferentiated product,' according to Gillian Shephard, former agriculture
minister, who launched the Pounds 10m marketing grants scheme in June.
George Ray, who runs Central Egg Agency, a farmers' egg co-operative in
Solihull, handles a product that is difficult to differentiate unless by
stressing the high health standards imposed on battery egg production in the
UK. He sought a way of selling surplus eggs on the world market when the UK
is over-producing.
'Before, these eggs would just be dumped abroad at low prices by wholesalers
who wanted to get rid of them,' he said.
Ray has used his grant to launch an export drive by which the eggs are
marketed overseas before the surplus arises, allowing deliveries to be as
fresh as possible. He has cut out the middle man, making direct contact with
customers. 'We've been going for nine months and we've far exceeded any
expectations,' he says. He sends eggs to the Netherlands and Spain and hopes
to break into the Hong Kong market. The grant pays half of the salary for an
export manager and half his travelling expenses.
For many small companies and farmers' co-operatives wishing to tap the
export market, the grant provides the resources for a marketing drive. The
grant can help organisations sharpen skills and redirect their marketing
efforts.
Stuart Edwards, managing director at Fenmarc Produce in Cambridgeshire, is
using the money to organise three groups of potato growers in anticipation
of the demise of the central Potato Marketing Board.
Edwards has identified north Lincolnshire, north Norfolk, and Herefordshire
as the areas with soil suitable for growing the type of potatoes he wants
when the PMB is dismantled. The PMB, which sets quotas for growers, is due
to be abolished in 1997, but potato producers are calling for the market to
be deregulated before then.
'We are not making any dramatic changes, but we are starting to become
closer to our growers so that we can relay to them the needs of the
customer,' Edwards said. That means encouraging farmers to grow varieties
for harvest at specific times of the year.
Some farmers still have to be convinced that better marketing will help sell
their produce. To try to overcome innate conservatism, the National Farmers
Union is conducting a study into how producers might best use the grants
scheme. As one official says: 'We can't eliminate the food trade gap
overnight, but we have to realise we're in the single European market now.'

FT  11 AUG 94 / People: George Bradt joins Coca-Cola
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Coca-Cola Great Britain and Ireland has appointed a new consumer marketing
director, George Bradt (left), currently director of marketing and sales
with Disney Development Company in the US.
Bradt, 36, succeeds Steve Jones, who is moving to Coca-Cola Japan in Tokyo.
Bradt is taking on responsibility for all marketing in the UK and Ireland
for Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, and other brands such as Fanta, Lilt and Sprite,
at a time of increasing competition in the market. The launch of its
own-label Classic Cola by the UK's biggest food retailer J. Sainsbury in a
blaze of media publicity in April prompted Coca-Cola to step up its already
high-profile marketing campaigns.
Bradt says a priority will be to try to increase the size of the total UK
market for soft drinks. Coca-Cola, he says, needs to find 'new ways to meet
consumer needs in a market which still has a lower per capita consumption of
soft drinks than countries such as Germany and the USA'.
This is Bradt's first post in the UK, but before joining Disney he worked
for companies such as Pollio Dairy Products, part of Kraft, Procter &amp;
Gamble, and Lever Brothers.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): An 'adult' double
scoop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Adult ice cream is the name given by analysts to the sub-sector of the ice
cream market into which Ben &amp; Jerry's has launched in the UK. That
X-certificate rating has nothing to do with the advertising of Haagen-Dazs,
the leader in the field of take-home brands, but reflects the fact that
adult ice cream is a luxury product sold at premium prices, and is usually
considered beyond children's pockets.
Purchasers are most likely to be 25-44-year-old ABC1s living in London and
the south-east, although there are some indications that teenagers and
children are starting to demand their share, too.
The adult sector has been the main source of growth for the ice cream
industry in recent years, and looks set to remain so, particularly if the
current rate of product innovation can be maintained.
Overall, consumers spent more than Pounds 850m on ice cream in 1993 - a 5
per cent increase on the previous year, and a 20 per cent growth during five
years, according to the market research group Euromonitor*. Of that, the
adult sector was worth Pounds 113m in 1993, an 11.3 per cent increase on the
previous year. In 1989, premium products made up 7.5 per cent of retail
sales; last year the proportion had grown to 13.2 per cent.
Two main and distinct markets operate in ice cream sales: take-home, which
accounts for almost 53 per cent, and wrapped 'impulse' buys which make up
nearly 36 per cent. The balance is accounted for by 'scoop' sales from ice
cream vans and stands.
Both main markets have been revitalised by the adult products. Among wrapped
impulse products, Mars was first in the field in 1989, with its ice cream
chocolate bars - a smart move which, as Euromonitor observes, sidestepped a
great deal of brand building. Competitors soon copied the trick. Unilever's
Wall's held leading position in 1993 in the impulse sector with a 45 per
cent share.
Interest in these products crossed over into the take-home market, where a
small premium sector, led by Loseley, was ripe for development. Haagen-Dazs,
with its sensuous advertising and 'dedicated to pleasure' slogan burst on to
the scene. The Grand Metropolitan-owned brand took the lead in the take-home
market, as luxury products pushed aside economy tubs.
Now Haagen-Dazs faces increased competition, particularly from Ben &amp;
Jerry's, and the launch this year of Ranieri Wall's.
Growth is set to continue, according to Euromonitor, predicting a rate of 10
per cent a year during the next five years.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Aston Martin DB7 - licensed to thrill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may take a long time to rival Ferrari, but Aston Martin Lagonda wants to
accelerate into the fast lane of the world luxury sports-car market.
'We are making the break from being a low-volume cottage industry to
becoming a mainstream specialist carmaker,' said Mr Nick Fry, managing
director.
The transformation is being fuelled by finance and expertise from Ford, the
world's second-largest vehicle producer, which acquired a 75 per cent stake
in 1987 and took over the outstanding minority shareholding earlier this
year from the Livanos shipping family.
One of the illustrious marques of the British motor industry, often
lossmaking and with a chequered ownership history after its golden age ended
with its sale in 1972, Aston Martin is in effect being relaunched.
The introduction this autumn of the DB7 sports car is set to increase car
output to about 800 next year from just 144 this year.
That is only the first stage in the marque's planned comeback. 'It is
critical to have more than one model line,' said Mr Fry. 'Our volume was so
small, we could never become a credible carmaker.'
Production of the traditional handcrafted Vantage and Volante sports cars
will continue in small numbers at Aston Martin's cramped Newport Pagnell
headquarters, but the company's expansion is being carried out at a new
plant at Bloxham, Oxfordshire, which it has recently taken over from
JaguarSport.
The Bloxham plant is planning to assemble 150 DB7s by the end of the year,
rising to nearly 700 next year. But Aston Martin intends to follow the DB7
with a four-door, four-seat sports saloon which is pencilled into the
development programme for launch in 1998-99. Total output could then exceed
1,500 cars a year.
This car, which will be modelled on the Lagonda Vignale concept car unveiled
at Geneva motor show last year, has not yet been given the go-ahead, but
that is expected next year.
Mr John Oldfield, who joined Aston Martin as executive chairman in February,
said: 'Within the company we have a clear consensus that we need a second
model and that Vignale is the model. If we can put together the right
programme, it could be in production in four years.'
Aston Martin continued to stumble for the first couple of years under Ford
ownership, but recently the US carmaker has taken a more rigorous approach
as it began to inject serious sums of money. Aston Martin was refinanced
last year with Pounds 50m new equity capital.
A large part of the Aston Martin senior management has come directly from
Ford, most recently Mr Oldfield, who was the vice-president responsible for
all Ford product development in Europe.
The board has been revitalised. It now includes Jackie Stewart, the former
Formula 1 world champion who has worked on developing the ride and handling
of the DB7, and Mr Nick Scheele, chairman and chief executive of Jaguar. A
number of parts are being drawn from Ford's other British subsidiary,
including the DB7 floorpan from the Jaguar XJS and the original block for
the DB7's 3.2-litre, six-cylinder, 335-horsepower supercharged engine.
An important part of the expansion of Aston Martin will be the development
of its worldwide dealer network, which is planned to grow from 42 at the
start of 1991 to more than 100 by the end of next year. Mr Fry said: 'This
is especially critical in the US, where you either fail completely or are a
big success. There is no in-between. This will be our Waterloo, and we are
determined it will be a major success.'
The DB7 will not be launched in the US until the beginning of 1996, by which
time it will be equipped with both driver and passenger airbags, but the
company has already started a big push with market research and the
recruitment of new dealers. It wants to increase the number of north
American dealers from 12 to about 30.
Aston Martin is planning to sell about 35 per cent of the output of the DB7
in north America and is hoping that the new car will greatly reduce its
dependence on the domestic UK market. It is also seeking to establish much
more of a presence in continental European and Asia-Pacific markets.
While the Aston Martin marque may still be well known in the UK, the racing
heritage is hardly established in foreign markets.
It plans a one-make DB7 racing championship for owners modelled on the race
series successfully launched a couple of years ago by Ferrari for its 348
sports car. Just as importantly, it is seeking to rediscover former glories
by competing at Le Mans in France and Daytona in the US. Negotiations are
taking place with two UK corporations in the search for the Pounds 3m-Pounds
4m sponsorship needed to run a successful three-car team for Le Mans. Aston
Martin was last at Le Mans in 1979, and it would like to return in 1995 or
1996, Mr Fry said.
The biggest image boost may come at little cost, however. Aston Martin has
an outline agreement - but no final contract yet - for the DB7 to be used in
the next James Bond film, Goldeneye, starring Pierce Brosnan in the latest
incarnation of agent 007.
The original James Bond, Sean Connery, was a priceless marketing coup in his
Aston Martin DB5 in Goldfinger, and both Ford and its sporty UK subsidiary
are hoping for the same worldwide boost from Goldeneye.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Cancer charity sells drug rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Cancer Research Campaign, a medical charity, has joined with Xenova, a
biotechnology company, to develop a new cancer drug.
Cancer Research Campaign Technology, the charity's technology transfer arm,
has sold the worldwide marketing rights to the drug Daca in return for cash
payments and royalties should the drug be marketed.
The payments are based on the progress of the drug through trials up to a
maximum of Pounds 1.7m.
If clinical trials go to plan, the drug could be approved at the end of the
decade. Stockbroker Lehman Brothers estimates that it may eventually
generate Dollars 250m in sales.
Daca is still in the early stages of development. Less than a quarter of
drugs make it to the market from this stage.
CRC and Xenova, which is based in Slough, Berkshire, are taking the
development forward because laboratory tests showed that low doses of Daca
overcame two main types of drug resistance - a common cause of failure of
chemotherapy - in various tumours, including colon, skin and lung cancers.
Mr Louis Nisbet, chief executive of Xenova, said he may resell certain
marketing rights, such as those in Asia, to large drug companies to secure
more funding for the final, most expensive, clinical trial stages.
The compound was discovered by scientists at the Auckland Cancer Society in
New Zealand and handed to the British charity for further investigation.
Dr Paul Bevan, Xenova's research director, said the drug worked by blocking
two enzymes, topoisomerase I and II, involved in the uncontrolled
replication of cancer cells. Existing anti-cancer drugs of this type hit
only one or other of the two.
The effect is to kill rapidly dividing cells in tumours. Such an approach is
already used in chemotherapy drugs which kill cells by other means, so
side-effects such as hair loss, infection and anaemia are also possible with
Daca.
Daca appears to overcome drug resistance that arises when cancer cells are
able to to pump out chemotherapy drugs before they can work.
The deal is one of a series CRC has done with the private sector. But it is
more unusual for Xenova, whose collaborations in the past have been with
companies such as Genentech and academic centres such as Purdue University
of Indiana, rather than charities.
Xenova, which specialises in rapid screening of large numbers of potential
drugs derived from fungi, bacteria and plants, floated its shares on the
Nasdaq market in the US last month.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Rapid deregulation urged for gas market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Consumers' Association today urges the government to move ahead quickly
with deregulation of the domestic gas market.
The association is concerned that the drive towards deregulation appears to
be faltering. A statement expresses particular concern about the possible
delay in introducing the necessary legislation to amend the present Gas Act.
Mr Stephen Locke, the association's policy director, said: 'Any delay would
mean a longer wait before customers see the benefits of competition. The
government must get a move on. We have all had to put up with British Gas's
unwelcome monopoly for too long.'
The association was responding to the joint consultation paper by the
government and Ofgas, the industry regulator, on opening up the domestic
market to competition beginning in 1996.
The association said it was concerned about recent British Gas statements
that prices for large numbers of gas consumers might have to rise in the
run-up to competition as cross-subsidies are removed. 'The current price
formula guarantees annual price cuts, and competition must not threaten
this,' it said.
It also rejected suggestions that the activities of the Gas Consumers
Council could be incorporated into Ofgas.
British Gas has increased prices for as many as 400 industrial customers on
its interruptible tariff. But it stressed that there would be no increase
for customers using less than 1m therms a year.
The company said it was obliged to operate a tariff until action was taken
on the consultation document and deregulation introduced.
The Gas Consumers Council denounced the move as 'part of a series of
selective price increases while British Gas defends itself against
competition'.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Fishermen angry at Navy action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cornish fishermen complained yesterday that the Royal Navy was harassing
British trawlers fishing for tuna in the Bay of Biscay instead of protecting
them from the Spanish.
The attack came as agriculture ministry officials said they were still
considering whether to take legal action against the Charisma, a Cornish
trawler, which was found at the weekend to have broken European Union rules
on the length of its driftnet.
Fisheries protection vessels from the Navy have confiscated the Charisma's
nets and have also issued a caution to another boat, the Alice Louise, which
was alleged to have exceeded the legal net length of 2.5km.
Charisma's nets were found to have exceeded the limit by 160 metres.
Fishermen's representatives claimed this was within a 5 per cent to 10 per
cent allowance for stretching at sea. However a ministry official said this
was a 'fallacy' and legal action which could result in a fine was still
being considered.
An agriculture ministry official said the Alice Louise's nets, which had
been measured at sea by European Commission inspectors, were measured again
by British inspectors and found to be over the limit. The skipper was
cautioned. The Alice Louise yesterday set out for the Bay of Biscay.
Yesterday the French navy ordered a French vessel back to Brest for
allegedly using illegal nets. Spanish fishermen had complained to EU
inspectors that three French boats were exceeding the net limits.
Mr Paul Tyler, Liberal Democrat MP for Cornwall North, told BBC radio: 'The
suspicion among Cornish fishermen, and rightly so I believe, is that the
ministry is not operating on our behalf but appears to be acting as the
watchdogs of the Spanish government.'

FT  11 AUG 94 / Labour to meet Scots companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish Labour party is to meet leading companies to help formulate an
economic strategy for Scotland.
The party will also use the meetings to reassure leading companies about its
plans for a devolved Scottish parliament.
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, has said a government formed by the party
would include early legislation to create a Scottish parliament.
Mr Jim Devine, chairman of the Scottish Labour party, said: 'We are seeking
a frank, constructive and substantive dialogue with key players in the
Scottish economy.'
Meetings have been arranged with companies including the Guinness subsidiary
United Distillers; ScottishPower; the life assurance company Standard Life;
and International Business Machines, which has a large personal computer
plant at Greenock, Strathclyde.
Mr Henry McLeish, deputy shadow Scottish secretary, said: 'Industry has
nothing to fear and much to gain from the creation of a Scottish
parliament.'

FT  11 AUG 94 / MPs demand closure of loophole on business rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The law should be changed to prevent businesses escaping council rates by
going into voluntary liquidation, the Commons environment committee said
yesterday.
A report from the committee highlights difficulties in collecting business
rates since 1988 when the government removed local authorities' status as
preferred creditors.
Mr Paul Britton, director of the Department of the Environment's local
government finance policy directorate, was unable to estimate how much
revenue had been lost.
He said the Department of Trade and Industry - 'the experts on company law
and receivership' - had been asked what could be done about the problem.
Mr Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, Conservative MP for Cirencester and Tewkesbury,
said: 'It does seem a bizarre regulation that you can put yourself into
voluntary receivership and thereby evade non-domestic rates.' The committee
urged the government to find an answer before the Budget in November.
Mr Britton said another factor in the fall in the yield from non-domestic
rates was the increase in empty-property relief caused by the recession. The
total is estimated to have risen from about Pounds 700m in 1990-91 to Pounds
1.22bn in 1994-95.
A further recommendation from the committee underlines anxiety among MPs
about the Local Government Commission headed by Sir John Banham, which is
reviewing the structure of local government in England and is expected to
spend Pounds 8.3m this year.
The committee concludes that if ministers decided to override a large number
of the commission's proposals it would be tantamount to a declaration that
the commission had failed.
In what amounts to a warning shot across the bows of the commission and the
government, the committee says: 'In those circumstances, it will be clear
that the commission has not provided value for money.' The report adds that
the committee is likely to be among those asking why.
Referring to the time taken on appeals against council tax, the committee
says 250,000 cases were still likely to be outstanding by the end of this
year. The committee says it will look for significant improvement next year.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Portillo plan 'could damage Tory vote'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday claimed that Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary,
could severely damage the Conservatives' chances in the next general
election if his call for a cut in state support for industry is implemented.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's acting campaign manager, strongly attacked Mr
Portillo for showing with his recent call for a reduction in the Department
of Trade and Industry's budget that 'he was out of touch with the real
world'.
The attack coincided with claims by Mr Derek Fatchett, shadow industry
minister, that 182 Tory MPs could lose their seats if the DTI is forced to
scale back its programme of regional assistance in the way Mr Portillo
recently demanded in a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary.
'Mr Portillo's proposals are a direct attack on his own party's MPs,' said
Mr Fatchett. 'But more importantly, they will hurt British business. His
colleagues must now decide whether to back their local industries or sack Mr
Portillo.'

Before the 1992 general election several leading Scottish financial
institutions, including Standard Life, voiced anxiety about the effect that
a Scottish parliament with the power to raise taxes would have on their
business. Labour's response was to ignore or deride such statements.
Mr Ian Preston, chief executive of ScottishPower, said the company 'welcomed
the chance to talk to the Labour party, as we do with all other political
parties'. ScottishPower said it would be concerned about a Scottish
parliament that disadvantaged Scottish companies.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Women amid 'male camaraderie': A look at moves to counter
sexual discrimination in the office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Miss Samantha Phillips, the insurance broker who yesterday won her case of
sexual discrimination and unfair dismissal against Willis Corroon, did not,
in the end, convince the industrial tribunal that she had been sexually
harassed by her manager on a business trip.
Nonetheless the case has served to highlight the difficulties of women who
work in what the tribunal yesterday described as 'an atmosphere of male
camaraderie'.
Sexual harassment has become a high-profile issue - treated increasingly
seriously by large employers - since 1986 when it was recognised as an
offence under the Sex Discrimination Act.
Organisations as diverse as the European Commission, British
Telecommunications and Goldman Sachs have made offenders leave following
complaints of harassment.
Publicity surrounding the issue has encouraged increasing numbers of women -
and a handful of men - to complain. Last year the Equal Opportunities
Commission received 793 complaints about sexual harassment, 58 per cent up
on the previous year. The commission believes this is 'the tip of the
iceberg'.
Ms Jayne Monkhouse, head of the commission's employment practices unit,
said: 'People make a claim of sexual harassment when they are at their wits'
end. A lot of women suffer a low level of harassment, such as persistent
name calling, pin-ups or pornography on their computers, which they try to
put up with.'
Surveys suggest that a majority of women suffer some form of sexual
harassment at work. When the Industrial Society surveyed 1,727 men and women
last year, 45 per cent said they had experienced some form of sexual
harassment. Nine out of 10 of the complaints were from women.
The commission believes women are most vulnerable where they are in a
minority, such as in the fire service or police. They also receive a
disproportionate number of complaints from women in small organisations,
where managers or owners of the business are often the culprits.
Large organisations are taking the issue increasingly seriously. Nearly all
public-sector employers and a majority of the largest private-sector
employers have policies to deal with sexual harassment.
Part of the impetus for these policies is that their existence will provide
some protection should the company be taken to an industrial tribunal.
Companies are potentially exposed to large claims following the European
Court's removal of the Pounds 11,000 ceiling on compensation for sexual
discrimination last year.
Most company policies are in line with the European Commission code of
practice issued three years ago. This recommends that companies put out a
clear statement of principle condemning all harassment, train managers to
deal with problems, and set up informal and formal avenues for investigating
complaints and disciplining culprits.
Few UK companies go as far as many US businesses, which sometimes adopt
blanket prohibitions on employees touching or dating colleagues.
Nonetheless, many companies issue comprehensive guidelines.
Midland Bank, for instance, sends staff a three-monthly circular reminding
them of the definition of sexual harassment. Its definition of unacceptable
behaviour includes 'staring and leering', pin-ups, unsolicited and unwanted
gifts, the use of explicit language, unwanted propositions, deliberate body
contact, groping and fondling.
Complaints at the bank are investigated by staff from an unrelated
department. If a preliminary inquiry finds grounds for suspicion, the
accused staff member is suspended while a full inquiry takes place. If found
guilty, the employee will be dismissed.
In practice, implementation of anti-harassment policies does not always live
up to the theory. Mr Michael Rubenstein, editor of Equal Opportunities
Review, said: 'The big problem now is going from paper to practice.'
Problems often arise when companies decide to move one of the employees.
Since most cases involve an offender who is senior to the victim, companies
are often inclined to transfer the victim. Mr Rubenstein said this would
deter people from coming forward. 'If the complainant is punished for the
behaviour of the harasser, it may undercut the whole policy.'
The attitude of the employer is crucial. Many women still fear that they
will be pilloried or ostracised if they complain. The fear of humiliating
publicity associated with a tribunal hearing is a strong deterrent to
seeking legal redress.
In spite of the growing commitment by large employers to tackle the
problems, many employees still feel they have no option but to suffer it.
The weak state of the job market has worsened the problems, according to Ms
Monkhouse. 'People often put up with behaviour when in a more fluid job
market they would just walk out.'

Poole in Dorset has the best beach in the UK, the Tidy Britain Group said
yesterday. The two-year survey ranked 100 beaches. Half of them were classed
in the top two categories and 19 in the worst, including both the north and
south beaches at Blackpool.
The Water Services Association, representing the sewage companies, said 20
of the 100 biggest coastal sewage clean-up schemes had been completed, and
the remainder would be completed by 1996 at a cost of Pounds 7m per beach.

Cambridgeshire North East, substantial damages and legal costs in settlement
of a libel action over an allegation that he lied about his earnings while
picking onions during private research into agricultural wages.
The action concerned a Public Eye programme on BBC2 about how workers were
hired on piece rates to harvest or clean fruit and field crops.

Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation for independent financial advisers,
is to announce today that it is fining Bankhall Investment Management Pounds
25,000 over a dispute with Clerical Medical International involving the
transfer of Pounds 20m to a bank in Cyprus, Alison Smith writes.
The fine is among the largest Fimbra has imposed, and the company will also
have to pay substantial costs, thought to amount to Pounds 40,000.
Two directors of the company were suspended but have now been reinstated.
Bankhall, one of the UK's largest broker fund managers, said the charges had
related to 'an isolated incident'.

FT  11 AUG 94 / New route for rural superhighway: In his latest report
looking at the progress of a scheme to stimulate a community's economy with
electronic equipment, Paul Cheeseright finds that the future is now seen to
lie in hard-headed income generation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The advertisements this week for a chief executive for Kington Connected
Community Company mark a change in direction for the village-based scheme in
Herefordshire.
The chief of KC3, as the company styles itself, will receive Pounds 20,000 a
year - plus performance-related bonus - but also a brief to put the project
on a more commercial basis. The past was enthusiastic innocence. The future
is hard-headed income generation.
Mr Mark Pierce, project manager at the Rural Development Commission, said:
'It's got to generate enough resources to stand on its own two feet in three
years.'
KC3 is an experiment. Apple Computer provided machines, British
Telecommunications provided telecoms, and supporting companies such as
Rothwell Group and System Support Networking provided training and software,
all with the aim of seeing if a rural community could gain economic impetus
from a Pounds 300,000 injection of electronic equipment.
A year into the experiment it has become clear that the presence of
equipment does not itself provide an increase in economic activity.
Other sponsors providing support in cash and kind are the Department of
Trade and Industry, Hereford and Worcester Training and Enterprise Council,
and Leominster District Council - a telecentre in Kington, the focus of the
project, is in a district-council building.
KC3's sponsors accepted that linking the use of the equipment to economic
activity would require careful management and that use of the equipment
would have to create the income necessary for the company's continued
existence.
The development commission has paid for the services of management
consultants Morton Hodson, which has put forward recommendations for a new
course for KC3.
Mr Gerald Harris, a Morton Hodson partner, said: 'There wasn't much of a
management structure there before. There wasn't much systematic long-term
thinking on future needs.'
The new chief executive will be either a young manager on the way up or an
older manager not too worried about money. Mr Pierce said: 'He's going to be
a commercial operator first and foremost with private-sector experience. But
he or she will need to be able to balance the private and public sectors.'
The KC3 team will remain small - with the main members being the new chief
executive and the manager of the telecentre - but it will draw expertise
from outside as it is needed.
The chief executive will have to devote immediate attention to two types of
revenue-raising schemes.
First, there are those which provide a service for which the public sector
is prepared to pay. These include acting for the Employment Service in
holding a computerised register, open to the public, of job vacancies in the
area, and developing databases of teleworkers and agricultural skills.
Second, and more difficult to establish, are those where KC3 will act as a
business in its own right.
The telecentre is starting to offer office bureau services. The new chief
executive will examine how to offer KC3's facilities for direct marketing
and how to provide a language translation service linking teleworkers to
their customers.
If the software can be devised for a Kington tourism package, providing
electronic contact between local facilities and booking agents, the
technique could be franchised to tourist authorities.
Mr Harris said that once the income started coming in there would be the
capacity to switch to non-income generating activities, such as
computerising the records of the Kington Historical Society.
But if the experiment is to be a success, the electronics must prompt the
establishment of new local business. 'That's the really challenging bit,' Mr
Harris said.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Manufacturers in all regions report growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturers in all regions are enjoying growth, according to figures
released yesterday by the Confederation of British Industry and the
consultancy Business Strategies.
For the first time since the survey began in July 1988 all 11 regions
reported increases in business optimism, orders and output. The report is
compiled from the CBI's national quarterly industrial trends survey,
released last month.
East Anglia appears to be growing the most rapidly, although Business
Strategies warned that it was a small region where survey results could be
volatile. Orders and output growth have grown faster in East Anglia than
elsewhere.
Expectations for new orders and increased output over the next four months
are highest in Wales while the greatest level of business optimism is in
Northern Ireland.
Business Strategies said it was significant that manufacturing appeared to
be healthy in the two important regions of the east and west Midlands. The
east Midlands has seen the strongest growth in total orders of any region,
apart from East Anglia, while the west Midlands is second to East Anglia in
the league table of regions enjoying output growth.
The regions which showed the smallest improvements, according to the report,
were the north-west, the north, Scotland and the south-west.
Although some commentators fear the strength of the economy will lead to
inflationary pressures, the report says: 'There is no evidence of rising
unit costs at the national level and only limited evidence that the regions
experiencing the strongest growth are also the first to experience
accelerations in costs.'
The survey found that in the past four months, seven of the 11 regions had
seen falls in domestic prices, with only Wales and Yorkshire and Humberside
seeing significant increases.
The fastest growth in unit costs occurred in the south-west and the east
Midlands. East Anglia is the area which most expects prices to rise over the
next four months.
The improvement in business prospects has done little to brighten the
employment outlook. Only three regions are expecting to see an increase in
manufacturing employment in the next four months - Scotland, East Anglia and
the west Midlands.
However, Business Strategies pointed out that manufacturing employment was
declining in the long term and only tended to pick up at the height of a
boom.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Carsberg urges crackdown on 'oppressive' sellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The law on consumer protection should be toughened to crack down on those
who use oppressive tactics to sell goods or services to vulnerable people,
Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, said yesterday.
He insisted also that the government's emphasis on deregulation should not
be seen as a campaign to weaken ways of protecting the customer.
'Economic policy, including policy on competition and consumer protection,
should be decided with the aim of achieving the greatest possible consumer
well-being,' he said. The OFT's review of consumer credit was an example of
how deregulation and consumer interests could coincide.
Publishing the Office of Fair Trading's annual report, Sir Bryan expressed
concern about the use of high-pressure techniques, such as those used to
sell security systems to older people living alone.
Powers for the director-general to take action against 'rogue traders' can
be exercised only if the sales agents persist in unsuitable but lawful
selling techniques. Sir Bryan said he had submitted proposals for reforming
this area of the law to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, late last year.
By highlighting the commitment in the Tory manifesto in 1992 to tighten the
law on 'rogue traders' Sir Bryan increased pressure on the government to
revise the legislation. Attempts to toughen this aspect of the law would
face fierce competition from other legislation in the limited parliamentary
time available for bills put forward by ministers.
However it is the sort of relatively limited and uncontroversial proposal
the government might suggest to a Tory MP who came high in the annual ballot
for parliamentary time to discuss bills put forward by backbenchers.
In terms of competition policy, Sir Bryan said he did not agree with every
decision made by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, but would not
specify where disagreements lay.
Earlier this year the commission concluded that neither the supply of ice
cream for immediate consumption nor the supply of recorded music operated
against the public interest.
Sir Bryan said it was the function of how the system worked - with the OFT
carrying out a preliminary inquiry and then referring some issues to the
commission for a fuller investigation - that there should be some cases
where the commission found against the industry and some where the industry
was cleared of acting against the public interest.
Of the six reports published last year, two - relating to exhaust-gas
analysing equipment and fine fragrances - were clearances.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Thomson attacks agents on discounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thomson, Britain's largest tour operator, yesterday attacked travel agents
selling its holidays at lower discounts than they offer on rival operators'
products.
Mr Charles Newbold, Thomson's managing director, said agents which offered
larger discounts on other operators' holidays would suffer as consumers
looked elsewhere.
Mr Newbold said his group would not tolerate any challenge to its market
dominance. 'We wish to make it clear that our position in the marketplace is
not negotiable. Anybody who attempts to usurp that position we would regard
as unwelcome.'
The three largest travel retail chains are offering discounts of up to 15
per cent on summer 1995 holidays. Lunn Poly, which is owned by Thomson, is
selling all its holidays at a 15 per cent discount.
Going Places and Thomas Cook, the second and third-largest chains
respectively, are offering 15 per cent discounts on holidays from Airtours
and Owners Abroad, but only 5 per cent on Thomson packages. Going Places is
owned by Airtours; Thomas Cook has financial links with Owners Abroad.
Mr Newbold said: 'Going Places is not a retailer of holidays. It is an
outlet for Airtours.'
Mr Kevin Welch, Going Places' marketing director, said his chain was
offering lower discounts on Thomson holidays because Thomson paid it a lower
commission of only 10 per cent.
Mr Welch denied Going Places acted merely as an outlet for Airtours'
holidays. He said Thomson's share of Lunn Poly's business was higher than
Airtours' share of Going Places' business.
Thomas Cook also said its discounts reflected the level of commission it
received from tour operators.
Thomson said it intended to sell its summer 1995 holidays at this year's
prices. The average cost of a summer 1995 holiday would be Pounds 350, the
same as this year and lower than the 1993 figure of Pounds 375.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Clarke sets out conditions for rates rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has agreed that it will be necessary to
raise interest rates 'promptly when signs of inflationary pressures emerge',
Treasury minutes of a meeting between Mr Clarke and Mr Eddie George,
governor of the Bank of England, showed yesterday.
But both agreed at the meeting on July 6 that there was no need yet to raise
base rates from 5.25 per cent.
The minutes show that the two agreed broadly about the state of the economy.
Mr Clarke agreed that 'interest rates might have to be raised sooner or
later', and appeared to be slightly more receptive to the idea of monetary
tightening than in the past, though his approach continued to be more
relaxed than that of Mr George.
Mr George said the economic data that had become available since their
previous meeting on June 8 had not changed his overall assessment of the
economy. The short-term outlook was of steady expansion without renewed
inflationary pressure. 'Questions remained about the outlook for inflation
further ahead,' he said. 'But, taken overall, these had not yet become more
pressing.'
The chancellor 'broadly agreed with the governor's assessment', adding that
'data over the last month had not caused him to revise his own assessment'.
The minutes report Mr George's conclusion 'that it was necessary to remain
especially alert to signs of cost pressures and to signs of an undue
acceleration of the expansion of activity'. But Mr Clarke summed up his
review of the economy by observing: 'It was now less likely that the economy
would grow too rapidly.'
Both men focused on the Confederation of British Industry's June industry
survey, which showed a sharp increase in the balance of companies expecting
to raise prices in the coming four months. 'These potential price pressures
would clearly need to continue to be watched very closely,' Mr George said.
Mr Clarke argued that the survey 'did not necessarily indicate a rise in
inflation'.
Manufacturers 'continued to face very strong competitive pressures, which
were likely to restrain prices increases', the chancellor said. 'Commodity
price rises were potentially worrying, but some commentators expected the
increases to ease off later this year. The overall picture remained one of
low inflationary pressures, with producer output price inflation down to 2
per cent, the lowest since 1967.'
Mr George said in summing up his position that 'the case remained for moving
(interest rates higher) sooner rather than later' in order to prevent
underlying inflation moving into, and staying in, the upper half of the
government's target range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent over the next two
years. But there was still not sufficient evidence to cause him to recommend
a change in policy.
City economists said the account of the meeting showed a rate rise was still
likely even though the chancellor did not want to rush the move. There is
general agreement that the most recent meeting between the chancellor and
the governor on July 28 decided against a rate increase.
Mr Don Smith, a UK economist with Midland Global Markets in London, said:
'The minutes suggest that the authorities need more than survey evidence to
justify an increase in rates, although clearly it appears that the bias of
their judgment is shifting towards favouring a rate increase.'

FT  11 AUG 94 / Refinery hit by fire to reopen next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Milford Haven refinery that was damaged by fire last month will resume
partial operation next month and full production in October.
Texaco, the owner, said yesterday that most of the damage was confined to
the units involved in an explosion, with other parts little affected by the
fire that followed.
Initial investigation has established that the fire was caused by the
failure of a pipe in the flare gas system which caused a release of vapour
and the subsequent explosion. The Health and Safety Executive and the
company are still clearing damaged areas for a full inspection.
The environmental group Friends of the Earth said 11 of the UK's most
hazardous industrial sites had failed to satisfy the Health and Safety
Executive over their plans for dealing with large industrial accidents.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Further 207 jobs shed at Swans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A further 207 job losses were yesterday announced at Swan Hunter, the
Tyneside shipbuilder, Chris Tighe writes. The redundancies affect workers
laid off since May 31.
The receivers injected a new urgency to the struggle to find a buyer for the
company by insisting that unless Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie - the
sole prospective bidder for the yard as a going concern - starts paying the
Pounds 200,000-a-month wage bill of the technical and design team by the end
of August, the team's 100 members will also be made redundant.
Price Waterhouse says talks with CMN have not yet yielded a deal. Mr Fred
Henderson of CMN insisted yesterday that the French company had an
'understanding' with the receivers, and that a deal hinged on the Ministry
of Defence agreeing to CMN's proposal to take on the contract for Swans'
last frigate, which is scheduled for completion in November, and
sub-contract it to the receiver.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Menem wants Iranian ambassador expelled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentine President Carlos Menem said yesterday that Iran's ambassador to
Buenos Aires should be expelled, after a judge investigating the bomb attack
against a Jewish community centre last month had issued arrest warrants for
four absent Iranian diplomats.
However, the final decision lay with the foreign ministry, he said on radio.
Last night the ambassador, Mr Habi Soleiman Pour, was called to the ministry
but made no comment afterwards.
Judge Juan Jose Galeano, on Tuesday night, accused seven Iranians - four
former and three current diplomats at Iran's embassy in Buenos Aires - of
having participated in both the bombing of the centre, which claimed 96
lives, and an attack on the Israeli embassy in Argentina, which killed 30 in
1992.
Mr Galeano also charged three Argentinians who are claimed to have
unwittingly reconditioned and sold the van used in the bombing. He accused
them of having used stolen car parts. One of those charged, Mr Ariel
Nitzcaner, is Jewish and a member of the bombed community centre. He claims
police tortured him to extract information.
Judge Galeano sent a preliminary report, late on Tuesday, to the Supreme
Court requesting it demand that the three current diplomats have their
immunity from prosecution waived.
Iran's foreign ministry yesterday protested over the arrest warrants to
Argentina's charge d'affaires in Tehran.
Argentina could take diplomatic action against Tehran if officials refused
to co-operate, Mr Guido di Tella, foreign minister, said. The government
would first request that the suspects 'appear as witnesses, abandon their
immunity, and only then, if they refuse, would we take measures.'
Possible action includes declaring the diplomats persona non grata and
ordering a reduction in embassy staff. Officials said cutting diplomatic
relations with Iran would only be appropriate if investigators established
Tehran's direct responsibility in the bombing. However, a European diplomat
said: 'Argentina is right that there may well be Iranian involvement but
whether they really have enough to prove a case in court is another
question.'

FT  11 AUG 94 / Shake-up at the top for Democrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton White House, increasingly anxious about the prospect of losses
in November, in congressional mid-term elections, has moved to shake up the
top of the national Democratic party.
Mr David Wilhelm will step down as party chairman in November and,
meanwhile, he will take a back seat to Mr Tony Coelho, a former rising star
in Congress from California, who will serve as a party special adviser.
The decision, finalised at a meeting of Mr Wilhelm and President Bill
Clinton on Tuesday, is very much the work of Mr Leon Panetta, now beginning
to exert effective control as new White House chief of staff.
In another move, Mr Panetta, also a former congressman from California, was
thought likely to recommend that Judge Abner Mikva of the federal appeals
court in Washington succeed Mr Lloyd Cutler as White House legal counsel,
when the latter's temporary secondment ends, probably next month.
Judge Mikva was a veteran congressman from Illinois before being appointed
to the bench by President Jimmy Carter in 1979 and, like Mr Coelho, served
on Capitol Hill with Mr Panetta.
Both moves represent the further assertion of the professional Democratic
politician over those, such as Mr Wilhelm, heavily involved in Mr Clinton's
1992 presidential campaign.
Mr Wilhelm, who is 37, has presided over losses by the Democrats in
state-wide and other elections since Mr Clinton was elected. The prognosis
for November is not good, with Republicans expecting to win 25 seats or more
in the House and hoping to take control of the Senate.
By 1989, Mr Coelho, now 51, was already a House Democratic whip and seemed
on track to be Speaker of the House. But he was forced to resign his seat to
stave off an ethics investigation of his personal financial dealings. This
arose from reports that he had borrowed money from a now defunct Californian
savings bank owned by a friend to purchase Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 65,000)
in junk bonds from Mr Michael Milken of Drexel Burnham Lambert. This year,
the Justice Department ended its investigation of the junk bond deal without
further action.
Mr Coelho is now president of Wertheim, Schroder, the Wall Street investment
bank.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's rebel-organised 'democratic convention' in the jungle ended with
delegates promising massive civil disobedience and protests if there is
fraud in the presidential election on August 21 but rejecting an armed
uprising, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
The convention, which ended on Tuesday, was hosted by the Zapatista Army of
National Liberation in the Lacandon jungle of the southern state of Chiapas.
Some 5,000 delegates from radical and leftist political organisations
throughout Mexico participated.
Sub-Comandante Marcos, the rebel spokesman, told delegates that the
Zapatistas would not be the first to take up arms. They launched a rebellion
in Chiapas in January and still control jungle areas.
The delegates left the jungle pledging to organise meetings and protests in
favour of a free vote on August 21. They said they would participate in the
elections, and vote against the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party.
Most are expected to vote for Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate
of the main leftist opposition.
Mr Ernesto Zedillo of the ruling party holds a commanding lead over his
nearest rivals, according to a well-regarded national opinion poll. His
support stood at 46 per cent, against 19 per cent for Mr Diego Fernandez de
Cevallos of the centre-right opposition, and 9 per cent for Mr Cardenas,
with 18 per cent undecided.

FT  11 AUG 94 / World Trade News: TNT and Ansett agree to pay record fines
for price-fixing

<TEXT>
Two of Australia's largest transport firms, TNT and its related company,
Ansett Transport Industries, were yesterday ordered to pay record fines
totalling AusDollars 5m (USDollars 3.6m) for price-fixing and collusion in
the air freight business.
The fines, AusDollars 4.1m for TNT and Dollars 900,000 for Ansett, were the
highest so far for anti-competitive business practices in Australia. The
previous highest penalty in a trade practices case was AusDollars 250,000.
The highest possible penalty for a corporation under the Trade Practices Act
is AusDollars 10m.
The case was brought against the companies in 1992 by the Trade Practices
Commission, the competition watchdog, alleging that the companies had agreed
to charge uniform prices for air freight services and not to poach each
other's customers.
The commission also alleged the companies deliberately tried to drive new
customers back to their original service provider by putting up prices or
deliberately providing a poor service. A case was also brought against Mayne
Nickless, another major transport group, as well as a number of other
individuals.
TNT and Ansett withdrew their defences against the case two weeks ago,
citing 'purely commercial reasons' but they did not accept guilt or
liability. They have also now agreed to pay the fines plus costs of more
than AusDollars 1m.
Mr Fred Miller, TNT chairman, said the company withdrew because of the
horrendous legal costs, which would have left TNT paying AusDollars 17m.

FT  11 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Oman hands big gas field to joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oman yesterday signed an agreement dedicating output of its natural gas
fields to Oman Liquefied Natural Gas (ONLG), the joint venture by the
state-owned oil company and a consortium of foreign energy companies.
The government of the Gulf state said that the deal represented a milestone
in the development of its proposed Dollars 9bn liquefied natural gas plan,
which is one of the biggest energy projects of the region.
Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), the state-owned oil company, said the
agreement 'demonstrates the resolve of the government of Oman and its
private oil industry partners to progress the project with due speed, and
bring the LNG to market as quickly as possible.'
The deal, covering 7,000bn cubic feet of proven and recoverable gas
reserves, is with Oman Liquefied Natural Gas (OLNG), a company established
this year by royal decree and 51 per cent owned by the Oman government.
Other partners are Shell (34 per cent), Total (6 per cent), Mitsubishi and
Mitsui (3 per cent each), Partex (2 per cent) and Itochu (1 per cent).
The gas fields are owned by the government and operated by PDO.
The LNG plant is to start in the year 2000 with annual output of 6.2m
tonnes. Preliminary work will start this year, and pre-qualified contractors
will be bidding to build the downstream facilities in the middle of next
year, so as to let the contract be awarded in 1996. The plant is to be at Al
Ghalilah, near Sur.
The LNG project is the largest industrial enterprise embarked on by Oman. It
envisages the production of 900m cu ft of gas a day in central Oman, and
transportation over 360km to the liquefication plant where it will be loaded
on to specially built tankers for shipment to customers in Asia and southern
Europe.
Much of the output is expected to go to Japan, the world's largest importer
of LNG.
Oman, whose oil reserves are dwindling, expects that, once the LNG plant is
in full operation, the value of its gas business will equal that of oil and
eventually overtake it.
A Dollars 5m pipeline to transport gas from Oman to India is under
consideration.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Hostility hits Senate debate on healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US healthcare reform debate got off, late on Tuesday, to a reasonably
civilised start in front of a relatively packed chamber, but hostility was
still rampant on the margins of the floor and away from it.
The US Senate has not for years been a forum of great oratory. Many senators
only bother to turn up to vote, rather than to listen.
Senator Jesse Helms, the right-wing Republican from North Carolina, tried to
prevent any debate at all. Both of his parliamentary ruses aimed at halting
the debate - amendments tagged on to unrelated issues  - were voted down.
But threats of Republican filibusters of the healthcare bill itself remained
in the air, most often voiced by Senator Gramm, of Texas, who was to be
accused by Mrs Hillary Clinton, in an interview, of 'opportunism'.
However, the cause of reform got an invaluable endorsement yesterday from
the American Association of Retired Persons, representing 33m Americans. It
backed both the House and Senate bills proposed by the Democrats and warned:
'If either bill is defeated, healthcare reform will be dead for years to
come.'
The bill sponsored by Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, received
qualified approval from the Congressional Budget Office. It found that the
impact would 'slightly reduce the federal budget deficit,' though expanded
insurance coverage 'would add to national health expenditures'.
The two principals Mr Mitchell and Senator Robert Dole, his Republican
opposite number, had tried to start the debate on a higher plane.
That is always easier for Mr Mitchell, from Maine, a man whose bland
demeanour and comforting New England twang belies his political toughness.
He has, after all, threatened to keep the Senate sitting throughout the
summer to complete action on his bill.
Mr Dole is more combative in public. He could not resist opening his speech
by repeating three times the Republican mantra, 'America has the best
healthcare system in the world'. But he, too, offered conciliation of a
kind. 'We believe there is a lot in our bill, a lot in Senator Mitchell's
bill, a lot in other bills. We could go in a back room and in two or three
days get a bill that could pass 99 to one.'
In her interview, Mrs Clinton accused Republicans like Mr Gramm of 'raving
about socialised medicine,' much as they had once opposed the creation of
social security and Medicare as exercises in doctrinaire left-wing
experimentation.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Senate votes cash to cut Jordan debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Congress yesterday tossed its contribution into the Middle East peace
pot when the Senate voted to set aside money for reducing Jordan's debt.
In voting for final passage of a Dollars 13.8bn (Pounds 9bn) foreign aid
bill, which now goes to President Bill Clinton for signature, the Senate
agreed to set aside Dollars 99m to reduce Jordan's debt burden.
Mr Clinton promised King Hussein of Jordan relief on Dollars 700m of debt,
and the Senate vote yesterday will allow him to achieve nearly a third of
that.
Peace in the Middle East has always been a central theme in justifying the
US aid budget to a reluctant Congress. The debt relief for Jordan, however,
has a direct link to the country's decision to end four decades of
hostility, while the lion's share of the US aid budget still goes as
military assistance to Egypt and Israel.
All told, Israel is allocated Dollars 3bn and Egypt Dollars 2.1bn, together
nearly 40 per cent of the total US aid budget.
The foreign aid bill also includes Dollars 50m for emergency assistance to
Rwandan refugees. Another Dollars 170m of Rwandan aid is to be included in a
defence spending bill, and congressional leaders have promised to consider
an additional Dollars 100m requested by Mr Clinton later this year.
Another measure ends the formal ban on US aid to Vietnam. Although no money
is set aside for Vietnam, the step could allow the US Export-Import Bank to
provide credits for US businesses there.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Sticks and carrots for Venezuela's banks: Selective
assistance and pressure is on offer to the troubled financial institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela's government, confronting a third phase of the banking crisis
which erupted in January, has refined its approach to dealing with ailing
financial institutions.
Instead of providing massive aid to the latest batch of troubled banks, or
simply closing them down as it did to others earlier this year, the
administration of President Rafel Caldera decided this week to apply a
selective programme of assistance and pressure.
The current crop of troubled banks is made up of eight institutions
suffering from varying problems, including three of the country's most
important commercial banks: Banco de Venezuela, the second-biggest bank,
Banco Consolidado and Banco Progreso.
Total deposits at these three banks were Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.09bn) at
the end of June, or about 20 per cent of all commercial bank deposits,
excluding those banks in which the government has already intervened.
Other banks in the current crisis are smaller institutions such as Banco
Republica, and Banco Italo-Venezolano, which a group of Venezuelan investors
bought from the government in 1991.
Even the new slimmed-down strategy does not come cheap. The government took
control of Banco de Venezuela on Monday, appointing its own president and
providing about Dollars 294m to recapitalise the bank. The bank, now 104
years old, was previously one of the country's most solid and prestigious
financial institutions. In mid-1993 it was taken over by a group headed by
Mr Jose Alvarez Stelling, who also controls Banco Consolidado.
The group included Mr Orlando Castro, a Cuban-born Venezuelan whose
Latinoamericana group of banking and insurance companies includes Banco
Progreso.
The government is providing a total of Dollars 429m for Banco Consolidado
and Banco Progreso. In return for what the government hopes will be
temporary support to these banks, the owners or major stockholders have
pledged some of their personal assets as guarantees.
The government is demanding that banks receiving assistance take several
measures, including the sale of domestic and foreign assets, mergers (in the
case of Progreso and Republica), and cost reductions.
The administration wants to avoid the impression, at all costs, that it is
'giving away' money to wealthy bankers, an image retained by many
Venezuelans from the bail-out programme earlier this year.
In the case of some of the smaller banks, the major shareholders have agreed
to raise their capital bases on their own, and can thus avoid direct
government control.
In contrast to the earlier two crises, the eight banks remain open and, so
far, depositors have not panicked.
The government believes it has learned from the previous phases of the
banking crisis. The first critical moment came in January, when Banco
Latino, then the country's second-largest bank, failed and was taken over by
the government. The impact of Latino's closure drained confidence in most of
the nation's banking system, caused runs on some institutions and convinced
the government that it should provide billions of dollars in assistance to
keep ailing banks afloat.
By mid-June, the administration realised that much of its assistance (which
reached Dollars 6bn to Dollars 7bn) was going into a financial black hole.
In some cases, major shareholders of banks receiving government aid
reportedly used part of the money to pay off obligations held by themselves
or associates. In others, government money was being recycled to other weak
banks.
At the same time, some banks benefiting from the bail-out cash did not take
steps to cut costs, re-capitalise or otherwise improve their financial
situation.
On June 14, in the second phase of the crisis, the government intervened and
shut eight financial institutions and their subsidiaries. By the end of the
month, it assumed de facto control over the entire financial system by
decree.
The government and the banking sector are trying to convince the public that
the latest strategy will work and that no other banks are in danger of
failing. Not many people are willing publicly to oppose the administration
on this delicate point.
Venezuela has 50 commercial banks, including nine that were taken over
earlier this year, and the eight receiving government attention this week.
In the past, owners of many Venezuelan banks were able to operate in an
environment where government supervision was ineffective, thus allowing
abuses to accumulate.
Poor management, excessively rapid growth in an inflationary environment,
huge unsupervised operations offshore and policies such as failing to write
off bad loans and making large loans to shareholders and associated
companies rank among the key elements.
This was exacerbated by an economic recession that began last year and is
deepening. This put heavy pressure on weak loan portfolios.
However, some businessmen and bankers believe that there are other weak
financial institutions in the system and that the only way to solve the
problem once and for all is to close the doors of troubled banks and
liquidate them.

FT  11 AUG 94 / World Trade News: A very faint ripping sound - A look at
restructuring in the European textiles industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the textile and clothing industry were not dominated by small companies,
a restructuring which has seen it account for 30 per cent of manufacturing
job losses in the European Union since 1988 might have caused more of a
stir.
Instead, with relative quietness, productivity has risen by 25 per cent in
the clothing industry and 17 per cent in textiles - against a manufacturing
average of 10 per cent - production has been cut, and 600,000 jobs have been
shed.
There have been scuffles. A group of senior British industrialists is due to
meet Sir Patrick Mayhew, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, today to try
to persuade the British government to withdraw its support for a Pounds 157m
(Dollars 243m) textile plant near Belfast which the industrialists say will
lead to further job losses.
But by and large the sector's contraction has been accompanied by little
politicking.
Restructuring has brought a slicker, leaner industry, which now faces the
phasing out of protective quotas under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement with
expectations of a gradual and partial decline, rather than annihilation.
A more severe future was possible. Even with the MFA in place, the industry
has been confronted by its inability to compete on cost with producers in
low-cost countries, particularly in Asia.
Textile and clothing production has traditionally been labour intensive.
European labour is expensive labour. And it is labour costs that have been
the main cause of the European industry's loss of competitiveness, concludes
a recent study for the European Commission.
As a result, clothing and textile imports into the EU have risen sharply.
Excluding imports arising from subcontracting by European producers outside
the EU, clothing imports into the EU rose by 80 per cent between 1988 and
1993.
Within textiles, it has been the earliest stages in the production chain and
the least technical areas of production that have been hardest hit. European
consumption of very basic fabrics, especially synthetic and cotton fabrics,
is now dominated by imports. For other fabrics, the loss of market share to
imports is progressing up the textiles production chain, with fibre
producers the first to suffer, followed by spinners and weavers.
The finishing and dying of fabrics remains largely unassailed by direct
competition because of its greater technological complexity, but it is still
feeding a contracting market thanks to the displacement of clothing
manufacturers through imports. Moreover, the entire industry has suffered
the effects of the European recession. The EU is still the largest market in
the world for clothing, and, with more than 50 per cent of textile output
sold to clothing producers, the fortunes of textiles and clothing producers
are inextricably linked.
Upwards of another 20 per cent of textile output goes to producers of home
furnishings and carpets, and a further 20 per cent to industry, much of it
to cars and construction.
However, although recovery will help the industry it will not reverse the
steady decline in spending on clothing and footwear as a proportion of total
consumption.
The industry's response has been two-fold.
Some producers have secured themselves and their markets through targeting
niche or high-quality markets unlikely to be satisfied through low-cost mass
production. More generally, producers have played to their strengths, in
terms of proximity and versatility, by shifting towards just-in-time
delivery, in short runs, of products made to customer's own specifications -
a trend particularly noticeable in the UK.
Another approach, in which German producers have led the way, has been to
move away from integrated production and, instead, subcontract from low-cost
countries on the European rim, particularly eastern Europe, but also North
Africa and Turkey.
The ending of the MFA, as agreed in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks,
is scheduled to take place in four phases over 10 years, beginning on
January 1 1995, when 16 per cent of quotas will be removed. Officials from
both the European Commission and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
foresee little difficulty in identifying this first 16 per cent, although
there may be some wrangling within the EU over whether any effective quotas
should be offered up, by way of good faith.
Europe will be able to choose which quotas it removes at each stage. And
when the phase-out bites harder, as further quotas are removed and existing
ones raised at the beginning of 1998, 2002 and 2005, the industry will not
be without some safeguards against real injury to markets. Clothing and
textiles are to be incorporated into the Gatt, which does allow quotas in
cases of serious damage to industries.
But there can be no change to the scale and pace of the phase-out and the
end of the arrangement will exacerbate the effects of global trends on the
European industry.
By type of product, industry experts Kurt Salmon Associates point to the bed
linen and blankets sector as the next to be hit by heavy competition from
imports, followed in the second half of the 1990s by the more
technologically sophisticated curtain and table linen sectors.
And by country, it will be those producers, predominantly in southern
Europe, who have so far escaped the need to restructure because of their
lower costs, that will be hardest hit.
However, for Europe's textile negotiators, the lifting of the MFA is barely
a hardship at all. They have the huge growth in exports from China to worry
about - and that was never covered by the MFA.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Israel and PLO agree to speed talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday agreed on a
series of high-level meetings to speed negotiations after a tough and tense
summit at the Erez crossing point into Gaza.
The meetings will address the extension of Palestinian self rule from
Gaza-Jericho to the rest of the West Bank and Palestinian national
elections.
The summit between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman
Yassir Arafat followed recent attacks in which each side accused the other
of failing to live up to the pledges of their peace accords.
The PLO said Israel had reneged on promises to release Palestinian prisoners
and is delaying implementing extension of self-rule from Gaza-Jericho across
the rest of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Mr Arafat was furious when Israel signed an interim peace deal with Jordan
and recognised King Hussein's special role as guardian of Islamic sites in
future talks over Jerusalem. The PLO claims occupied Arab East Jerusalem as
its political capital.
Israel in turn accused the PLO of not containing violence against Israeli
soldiers who remain in Gaza.
Israeli officials said Mr Warren Christopher, US Secretary of State, who met
Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat during his regional shuttle earlier this week, had
been sympathetic to Palestinian frustrations and had encouraged Israel to
revive the momentum of peace talks with the PLO.
The tortuous negotiations between Israel and the PLO have been in marked
contrast to the smooth and speedy Israeli-Jordanian peace talks.
Jordan and Israel continued making swift progress in talks yesterday.
Israeli radio said the two sides agreed to joint promotion of regional
tourism and would produce a joint tourist brochure within 10 days. They also
agreed to begin connecting their electricity grids next week.
After the summit Mr Rabin said he had expressed concern about Palestinian
violence against Israelis and stressed Israel's abiding focus on security.
Mr Rabin strongly criticised remarks by Mr Farouk Kadoumi, PLO Foreign
minister, who called on Monday for the destruction of Israel.
'I hope that on the Israeli side and the Palestinian side tension and
violence will be reduced, and statements that undermine or are against what
we are committed to will not be heard,' he said.
A more confident Mr Arafat, who last week warned of an 'explosion' unless
Israel fulfilled its obligations.

FT  11 AUG 94 / By-election threat to NZ government: South Island voters
could end National's majority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christchurch may be the largest city in New Zealand's South Island, but it
is not usually the hub of the nation's political life. This week is
different.
For the past few days, top politicians such as Mr Bill Birch, the finance
minister, Ms Helen Clark, the embattled leader of the opposition Labour
party, and Mr Jim Anderton, who broke away from Labour to form a coalition
of five left-leaning minority parties called the Alliance, have been rubbing
shoulders there. Jim Bolger, the prime minister, arrived last night.
The reason for this turnout is a by-election to be held on Saturday in the
Selwyn constituency which threatens to end New Zealand's fragile political
stability. According to the latest opinion polls, Mr Bolger's National party
could lose the seat, and with it, the majority that has allowed National to
govern for nine months.
Mr Bolger, anxious to deter voters from risking this option, has said that
it would be 'a disaster'. A general election would be one possible outcome,
but by no means guaranteed. What is certain, he claims, is that financial
markets would take fright, causing the New Zealand dollar to fall,
inflationary pressures to mount, and interest rates to rise.
By contrast, Mr Anderton - whose party looks most likely to snatch the seat
from National - has talked soothingly of allowing the Bolger government to
remain in office. The opposition parties would simply insist that it act in
a consultative manner, passing only those measures on which consensus had
been achieved. 'They could govern,' he says 'but they just couldn't do what
they want.'
Last month, when Ms Ruth Richardson, the former finance minister who held
Selwyn for National at the November general election, announced that she was
quitting politics, few observers thought matters would pan out this way.
Selwyn is a curious constituency, encircling Christchurch in horseshoe
fashion. Historically, the electorate has been dominated by Canterbury
Plains farming communities, who tended to back National.
But boundary changes before the general election last November added parts
of Christchurch's urban hinterland, such as Belfast and Kaiapoi. These are
blue-collar communities which traditionally vote Labour. About half the
current Selwyn electorate receives some form of welfare payment, according
to census data, and the threatened closure of local hospitals under the
government's health service reforms has been a dominant issue in the
by-election campaign.
The boundary changes may partly explain why Ms Richardson saw her majority
cut to just 888 votes last November from more than 5,400 in 1990.
Nevertheless, when she stepped down last month, few commentators thought the
Bolger government would be at risk. National, it was argued, would retain
its 'bedrock' rural support.
Non-National voters, angry at the government's squeeze on welfare payments
and slow to feel the benefits of economic recovery, were expected to split
their protest vote between Labour and the Alliance.
An AGB-McNair opinion poll, based on a 400-voter sample and taken on Monday
night, showed National set to win 30 per cent of the vote, the Alliance 27
and Labour 9. Immediately after Ms Richardson resigned, the figures were 33
per cent, 15 per cent, and 23 per cent respectively.
Since then, the Trade Union Federation, the umbrella body for about a dozen
unions, has thrown its weight behind the Alliance. This, the TUF stresses,
is not a long-term defection from Labour, but the only way to stop National.
The Labour-to-Alliance shift is not hard to understand. Mr Anderton
promulgates old-style 'tax and spend' policies and has played his cards
adroitly since the last election when his party won more than 18 per cent of
the vote but only two of the 99 seats.
Labour, by contrast, has big internal problems. Ms Clark ousted Mr Mike
Moore as leader soon after the election defeat. But her personal popularity
rating is much lower than her predecessor's, and Labour's
financially-conservative but socially-liberal policies are tough to sell. Ms
Clark calls Labour's approach 'responsible, but with a heart'.
For many reform-weary New Zealanders who do not believe that National's
quest for financial virtue is building a desirable society, this is fudge.
If the Alliance wins the seat on Saturday, National would be reduced to 49
seats, while Labour would have 45, the Alliance three and NZ First two. Mr
Peter Tapsell, the speaker, is drawn from Labour ranks, and has made clear
that his primary responsibility would be to maintain the status quo. In the
event of a confidence vote, for example, he would support a Bolger
government. Mr Anderton has said the Alliance would do likewise.
Whether this would still allow Mr Bolger to plead 'an inability to govern'
and ask the governor-general to call a general election, is debatable. Asked
yesterday about this, Mr Bolger said it was 'not currently in my thinking'.
In any case, such a request might be rebuffed; the governor-general might
very well ask Ms Clark, as leader of the biggest opposition party, to try to
form a government.
Further clouding matters is New Zealand's decision to move to a proportional
representation system. Under this, half the MPs will represent specific
constituencies and the remainder will be drawn from party lists. The move
was supported by a majority of voters last November, but the administrative
changes will not be completed until next year.
An election under the new system would benefit minor parties such as the
Alliance and, given the wafer-thin majorities at present, most pundits
believe that the country would go the polls under the new system in 1995.

FT  11 AUG 94 / S Africa's image problem makes investors wary: Fear of
labour unrest and exchange controls mean foreigners are still nervous of
taking the plunge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
When it comes to attracting new foreign investment, South Africa has an
image problem.
Potential investors like the rhetoric of the country's new government, which
constantly promises fiscal discipline; but they are waiting to see intention
translated into action. The retention of exchange controls and daily
headlines proclaiming a crisis of industrial unrest have done much to
perpetuate the image of South Africa as a high-risk destination for
international capital.
This is not entirely fair. However nervous whites may grumble about striking
black checkout girls or car workers, the country is not wracked by
industrial strife - or at least, not any more than normal for this time of
year. July and August are traditionally the 'strike season' in South Africa,
the period every year when collective bargaining reaches its peak in the
mining, engineering, motors and other industries.
This year's disputes appear to have captured more than their fair share of
publicity for two reasons: strikes have provided just about the only news
available during the political lull which followed the April 27 elections;
and whites have seized on the unrest as a focus for dissatisfaction with the
new government which began to surface once economic realities dispersed the
happy glow of the peaceful transition.
But whatever the popular perception, there is no real evidence of a
fundamental shift in strike patterns, or a serious upsurge in militant
action. According to Johannesburg labour consultants Andrew Levy and
Associates, 233,066 man-days were lost to industrial action in July this
year, higher than in the previous two years but less than a third of the
figure for 1991 (752,655).
Some rise in strike action may have been inevitable. With the economy
finally recovering after four years of recession and real wage cuts, there
is substantial pent-up demand for wage rises.
Equality at the ballot box has also fuelled new demands for the narrowing of
wage differentials between the (almost entirely white) management and the
(almost entirely black) shop-floor. According to the Cape Town-based Labour
Research Service, which has close links to the unions, the average pay of
the directors of South Africa's 70 largest public companies is 47 times that
of the companies' labourers.
A crisis of union leadership may also be exacerbating unrest. The Congress
of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the largest federation, has lost
nearly 100 top unionists to the government and the private sector in recent
months, and many who remain lack the authority to push for unpopular
settlements. Still, most unionists and employers believe all the big
disputes - in engineering, the car industry and mining - will be settled,
and that no national general strike is likely. Cosatu had threatened a
general strike in the industrial heartland around Johannesburg last Monday,
but abandoned the threat after talks with President Nelson Mandela.
That is the good news. South Africa is not a labour battleground (though if
disputes drag on into the autumn, this view would have to be revised). But
the bad news for investors is South African labour is expensive in relation
to productivity. According to figures compiled by Pretoria's National
Productivity Institute, hourly manufacturing wages in South Africa, at
Dollars 4.78 in 1993 dollars, rank just below wage rates in Singapore and
South Korea (where productivity is far higher) and far above countries such
as Malaysia (Dollars 1.80), Thailand (Dollars 0.71) and the Philippines
(Dollars 0.68).
With most manufacturing employers likely to agree to above-inflation wage
demands this year, South Africa's competitive position could worsen unless
steps are taken to improve productivity. In the meantime, the image problem
will persist - and foreign investors so desperately needed to create jobs
may remain wary.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Maverick may bring Beijing's anger on Hong Kong business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong entrepreneur, has set fashion trends in China with
his polo shirts, and publishing trends in his home territory with a rough
and ready magazine. Now, he is setting a new standard for dealings between
Hong Kong companies and the Chinese leadership.
The case of Mr Lai is providing clues for Hong Kong business people wary of
their fate after 1997, when China regains control of the territory. Having
berated Chinese Premier Li Peng and called him a 'turtle's egg', a serious
insult in Chinese, he is now considering his future as non-executive
chairman of Giordano, the casual clothing company which is one of Hong
Kong's most successful retailers within China.
Things are never simple with Mr Lai. One partner in Giordano is
Beijing-backed China Resources, which would not want his casual clothing
company punished too harshly. However, on Monday, officials closed the
company's Beijing store, and there are fears for its 28 other outlets in
China.
Mr Lai's likely resignation is being seen as an attempt to douse the fires
he stoked with an abusive letter to Chinese premier Li Peng - a two-page
stream-of-consciousness that heaped scorn on the leader's worth,
intelligence and even looks. It was printed in his Next magazine, which has
a weekly circulation of about 170,000 and is avidly read by those with a
thirst for outspoken politics, gore and gossip.
The 45-year-old Mr Lai has recently had little to do with the day-to-day
running of Giordano in which he has a a 36 per cent stake. But his
resignation could prove to be a step backwards for Hong Kong.
By eliminating all effective ties with Giordano, Mr Lai would be separating
his beliefs from the fortunes of the company, a move many say was prompted
by the closure of the month-old Beijing store.
Officially, Giordano says the Beijing outlet was closed because 'certain
licensing formalities had not been completed'; but observers are linking it
with Mr Lai's virulent open letter. They fear Beijing is cracking the whip
on Hong Kong businesses.
There is barely a company in Hong Kong which is not doing business in China,
or plans to do so. For retailers and manufacturers of consumer goods
especially, a market of 1.2bn people is the main reason to stay in the
relatively saturated Hong Kong marketplace.
Mr Lai has never been above a degree of co-operation with China where it
suits. China Resources (Holdings), the trading company controlled by China's
Foreign Trade and Economic Commission (the same body that closed the Beijing
store), owns a 10 per cent holding in Giordano and is the likely beneficiary
of Mr Lai's controlling voting rights.
He may find himself called to do a little more back-peddling next March,
when he plans to float Next Magazine. Investors may prove harder to please
than readers, and shy from a company which so blatantly attacks the
leadership when 1997 is just around the corner.
Giordano has tapped demand in China for primary coloured polo shirts, jeans
and sweat-shirts. The value-for-money concept, of reasonable price tags
attached to quality clothes, has ensured the chain's popularity on both
sides of the border and helped stimulate profits. Last year the company
recorded net profits of HKDollars 137.6m (Pounds 11.6m), compared with
HKDollars 115m in 1992. First half earnings this year rose 58 per cent to
HKDollars 85m.
Mr Lai himself is the Hong Kong story made flesh. Leaving school young and
with little by way of qualifications he wound up in Hong Kong and swiftly
developed an appetite for philosophy, commerce and politics. His
conversation can be peppered with insights and words gleaned from Adam Smith
and Milton Friedman or it can be colourful, unstructured invective. His
estimated personal wealth has been put as high as HKDollars 2bn.
He was incensed by the events of June 1989, when tanks rolled into Tiananmen
Square to crush the democracy movement, and Next Magazine - started up two
years later - was born out of this anger. Mr Lai has said while the group
will adjust its editorial policy it will not 'kowtow to get business going'.

<TEXT>
Ms Taslima Nasreen, the controversial Bangladeshi feminist writer subjected
to death threats by Moslem fundamentalists, has fled Bangladesh out of fear
for her life.
Ms Nasreen arrived in Sweden yesterday after leaving Bangladesh secretly on
Tuesday. Her departure could harm Bangladesh's international reputation by
highlighting the fundamentalists' power to inflame popular passions and
incite violence.
It could also embroil the government of Mrs Khaleda Zia, the prime minister,
in a dangerous row with fundamentalist groups because government officials
appear to have helped arrange Ms Nasreen's departure.
Ms Nasreen, 33, a divorced former doctor, urged women to fight for economic,
social and sexual equality with men. In one poem, she described men as
cockroaches, wasps and poisonous ants.
While these views angered Bangladesh's Moslem clergy, they only became
widely known last year after Ms Nasreen published Lajja (Shame), a novel
about the plight of Bangladesh's Hindu minority who suffer discrimination
from Moslems. The Bangladeshi government banned the book, but it became a
best-seller in India.
The final straw for the fundamentalists was the publication of an interview
in May in the Indian newspaper The Statesman in which Ms Nasreen was quoted
as calling for revision of the Koran. Ms Nasreen said she was misquoted, but
radical clerics called for her public execution.
On June 4 the authorities ordered Ms Nasreen's arrest on blasphemy-related
charges. Thousands of fundamentalists demonstrated almost daily demanding
her punishment.  Secular student groups arranged counter-demonstrations. Ms
Nasreen went into hiding and surrendered to the courts only last week. For
her own protection, she was placed under heavy police guard at her home in
Dhaka.
Her departure leaves Bangladesh in turmoil. Yesterday fundamentalist groups,
led by Jamaat-e-Islami, the leading Islamic political party, vowed to attack
Mrs Zia's government for letting Ms Nasreen leave. Jamaat-e-Islami has had
little support from voters, unlike Mrs Zia's Bangladesh National Party and
the Awami League, the main opposition party. But this has not stopped
Islamic clerics trying to extend their influence.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, yesterday ruled out a cut
in interest rates in the foreseeable future.
'Our judgment on the economic situation remains unchanged in the light of
several positive indicators,' Mr Mieno said in Tokyo.
He repeated his oft-stated belief that the economy is headed for recovery,
though he expressed caution about the pace of the upturn.
The economy has already registered strong growth in the first part of the
year; unusually warm summer weather has helped boost consumption in the past
few months.
That seasonal benefit would be reflected in faster-than-expected growth for
the current quarter, Mr Mieno added, but he warned that when this temporary
stimulus had passed, the economy would still be beset by potential risks
such as a high yen and weak capital spending.
The governor's remarks appeared to confirm what many analysts have suspected
for some time: that the bank sees the present historically low official
discount rate of 1.75 per cent as the bottom of the present cycle, and as
the economy recovers, the next likely move in rates will be upwards.
The bank has steadfastly resisted pressure at home and abroad to cut
interest rates in the wake of the sharp appreciation of the yen in the past
few months, arguing that monetary policy was consistent with the needs of
the domestic economy.
Yesterday, Mr Mieno noted with evident satisfaction the recent slight
decline in the Japanese currency's value.
But the bank's optimistic assessment of the country's prospects has not been
shared by all analysts, including some of the government's own economists.
Last month's quarterly assessment by the bank stated confidently that the
Japanese economy was 'heading for recovery'.
But it came just a week before the publication of a wide-ranging analysis by
the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) that pointed only to 'bright
economic spots', and avoided stating unequivocally that recovery was under
way.
The EPA's monthly report for August, to be published tomorrow, is expected
to be equally cautious.
Some analysts have accused the bank of deliberately adopting a more
optimistic tone about recovery prospects specifically to defend its
opposition to a cut in borrowing costs.
Mr Mieno rejected such allegations, saying it was 'putting the cart before
the horse' to suggest that policy dictated economic analysis rather than
vice-versa.

FT  11 AUG 94 / TB/HIV epidemic 'could hit Asia'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
As many as 12m lives could be saved in developing countries during the next
decade if the industrialised world increased annual spending on tuberculosis
programmes by between Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.6m) and Dollars 150m, the
World Health Organisation said yesterday.
The world's foreign aid agencies spend only Dollars 16m a year on
controlling TB. The WHO itself spent only Dollars 7m on its TB programme
this year.
Yet it can cost as little as Dollars 13 to cure someone of the disease, Dr
Arata Kochi, programme manager of the WHO's tuberculosis programme, told the
10th international conference on Aids in Yokohama.
TB and HIV threatened to combine to create a huge epidemic in Asia that
would dwarf that sweeping Africa and other parts of the world, said Dr
Kochi.
Annual TB/HIV deaths in Asia would surpass Africa by the end of the decade,
he added.
Over the next 10 years, the cost to the Asian economies of the Aids epidemic
alone could reach Dollars 52bn, according to the WHO.
Dr Tadao Shimao, president of the Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association, said
that over the same period TB and Aids together would kill more people in
Asia than the numbers equal to the combined populations of the cities of
Singapore, Beijing, Yokohama and Tokyo.
About a third of the world's population carried the TB bacilli, although
most never become ill, said Dr Kochi.
However, an HIV-positive person was 30 times more likely to develop TB than
a non-infected individual, and was then capable of passing TB to
non-HIV-positive family and friends.
'This raises the frightening prospect that the general population now no
longer has nothing to fear from close proximity to HIV-positive people. They
are at risk (of contracting TB) simply by breathing the same air as
(HIV-positive) people with TB,' warned Dr Shimao.
The WHO estimated that in some parts of Asia, such as Thailand, India and
Nepal, as many as 70 per cent of Aids patients develop TB.
The median life-expectancy of an HIV-positive TB patient is six months. TB
already kills nearly 2m every year in Asia.
The organisation estimates that an additional package of between Dollars
1.5bn and Dollars 2.9bn would be required each year to set up and maintain a
basic programme for HIV prevention.
Funding for the WHO's Global Programme on Aids has fallen from a peak of
Dollars 90m a year to only Dollars 70m in 1994.

For the first time since the start of Germany's election campaign, an
opinion poll suggests that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union might be able to form a majority government with its present Free
Democratic party allies. The two parties would poll a combined 50.2 per cent
of the vote if October's election were held next Sunday, the Allensbach
Institute reported. While the CDU's popularity is rising, more important has
been a recovery in the fortunes of the FDP who have seen their support grow
since June. The latest poll, conducted in August, puts the CDU on 40.9 per
cent and the FDP on 9.3 per cent. The gains were made at the expense of the
opposition Social Democratic party, which the poll gives 32.7 per cent of
the vote, and the left-wing Greens/Bundnis 90 party 10.1 per cent. The
former communists, the PDS, would poll 3.7 per cent.

The Dutch caretaker finance minister, Mr Wim Kok, was yesterday putting the
finishing touches to a three-party government coalition agreement that will
make him the next prime minister, more than 100 days after the May general
election. The three parties that are aiming to govern - Mr Kok's Labour
party, the right-wing Liberals and the left-of-centre D66 - will be asked to
approve the plan over the next few days, and ministers are expected to be
appointed next week. The proposed left-right coalition, a new departure in
Dutch politics, will relegate the Christian Democrats of prime minister Ruud
Lubbers to the opposition benches for the first time in modern Dutch
politics. Mr Kok's plan calls for Fl 18bn (Pounds 6.59bn) in spending cuts
over four years, around a third of them falling controversially on social
security. University education is also set for a shake-up. Students would
continue to receive funding up to their bachelor's degree, but would have to
take out loans to finance master's and doctoral degrees.

Six more suspected Islamist militants were detained by French police
yesterday as part of the nationwide anti-terrorism clampdown. They were
arrested in the morning in Paris, Lille, Lyons and Marseilles, following a
series of swoops and spot-checks on vehicles and individuals by French
police since last week's terrorist attack by militant Moslem fundamentalists
on a French embassy housing compound in Algiers. More than 110 people have
been held for questioning in France in the current clampdown. The Algerian
authorities yesterday claimed to have identified the ringleader of last
week's attack as Mr Djamel Zitouni. They claimed that the 26-year-old Mr
Zitouni, said to be a member of the banned Islamic Salvation Front, was also
responsible for the recent murders of two French people and two nationals
from the former Yugoslavia. They did not say whether he had yet been
arrested.

<TEXT>
A 35-38 per cent decline this year in Russia's industrial production was
predicted in a central bank report this week. However, because industry
accounts for a decreasing portion of the economy, gross national product was
expected to fall by only 10 per cent. The report, the bank's annual public
declaration of its goals, sets a target of reducing inflation to 8 per cent
a month by the end of the year. Earlier this year the Russian central bank,
whose chairman was once an enthusiastic provider of soft credits to the
country's industry and agriculture, has since tightened its monetary policy
considerably. This has had moderate success in reining in runaway inflation,
but the economy now faces a new inflationary threat. Unable to easily obtain
credits from the government, Russian enterprises have extended loans to one
another, creating a growing mountain of debt which threatens to paralyse the
financial system. In this week's report the central bank suggests that
commercial banks should be asked to participate in the increasingly urgent
efforts of the Russian government to find a solution to the issue of
inter-enterprise debt.

The United Nations threatened to call in air strikes yesterday on both Serb
and Bosnian positions for exchanging artillery fire within the weapons
exclusion zone around Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. UN commander Lt Gen Sir
Michael Rose accused both sides of 'serious breaches' and estimated that 400
artillery shells and mortar rounds had landed within and just outside the
zone. UN officials say Moslem-led government forces fired into the
12-mile-wide zone from the north while Serb gunners returned fire from
within the zone, aiming at Bosnian-held Visoko and other targets. This is
the first time the Bosnian government has been warned since the zone was set
up this spring. Its forces have become more assertive since Belgrade cut
ties with the Bosnian Serbs last week following the latter's refusal to
accept a western-brokered peace plan. The Bosnian Serbs have faced
increasing military pressure from Moslem forces, who appear to be gaining
ground.
The Bosnian army yesterday cornered the breakaway Moslem enclave of Bihac.
Troops advanced further into the northwestern zone as several thousand
refugees continued to flee into Croatia. Mr Fikret Abdic, the rebel leader,
rejected Bosnian amnesty offers. His chief military commander was killed by
a shell yesterday as the Bosnian army built on gains made on Tuesday, when
it captured two towns on the Croatian border.

Norway's consumer price index rose by 0.2 per cent in July from June, the
country's central statistics bureau said yesterday. This brought the
year-on-year inflation rate to 1.4 per cent. According to the bureau, the
rise in food prices recorded in the past couple of months has slowed, with
an annual increase of 1.3 per cent in July, compared with 1.8 per cent in
June. Meanwhile, oil and tobacco showed noteworthy price rises in July. The
bureau said tobacco rose because of higher taxation, oil because of higher
crude prices.
Commercial bankruptcies in Switzerland rose 6.2 per cent to 580 in July from
a year earlier, the highest number since 1974 when Schweizerischer Verband
Creditreform, an association of Swiss banks, began collecting data.
Creditreform, which gives banks information on borrowers' creditworthiness,
also reported 3,326 commercial bankruptcy proceedings in the first seven
months, a decline of 3.3 per cent from the same period last year.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Moldova deal hit by Russian spoilers: A look at the
complications for Russian army's withdrawal from TransDnestr
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years after a bitter civil war which at one point threatened to draw in
neighbouring Romania and Ukraine, the break-away TransDnestr region of
Moldova is in danger again of becoming a lightning rod for the discontent of
ethnic Russians transformed into an embittered minority by the collapse of
the Soviet Union.
But this time the governments of Moldova and Russia, which yesterday
appeared to be on the verge of an agreement for the withdrawal of Russian
troops, are seeking compromise.
Russian and Moldovan officials, meeting yesterday in the Moldovan capital of
Kishinev in the tenth round of negotiations aimed at smoothing military,
political and economic relations between the two states, were reportedly
close to an agreement on the most contentious issue: the withdrawal of the
Russian-controlled 14th army from the TransDnestr region.
The 14th army backed Russian-speaking separatist leaders when TransDnestr
violently split off from Moldova two years ago. The Slavic Russians and
Ukrainians, who form a majority in the TransDnestr but are outnumbered in
Moldova as a whole, refused to be a part of the newly independent state
which they feared would eventually re-unite with ethnically kindred Romania.
Russia, which has claimed the right to defend ethnic Russians beyond its own
borders, at first offered political support to the TransDnestrian
separatists, but now appears to attach more value to restoring normal
relations with Moldova.
However, ethnic Russian politicians and soldiers in the TransDnestr are
refusing to go along with the Russian-Moldovan rapprochement.
Like the defiant Bosnian Serbs, who have refused to toe Belgrade's new
political line, ethnic Russian politicians and soldiers in the separatist
TransDnestr region, which is dominated by Slavic Russians and Ukrainians,
are expressing a mounting sense of betrayal. Accustomed, when the Soviet
Union was still intact, to acting as Moscow's favoured envoys in a
non-Russian land they looked to Russia for support when they launched their
separatist bid two years ago.
They have reacted to the growing rapprochement between Russia and Moldova
over the past few months first with bewilderment and now with anger.
The danger that the Russian soldiers and politicians in the TransDnestr
could become a rallying cause for the neo-imperialist political opposition
to President Boris Yeltsin's government in Moscow is heightened by the
wide-spread popularity of General Alexander Lebed, the commander of Russian
forces in the TransDnestr.
The Russian ministry of defence announced plans last week to reassign the
outspoken general, who became the darling of hardliners last month after he
told Izvestia, a Moscow daily, that Russia needed a military dictator 'like
Chile's Pinochet' and described Mr Yeltsin as 'a minus'.
The discontent of TransDnestrian politicians manifested itself yesterday
when embittered TransDnestrian officials walked out of talks between Russian
and Moldovan representatives.
A withdrawal of the 14th army will 'automatically lead to an imbalance of
forces in the region and to a new spiral of confrontation', General Stefan
Kitsak, the TransDnestrian representative, warned.
Although often themselves at odds with the ramshackle TransDnestrian
government, the equally disenchanted officers of the 14th army are also
emerging as potential spoilers of a Russian-Moldovan concordat.
Colonel Mikhail Bergman, a 14th army officer and ardent supporter of Gen
Lebed, has been battering the Kremlin with an increasingly passionate series
of accusations. He told Russian newspapers this week that the ministry of
defence had been bribed by arms dealers to dismiss the fire-brand general
and darkly warned that if Gen Lebed was ousted Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's political future could be in jeopardy.
'Unless the president stands up for Lebed the way Lebed stood up for him, he
won't remain in office for more than three months,' Col Bergman told Reuters
in a reference to Gen Lebed's critical support of Mr Yeltsin during the
failed hardline coup in Moscow three years ago.
Col Bergman, whose fiery statements could strike a chord in Russia's poorly
paid, demoralised and increasingly disorganised army, said that Gen Lebed
'will be president of Russia'.
'I tell you that as a fact. In Russia, people who are disgraced have always
come to power.'
This week a meeting of 14th army officers responded to Moscow's attempt to
disband their army and reassign Gen Lebed with the declaration that they
would not leave the break-away region.
Some observers fear that the defiant stance of both TransDnestrian officials
and 14th army officers could - despite the best efforts of Moscow and
Kishinev - lead to a fresh outbreak of fighting in the impoverished region.
If Moscow's already tenuous control over the 14th army weakens further many
of the 8,000 soldiers and officers and their massive arsenal could fall into
the hands of the bellicose TransDnestrian government.
The mounting tension in the area is an unwanted distraction for both Russia
and Moldova, whose governments would prefer to focus on painful but
increasingly successful economic reforms. However, the increasingly volatile
statements of politicians and soldiers in the TransDnestr suggests that
Moscow, which helped to ignite the separatist flames in Moldova two years
ago, will not find them so easy to extinguish now.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Renault sale sparks mixed union feelings: Battle lines
forming in a high-profile privatisation struggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robert Hue, general secretary of the French Communist party, yesterday
deployed all the symbolism he could muster in his attempt to put the brakes
on the privatisation of Renault, star of the country's public sector and
erstwhile stronghold of its workers' movement.
Speaking at the now-disused Boulougne Billancourt plant in western Paris,
near where the first Renault car was built at the end of last century, he
condemned the proposal to sell the motor group.
'At the time when France is celebrating the 50th anniversary of its
liberation, the government is undoing the work of De Gaulle,' he said,
referring to the nationalisation of the car company after the second world
war. 'We declare our total and resolute opposition to this project and will
use all our force to stop it.' He warned of job losses and promised a
campaign against privatisation after the holidays.
Despite the symbolism, however, it is less clear how much substance lies
behind the threat from the Communist party and some of France's trade
unions. The influence of both has waned and, for most observers, the
proposed privatisation is more likely to stand as a landmark in the
government's withdrawal from a dirigiste economic tradition than a victory
for union opponents.
'I don't think the unions will prevent privatisation,' says Mr Eric
Michelis, motor industry analyst at Kleinwort Benson in Paris. 'Renault is
already managed like a private sector company.' However, he believes the
matter will need delicate handling.
That message is not lost on Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister.
Displaying customary caution he has left his options wide open. Wary of the
impact of an industrial dispute before next year's presidential election,
but tempted by the prospect of a flagship privatisation and the FFr20bn
(Pounds 2.4bn) or so it could bring to a strained public purse, his
centre-right government has moved gingerly to prepare for what it calls 'an
opening of the capital' of the group.
Another sale, that of the insurance company Assurances Generales de France,
has been lined up and is ready to be launched should the government prefer
to privatise Renault next year. 'No decision has been taken. We are
following our strategy of having two irons in the fire,' says an economics
ministry official.
Which of the two companies will be offered first will be determined partly
by the success of the government and Renault in ensuring employee support
for the sale.
While the Communist-led Confederation Generale du Travail says it is
'categorically opposed to abandoning a national industrial asset', other
unions at Renault have given a nuanced response. The more moderate
Confederation Francaise Democratique du Travail, which has combined with
other unions to wrest control of Renault's central union committee from the
CGT, says it is 'not systematically opposed to a partial privatisation'.
Force Ouvriere says it wants more details about the impact of privatisation
and guarantees that workers' rights at the plant will not be affected by the
sale.
The possibility for disruption remains. While the CGT has seen its influence
eroded and union membership generally is only about 10 per cent, it remains
relatively strong in certain areas of the company. 'They are present on the
production lines and in the factories,' says one industry observer. 'So they
can cause trouble if they want.'
To prevent broader opposition, the government is likely to provide
attractive terms to employees to back a privatisation. 'The government may
offer employees very cheap shares in the company to involve them in the
operation,' says Mr Michelis. A suggestion by the CFTC union that workers
might be offered a bonus of FFr2,500 at the time of privatisation could,
however, be too obvious a ploy.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Andalucia deals a blow to Gonzalez
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish Socialist party's first parliamentary defeat in the southern
region of Andalucia threatens to complicate its efforts to maintain the
delicate political alliance which keeps it in power at the national level.
The Andalucian government headed by Mr Manuel Chaves has this week lost to
the combined opposition forces in a series of motions on regional finances.
Most seriously, the parliament has demanded that Mr Chaves withdraw his
support from a budgetary system agreed last year, under which regional
governments may control 15 per cent of the tax revenue raised in their
territories.
The agreement is a cornerstone of the pact between Mr Felipe Gonzalez in
Madrid and the Catalan nationalists on whom the Socialists rely to achieve a
working majority in the Madrid parliament.
The opposition parties in Andalucia - conservatives, communists and
regionalists - say the budgetary pact favours Catalonia as a rich region, at
the expense of the principle of nationwide solidarity.
Socialist politicians, however, see the parliamentary vote as a political
manoeuvre designed to drive a wedge between the Gonzalez government and its
Catalan allies. The move comes after failure of initial attempts to forge
agreement between the Madrid government and the Catalan nationalists on next
year's Spanish budget.
Mr Chaves described the vote as 'a frivolous act'. He said there was no
evidence that the 15 per cent system worked against Andalucia's interests
and warned that by rejecting it the region stood to lose up to Pta17bn
(Pounds 85m). The pact was approved last October by the regional parliament,
where the Socialists then held an outright majority.
The defeat shows up the Socialist party's vulnerability in Andalucia, which
is also Mr Gonzalez's home region, following regional elections in June. Mr
Chaves, a former labour minister under Mr Gonzalez, has been reinstated as
regional president but with a minority in the 109-seat regional parliament.
The decision to hold the Andalucian elections on the same day as the
European elections on June 12 opened Mr Gonzalez to opposition charges that
he was trying to influence the outcome of the European poll by stirring up
his traditional support in the south. If that was indeed his calculation, it
backfired badly.
The punishment meted out to the Socialists in the European poll in the
aftermath of corruption affairs involving former top officials was reflected
in the outcome in Andalucia. The party also suffered as a result of recent
factional infighting.
The Socialists saw their 62 seats in the regional parliament in Seville cut
to 45, while the conservative Popular party increased its presence from 26
to 41 and the communist-led United Left from 11 to 20.
In the wake of the election Mr Chaves was unable to forge an alliance with
the United Left, which refused to collaborate without a shift to more
left-wing policies. Such policies would be anathema to the free-market
orthodoxy which forms the basis of the understanding between Mr Gonzalez and
the Catalan nationalists.
Andalucia is the most populous of the 17 self-governing regions set up under
Spain's 1978 post-Franco constitution, and is therefore crucial to the
national political balance.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Irish braced for broadsheet broadside: Fears are growing of
an invasion by quality UK newspapers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish newspaper industry is once again looking apprehensively across the
Irish Sea at the broadsheet price war currently taking place in the UK. It
is fearful that the British tabloid invasion, which began in the 1980s and
which has grabbed a 50 per cent share of the Irish tabloid market, is now
about to be repeated by an invasion of upmarket UK daily and Sunday papers.
A small market by UK standards (Ireland's population is 3.5m), there are
nonetheless almost 6m papers sold every week in the Irish Republic, with
around 1.3m selling on Sunday alone. The UK papers currently have an overall
market share of around 20 per cent.
According to one Irish newspaper editor, 'there are enormous economies of
scale in the UK industry. They can keep the presses rolling an extra half an
hour and dump the extra copies in the Irish market at virtually no extra
cost. The effect can be potentially devastating'.
However, Mr Liam Igoe, a newspaper industry analyst with Goodbody
stockbrokers in Dublin, believes the main threat is to Ireland's quality
Sunday papers rather than the broadsheet dailies, the sector in which the UK
price war is currently taking place. 'The quality dailies have a strong
Irish editorial content, and it will be difficult to compete with these on
price alone' he said.
Mr Peter Murtagh, new editor of the Sunday Tribune, and formerly deputy
foreign editor of the Guardian in the UK, believes that the strong Irish
focus of the quality dailies and Sunday papers will be the key factor in
fighting off the competition.
'Nothing will change the fact that the imports are British newspapers
editorially controlled from London. This is a different country with a
different perspective and a different agenda. Irish people want to read an
Irish newspaper which reflects their perspective on events. At the same
time, we have to be better at what we are doing and make editorial and
presentation more attractive,' he says.
Neither the Times, Daily Telegraph nor the UK Independent have gained
significantly in market share since the outbreak of the broadsheet price war
in the UK. Their combined circulation is still well under 10,000, compared
with 90,000 for the Irish Times and 143,000 for the Irish Independent. A
spokesman for Independent Newspapers, which publishes the latter,said: 'We
can't be complacent, but we are not too fearful of the price war spilling
over into the Irish market.'
Even among Ireland's tabloid papers, the Star (jointly owned by Independent
Newspapers and the Express Group) has managed to increase its circulation
from 85,000 to 89,000 over the past two years, maintaining its share against
the Sun and the Mirror which sell a combined 110,000 in Ireland, and despite
being 30 per cent more expensive. Around 80 per cent of the Star's content
has an Irish focus.
Advertisers have also remained largely loyal to the Irish titles. Mr Steve
Shanahan, media director of QMP, a large Dublin advertising agency, said:
'There is little evidence of a switch by Irish advertisers to the UK
imports.' Despite higher advertising costs in the Irish market, it is still
more cost effective to reach readers through Irish titles than through the
UK imports.
That loyalty could shift, however, if titles such as the Sunday Times,
thought to be selling more than 50,000 now, continue to make inroads into
the circulation of the Irish Sundays. Most at threat are the Sunday Tribune
(90,000) and the Sunday Business Post (30,000). Ms Barbara Nugent, Sunday
Business Post editor who also sits on the board of the National Newspapers
of Ireland (NNI), the industry's umbrella body, said: 'It is a worry. We are
talking about people with much deeper pockets than ourselves and it is vital
for our democracy that the Irish newspaper industry survives.'
Under pressure from the NNI, the government recently established a working
group to investigate the competitiveness of the Irish newspaper industry,
and to suggest legislation to protect it from what many Irish editors
believe are 'predatory pricing' tactics from the UK. Whether that could
square with European Union legislation remains to be seen, but according to
Ms Nugent, 'we are in a unique situation in Europe. No other country faces
the threat we do'.

Russian and German gas industry leaders met in the Black Sea resort of Sochi
yesterday to discuss marketing strategies and future co-operation, company
sources said. The talks were attended by the heads of the German gas
companies, Ruhrgas and BASF's BASF. F Wintershall Group, and Mr Rem
Vyakhirev, chairman of Russia's Gazprom monopoly. The company sources
believed this was the first time the German groups, which are fierce
competitors at home, had held joint talks with Gazprom. Wintershall, a
relative newcomer to the German gas business, says it has taken an eight per
cent share of the domestic market, traditionally dominated by Ruhrgas. Both
companies are supplied by Gazprom. The Russian company says it would like
its big German clients to make peace. 'I not only want this very much, I'll
fight for it,' Mr Vyakhirev said in a recent interview. Reuter, Bonn

FT  11 AUG 94 / Cuts promised in electricity prices: Consumer bills set to
fall by Pounds 2.5bn over five years under power revenue controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Savings totalling Pounds 2.5bn for electricity users in England and Wales
over the next five years will be promised today by the industry's regulator
as he unveils price controls that are likely to disappoint consumer groups
but please investors.
Prof Stephen Littlechild, director-general of the regulatory body Offer,
says his proposals imply reductions of Pounds 12-Pounds 16 in average
household electricity bills in the year from next April. This is equivalent
to at least 4 per cent.
The controls will cut allowed charges in the 12 regional electricity
companies' distribution businesses by 11-17 per cent in the year from April
1995, or an average of about 14 per cent, and will restrict price rises to 2
percentage points below inflation in each of the following four years.
Distribution charges make up more than a quarter of the typical electricity
bill.
Analysts were last night predicting that share prices of most of the 12
companies would rise since the controls were less severe than many had
feared.
Most believe it unlikely that any of the companies will challenge the price
formulae through the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Prof Littlechild's price restrictions represent a significant tightening of
the controls that have been in place since the industry's privatisation four
years ago. The controls have allowed the regional companies to increase
distribution charges by up to 2.5 per cent above the rate of inflation.
Leaked letters from Prof Littlechild's office in the spring prompted
analysts to suggest that allowed charges could be cut by as much as 30 per
cent next April with rises in subsequent years restricted to inflation minus
4 percentage points.
In his 118-page report, to be released today, Prof Littlechild says
tightening of the controls will lead to savings of about Pounds 70-Pounds 90
over the five-year period for the average household.
The Pounds 2.5bn he says will result from the control changes will be shared
by all consumers, including large companies.
Prof Littlechild also argues that the companies whose allowed revenue will
fall by 17 per cent in the first year will then be on the equivalent of an
inflation minus 7.5 percentage points formula over each year of the
five-year period.
The companies suffering an initial 14 per cent reduction in allowable
revenue will be on the annual equivalent of inflation minus 6.5 percentage
points, and those suffering 11 per cent cuts will be on the equivalent of
inflation minus 5.5 points.
Electricity companies will use these figures to argue that their formula is
one of the toughest reviews by a regulator.
But consumer organisations and opposition parties are likely to feel the
controls fail to redress the balance between power users and shareholders
who have benefited from profit growth.
The stock market is initially likely to identify Manweb in north-west
England, Newcastle-based Northern Electric and Swalec in south Wales as the
losers since their allowed revenues are being cut by 17 per cent.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Scholes open to new bid despite Hanson's Pounds 96m offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Scholes Group, the UK electrical equipment maker which last month agreed to
a Pounds 96.1m takeover bid from Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate,
yesterday took the unusual step of saying it was open to higher offers.
Mr Bill Riches, chairman, said: 'Clearly I want the best possible deal for
shareholders and if there are any other potential bidders out there it is
obviously in their interests for all the information to be presented.'
He denied he was directly soliciting a higher offer, but said the board had
recommended the Hanson bid only so it could present its own case to
shareholders, particularly regarding its relationship with ABB, the
Swedish-Swiss electrical giant, from which it licenses key technology.
Scholes revealed that ABB had warned that it would end the agreements if
Hanson's offer were not successful. ABB supports the Hanson bid and has
given an irrevocable undertaking to accept the offer in respect of its 4.3
per cent stake.
Originally Scholes wanted to buy Hanson's Crabtree business. But Mr Riches
said Scholes could not accept the conditions ABB had placed on its support
for a rights issue.
After ABB's warning, Scholes started discussions with Felten &amp; Guilleaume, a
German electricals group, to replace ABB's technology. Mr Riches said he was
confident that Scholes could reach an agreement if the Hanson offer were not
concluded. This 'would be in the best interests of Scholes'.
Although the Scholes board judged the offer 'fair', he said it had only
recommended the bid because a hostile offer document would have given 'an
unfair view of the company's situation'.
Scholes yesterday reported a 63 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds
7m for the year to June 30. Turnover was 5 per cent higher at Pounds 66m
with UK volumes slightly down.
It said in the absence of the Hanson offer, it would have recommended a 25
per cent increase in dividends reflecting 'confidence in Scholes' prospects
for the future'.
Hanson's offer of 250p a share in cash represents 20 times earnings, which
rose 60 per cent to 12.3p.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Railtrack snubs transport union peace proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The RMT transport union's leaders disclosed peace proposals yesterday to
resolve the nine-week long rail signal workers dispute, but these were
described as 'a step backwards' by Railtrack.
Although talks were taking place between the two sides through the
conciliation service Acas last night, the prospect of preventing three days
of rail disruption around the weekend looked increasingly remote.
The strike is due to start at midnight tonight and last all day Friday, with
a further 48 hour stoppage on Monday and Tuesday. More stoppages are
expected to be announced shortly by the RMT.
Last night, Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said Railtrack's initial
response to his 'constructive suggestions' had been 'far from enthusiastic'.
He added: 'I believe Railtrack's objective is to break the strike rather
than settle it by negotiation.'
The union yesterday released the details of its proposals for a possible
deal it claimed it put to Acas on Tuesday. However, Railtrack - the
state-owned company that runs the rail network - denied it had seen them and
expressed disappointment that they had been released publicly.
The union claims that a settlement of the conflict could be found 'without
the company having to concede a politically sensitive headline figure'.
Four possible ways out were suggested by the union. Three would involve
interim increases of 4.6 per cent - this would include a consolidation of
half a 6 per cent unconsolidated supplement in addition to Railtrack's last
3.6 per cent offer.
In addition Railtrack would be asked to concede either a one hour cut in the
39-hour week or a continuing index-linked payment that would not go into the
basic rate, or an improvement in overtime and shift payments.
A further option, the RMT suggested, would mean incorporating money put
aside to compensate 'losers from restructuring into the basic rate'.
Railtrack said the plan would 'indicate the union is asking for more money'
with rises of 2 to 3 per cent on top of 4.6 per cent.
The union added that if the employer agreed to make this offer it would
start 'intensive talks' with Railtrack on the entire restructuring and
productivity package next Monday.
The aim of the negotiations would be to reach a deal well before the end of
next month, with a final package being put to the signal workers in a
ballot.
'These discussions would see negotiations on all aspects with a firm
commitment to Railtrack's salaried status and a simpli-fied grade
structure,' said the union.
'We are trying to blow a flicker of hope into a flame,' said Mr Knapp. 'We
are being as flexible as we can be around our claim.'
The RMT said that while it was 'willing to negotiate on the signalling staff
claim and on restructuring', the company seemed only prepared to negotiate
on restructuring.
Mr Vernon Hince, the RMT's assistant general secretary and chief negotiator,
said that Railtrack was 'not serious' about resolving the dispute.

FT  11 AUG 94 / Broker awarded Pounds 18,000 in sex discrimination case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An aviation insurance broker who claimed she was sacked after spurning the
advances of a senior manager won Pounds 18,000 in damages yesterday in her
case which alleged sexual discrimination and unfair dismissal.
Miss Samantha Phillips, a broker for Willis Corroon, won Pounds 13,500 in
damages for unfair dismissal and Pounds 4,500 in damages for injury to
feelings after an industrial tribunal in Croydon, south London, said the
company 'would not have acted so unfavourably in the case of a male'.
The tribunal awarded Miss Phillips only 75 per cent of full damages for
unfair dismissal because it said she 'behaved unwisely, foolishly and
irresponsibly'.
It also ruled that Mr Giles Wilkinson, head of production at Willis Corroon,
had not acted improperly during a business trip to Denmark in 1992. Miss
Phillips had claimed he made unwanted advances in a hotel bar.
In delivering the tribunal's verdict, Mr David Milton, panel chairman,
criticised Willis Corroon for a 'litany of defects' in its disciplinary
procedure, which did not allow Miss Phillips to appeal after she was sacked
in 1992 for gross misconduct.
The company said she was fired because she misled LA Hudson, a Lloyd's
underwriting syndicate, about whether any other dealers had been approached
to quote prices for a contract.
Miss Phillips denied the charges and claimed there had been a strategy to
oust her from the company in order to save face with the underwriter. The
tribunal determined that Willis Corroon did not give Miss Phillips any time
to defend herself against allegations of misconduct. Mr Milton said the
company would not have taken a 'steamroller attitude, catapulting her out
the door', if she had been a man.
But the tribunal said Miss Phillips should have known that Willis Corroon
would have been seeking insurance quotes from other underwriters in addition
to LA Hudson.
Miss Phillips said the whole affair had ruined her life but that she felt
vindicated by the tribunal's decision.
Willis Corroon said it was disappointed with the tribunal's findings, which
did not uphold its view that Miss Phillips was fired because 'she acted in
disregard of the total honesty and trust between broker and underwriter'.
The Equal Opportunities Commission said it was pleased with the outcome of
the hearing.

FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: Minorco backs offshoot in
purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Minorco, the Luxembourg-based offshore operating arm of the Anglo
American-De Beers group of South Africa, is backing a Dollars 405m
acquisition by its Terra Industries subsidiary.
As a result Terra will emerge as one of the largest producers of nitrogen
fertiliser in North America and a leading methanol supplier.
Terra is to buy Agricultural Minerals and Chemicals from its shareholders,
who include Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund.
To finance the purchase, Terra, quoted in New York, plans to use about
Dollars 50m of its own and AMC's cash, issue Dollars 100m of new common
stock and secure Dollars 250m of additional and long-term debt. Minorco has
given Terra an option to sell it about 13.3m shares at Dollars 7.50 each,
and this private placement would boost Minorco's ownership of Terra from 53
per cent to 60.5 per cent.
Citibank has committed to provide all the debt financing.
Terra, which produced net income of Dollars 22.8m on revenues of Dollars
1.2bn last year, is seen as one of Minorco's successes since it was split
from Inspiration Resources, another Minorco offshoot, in 1991 to
concentrate on its core agribusiness.
Minorco said yesterday that the AMC acquisition would increase operating
earnings at Terra and Minorco when many of Minorco's other big projects were
in the development stage and consuming, rather than generating, cash flows.
AMC's balance sheet included Dollars 216.8m of long-term debt at June 30 and
it expects to have Dollars 86m of net working capital when the deal is
closed at the end of October. AMC reported net income of Dollars 26.8m for
the six months ended June 30 on revenues of Dollars 231.8m. If the deal had
been completed at the beginning of 1994, Terra's earnings for the half-year
to June 30 would have been 63 cents a share compared with 55 cents without
the acquisition.
AMC's two nitrogen manufacturing plants - at Blytheville, Arkansas, and
Verdigris, Oklahoma - will double Terra's nitrogen fertiliser production
capacity and give it the opportunity to reduce by 10 per cent its outside
purchases of nitrogen fertiliser for resale through its retail network.
Terra produces 1.3m short tons of anhydrous ammonia, upgrading 600,000 tons
into 1m tons of solutions, over 250,000 tons of urea and 100,000 tons of
ammonium nitrate. AMC's plants produce 1.4m tons of anhydrous ammonia, 1m
tons of which are upgraded into 2m tons of nitrogen solutions and 480,000
tons of urea.
AMC also produces 280m gallons a year of methanol from its plant in
Beaumont, Texas, compared with Terra's present 40m gallons from its
Woodward, Oklahoma, plant.

The US Navy needs retirement homes for some special veterans forced
overboard in the latest round of post-Cold War fleet reductions. The
requirements: a caring staff, companionship and a swimming pool of at least
625 square feet.
The Navy says about 30 bottlenose dolphins - trained to patrol harbours,
find underwater explosives and help research - are no longer needed. It is
hoping to unload the decommissioned marine mammals - free of charge - on to
aquatic parks in the US.
Each of the 101 dolphins stationed at San Diego, California, with the navy's
marine mammal fleet, costs Dollars 15,000 to Dollars 20,000 a year in food
and vitamins. That is money the Navy does not want to spend in the tight
budgetary environment, said Mr Thomas Lakusa, a Navy spokesman.
So far, only a few marine parks have taken an interest. The Navy has
received requests from five marine parks for a total of 17 dolphins and is
inspecting facilities.
Mr Lakusa said that, if the Navy cannot find a home for some of the
dolphins, it will continue to look after them for the rest of their lives,
as it is doing for seven dolphins classified as 'retired' and another group
with chronic health problems.
But some animal rights activists, calling the dolphins 'prisoners of war',
have asked the navy to send the excess animals to a centre in the Florida
Keys, where they would be retrained to live in the wild and then released
into the sea.
'We do not believe in the militarisation of animals,' said Mr Craig VanNote,
executive vice-president of Monitor, an umbrella organisation for 25
conservation groups.
'This an unethical use of these remarkable wild animals and we applaud the
Navy ending this programme - or most of it.'
The Navy - which studied the idea of releasing the dolphins at the request
of Congress - had baulked at the rehabilitation and release, saying that,
once back in civilian life, the dolphins might introduce new diseases into
the wild population or be susceptible to diseases themselves.
However, after some prodding from Mr Charles Wilson, a Democratic
Congressman from Texas on the House defence appropriations committee, the
navy negotiated with several animal welfare groups and last month agreed to
ship six dolphins to the Florida retraining centre.

FT  10 AUG 94 / France clamps down on five Islamist publications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France yesterday banned five Islamist publications and detained another 36
people as part of its clampdown on suspected Algerian Moslem
fundamentalists.
The crackdown is aimed at preventing terrorist attacks in the wake of
threatened reprisals against France for the internment of 17 suspected
Moslem militants in an army barracks in north-eastern France. The
internments followed the deaths of five French citizens in last week's
attack on a French embassy building in Algiers.
In a demonstration of its tough line, the French interior ministry justified
the moved by claiming that the distribution of the publications 'could
endanger public order because of their violently anti-western and
anti-French tone and the calls for terrorism which they contain'.
Paris police said that a further 36 people had been detained during a third
successive night of spot-checks on vehicles and pedestrians. Monday night's
detentions took to more than 100 the number held for questioning since the
police launched their clampdown on Saturday.
Some senior Moslem figures expressed fears that the upsurge in violence in
Algeria and the crackdown in France could damage the position of the Moslem
community in France. 'What we fear is that France will see a terrorist in
every Moslem,' said Mr Dalil Boubakeur, head of the Paris Mosque. 'The
fragile consensus between the Moslem community and French society could be
broken'.
Mr Boubakeur criticised the threat of reprisals issued by the Islamic
Salvation Army, a militant group linked to the Islamic Salvation Front which
is outlawed in Algeria after having been poised to win elections in 1992.
'It would be folly for Moslems to believe there could be any interest or
benefit in taking violence to France.'
Domestic criticism of the clampdown remained muted, although the opposition
Socialist party demanded the centre-right government should expand contacts
with moderate Moslems in Algeria. Mr Charles Pasqua, interior minister,
argues, however, that there is no choice but to back Algeria's military-led
government or see extreme fundamentalists take power in France's former
colony.
France's hardline approach has demonstrated a rift with diplomatic partners,
such as the US, which favour increased dialogue with moderate Moslems. The
French foreign ministry has sought to play down the rift, claiming France's
western allies shared its concerns and were taking the situation very
seriously.

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the former speaker of the Russian parliament who was
ousted in an violent struggle with the President Boris Yeltsin last October,
yesterday stepped up his bid to return to power in his native Chechnya.
Chechnya, which effectively broke away from the Russian Federation two years
ago, is now gripped by a civil war between supporters of President Dzhokhar
Dudayev and opposition forces which have turned to Moscow for support.
Mr Khasbulatov, an ethnic Chechen, offered yesterday to mediate between the
warring factions. This may prove unnecessary, however. Reports from Chechnya
suggest that Mr Dudayev's forces still control most of the territory in the
republic and Russia is proving to be a reluctant ally for the Chechen
opposition. Reports suggest opposition leaders have lost popular support
because of their open links with Russia.

Strikes and clashes shut down Burundi's capital Bujumbura for a second day
and authorities stepped up security as diplomats feared the country may
follow neighbouring Rwanda into conflict. At least 15 people have been
killed in Burundi in two days of clashes involving youths of the minority
Tutsi tribe. Aid officials warned that their operations in south-west Rwanda
and eastern Zaire could be affected.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Scharping attacks Kohl at election rally
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rudolph Scharping, who is challenging Helmut Kohl to take over as German
chancellor, addresses supporters in Bonn yesterday after opening the final
phase of his election campaign.
Mr Scharping, leader of the opposition Social Democratic party, accused Mr
Kohl of being responsible for the mood of uncertainty and lack of direction
in the country, and he charged Wolfgang Schauble, Mr Kohl's closest ally, of
organising a 'nationalistic front'.
The Social Democrats also unveiled the slogan they hope will help them win
power in the general election on October 16: 'Look forward to the change,
Germany]'
Party leaders flatly rejected hints by Mr Kohl that a 'grand coalition'
between his Christian Democrats and the SPD might be possible. However, even
if the electoral outcome forces such a solution, yesterday's statements
suggest that the SPD will not accept the chancellor as its leader.

FT  10 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Company news features a dull trading
session - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prospects for interest rate rises in the US subdued the UK stock market
yesterday, and it was left to trading statements from a handful of leading
British companies to provide the day's features. An erratic session saw
shares rallying at the close as an earlier sell programme, believed to be
worth around Pounds 100m across the equity range, was cleared away.
The final reading put the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,168.6 for a net loss of 3.3
points. The Footsie had been up by nearly 13 points and down by 17 points
during the day, often led by stock index futures. Trading volume was higher
than for some weeks, with the day's turnover through the Seaq network of
669.8m shares more than one-fifth above the previous session's total.
Little attention was paid to the widening in the UK visible trade deficit
for May. While aware that the trade deficit could prove a restraint on
economic policy later this year, equity strategists do not yet see cause to
worry.
London continued to focus on the chances for a tightening in Federal Reserve
credit policies in the wake of the US jobless statistics released last week,
which will be followed towards the end of this week by data on retail sales
and consumer and producer price indices.
At the close, UK stocks were helped by reports of successful pre-auction
trading in the Dollars 17.25bn of three-year Federal bonds to be sold
yesterday in New York. Some analysts suggested that this week's auctions of
around Dollars 40bn in US bonds may deter the Federal Reserve from taking
action for the time being. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.65 up when
London closed for the day. Confirmation that Commercial Union plans to
partly fund the acquisition of Groupe Victoire, the insurance arm of Cie de
Suez, by means of a rights issue was no surprise for the stock market -
indeed, Pounds 322m was at the low end of expectations.
Shares in Commercial Union remained strong as Cazenove, Hoare Govett and
Strauss Turnbull Societe Generale commenced sub-underwriting the issue.
Other blue chip stocks responding to trading news included General Accident
and Barclays, the latter advancing sharply after disclosing first-half
results well above the most optimistic expectations.
However, the market was turned off in the afternoon by the sell programme,
although the individual deals were mostly 'delayed deals' and therefore not
fully identified until later in the session.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which has been running more strongly than the FT-SE
100 over the past fortnight, also ground to a halt yesterday, closing 2.3
down at 3,726.4.
Trading in second-line stocks remained busy, and made up some 60 per cent of
the day's total Seaq volume. On Monday, retail activity in UK equities was
worth Pounds 1.12bn, still a satisfactorily profitable level of business for
the London securities industries, albeit at the low end of this year's daily
averages.
Some stocks with Far Eastern links strengthened towards the close of
business when unsubstantiated rumours of a pending statement regarding plans
to extend the Hong Kong airport began to filter through to London securities
houses. Dealers hurriedly searched out stocks in the construction and
building sectors which could benefit from such a development.
Traders drew heart from the UK stock market's success in holding steady
yesterday in the face of falls in long-dated British government bonds. This
is a quiet week for UK economic statistics, but markets are expected to
react sharply to any sign that the UK authorities have become more bearish
on inflation prospects. However, the UK equity market is generally hopeful
that the widely expected rise in base rates can be postponed until later in
the year.

FT  10 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: CU cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were no real surprises for the market as Commercial Union finally
revealed the terms of its acquisition of Group Victoire from Compagnie de
Suez, the French financial services and holding company. The stock market
had been on alert for a large fund-raising in CU for many weeks and had
expected a rights issue last week.
Analysts said the market had been satisfied with the terms and the size of
the rights offer, a one-for-eight call at 475p a share to raise Pounds 322m.
News of the rights issue, a share sale to French investment bank Societe
Generale, and top-of-the-range interim profits of Pounds 181m, helped CU
shares improve to 565p before closing a net 11 ahead at 563p.
Composite insurer General Accident touched 605p immediately following the
top of the range interim figures, but subsequently fell to close a net 13
off at 590p as insurance specialists pointed out the group's limited
prospects for dividend growth
Late stories circulated in the market suggesting that final go-ahead for the
new Hong Kong airport might have been granted by the Chinese authorities.
The project involves an investment in excess of Dollars 20bn and the
prospect gave a big push to companies heavily involved in the colony. Cable
and Wireless rose 7 to 449p on very heavy turnover of 7.9m shares, while
HSBC settled 5 1/2 firmer at 794 1/2 p after 6.5m traded.
NatWest Securities upgraded Cadbury Schweppes to a hold and the shares
hardened 2 to 469p.
The broker was also advising clients not to chase Unilever ahead of
second-quarter results due on Friday, although it remains positive on the
stock in the longer term.
The Anglo-Dutch group is expected to produce a slight fall in profits,
adversely affected by the costs of its new Persil launch and a detergent
price war in the US. The shares retreated 18 to 1063p, mostly on concern
over rumoured Unilever interest in buying Eastman Kodak's household products
division. A price tag of between Dollars 1.7bn and Dollars 2bn has been
mooted by analysts for the Kodak business.
Results announced and pending in the chemicals sector affected a number of
stocks. Holliday Chemicals moved ahead 13 to 250p after reporting a 46 per
cent boost in half-year profits.
Hickson International improved 4 to 177p awaiting interim figures scheduled
for release today, while BOC receded 10 to 746p ahead of third-quarter
figures due tomorrow.
Consideration of the possibility that Reckitt &amp; Colman might be interested
in purchasing Eastman Kodak's household products division saw the shares
open weaker. However, they maintained their level as the market turned off
and ended 9 down at 605p.
Media conglomerate Pearson advanced 10 to 655p on speculation that a leading
broker had upgraded its recommendation.
Consideration of a sparkling set of figures from advertising agency Saatchi
&amp; Saatchi prompted a rush of optimism over today's figures from WPP.
Analysts expect WPP, which has taken so much pain since it acquired Ogilvy &amp;
Mather just before the recession, to announce half-year profits of between
Pounds 33m and Pounds 37.5m.
Saatchi rose in early trading but profit-taking sent the shares back to
close 2 easier on balance at 174p. WPP jumped 13 to 123p.
The holiday price war continued to exact a toll on shares of Airtours, the
tour operator slipping 5 to 455p. Director share selling was said to be one
reason behind a fall in Granada of 7 to 526p.
Reverberations from Monday's strong consumer lending figures were still
being felt among stores stocks. Kingfisher added 2 at 517p, as did Marks and
Spencer, at 433p.
The shock announcement that Upton and Southern, the northern-based retailer,
is to consider legal action against the directors of the Reject Shop chain,
which Upton bought for Pounds 2.4m only six months ago, shook the shares.
Upton, which said Reject's expected losses would be significantly greater
than originally forecast, plummeted 12 to 14p, although dealers reported
institutional buying towards the close.
Materials group Cookson advanced 8 to 258p following a Hoare Govett
recommendation.
Engineering concerns Glynwed International and TI Group succumbed to a sell
recommendation from Hoare. The former gave up 13 to 369p and the latter
slipped 3 to 400p.
Investors in industrial group Charter, up 9 at 745p, were cheered by news
that the company will not raise its Pounds 260m bid for Esab, the Swedish
welding equipment concern, after several investors in Esab said they will
reject the offer.
BPP Holdings forged ahead 25 to 215p as the education and training group
reported improved interim figures.
International conglomerate Hanson hardened 2 to 263p in hefty trade of 9.7m,
with SG Warburg reported to have recommended the shares.
Clothes and furnishings group Laura Ashley, off 2 at 69p, was said to be
denying press reports of a takeover by Hugo Boss, of Germany.
Enterprise Oil suffered from further selling pressure and switching into
Lasmo, a course recommended by Kleinwort Benson, with the former closing a
net 3 cheaper at 422p, after 418p. Lasmo settled 1 1/2 easier at 154 1/2p.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealers in bank shares were stunned by the extent of the profits recovery at
Barclays at the halfway stage. They responded by hoisting Barclays shares to
597p in unofficial pre-market trading, compared with the overnight level of
564p.
After a bout of profit-taking, however, Barclays closed only a net 4 higher
at 568p. Turnover in the shares reached 14m, the highest since March this
year.
The pace of recovery in provisions against bad debts was much quicker than
analysts had expected and produced pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 1bn,
against the most optimistic market estimates of around Pounds 770m. There
was no real surprise in the 23 per cent increase in the interim dividend,
which had been factored in by most leading analysts.
'These were super figures,' commented one leading analyst, 'much better than
expected and almost entirely due to the figure for bad debts which was
around 50 per cent better than expected.'
The analyst pointed out that underlying operating profits at Barclays had
come out better than those of National Westminster and that the market had
focused on the lack of growth in costs at Barclays. Full-year estimates were
lifted to around the Pounds 2bn mark, with dividend forecasts increased to
around 22p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Active arbitrage trading was the main feature in stock index futures in a
session which saw the near month contract attempt to break through the 3,200
level, writes Joel Kibazo.
After opening at 3,192, the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100
advanced to 3,198 on active buying from independents (locals) in the first
hour of trading.
A setback in the bond markets brought sellers to the fore and September went
into decline, falling to below its fair value premium to cash in the late
morning.
Dealers took the opportunity of weakness in the contract to arbitrage with
the cash market, with many of the deals taking the form of cheap buying of
the contract to sell stock. This in turn led the cash market lower.
September fell to a low of 3,157 after lunch before steadying with the
tentative start to trading on Wall Street. It closed at 3,174, down 11
points on its previous close and at parity with its fair value premium to
cash of about 10 points. Volume at 11,366 was a significant improvement on
Monday's level.
There was little change in turnover in the traded options, where 26,169 lots
were dealt, just shy of Monday's closing total. Some 11,126 lots were traded
in the FT-SE 100 option and Hanson led the way among the stock options with
closing volume of 2,717 contracts.

Toronto closed mixed after moderate trading, although the key composite
index was boosted into positive territory by a modest late-afternoon rally.
The TSE 300 composite index finished 11.5 firmer at 4,186.8, but declining
issues outnumbered advances by 389 to 338. Volume amounted to 62.6m shares
valued at CDollars 719m.
Nine of the 14 sub-indices gained ground, led by transportation, up 1.7 per
cent.
Lac Minerals recommended that its shareholders reject a takeover offer from
American Barrick, but said it will examine a revised offer from Royal Oak
Mines before making a recommendation on that bid. Lac shed CDollars  3/8 to
CDollars 14 1/4 , American Barrick was unchanged at CDollars 30 5/8 and
Royal Oak hardened CDollars  1/8 to CDollars 5 5/8 .

FT  10 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow steady ahead of inflation
data

Wall Street
US share prices were mostly flat in listless trading yesterday as dealers
and investors remained on the sidelines awaiting a lead from the bond
market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was just 1.95 firmer at
3,755.76, never having strayed far from its opening mark throughout the
session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 edged up 0.04 to
457.93, while the American Stock Exchange composite finished 0.62 higher at
442.22 and the Nasdaq composite 2.14 ahead at 722.61. Trading volume on the
New York Stock Exchange came to 259m shares.
As on Monday, equities took their cue from bonds. The Treasury market was
subdued in early trading because participants were reluctant to commit funds
ahead of the afternoon auction of Dollars 17bn in new three-year notes. In
the event, the auction was deemed a modest disappointment, which led to
slight selling of bonds, but the general lack of action in the Treasury
market, where the yield on the 30-year bond edged ahead to 7.57 per cent,
ensured that stocks remained becalmed.
Equity investors were also wary of the market yesterday because of the
approaching release of July inflation figures. The producer and consumer
price indices are due to be published today and tomorrow, and analysts warn
that if the inflation numbers are worryingly high the Federal Reserve,
already troubled by recent strong growth in the labour market, could decide
to raise interest rates once more to cool down the economy.
Bank stocks were marginally weaker, unsettled by talk of higher interest
rates. Bankers Trust declined Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 67, Chase Manhattan
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 35 3/4 and Chemical Bank Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 37
7/8 .
Other financials were also lower, with the securities houses Salomon down
Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 42 3/8 , Merrill Lynch off Dollars  3/4 at Dollars
35 7/8 , Bear Stearns Dollars  3/8 lighter at Dollars 16 3/8 and Morgan
Stanley Dollars  3/8 cheaper at Dollars 62 1/2 .
Leading technology issues were lifted by reports that a top mutual fund was
positive on the sector. Texas Instruments rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 80
1/4 , IBM added Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 64 1/2 and the Nasdaq-quoted Intel
appreciated Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 59 1/4 .
Shares in the Equitable insurance group fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 20 as
second-quarter earnings came in below market expectations, partly because of
a sharp drop in profits at the Equitable's securities unit, Donaldson Lufkin
&amp; Jenrette.
Storage Technology receded Dollars 2 to Dollars 37 and Network Systems,
quoted on the Nasdaq market, rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 9 1/8 after the
two companies announced plans to merge later this year in a stock-for-stock
transaction.
Colgate-Palmolive moved forward Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 53 1/4 after an
analyst at securities house Morgan Stanley raised her investment rating for
the stock from 'hold' to 'buy'.

FT  10 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico dips and rallies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexican stocks ended slightly down yesterday after a mixed session dominated
by profit-taking and a technical rebound.
Traders attributed the erratic session to two periods of profit-taking split
by a technical rally. The market's volatility, they added, was enhanced
because of mixed expectations for movements in key interest rates in today's
central bank auction.
Analysts are split as to whether the bellwether 28-day Cetes, or Treasury
Bill, will see a slight fall or minor rise from last week's 15.80 per cent
rate.
Traders said profit-taking was so pronounced that the market's bellwether
stock Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) was not the usual driving force behind
the market's overall movement. Telmex shares closed higher.
The IPC index lost a net 8.94 at 2,594.96, following a decline of 1.5 per
cent on Monday and a rise of almost 8 per cent over the course of last week.
Yesterday's turnover was a moderate 1.23bn new pesos.
Telmex 'L' series shares - those available to foreign investors - were up 4
centavos at 10.74 new pesos.

FT  10 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Warning note as weak bonds
pressure equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure on bond markets left bourses lower, writes Our Markets Staff.
Mr Albert Edwards, global strategist at Kleinwort Benson, sounded a warning
note about recent bourse gains. German and French equity markets had seen
rises of 7.9 and 11.4 per cent in the five weeks since June 30, regaining
much of the ground they had lost - falls of 10.7 and 16.6 per cent
respectively - in the first six months of this year.
Many commentators were consigning the depressing first- half performance to
the history books, said Mr Edwards, who contended that the fear of higher US
interest rates and global inflation, which drove markets down in the first
six months of this year, would continue to be a depressing influence in the
second half.
FRANKFURT's Dax index declined 20.47 to 2,164.20 after pressure on bund
futures and conflicting theories on interest rates.
Turnover stayed low at DM5.4bn, after DM4.7bn. Ms Barbara Altmann said the
accelerated economic growth which excited equities last week was used
yesterday to support theories that the decline in interest rates was coming
to an end. Kidder Peabody, meanwhile, said on Monday that interest rate cuts
were likely after Germany's federal elections in October.
Financials reflected the weakness in bunds, with Allianz DM44 lower at
DM2,428. Degussa produced a 54 per cent rise in profits, compared with
Metzler's expectation of a 60 per cent gain, but the shares still rose
DM6.50 to DM513.50.
AMSTERDAM was generally disappointed by Polygram's first-half results, which
came in at the lower end of analysts' expectations. The shares fell to a
session's low of Fl 77.10 before picking up a little towards the end of the
day, closing off Fl 3.30 at Fl 77.90.
In spite of yesterday's setback, analysts at Kleinwort Benson in London
remained broadly positive on the company and remarked that the recent
success of its film unit would make a significant contribution to
second-half earnings. The market would now be looking ahead to results from
its parent group, Philips, off 60 cents at Fl 55.80, due to be released
tomorrow.
The AEX index, down 4.53, or 1 per cent, at 416.83, was affected by bond
weakness, as well as sharp corrections in a number of leading stocks which
had been performing well in recent days ahead of results. Unilever, for
instance, dipped Fl 5.30 to Fl 194.80, erasing all of Monday's gain.
After the market closed, Fokker, off 30 cents at Fl 16.20, announced that it
would not after all be publishing its first-half results this Friday as had
been expected. The aircraft manufacturer was expected to reveal a further
deterioration in earnings.
PARIS stayed in the doldrums, with the 1.5 per cent fall in the CAC-40 index
occurring amid very low turnover, estimated at FFr2.7bn. The index lost
31.86 to 2,074.48 as the equity market took its cue from weakness in the
Matif.
In a session devoid of major features, Rhone-Poulenc slipped FFr2.40 to
FFr140.60. James Capel maintained its hold recommendation on the chemcials
group following last week's results. Capel said that since the shares had
lost most of the strength built up during March and April, a period of
relative outperformance could be expected, particularly in light of the
economic recovery under way in Europe.
ZURICH dealers said that trading was largely driven by derivatives as the
SMI index finished 32.0 lower at 2,585.5 following thin volume.
In financials, where existing pressure after first-half results was
heightened by bond market worries, UBS fell another SFr23 to SFr1,117; CS
Holding lost SFr10 at SFr550.
Industrials were relatively strong, but Roche certificates lost SFr30 at
SFr5,670 after their recent gains, and Brown Boveri fell SFr17 to SFr1,272.
MADRID said that the weak bond market led to a bout of profit-taking but the
obvious stocks did not suffer. In banks, fairly flat as a sector, Popular
and Bankinter actually managed to rise. Recently the subject of buy
recommendations, the shares put on Pta40 at Pta15,880 and Pta30 at Pta12,470
respectively.
The general index receded 2.49 to 320.99 in turnover of Pta21.30bn. Losers
included the recently ebullient construction sector, with Cubiertas down
Pta200 at Pta11,130 and FCC Pta370 lower at Pta14,700; and the US-quoted
Telefonica, Repsol and Endesa off Pta15 at Pta1,825, Pta75 at Pta4,200 and
Pta60 at Pta6,230 respectively.
MILAN was easier, with losses seen especially in the telecoms sector. The
Comit index shed 6.42 to 689.33.
Some brokers remarked that a further brake on activity was the approach of
the end of the account.
Among telecoms shares, Stet slid L120 to L5,150 while Sip, the domestic
telephone operator, fell L90 to L4,390.
TEL AVIV continued to strengthen, the Mishtanim index gaining 3.93, or 2.1
per cent, at 194.19. Political progress between Israel and Jordan,
favourable second-quarter company results and improving investor confidence
were the main driving factors.
Mr David Duke, a consultant at Israel and Overseas Investment in Tel Aviv,
suggested that since the market's falls at the beginning of the year,
investors had been waiting for it to stabilise. He said that increasing
market trading volume reflected greater investor confidence and added that
many individual corporate difficulties which had troubled the market had now
been cleared.

FT  10 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Further gains in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equities in Johannesburg continued to make ground as the recent positive
mood continued. Analysts suggested that local buying in the gold market and
light foreign interest were the main factors for yesterday's rises, and they
expected further gains if gold bullion prices and the world's equity markets
remained firm.
The overall index added 65 at 5,823, industrials advanced 80 to 6,656 and
the golds index rose 54 to 2,157.
Among the day's active stocks, Joel, the gold miner, gained 20 cents at
R7.25 following recent positive quarterly results.
Sasol, the chemicals group, extended its recent gains, adding R1.25 at
R33.25, a new high for the year. Analysts forecast that the stock could
reach R35 in the short term.
De Beers moved ahead R1.50 to R119.25, Anglos R2 to R254 and Richemont R1.50
to R39.

FT  10 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: New index for ASX tourism and leisure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian Stock Exchange, which is in the process of revamping the
stock market's indices, unveiled a new 'tourism and leisure' index this
week. At the outset, this will cover nine stocks with a current market
capitalisation of ADollars 3.6bn.
The ASX said the move reflected worries that a lack of information on the
returns notched up by the tourism sector might be restraining investment.
The new index, it said, would provide an easily accessible yardstick. The
tourism business is expanding fairly rapidly in Australia at present, helped
by a surge in casino developments, Asian tourist trade, and the decision to
let Sydney host the Olympic Games in the year 2000.
The nine stocks which will make up the index at the outset include AAPC (the
Accor Asia hotel group), a number of casino companies such as Burswood,
Crown Casino and Jupiters, as well as Sea World, Village Roadshow and
Hamilton Island.
The ASX said they are likely to be augmented in the future as other
tourism-related stocks come to the equity market. Likely inclusions are
Qantas, the Australian airline which the federal government is due to
privatise next year, the Sydney Casino, and TABcorp, which runs a chain of
betting shops in Victoria and is being privatised by the state government
there at present.
For inclusion in the index, companies must have a market capitalisation of
more than ADollars 60m, be members of the All-Ordinaries index, get most of
their profits from tourism or leisure, and have stock turnover of at least
0.5 per cent per month for three months.
Last month, the ASX launched a new 'ASX100' index, covering the 100 top
stocks in the market. It plans to bring in a range of large, mid-cap, and
small company indices later this year. There is strong competition between
exchanges in the Asia-Pacific regions, and a growing realis-ation that
active marketing efforts are necessary to secure investors' dollars.

FT  10 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Setback for Shanghai A
shares as Nikkei declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Although the dollar's rise to the Y101 level supported share prices in the
morning, the Nikkei 225 average finally closed lower on arbitrage unwinding
and selling by dealers, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index ended 45.61 down at 20,590.22 after a day's high of 20,774.75 in
the morning and a low of 20,583.22 in the afternoon. The dollar moved above
Y101 for the first time in six weeks, while a rise in the Chicago futures
market on Monday prompted buying by arbitrageurs. But afternoon selling
eroded the gains.
Volume was 259.3m shares, against 225m. Small-lot buying supported a wide
range of stocks, but lack of follow-through buying, mostly due to summer
holiday absences, prompted profit-taking.
The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 0.63 to 1,656.15, while the
Nikkei 300 firmed 0.07 to 301.01. Declines led advances by 517 to 472, with
163 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.28 to
1,343.24.
The day's four most active stocks were steels on buying by foreign
investors: Sumitomo Metal Industries, the day's most active issue, put on Y3
at Y323, Nippon Steel eased Y1 to Y368, Kawasaki Steel gained Y4 at Y368 and
NKK dipped Y3 to Y281.
Chemical issues, expected to record an increase in earnings due to a
recovery in industrial production, were higher on continued foreign buying.
Showa Denko added Y6 at Y367 and Ube Industries Y5 at Y410.
Takasago International, the fragrance maker, rose Y19 to Y840. The company
supplies fragrances for cigarettes to Japan Tobacco, whose shares are being
auctioned next week ahead of its listing in October.
Profit-taking depressed Aids-related stocks, which have been supported
recently by interest related to the International Aids Conference currently
being held in Yokohama. Green Cross, the blood plasma maker, fell Y40 to
Y1,130 and Ajinomoto, the foods maker which is involved in the development
of an Aids cure, declined Y40 to Y1,320.
East Japan Railway lost Y2,000 at Y520,000: after the market closed, the
Tokyo stock exchange authorities said it would add JR East to its list of
stocks eligible for margin trading from August 18.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 28.46 at 23,017.20 in volume of 43.8m
shares.
Roundup
Second thoughts in Shanghai, and weakness in Hong Kong and Wellington, were
the outstanding features in the region.
SHANGHAI's A shares plunged by 13.1 per cent in a powerful technical
correction following the index gain of more than 117 per cent in the
previous six trading days. The index lost 95.63 at 633.90 in reduced
turnover of Yn6.87bn.
Analysts suggested that market sentiment was still strong but expected the
consolidation to continue today. Shanghai's B index, meanwile, was dragged
lower by general weakness in sentiment to 77.02, a decline of 1.92.
HONG KONG lost nearly 1 per cent, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index falling
91.44 to 9,446.43 in thin trade. Analysts suggested that investors were
holding back over interest rate uncertainty and did not expect trading to
pick up until the US FOMC meeting.
The garment retailer Giordano slid 20 cents to HKDollars 3.99 after the
Chinese authorities ordered the closure of its Beijing store.
WELLINGTON fell 1.4 per cent amid worries about Saturday's by-election in
the vacant parliamentary seat of Selwyn, the NZSE-40 capital index closing
30.39 lower at 2,076.23.
The market was shaken by Prime Minister Jim Bolger's comments warning of
disaster if the opposition Alliance won the by-election, a prospect which a
poll saw as increasingly possible. A win by the Alliance, which has said it
would raise taxes on the rich and redesign the Reserve Bank Act, would be
taken negatively by the markets.
AUSTRALIA ended slightly higher on firm futures in turnover of 161m shares
worth ADollars 252.7m. The All Ordinaries index moved up 5.7 to 2,086.8 as
the September futures contract rallied 12 to 2,103, four points off its
high.
BHP climbed 14 cents to ADollars 19.62; but Coca-Cola Amatil receded 7 cents
to ADollars 9.28 after reports of analysts reacting coolly to the company's
interim net profits.
KARACHI finished a shade firmer on institutional demand for blue chips. The
Karachi Stock Exchange 100-share price index put on 2.44 at 2,292.01.
ICI Pakistan gained Rs6 at Rs233 on expectations of good results being
announced next week.
General bullishness in the mutual fund sector, and prospects of good
half-year and annual results, pushed First Confidence Modaraba ahead Rs1.50
to Rs24.00 and LTV Modoraba up Rs1.55 to Rs24.30.
BOMBAY gained ground on buying across a broad front. The BSE 30-share index
closed 21.74 higher at 4,319.08 as analysts said investment buying was
strong but that overseas funds had withdrawn from the market.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Jitters over kiwi dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US dollar yesterday traded in a narrow range as markets waited to assess
the success of the quarterly Treasury refunding programme, writes Philip
Gawith.
For much of 1994 the dollar and US bond markets have moved in tandem and an
unsuccessful auction could put downward pressure on the US currency.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.5820, from DM1.5811 on Monday. Against
the yen it finished at Y101.2 from Y101.345. It ended New York trading at
DM1.5817 and Y101.295.
Volumes were generally low, with markets stuck in a lacklustre summer rut.
Most of the excitement was generated by the New Zealand dollar, which
weakened on fears of a possible government defeat in the weekend Selwyn
by-election; and by a lower Italian lira, which again broke the L1,000
barrier against the D-Mark.
Sterling had a steady day, with the market ignoring May trade figures that
were in line with market forecasts. The pound closed at DM2.4349 from
DM2.4380.
In Europe the D-Mark was generally firmer, finishing higher, inter alia,
against the French franc, lira and Danish krona.
The New Zealand economy has been one of the better recent success stories in
the Anglo Saxon world, combining high growth with negligible inflation.
Swiss Bank Corporation estimates 1994 inflation will average 1.4 per cent,
with growth of about 4 per cent.
Other plus factors are a strong fiscal position, with an anticipated surplus
being used to pay off external debt, and an independent central bank whose
policy transparency is appreciated by markets.
These are the factors that lie behind the recent strength of the 'kiwi'
dollar, which has risen by about 7 per cent, from the Dollars 0.56 level in
January against the US dollar to around Dollars 0.60 currently.
Yesterday, however, the currency suffered a bout of the jitters as a
newspaper poll suggested that the National party-led government might lose
the weekend by-election that it must win to keep its one seat majority in
parliament. The kiwi closed in London at Dollars 0.6007 from Dollars 0.6046.
Prime Minister Jim Bolger aggravated matters when he predicted economic
disaster if the Alliance party won. He said it raised the spectre of a
falling dollar and higher interest rates and inflation.
'Essentially what we have in Selwyn is the most important by-election this
country has ever faced,' said Mr Bolger.
Analysts said investors who expected the National party to hold the seat
should buy the currency, as recent weakness reflected political rather than
economic considerations.
The Italian lira weakened following the latest evidence of political
discord. Traders were unnerved by the row between the office of Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Mr Umberto Bossi, his Northern league
coalition partner.
The row had its roots in controversial television advertisements, criticised
by Mr Bossi, in which the government sought to outline its achievements in
office to date.
The lira finished again on the wrong side of the L1,000 level against the
D-Mark, at L1,001 from Monday's L997.9 close. Commentators had predicted
that the parliamentary recess would help Italian financial assets by
lowering the political temperature. The latest squabble has confounded their
predictions.
The Bank of Japan stressed that it had not changed its monetary policy
stance following a recent run-up in money market rates. Benchmark
three-month yen certificates of deposit were issued at 2.3 per cent, the
highest rate since mid-March.
The Bank said the recent rises reflected strong demand for funds because of
end - September corporate book closures, and slight changes in the interest
rate outlook.
Mr Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International in London, said the
next move in Japanese short-term rates would 'certainly be up, but that move
is some way off'. He added that if the recent rise in rates was the result
of an economic upturn, this would probably shrink Japan's current account
surplus, leading to significant yen weakness.
Ahead of the treasury auction, Mr Michael Burke, international economist at
Citibank, said the balance of risk for the dollar was on the downside. He
said the Treasury had Dollars 40bn of bonds to sell and investors have not
much appetite to add to their holdings.
Disinflationary forces, such as low and falling oil and commodity prices,
appeared to be unwinding and putting upward pressure on inflation and
interest rates.
In the UK the futures markets were fairly quiet. The December short sterling
contract traded 21,530 lots and finished at 93.44 from 93.40. In the cash
markets three-month sterling LIBOR moved slightly to trade at 5 9/16 per
cent from 5 5/8 .
In its daily operations the Bank of England provided Pounds 474m liquidity,
at established rates, to the market after forecasting a Pounds 450m
shortage. Overnight rates traded between 3 per cent and 4 3/4 per cent.

Plans for a ADollars 500m (USDollars 370m) zinc smelter and refinery in
Japan have been abandoned, Reuter reports from Brisbane and Tokyo.
The smelter was to have been built at Hachinohe, in north-east Honshu, using
the Imperial smelting process, developed in Australia, to produce 120,000
tonnes of zinc and 60,000 tonnes of lead a year.
The three partners in the so-called Pacific Zinc project are Nippon Mining,
with 50 per cent, MIM, the Australian group, 40 per cent, and Mitsui Mining.
In August last year the partners decided to defer the project because of a
change in circumstances surrounding the Japan smelting industry, including a
rapid appreciation of the yen and low zinc and lead prices.
MIM said yesterday they now believed that more favourable circumstances were
unlikely and that the project should be abandoned and the partnership
dissolved.
When the project was planned in 1991, the US dollar traded at about 140 yen.
The dollar is at present hovering around 100 yen. Slumps in metal prices
were another factor, industry sources said.

drought aid
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian government yesterday announced an ADollars 14m (USDollars
10m) relief package for farmers in drought-stricken Queensland and northern
New South Wales, writes Emilia Tagaza in Melbourne.
Mr Bob Collins, the primary industries minister, ordered the immediate
release of ADollars 5m of the funds to New South Wales and ADollars 2.5m to
Queensland. He said the government would top up the ADollars 14m if the
drought persisted.
The government has so far spent ADollars 75m in emergency assistance to
farmers, in the form of interest and farm workers' wage subsidies,
counselling and direct handouts.
In Queensland, which faces the fourth consecutive year of dry weather, 35
per cent of the state has been declared a drought area. In New South Wales,
which only last year had a good grain crop, almost 60 per cent has been
declared to be suffering the drought.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fortex meat processing plants
sold after tender
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The financially troubled New Zealand meat processing industry is headed for
further difficulties after it was announced yesterday that two former Fortex
plants will reopen under new owners.
The announcement coincided with the release of a study by Southpac, the
merchant bank, which says the industry has lost money in each of the past
five years and will continue to do so unless it is restructured. Meat
processing is New Zealand's biggest industry, with a turnover of NZDollars
3.4bn (USDollars 2bn) a year.
Fortex was placed in receivership earlier this year after it incurred losses
of around NZDollars 600m.
Mr Alan Isaac, the receiver for Fortex, said yesterday the plants had been
sold after an international tender, and would reopen. He refused to disclose
the prices paid.
The South Canterbury plant has been bought by a consortium including
Japanese interests, the Brierley controlled Huttons Kiwi and Meat Board
subsidiary Anzco, and local group Phoenix Meats. The Dunedin plant has been
bought by a former city mayor, Sir Clifford Skeggs.
The group's 24-hour processing methods and harmonious labour relations had
attracted international interest and its collapse embarrassed the New
Zealand government. Two of the company's founders face fraud charges.
The collapse was blamed on a costly battle with its competitors to buy
stock. With sheep numbers having fallen by around 23m-50m during the past
decade, companies have been forced to offer high prices to farmers for
animals in a bid to stay in business.
Industry leaders said the plants' closure had relieved the competitive
pressures in the industry.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold consumption weakens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demand for gold bullion is being depressed by a big drop in consumption in
two important areas - Saudi Arabia and Turkey - according to the World Gold
Council, a promotional organisation financed by some producers.
At 18 tonnes, demand in the second quarter in Turkey was 50 per cent below
the same months of 1993. The council suggests in its latest Gold Demand
Trends publication that Turkey's austerity package, launched in April to
combat its economic and financial crisis, encouraged huge sales of jewellery
and exports of scrap gold bars. In the quarter scrap gold exports of 5.9
tonnes far outweighed gold imports of only 0.1 tonnes.
Saudi Arabian gold demand, meanwhile, dropped by 53 per cent because, the
council says, consumers were worried about economic conditions and this
caused a reduction in trade stocks. Demand was also hit by a lacklustre Hajj
season, a 20 per cent cut in government spending, and by the impact of the
civil war in Yemen.
All this contributed to a 4.3 per cent fall in gold demand - from 562.8
tonnes to 538.5 tonnes - in the second quarter in those countries monitored
by the council. These account for about 75 per cent of total world demand.
A council official claimed that in the largest of the price-sensitive
markets in the developing world, such as India and China, buyers seem to
have adjusted to higher gold prices.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures down after
earlier sell-off by funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee futures fell heavily in London yesterday in response to the previous
day's late sell-off by funds in New York. But traders said the market found
strong support above Dollars 3,000 a tonne.
'When New York opened we would have expected London to be down near Dollars
3,100 on the September contract, but it held up fairly well,' said one
trader.
The November position closed at Dollars 3,195 a tonne, down Dollars 194 or
5.7 per cent. That is still some way above the Dollars 2,848 reached on June
27 after the first severe Brazilian frost sent prices up nearly 40 per cent
in a single day.
London was feeling the force of the 11 per cent drop in New York on Monday
night, when arabica futures fell through the key resistance level of 200
cents a pound to close at 183.60 cents on the second position in a
technically inspired pull-out by investment funds. In afternoon trading
yesterday, New York was steady, with December up 1.40 cents at 185 cents a
pound.
'The coffee trade in general probably feels eventually that the situation in
coffee justifies higher prices than this,' said the trader. 'But when funds
trade, they can carry all before them.'
London saw some buying by roasters yesterday, but many are believed to be
awaiting the US Department of Agriculture's estimate of the frost damage to
next year's Brazilian crop before making their next move.
The report, due to be published on Friday, is expected to put the damage at
less than the 40 per cent esti-mated by the Brazilian government.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbean exporters feel the
heat - An economic warning sent to the island nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caribbean commodity exporters have been warned that their foreign markets
will become limited unless they improve production efficiency and the
quality of their products.
The warning is from the Caribbean Development Bank, which says that the
region is also threatened by changes to the preferential export markets on
which its commodities have been dependent.
'The preferential markets, at subsidised prices, account for a significant
share of regional output,' says the bank, in its report on the performance
of the region's commodities in 1993. 'This has increased the region's
vulnerability to adverse changes in these arrangements, at the same time
that the arrangements have contributed substantially to regional incomes and
employment.'
The Barbados-based bank, which provides loans for 17 members, and which has
resources of Dollars 827m, with its main contributors being the US, Canada,
the UK, France and Germany, offers little hope for a turnaround in the
waning fortunes of the region's economies, all of which recorded declines
last year.
The region's sugar industry was affected last year by poor weather, and
production fell by 3 per cent to 730,000 tonnes, with only St Kitts-Nevis,
the smallest producer in the group, recording an increase.
The largest fall, of 10 per cent, was in Barbados where the industry
recorded its lowest output in decades, and had difficulty meeting its
commitments to the European Union, the US and the domestic market. The
largest absolute decline was in Jamaica where output fell by about 8,000
tonnes, the bank reported. Cane farmers in Belize were attracted by higher
prices offered by molasses producers, resulting in a slight decline in raw
sugar production.
The region's bauxite producers - Guyana and Jamaica - recorded declines in
ore production in 1993, with their cumulative output falling by 4.8 per cent
to 12.09m tonnes. 'The performance of the industry in the region continued
to be disappointing,' the bank says. 'In both countries, performance was
affected by weak international prices.'
The Jamaican industry, however, reported a 2.8 per cent increase in alumina
production last year to reach 2.98m tonnes. Guyana's production of bauxite
was affected by the flooding of some mines from heavy rain, and worker
unrest, said industry spokesmen.
Output of crude petroleum in Trinidad and Tobago fell last year 'in line
with the declining pattern in recent years, despite the stimulation offered
the industry by changes in petroleum taxation arrangements to encourage
exploration', the bank says.
The maturation of main oil fields and reduction in drilling reduced Trinidad
and Tobago's crude oil production to an average 123,800 barrels a day in
1993, against daily average production of 135,800 barrels a day in 1992. The
decline reflected a decrease in drilling in the year, with the total depth
drilled being 68,500m, 10.3 per cent less than the previous year.
The industry also suffered from a decline in oil prices, which averaged
Dollars 18.45 a barrel, against Dollars 20.58 in 1992. 'The government's
1993 budget had been predicated on an average price of Dollars 21 per barrel
of petroleum, with the result that measures to restrain expenditure were
brought into effect,' the bank says. Barbados' small industry yielded
459,500 barrels of crude last year, a fall of 4 per cent. This accounted for
32 per cent of domestic requirements.
'The medium-term prospect is for continued decline in crude production in
Trinidad and Tobago, with the outlook for international prices not being
particularly encouraging,' it says.
'However, prospects for increased production of natural gas are promising as
substantial investments are programmed over the medium term.'
The depreciation of sterling against the US dollar and changes in the EU's
import regime depressed banana production and earnings in the Windward
Islands, according to the report.
St Lucia's exports fell 13 per cent, while shipments from St Vincent
declined 22 per cent. Export earnings averaged 30 per cent less. 'Although
prices were similarly affected in Jamaica and Belize, higher production
efficiencies in these countries led to an expansion in output,' the bank
says.
The industry's performance in the Windwards was also affected by 'poor
management of the banana price shock on the part of the growers'
associations' and unrest among farmers, mainly in St Lucia.
The bank warns: 'The new European importing arrangements will require
substantial increases in banana efficiency in the Windward Islands, together
with a significant improvement in fruit quality, at the same time that unit
prices will trend downwards to more closely reflect the lower price of Latin
American fruit.
'The situation will be further influenced by . . . continuing allegations of
inconsistency between the new banana regime and the new general agreement on
tariffs and trade arrangements.'

<TEXT>
The Tokyo stock exchange (TSE) is considering whether to ease trading
restrictions on newly listed shares ahead of the listing of Japan Tobacco,
Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The TSE hopes an easing of restrictions will reduce excessive share price
volatility when JT is listed on October 27. This is an attempt to prevent a
repeat of the chaos which followed the listing in 1993 of East Japan
Railway, a TSE official said.
'To prevent excessive share price volatility after the listing of JT, we are
looking at a number of measures, including allowing share prices to
fluctuate more than at present,' said the official.
Share prices of new listings are now allowed to fluctuate by 15 per cent.
The official declined to say how much this range might be increased. He also
declined to say what other measures to reduce volatility were being
considered and when they might be introduced.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries ease on disappointing auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prices of US government securities eased at the long end of the maturity
range yesterday after the opening leg of the Treasury's Dollars 40bn
quarterly refunding round met with only moderate demand.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  9/32 at 84
9/16 , yielding 7.566 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 99 13/16
, to yield 6.209 per cent.
Trading was subdued and prices mostly weaker throughout the morning session,
with few participants willing to get involved ahead of the afternoon auction
of Dollars 17bn in three-year notes, the first part of this quarter's
refunding round.
Although traders predicted solid interest in the new issue, the auction
proved disappointing. The three-year notes were offered at an average yield
of 6.61 per cent, toward the high end of expectations and indicative of only
moderate demand from investors for the issue.
Bearish sentiment gripped European government bond markets yesterday amid
growing worries that the strong economic recovery in Germany would
discourage the Bundesbank from cutting interest rates further.
Yields on 10-year bunds touched 7 per cent, up from 6.90 per cent on Monday,
while in Italy, 10-year yields rose to 11 per cent from 10.60 per cent.
'Growth expectations are being revised upwards, which is causing firms to
adopt a more bearish stance towards bond markets,' said Mr Julian Callow,
European economist at Kleinwort Benson.
The view that Germany was well behind schedule with its fundraising - Mr
Callow estimates that DM120bn of public-sector borrowing has to be met
before the year-end - was a further worry, especially since government bond
auctions across Europe had not gone well recently.
'The market is becoming fairly paranoid about issuance in Germany,' said Mr
Kit Juckes, international economist at S. G. Warburg, adding that this
problem was compounded by the current lack of activity in the cash market.
Yesterday, the Bundesbank said the Treuhandanstalt privatisation agency
would issue either new five-year notes or an additional tranche of its
existing five-year paper next week. Dealers expect the auction to raise
between DM4bn and DM5bn.
On Liffe, the September bund future fell below the support level of 93.00 to
92.68 in the late afternoon, down 0.40 on the day, in volume of 119,000
lots, double Monday's volume.
UK gilts fell in line with bunds, with the September long gilt future losing
 27/32 to 101 13/16 in volume of 55,000 lots.
The French bond market was also under pressure, with 10-year yields rising
by 12 basis points to 7.50 per cent.
Weakness in the French franc raised fears that the government would not be
able to persist with its policy of pegging its interest rates to those of
Germany.

FT  10 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Flotation values Thai
construction group at Dollars 2.3bn

Italian-Thai Development (ITD), south-east Asia's largest construction
contractor, was valued at Bt58bn (Dollars 2.3bn) when its shares were
floated on the Thai stock exchange yesterday.
Shares in ITD, part of the Italian-Thai group of companies, closed at Bt230,
compared with an initial public offering price of Bt175.
Foreign stockbrokers noted that the closing price gave the company a
prospective price/earnings ratio for 1994 of 34, well above the overall
market average of about 20.
The Karnasuta family which controls Ital-Thai has strong political
connections, and the company is expected to win a substantial share of
forthcoming Thai infrastructure projects in the absence of significant local
competition.
However, some brokers still regard ITD as overvalued. 'It's a case of take
the money and run,' said one stockbroker, advising those holding shares to
take profits.
ITD has announced first-half net profits of Bt715m, compared with Bt575m in
the first half of 1993, although revenues fell to Bt5.5bn from Bt5.7bn.
The figures suggest that ITD may find it difficult to meet its full-year
revenue forecast of Bt16.3bn, particularly now that the start of work on a
Dollars 1.5bn elevated railway for Bangkok - for which ITD is the main civil
contractor - has again been delayed.
Gross margins rose to 26 per cent from 21 per cent, exceptionally high by
the standards of construction companies elsewhere in the world.
ITD's principal shareholders decided to sell 10 per cent of the company to
the public to allow ITD to raise funds for 'build-operate-transfer'
concessions through the stock market, rather than bank borrowing.
Italian-Thai is the dominant Thai contractor for ports, dams, power
stations, roads, pipelines and other infrastructure projects.
It is part of the group founded by the late Giorgio Berlingieri, an Italian
marine engineer, and Mr Chaijudh Karnasuta, a Thai-Chinese doctor turned
businessman. Mr Berlingieri's relatives now have only nominal holdings in
the group.

FT  10 AUG 94 / International Bonds: EIB raises CDollars 200m with 10-year
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The eurobond sector was revived yesterday by a flurry of new issues in a
variety of currencies, but traders said activity was likely to remain
subdued for the rest of the week amid the US Treasury's quarterly
refinancing.
The European Investment Bank took advantage of the recent buoyancy in the
Canadian dollar sector to issue CDollars 200m of 10-year bonds.
The bonds were targeted mainly at institutional investors keen on liquid,
long-dated paper, said a syndicate official at lead manager Barclays de
Zoete Wedd.
He said that investor interest in the longer maturities had picked up in the
last week as the 10-year yield spread over US Treasuries had contracted
dramatically.
The pricing, at five basis points over the 10-year Canadian government
benchmark, was deemed to be competitive.
Meanwhile, Ford Credit Australia issued ADollars 75m of five-year bonds via
Macquarie Bank, the Sydney-based investment bank which converted its London
office into UK branch status on Monday.
Also in the Australian dollar sector, Queensland Treasury Corp issued
ADollars 100m of three-year bonds via Nomura, which were seen to be aimed
mainly at Japanese investors.
The Republic of Finland tapped the Luxembourg franc sector, issuing LFr5bn
of 10-year bonds. This deal was largely targeted at Benelux retail
investors, and met with good demand, said lead manager Banque Internationale
a Luxembourg.
Finland plans to borrow at least Dollars 2bn more in the international
capital markets this year, a finance ministry official told Reuter in an
interview.
Standard &amp; Poor's has affirmed its triple-A senior and double-A subordinated
debt rating for the African Development Bank.
Some months ago, revelations of mounting arrears from AfDB debtors put a
question mark over the bank's triple-A rating.

Bank Bali, Indonesia's seventh largest bank in terms of private assets, said
its pre-tax profit for the first six months of this year rose by 2 per cent
to Rp43.44bn (Dollars 20m) compared with Rp42.50bn in last year's first

Total income rose to Rp274.79bn from Rp253.27bn in the year-earlier period.
Total expenses climbed to Rp231.35bn from Rp210.81bn.
Revenues from interest rose by 11 per cent to Rp232.04bn from Rp208.81bn,
reflecting the bank's more aggressive attempts to to capture a share of
Indonesia's loan market.

FT  10 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: ISDA forms disclosure
guidelines committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), the derivatives
industry's trade body, has set up a new committee to develop disclosure
guidelines for financial instruments, including derivative instruments.
The committee aims to prepare a preliminary report on disclosure by the end
of the year, according to Ms Gay Evans, chairman of ISDA and a managing
director of Bankers Trust International.
'Since a 'derivatives only' approach to disclosure conveys an incomplete and
potentially misleading view of a company's credit or market exposure,
disclosure should cover both derivatives and related cash positions,' she
said.
Ms Gay warned that 'squeezing derivatives into an existing accounting
framework', as most accounting guidelines have tried to do, can create a
distorted picture.
The need to increase disclosure of derivatives activities has been
highlighted in a number of recent studies, in particular in a report earlier
this year by the US General Accounting Office.
ISDA's entry into the debate, and efforts by a number of US institutions to
expand their reporting of derivatives, is part of industry efforts to help
shape any new requirements for disclosing derivatives, and perhaps forestall
the imposition of even tougher rules.
The new committee is headed by Mr Brian Crowe, senior vice-president at
Chase Manhattan in London, and Ms Hannah Sorscher, vice-president at
Citibank in the US, both of whom are ISDA directors.

DuPont said it is pursuing discussions with potential Chinese partners on
more than 20 projects in the areas of chemicals, fibres, electronics and
polymers.
The company said it now has two manufacturing ventures in China - one wholly
owned facility at Shenzhen for slitting Riston photopolymer film and Tyvek
spunbonded olefin, and a Shanghai joint venture to produce Londax rice
herbi-cide.
DuPont said a plant to manufacture electronic materials for microcircuits
will start up late next year in Dongguan, Guangdong province.

FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: Equitable shares fall despite
rise in net earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The share price of The Equitable, the US insurer which is 49 per cent owned
by French group Axa, fell yesterday in spite of strong growth in
second-quarter profits and continued progress in its life insurance
activities.
The results also showed a solid performance from the group's investment
business, which held up well amid deteriorating market conditions.
Investors, however, sold Equitable shares because earnings were below
analysts' estimates and because of general concern about what are perceived
to be interest rate-sensitive stocks. In New York, the shares fell Dollars 1
1/2 to Dollars 20.
Equitable earned net income of Dollars 68.5m, or 31 cents a share, up from
Dollars 47.5m, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier.
For the first six months of 1994, the group earned Dollars 150.6m after
taxes, compared with Dollars 79.3m in the same period of 1993.
Post-tax operating earnings in the life insurance operations jumped 114 per
cent to Dollars 62.6m in the quarter, due to a reduction in the losses from
disability insurance, higher new sales and improved investment spreads.
Investment gains of Dollars 4.7m, however, were partly offset by Dollars 2m
of restructuring charges.
The investment operations posted after-tax operating income of Dollars
30.4m, down from a record Dollars 55.9m a year earlier as higher earnings
from the investment fund and property businesses were offset by a sharp drop
in profits at the Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette securities unit.

quarter
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Continuing weakness in sales of women's clothing caused net profits at The
Limited, the US retailing group, to tumble to Dollars 53.8m in the second
quarter to July from Dollars 68.2m in the same period last year, the company
said yesterday.
However, Nordstrom, another clothing retailer, showed a strong recovery.
The Limited saw good performances from its lingerie, men's, girls' and
personal care products businesses during the quarter, but these were
insufficient to outweigh poor results from the The Limited and Lerner New
York chains, where store-for-store sales fell by 13 per cent.
Group sales fell to Dollars 1.59bn from Dollars 1.69bn and earnings per
share to 15 cents from 19 cents. For the half-year, sales fell to Dollars
3.07bn from Dollars 3.21bn, net income to Dollars 101.1m from Dollars
112.5m, and earnings per share to 28 cents from 31 cents.
Among The Limited's best performers was the Bath &amp; Body Works personal care
products business, which recorded the highest store-for-store sales
increases in the company. The Limited expects to open its first Bath &amp; Body
Works stores in the UK this year in partnership with Next, the British
retailer.
Mr Leslie Wexner, chairman and chief executive, said stocks in the women's
apparel businesses were planned to avoid an overhang of summer merchandise
into the autumn. 'As a result, we are positioned to improve the sales and
earning opportunities as our fall merchandise moves into the stores,' he
said.
The Limited's fall was in sharp contrast with that of Nordstrom, which
lifted net income to Dollars 63m from Dollars 42.7m on turnover up 6 per
cent at Dollars 1.08bn. The company said the rise was mainly attributable to
better margins, particularly on women's clothing.
Earnings per share rose to 77 cents from 52 cents. For the half-year, net
income was 76 per cent ahead at Dollars 95m.

FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: Foreign finance lines up at
Mexico's doors - Nafta has sparked a rush to join the country's banking
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign financial institutions have set their sights on Mexico. Some 61 of
them, drawn by the North American Free Trade Agreement, last week submitted
applications to open one or more subsidiaries in the country by the end of
the year.
The approval of licences for new banks, brokerages and other institutions
would lead to one of the fastest infusions of foreign capital into a
country's financial sector. From next to nothing, foreigners are likely to
account for almost 8 per cent of domestic banking capital at the end of this
year, 10 per cent of brokerage capital, and dominate the non-bank bank
sector.
The influx is expected to increase competition significantly in the
corporate banking sector, the area attracting most interest. That should
help to lower the cost of peso funding for Mexican companies, many of which
are struggling under high domestic interest rates or having to fund
themselves in dollars and face exchange rate risk.
Officials reckon that international institutions will play a key part
developing a more mature domestic financial sector.
Mexico's derivatives and securitisation markets have been slow to develop
because of regulatory obstacles, low liquidity and lack of expertise. By
contributing liquidity and risk-management skills, foreigners should help
such markets to become established.
Most of the 20 banks which applied are active in offshore peso trading,
corporate finance and lending dollars to better-known Mexican companies.
With their new licences they will be able for the first time to receive peso
deposits from Mexicans, lend money in pesos to Mexican corporations, and
actively trade in the onshore foreign exchange and money markets.
Mexican banks play down the impact of the foreigners' arrival, taking
comfort from the significant barriers to entry in retail banking and their
access through branch networks to cheap peso funding. With the exception of
Citibank, none of the foreign banks that have applied is expected to target
retail banking.
But domestic banks, especially the larger ones, make a significant
proportion of their profits from corporate banking and securities and money
market trading. Many would appear to be at least partly vulnerable to an
onslaught on these sectors - especially when the limits on foreign banking
shares are scrapped at the end of the decade.
While Mexican banks will enjoy lower peso funding costs than international
counterparts, this advantage may be lost because of their inefficiency and
the consequent need to charge high spreads, according to Mr John Donnelly of
Chemical Bank.
Some foreign banks believe competition in the corporate banking and
securities market may become so tough that they will find it difficult to
survive.
Such fears have increased as more and more domestic banks have been approved
by the Mexican government and financial margins have begun to fall. The
finance ministry has approved 17 banks in the past 12 months, nearly as many
as the 18 that were privatised from 1991-92.
Mr Eduardo Cepeda, head of J. P. Morgan in Mexico City, says the winning
banks are likely to be those which have been in Mexico for longer and have
established clients. Morgan itself plans to employ about 80 people in Mexico
as it increases corporate banking business, lends selectively in pesos and
trades in the onshore foreign exchange and money market.
In the brokerage sector, foreigners applied for more than the initial
capital limit, and requests are expected to be scaled back. Foreign
brokerages with a licence will for the first time be able to execute local
trades, cutting out the often large commissions charged by local brokers.
'We will see more of the available business on the international side as a
result (of the liberalisation),' says Mr Peter Norris, head of Barings
Securities, one of 17 brokerages to apply. 'Obviously it does open up the
potential to become an intermediary for the local market as that develops.'
While some of the larger US brokerages and investment banks which have not
sought licences - such as CS First Boston and Salomon Brothers - intend to
continue doing business in Mexico as before, rivals which expect to open
full subsidiaries maintain they will have a distinct advantage. 'Opening up
a subsidiary will demonstrate to our clients our commitment to doing
business in Mexico,' says Mr Justin Manson of Morgan Stanley.

FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: Disney to form link with three
'Baby Bells'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, plans to form a joint venture with
three regional telephone companies to provide traditional and interactive
video programming in customers' homes.
News of the alliance between Disney and the three 'Baby Bells' - Ameritech,
BellSouth and Southwestern Bell - follows last month's decision by the
Federal Communications Commission to allow Bell Atlantic, a local telephone
operator, to provide cable TV and interactive video services to customers in
its region.
That decision was hailed as a breakthrough because it was the first time a
telecommunications company had been allowed to offer cable and interactive
programming services over its lines in competition with local cable
television monopolies.
At the time of the Bell Atlantic ruling, the FCC made clear that it would
allow other telephone companies to compete with cable television groups.
Telephone companies, however, are still forbidden in general from owning the
content of television programming, which is why the three Baby Bells have
joined forces with Disney.
The entertainment group will provide the product - including motion films,
television shows and educational programmes - and the telephone companies
will provide the means to deliver that product to homes.
According to the four partners, the services their venture will provide
could ultimately include traditional broadcast and satellite television
networks, movies-on-demand, interactive home shopping, educational
programming, games and travel information and assistance.
Mr Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, said of the project: 'Our goal is to
use technological breakthroughs and new entertainment delivery systems to
provide customers with a compelling and creative array of programming.'

Tele-Communications, the largest cable television operator in the US, is to
acquire TeleCable, a smaller, privately held rival.
In total, the deal values the Virginia-based TeleCable, which is believed to
generate annual revenues of about Dollars 300m, at Dollars 1.4bn.
The acquisition, to be equity-financed, will boost TCI's dominant share of
the US cable television market to more than 18 per cent.
Under the terms of the agreement, TeleCable shareholders will get 41.7m
shares of TCI's class A common stock, plus Dollars 300m of a convertible
preferred stock paying a 5.5 per cent dividend.
For its money, TCI will get 740,000 new subscribers and 21 cable systems
spread across 15 states, with the largest concentration in the Dallas area.
The deal will take the number of TCI's subscribers to just under 11m, out of
a total 60m homes in the US with cable television.
The acquisition of TeleCable by TCI is the most recent example of the
consolidation of the US cable television industry, which is becoming
increasingly dominated by a handful of large nationwide operators.

Campbell Soup, the US foods group, is acquiring the food service bakery
business of Fresh Start Foods in a move aimed at building up Campbell's
global food service business, agencies report.
Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
Privately-held Fresh Start, based in California, has sales of about Dollars
75m, providing sandwich buns and English muffins to the quick-service
restaurant markets from operations in the US, Europe and South America.
Campbell said it supplies McDonald's, the US fast-food chain, with soups and
pickles in markets in and outside the US, while Fresh Start has supplied
bakery goods to McDonald's for more than 30 years.
The acquisition is expected to be completed by the autumn, subject to
government approval.

Engineering

<TEXT>
Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company (Haeco), the aircraft maintenance
subsidiary of the Swire Pacific Group, saw net profits inch up to HKDollars
215.2m (USDollars 27.8m) for the six months to June 30 this year, compared
with HKDollars 213.9m for the same period last year.
The company blamed the stagnant results on rising operating costs,
exacerbated by inflation; reduced margins on airframe maintenance; and
losses on managed funds sparked by the worldwide fall in bond prices.
Earnings per share were also flat, at HKDollars 1.16 compared with HKDollars
1.15. The interim dividend is to be held at 30 cents.
Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, said: 'It is expected that the company's
maintenance and overhaul divisions will enjoy reasonable levels of work in
the second half of the year.
'However, as a result of worldwide overcapacity, rates for heavy airframe
maintenance work have fallen sharply and are expected to remain depressed.
In this generally difficult environment, any improvement in the results for
the full year may be difficult to achieve.'
Haeco received higher line maintenance revenues on the back of a 7.8 per
cent increase in the number of aircraft movements at the colony's Kai Tak
airport.
Scheduled checks on Cathay Pacific's fleet were supplemented by refurbishing
work on three of the airline's Boeing 747s, and maintenance work on aircraft
belonging to other companies, including Air India.
Union Bank of Hong Kong lifted net income for the first six months of 1994
by 40 per cent to HKDollars 71.7m, AP-DJ reports from Hong Kong.
The bank said its deposit base grew 28 per cent in the first half from a
year earlier.

move

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Creditors of the US arm of Olympia &amp; York, the failed Canadian property
group, said they no longer intend to pay O&amp;Y Dollars 3.5m under the terms of
a deal struck in March.
The unofficial committee of the creditors, who hold Dollars 200m in bonds
secured by a property in lower Manhattan, added that they will begin
foreclosure proceedings later this week to gain ownership of the building.
The move was prompted by 'Olympia &amp; York's unwillingness or inability to
address in a timely manner major substantive issues' of its reorganisation,
the committee said.
In March, the holders of mortgage notes secured by the property, 59 Maiden
Lane, agreed to pay O&amp;Y Dollars 3.5m in return for an agreement to transfer
ownership.
The creditors say they are taking a 'non-consensual approach' to securing
ownership. They plan to file a foreclosure complaint, the first step of
proceedings, with the Supreme Court of New York state later this week.
NationsBank of Tennessee, the trustee for the mortgage notes, which will
pursue foreclosure proceedings under the committee's direction, will
distribute Dollars 7m to note-holders on August 22 from excess cashflow
generated by the building, the committee said.
Olympia &amp; York said last night: 'This move is not material. We have been in
extensive negotiations for some time with these parties, and the
negotiations continue.'

Mining to CDollars 6.1m

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Earnings at Metall Mining, the international mining arm of Germany's
troubled Metallgesellschaft, improved sharply in the second quarter, due
largely to gains from the sale of options and shares in MIM Holdings, the
Australian metals group.
Metallgesellschaft is keen to dispose of its 50.1 per cent stake in the
Toronto-based company as part of the German group's radical restructuring.
But a public share offering of Metallgesellschaft shares has been held up by
restrictions involving Metall's partners in various metal projects.
Metall's earnings rose to CDollars 6.1m (USDollars 4.42m), or 8 cents a
share, in the second quarter, from CDollars 110,000, or zero cents, a year
earlier. The sale of MIM shares and options boosted earnings by CDollars
5.6m.
Revenues almost trebled to CDollars 195.8m, due mainly to the acquisition
last year of Metallgesellschaft's 35 per cent stake in Norddeutsche
Affinerie, a leading European copper smelter. Earnings were lifted by a
higher contribution from the Ok Tedi copper-gold mine in Papua New Guinea
and the Winston Lake zinc mine in Ontario.

FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: Degussa up 54% on solid
all-round performance
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strong earnings in all sectors pushed Degussa's pre-tax profits up 54 per
cent to DM186m (Dollars 118.4m) in the first nine months of the current
financial year, the metals and chemicals group said yesterday.
The improvement, on turnover up just 1 per cent at DM10.9bn, stemmed mainly
from North America, Asia and some European countries, while domestic
business was still affected by the 'moderate' economic climate, it added.
The North American contribution to group sales, excluding precious metals
dealings, rose to 15 per cent from 13 per cent, while Asia accounted for 14
per cent after 11 per cent last time.
Domestic business generated 34 per cent of turnover compared with 36 per
cent.
After stripping out improved earnings from precious metals, the metals
division returned to break-even after heavy losses last year.
The Leybold subsidiary, which is being sold to Switzerland's
Oerlikon-Buehrle, returned to profit. However, these earnings were not
included in the results.
Chemicals sales rose 4 per cent, in line with the west German industry
average. Although prices fell slightly, earnings increased markedly due to
cost-saving measures and rising foreign demand.
Turnover from pharmaceuticals was 6 per cent higher, with about half the
increase coming from the first-time consolidation of Elephant, a Dutch
dental company.
The bottom line was also enhanced by a 9 per cent cut in capital spending,
while the rise in group payroll costs was held to 2 per cent. At the end of
June, the number employed was 4 per cent lower than a year earlier.

FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: Iri plans L600bn sale of
property interests
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iri, the Italian state holding company, is planning to sell off its surplus
property interests over the next few months in a gradual privatisation which
could raise more than L600bn (Dollars 380m).
The sale is a small part of the Italian government's privatisation
programme, which should move into a new phase after the autumn when plans to
sell Enel, the electricity generator, and Stet, the telecommunications
holding company, are finalised.
Iri's approach to the property sale makes it clear that it is concerned not
to neglect its smaller interests. A new subsidiary, Sofinpar-IGP, has been
set up to conduct the sale, and full-page advertisements have been placed in
the Italian press.
The advertisements underline that this is not a liquidation, and that the
property will be sold according to 'clear acquisition procedures, precise
market rules and in the light of a programme of property valuation'.
Some 80 per cent of the property on sale is industrial, but Iri is also
putting on the market certain residential and tourist properties, including
a seaside park near Genoa and a sporting and leisure complex further down
the coast in Liguria.
The Italian press has also made much of the fact that 250,000 square metres
of former industrial land is on sale close to the villa of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, at Arcore, near Milan.
Apart from the overall figure of 'more than L600bn', Iri has not specified
individual prices for the land and property, but it has already established
minimum prices internally.
The items will be sold to the highest bidder, but if the offers are
inadequate, or no buyers appear, the company reserves the right to withdraw
the property from the sale, or begin a new procedure.

FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: Austrian group buys 34% stake in
Czech brewery for Sch115m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BBAG, Austria's biggest drinks company, is paying Sch115m (Dollars 10.3m) in
cash for a 34 per cent stake in Starobrno, a Czech brewery in Brno.
The acquisition, through BBAG's brewing subsidiary Brau-Union, is the first
significant foreign investment in the Czech Republic's brewing industry this
year. Brau-Union won against competition from several other European
brewers.
Starobrno has about 3 per cent of the Czech beer market and is the largest
brewer in South Moravia, close to the border with Slovakia, with some 50 per
cent of the market in Brno, the regional capital. The brewery's output last
year was 488,000 hectolitres and this is expected to rise to 500,000
hectolitres this year. The company had turnover last year of Kcs325m
(Dollars 11.48m).
Brau-Union bought the stake in Starobrno because of its strong position in
its local market. The Austrian company is keen to increase its share of the
central European market, adding to its breweries in Austria and Hungary.
It intends to maintain Starobrno's position as a regional brand and will
offer support in marketing and technological development.
The Czech beer market, heavily localised and fragmented, is the focus of
fierce competition among European and US drinks groups vying for stakes in
local brewers. Anheuser-Busch, the US brewer of Budweiser, is wooing
Budjeovicky Pivovary, brewer of Czech Budvar. Negotiations are complicated
by disputes over the use of the Budweiser brand name, which is of Czech
origin.
Bass, the UK brewer, bought a 34 per cent stake in Prazske Pivovary brewery
last December for Pounds 9m (Dollars 13.95m).

FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: Ciba pays Dollars 300m for Iolab
drug operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reorganisation of the world's healthcare companies continued yesterday
with the Dollars 300m acquisition by Switzerland's Ciba of part of Iolab, a
division of US rival Johnson &amp; Johnson that specialises in eye treatments.
Ciba is buying Iolab's drug operations, which include products that reduce
allergic reactions and treat dry eyes. The rest of Iolab, mainly the
surgical products business, stays with Johnson &amp; Johnson.
Johnson &amp; Johnson said that it was selling the business 'to concentrate on
other pharmaceutical development areas'.
Iolab's drug side will be incorporated into Ciba Vision, the US-based Ciba
subsidiary that was established in 1980.
Ciba has been conspicuously absent from the spate of acquisitions and
disposals in the pharmaceuticals industry in recent months. Roche, its
neighbour in Basle, for example, paid Dollars 5.3bn for California's Syntex
in April.
Mr Rolf Meyer, Ciba finance director, said the acquisition was not as
strategic as such deals, but presented 'a good growth opportunity for Ciba
Vision'. He said Iolab's prescription and over-the-counter products had
generated Dollars 70m in sales last year and should bring in Dollars 100m in
1995.
This would put Ciba Vision into fifth place in the Dollars 2bn a year
ophthalmic drug market. The top four are Alcon, a US subsidiary of
Switzerland's Nestle, Allergan and Merck of the US, and Japan's Santen
Pharmaceutical.
Ciba Vision's sales in 1993 were worth Dollars 700m, mostly from contact
lenses and lens care products, placing it about tenth in the sector.
Mr Luzi von Bidder, president of Ciba Vision's Worldwide Ophthalmic Business
Unit, said the acquisition would boost sales both in and outside the US. 'We
have the international sales force in place to (increase) Iolab products
(sales) overseas,' he said. Sixty per cent of Ciba Vision's sales are
outside the US.
He added that the extra sales would allow Ciba Vision to support a bigger
research and development programme.
The deal is the second this week in eye medicine. On Monday, the UK's Smith
&amp; Nephew sold its Ioptex division to Allergan of Irvine, California.

FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: BHF reports unchanged profits at
half-year stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong growth in commission and interest income compensated for a slump in
own-account earnings and helped Germany's BHF bank group maintain first-half
operating profits unchanged at DM148m (Dollars 94.2m), according to
yesterday's interim report.
Excluding the drop to DM9m from DM53m in income from its own financial
transactions, partial operating profits rose 37 per cent to DM229m.
Provided partial earnings continued to develop at this rate, BHF expected to
report a satisfactory overall result at the end of the year, it added.
The bank said prospects would depend largely on developments in capital
markets, and it saw no reason to change its cautious assessment of its
credit business.
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts in the period were DM91m, up 36.5 per
cent on a year earlier.
On the basis of comparing six-month figures with 50 per cent of the previous
year's full result, full operating earnings were down almost 9 per cent,
although partial profits were 24 per cent higher. On this basis, risk
provisions were up 8.8 per cent.

New Ireland Holdings, the Dublin-based life assurance and pensions group,
saw profit almost halve, from IPounds 4.04m to IPounds 2.39m (Pounds 2.37m)
pre-tax, in the six months to the end of June, despite an 18 per cent
increase in premium income.
Premiums from life assurance rose from IPounds 69.1m to IPounds 81.4m, but a
sharp rise in claims from IPounds 49.9m to IPounds 79.8m meant a net deficit
of IPounds 16.6m (income IPounds 103.8m).
There was also a loss on underwriting, although this was reduced from
IPounds 1.64m to IPounds 1.24m.
Earnings per share dropped from 18.5p to 9.3p. An interim dividend of 3.85p
(3.5p) is declared.
The ultimate holding company is UAP, the French insurance group.

The surplus was Pounds 1.12m (Pounds 570,000) on turnover up 16 per cent at
Pounds 20.9m, compared with Pounds 17.9m, which included Pounds 1.88m for
discontinued operations.
Earnings per share rose 59 per cent, from 0.78p to 1.24p. There is again no
interim dividend but, following a capital restructuring in March, the board
believes it will be able to return to the dividend list at the year end.
Gearing has been further reduced from 48 per cent at the end of December to
38 per cent.

US and Asian groups may dominate the world's high technology industries but
the UK has its share of small, entrepreneurial companies exploiting
ingenuity and enthusiasm. How are these companies coping with the demands of
growth, finance and competition, asks Alan Cane in the first of a new
series.
In a laboratory in the Corstorphine area of Edinburgh sit tiny machines
capable of analysing human fingerprints, counting the spots on gaming dice
and recognising dazzle in a car's rear view mirror.
They are among the prototypes and products from a company which seems to
have secured a useful lead in one of today's most exciting technologies -
machine vision.
VLSI Vision (VVL) makes the smallest, cheapest and least power-hungry video
cameras in the world.
The entire camera, image sensing unit and signal processing circuitry is
inscribed on the surface of a silicon chip. Add a conventional lens and a
microprocessor to endow the camera with intelligence and the entire
'imputer' (image computer), as VVL describes its smart camera, is about the
size of a box of matches. It costs Pounds 180 in quantities of 1,000.
Conventionally, it takes Pounds 3,000 worth of video camera, accessory
circuity and computer to do the same job. The scope for using VVL's cameras
extends from manufacturing control systems and surveillance equipment to
children's toys.
The technology which underpins VVL's products is the work of Professor Peter
Denyer, 41, VVL managing director and one of the UK's outstanding
semiconductor specialists.
Working in the late 1980s on a fingerprint identification system for De La
Rue, the security printer, he made the conceptual breakthrough which made
possible sensor and processor on the same chip. Other semiconductor
companies have so far failed to match his achievement and his technology is
hedged with patent protection.
Prof Denyer teamed up with Mr Roy Warrender, a 50-year-old engineer
specialising in computer techniques, to form VVL in 1990. Mr Warrender is
now commercial director.
About Pounds 200,000 in venture capital and loans was provided by Mr George
Soros's Quantum Fund and the former Scottish Development Agency.
VVL has since had some 10,000 enquiries for its products and systems. The
availability of tiny, low cost video cameras has opened up a world of new
commercial and social opportunities.
One of the first products VVL developed was a simple security camera - by
transmitting a handful of video pictures to a control centre it confirms
whether a breach of security has taken place. Some 96 per cent of alarm
calls are false, resulting in wasted time and money.
Security is an important growth area for the video camera business. Local
authorities which have installed cameras in public places have seen a
dramatic fall in casual crime as a consequence.
The company's growing need for funds was met last year through a cash
injection amounting to several million dollars from Donnelly Corporation of
Michigan. The US company, one of the world's largest vehicle components
manufacturers, now holds a sizeable minority stake in the Scottish company.
Donnelly's logic for its involvement rests on its belief that conventional
vehicle mirrors will eventually give way to electronic imaging systems. The
first fruit of its collaboration with VVL is a rear view mirror fitted with
a video camera which detects excessive glare and modifies the reflectivity
of the mirrors accordingly.
VVL sells its video products in several versions; it sells the basic chips,
modules ready for incorporation into other manufacturer's products and
entire cameras. Modules, selling at about Pounds 20 a time, are the most
popular.
Prototypes the company is working on include:
A gambling machine intended to automate games involving the throwing of
dice. VVL's imputers are capable of distinguishing and counting the spots on
a pair of dice tossed on to a green baize background.
As a consequence of the work with De La Rue, a fingerprint recognition
system that will match a sample print against a small group of prints in a
second or less. Such a system could typically be used to allow or deny
access to an office or building. The individual presses his or her finger
against a glass panel where it is scanned by a VVL camera. The fingerprint
pattern is recorded using a set of calculations developed by Prof Denyer and
compared with those on file. If a match is made, access is allowed.
VVL is also working with games and toy manufacturers. Here cost is critical.
While easily available vision systems offer the possibility of many
futuristic kinds of toy, the selling price must be strictly within
traditional limits.
VVL has responded by developing the world's first single chip video camera
selling for less than Dollars 10 (640p).
The company has turnover in excess of Pounds 1m a year at present. It has
been profitable in the past but now is investing heavily.
Mr Warrender says, however, that the company's forward order book is worth
Pounds 5m. It is likely VVL will be looking for new money in the next 12
months to fund the next phase of its development, but he says he is keeping
an open mind - and a closed mouth - about the way the new funding will be
achieved.

FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Upton warns of deeper losses at Reject Shop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Upton &amp; Southern Holdings dived 12p to 14p yesterday after the
Middlesbrough-based department store group sounded a warning over the
trading position of The Reject Shop, its recently acquired furniture and
household goods chain.
Upton said it had become apparent since the acquisition of the USM-quoted
group that the financial and trading position of Reject Shop was materially
worse than had been represented at the time of the recommended offers.
This had resulted in a cash shortage of about Pounds 2.75m, the directors
said, and it was anticipated that losses of Reject Shop for the period to
July 31 would now be significantly greater than anticipated.
Reject Shop, which had suffered mounting losses in recent years because of
the reces-sion, was acquired by Upton in a Pounds 2.5m all-paper deal in
March.
Upton, which itself has recently undergone a period of reorganisation, had
been looking at Reject Shop since July last year.
The directors believed that the business had lost its way by trying to move
upmarket. Following its acquisition, Upton planned to reduce prices and
rationalise the product range with the intention of making Reject Shop its
core business.
Reject Shop incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.39m on turnover of Pounds
10.3m in the 28 weeks to October 3 1993, while Upton - which has changed its
year end to July 31, in line with that of Reject Shop - reported losses of
Pounds 321,000 on turnover of Pounds 8.67m in the year to end-January 1994.
Despite yesterday's announcement, Upton said the group continued to operate
within existing banking facilities, and retained the support of its banks.
Reject Shop was beginning to see an upturn in sales as the steps taken by
the new management began to have effect, the directors said.
However, in order to meet cash flow requirements and to provide working
capital for the development of Reject Shop, Upton was actively seeking
additional equity funding, they added.
They were also investigating the possibility of instituting proceedings
against certain former directors of Reject Shop, and a further announcement
would be made as soon as possible.

FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Kalamazoo poised for Pounds 20m buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kalamazoo, the Birmingham-based computer services and printing systems
group, is on the verge of spending up to Pounds 20m on the acquisition of a
computer software company.
'I'd like to see us make one or two substantial acquisitions this year, both
in the computer software arena. To do that we will have to go to the City to
raise some cash,' said Mr Mike Langmore, chief executive.
The acquisitions will emphasise the shift in the group's direction. Some 10
years ago, printed systems provided 66 per cent of turnover; they now
provide 25 per cent and the main thrust of profits growth is coming from the
computer services business.
Kalamazoo will, for the first time, be able to finance expansion through
paper as well as borrowing.
Earlier this year the Kalamazoo Trust, set up in 1948 for the benefit of
employees and holding 51.5 per cent of the equity, agreed to accept some
dilution. The board now has freedom, without any further approval from the
Trust, to increase the capital by 5 per cent.
However, acquisitions which demand further dilution would have to be
sanctioned by the Trust.
No decisions have been made on the how the financing of acquisitions will be
structured, but the group is in a relatively strong position either to issue
new shares or to raise borrowings.
Yesterday's share price of 140p is near the top of its 1994 range and has
climbed from a 1993 low of 26p. The group ended the year to March 31 with
cash balances of Pounds 8m; they have now reached Pounds 9m, Mr Langmore
said. 'To borrow would not be difficult,' he added.
Kalamazoo is likely to buy a UK company but it is searching for a
continental European acquisition to supplement its first small overseas
purchase, CBA Nederland, a software systems business servicing the motor
trade - Kalamazoo's speciality.
The group claims 45 per cent of the UK motor trade systems support business
and has ambitions of spreading into France and Germany but, with recession
in the background, it has been cautious. 'We didn't want to buy anything
which would immediately fall into lossmaking,' said Mr Langmore.
Concentration on expansion of the computer services business seemed to cast
doubt on the future of Kalamazoo's printed systems, the historical base of
the company. 'We looked at selling it; we examined that alternative with
great seriousness, but there is a series of specialised markets which
Kalamazoo, with its design capability, can serve.'
The printed systems business has been internally overhauled and externally
focused on higher margin business such as security printing with a product
range reduced from 10,000 to 2,000 in recent years. 'It's generating lots of
cash - more than Pounds 2m on turnover of Pounds 16m,' said Mr Langmore.
In the year to March 31, Kalamazoo made pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.35m on
turnover of Pounds 60.9m.

FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind sharp gain to Pounds
3.5m at Lilleshall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lilleshall, the engineering and building products group, yesterday reported
a 93 per cent increase in first half profits following a strong performance
by new subsidiaries.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 1.82m to Pounds 3.52m after contributions
from Trutite Fasteners, St Helens Glass and Jay Fasteners  - all acquired in
the past 12 months - helped lift turnover to Pounds 48.7m (Pounds 31.3m).
The figures were distorted by a Pounds 781,000 gain on property disposals
and a Pounds 300,000 loss on a consultancy agreement, but underlying profits
rose by 66 per cent to Pounds 3.04m.
The improvement was fuelled mainly by profits of Pounds 1.65m (Pounds 1.01m)
in the building products division, including St Helens, and a Pounds 797,000
(Pounds 355,000) gain in the industrial consumables business, dominated by
the fastener companies.
Together, they contributed Pounds 2.44m to operating profits of Pounds 3.25m
(Pounds 2.09m).
Mr John Leek, chairman, said: 'Demand has increased and our businesses
generally saw reasonable growth, but no-one would call it buoyant.'
In a cautious statement, he forecast a satisfactory outcome for the full
year 'provided the prospect of higher interest rates does not dampen demand
and assuming that pressure on margins does not worsen'.
Among the group's 13 companies, St Helens endured a slowdown in orders in
the second quarter, while profits at Ideal Williams - the PVC doors and
windows business - were affected by a price war among its competitors.
Profits in the plastics and engineering division, meanwhile, rose by a
modest 3.3 per cent as the components and housewares businesses struggled
against margin pressure and mixed trading conditions.
Nevertheless, the division enjoyed healthy export orders in the US and a
small first-time contribution from Laets, the Belgian houseware company
acquired for Pounds 1.33m in May.
Earnings per share rose to 7.67p (5.06p), and an increased interim dividend
of 1.85p (1.7p) is declared.
The shares closed up 5p at 155p.

FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: BPP advances 4% to Pounds 3.47m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in BPP Holdings rose 25p to 215p yesterday after the the education
and training group announced increased profits and an improvement in the
performance of Linguarama, its lossmaking language training subsidiary.
Pre-tax profits rose 4 per cent to Pounds 3.47m (Pounds 3.34m) in the first
half of 1994, helped by a strong performance from the professional training
division. Turnover edged ahead from Pounds 24m to Pounds 24.7m.
Linguarama, which plunged to a Pounds 728,000 loss last year, incurred an
interim deficit of Pounds 30,000 (Pounds 40,000). However, it has broken
even during the past three months, and management is optimistic of a profit
for the second half.
Linguarama suffered from the economic downturn in Europe, because it offers
language services to businesses and has a strong presence on the Continent,
particularly Germany.
The language business has been restructured, with closures in Japan and
Belgium, and although it has been forced to take on further price cuts,
business volumes are finally recovering.
The professional training division, which has focused recent expansion on
building up its BPP Law school and bank training business, saw profits
increase from Pounds 1.15m to Pounds 1.38m.
Publishing was affected by the loss of a sizeable accountancy training
client which has now turned competitor, and profits were down Pounds 127,000
at Pounds 1.27m.
Markus Verbeek, the Dutch business training subsidiary, has seen further
profits growth, but this will result in BPP having to pay about Pounds 5.5m
when it buys out the 32.3 per cent minority shareholders in April.
Academic education, which comprises the MPW sixth-form colleges, contributed
Pounds 684,000 (Pounds 584,000).
The most important time for the group's profits performance is during the
next few months - the start of the academic year - when it achieves the bulk
of sales for text books, distance learnings and A level courses.
However, management is confident that improved economic conditions will
result in further earnings recovery.
The company recommended an interim dividend of 3.1p (3p), which tracked a
0.1p increase in earnings per share to 7.7p.

FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Strong UK side lifts GA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance in the UK helped General Accident, the composite
insurer, increase pre-tax profits to Pounds 203.2m for the first six months
of 1994, compared with Pounds 124.7m.
The figures follow full year profits of Pounds 295m in 1993 and underlined
the company's recovery since its heavy losses of 1991 and 1992.
'We need to be making good profits now to be effectively paying for the
losses of previous years,' commented Mr Nelson Robertson, group chief
executive.
In the UK, rate increases, more selective underwriting, greater efficiency
and a reduction in claims frequency all helped improve results, with
underwriting profits amounting to Pounds 93.5m (Pounds 3.5m).
Underwriting profits in home insurance amounted to Pounds 37.8m (Pounds
16.8m), partially because of improved weather conditions, and motor business
was also profitable, despite signs that rate competition is returning to
that sector of the market.
Although GA maintained its portfolio of some 700,000 motor insurance
customers intact, premium income fell by 2 per cent to Pounds 119.6m (Pounds
122.5m) and by 7 per cent to Pounds 60.6m in the second quarter, with rates
falling about 10 per cent.
Results improved in the US and in east Asia, but bad weather in the first
quarter led to an increase in underwriting losses in Canada.
Worldwide underwriting losses fell to Pounds 44.9m, against losses of Pounds
125m last time.
Overall premium income from non-life business increased to Pounds 2.14bn
(Pounds 2.1bn), with long-term business premium income rising to Pounds
435.9m (Pounds 413.7m).
Investment income fell to Pounds 234.2m (Pounds 242.7m) and estate agency
losses rose to Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 4.5m). Interest paid took Pounds 6.7m
(Pounds 9.4m).
The interim dividend goes up by 4 per cent to 10.1p, payable from earnings
per share ahead from 21.2p to 33.4p.
The company has been badly hit by falls in the value of its equity and fixed
income portfolio, with net asset value per ordinary share falling from 545p
at the end of 1993 to 441p at August 4 1994.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial Union, largest of the UK's composite insurers, reported pre-tax
profits increased from Pounds 66m to Pounds 181m in the first half of this
year.
The interim dividend is raised from 9.75p to 10.25p, payable from earnings
of 26.3p (24.9p) per share.
Mr John Carter, chief executive, said that general insurance operations
continued to benefit from improved conditions in a number of main markets.
The performance was particularly influenced by the return to profitability
in the UK, where premium rates have been increased and claims fallen.
Underwriting profits in the UK amounted to Pounds 26m (Pounds 57m losses),
with profits in domestic and commercial property and motor business
offsetting losses in the London commercial and reinsurance market.
The group's operating ratio in the UK - which measures claims, commissions
and expenses as a percentage of premiums - amounted to 97 per cent (105 per
cent).
Overall worldwide underwriting losses fell to Pounds 75m (Pounds 165m),
despite high severe weather and catastrophe claims in North America,
particularly in the first quarter.
Underwriting losses in the Netherlands - CU's largest European operation
outside the UK - fell to from Fl 39m to Fl 30m (Pounds 11m). In France,
where the group is set to expand significantly following yesterday's
completed acquisition of Groupe Victoire, underwriting losses narrowed to
Pounds 11m (Pounds 16m), but the operating ratio - at 138 per cent (151 per
cent) - remains high.
Worldwide premium income from non-life insurance rose to Pounds 2.16bn
(Pounds 2.11bn), compensating for a small fall in life insurance income to
Pounds 923m (Pounds 927m). Investment income net of loan interest amounted
to Pounds 179m (Pounds 169m). Income from non-insurance activities was
Pounds 8m and earnings from associates Pounds 5m (Pounds 4m).
Shareholders' funds amounted to Pounds 2.03bn at the end of June, compared
with Pounds 2.53bn at the start of 1994. Investment values have since
increased and shareholders' funds as at August 4 were estimated at Pounds
2.23bn.

Gardner Merchant, Europe's largest contract caterer, has completed a Pounds
240m financing package, part of which will be used to finance its recent
Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m) acquisition of Morrison's Hospitality Group from
Morrison Restaurants of the US, writes Tracy Corrigan.
The package includes a Pounds 155m five-year loan which will be used to
refinance existing bank borrowings, left over from the Pounds 402m
management buy-out of the company from Forte in December 1992; a Dollars
100m five-year loan to fund the Morrison's acquisition and a Pounds 20m
multi-currency working capital and guarantee facility, again over five
years.
The terms of the loans were not disclosed. The facilities were arranged by
the Royal Bank of Scotland, with five other participating banks.

FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Property side spurs recovery at Howard
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Howard Holdings, the property development and plant hire group, reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 405,115 for the 12 months to April 30 - the south
London-based group's first year in the black since 1990.
Mr John Howard, chairman, attributed the recovery to property development
activities. 'Prospects continue to look good and we have now made land
purchases to sustain our level of trading,' he said.
The recession in construction and housebuilding has gone on for a long time,
said Mr Howard, but he believes the better times expected are finally
becoming a reality.
The outcome, which compared with losses of Pounds 204,749, was struck after
interest charges of Pounds 265,227 (Pounds 395,618), and reflected turnover
more than doubled to Pounds 6.38m (Pounds 3.07m).
Although plant hire had 'another difficult year' there were 'firm
indications' of a return to profits by 1995.
The dividend is 0.8p (0.5p), payable from earnings of 1.07p (0.56p losses)
per share.
The shares rose 3p to 28p.

FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Wyko Pounds 4m in red but this year starts
well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wyko, the West Midlands-based industrial distribution and engineering group,
incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.16m in the year to April 30, but resumed
profitable trading in the first quarter of its current year.
The deficit, foreshadowed in statements in January and May, was expected as
the group provided for the cost of a policy under which, as Mr Philip White,
chairman, put it yesterday, 'all our major problems have been firmly
addressed'.
Mr White said this year there had been 'sustained improvement in demand
within our UK distribution business and improved trading results elsewhere
in the group.' This justified a dividend of 0.5p, half of the previous
year's payment when the year end pre-tax loss was Pounds 20,000. Losses per
share were 11.3p (0.5p).
Total turnover was Pounds 58.3m (Pounds 57.4m) including Pounds 4.39m
(Pounds 6.47m) from discontinued operations. There were exceptional or
one-off items of expenditure of more than Pounds 3.4m. These covered
withdrawal from South Africa, the concentration of manufacturing sites and,
most significantly, Pounds 1.2m to provide for withdrawal from capital
equipment manufacture: units in this business will be sold individually.
Losses at the operating level amounted to Pounds 3.4m, compared with profits
of Pounds 753,000.
Shareholders' funds dropped from Pounds 15m to Pounds 10.9m during the year.
Gearing fell to 33 per cent (45 per cent).

FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Former LIG directors get compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London International Group has made compensation payments to its former
chairman and group managing director.
The group, which manufactures Durex condoms and Marigold gloves, paid
Dollars 151,216 (Pounds 98,429) to Mr Alan Woltz, who retired as chairman in
April. Mr Robert Hall, the former group managing director, received Pounds
151,600.
The two executives retired before LIG announced net losses of Pounds 173.7m
for the year to March 31 and a Pounds 115m rescue rights issue to restore
the group's balance sheet.
The company said Mr Hall was being compensated for 'termination of
contract', while Mr Woltz's payment related to an outstanding consultancy
fee. Analysts, however, said the two men had been blamed for LIG's ambitious
diversification during the 1980s, which led to sizeable trading losses.

FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Holliday Chemical turns in 72% rise to
Pounds 9.81m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Holliday Chemical Holdings yesterday rose 13p to a post-flotation
high of 250p after the industrial dyes and speciality chemicals company
announced a 72 per cent increase in first half profits.
The company, which came to the market last year, saw pre-tax profits rise
from Pounds 5.69m to Pounds 9.81m on turnover of Pounds 62.9m (Pounds
54.9m). On a pro-forma basis profits showed a 46 per cent advance from
Pounds 6.7m.
Mr Michael Peagram, the founder and chairman, said the healthy results and
rising share price showed the group had recovered from last November's
profit warning, when concerns over its Spanish subsidiary sent the shares
tumbling to 174p.
Operating profits in Spain - where Holliday makes pharmaceutical actives and
fine chemicals - have improved in recent months, although Mr Peagram
admitted they remained 'below aspirations'.
Group operating profits rose to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 7.19m) following
better-than-expected performances from all six divisions.
The figures were enhanced, however, by a Pounds 1.2m currency gain and a
Pounds 1.69m contribution from Reckitt Colours International - the former
Reckitt &amp; Colman subsidiary acquired for Pounds 52m in March.
Mr Peagram predicted that Reckitt Colours, which is to be renamed Holliday
Pigments, would emerge as the company's largest profit centre.
Profits from the business, which supplies 60 per cent of the world market
for industrial grade ultramarine - the tints for plastic bottles - helped
offset flat demand for the group's other dyes and pigments.
Its contribution underpinned profits of Pounds 4.9m in the colours sector,
against a pro-forma Pounds 3.17m last time, while the existing chemicals
operations made Pounds 6.15m (Pounds 4.26m).
Welcoming the performance, Mr Peagram pointed to increased demand for waste
recycling products, hair dyes and fine chemicals.
'We do not have one single product, or customer or market that could more
than dent our growth if it was wiped out overnight.'
He also hinted at further acquisitions which could be financed from bank
facilities. Net borrowings fell from Pounds 32m following the Reckitt
acquisition to Pounds 29.6m at the end of June - equivalent to gearing of 56
per cent.
Earnings per share rose from 5.8p to 7.4p on a pro forma basis and an
interim dividend of 2p (1.6p) is declared.
COMMENT
On the surface, Holliday's results look as rosy as some of its industrial
pigments. After stripping out the favourable currency gains and contribution
from Reckitt Colours, they appear a little less bright. Nevertheless, the
group has overcome tough price competition in Spain and enjoyed organic
growth elsewhere. Reduced operating costs should feed through in the second
half and new products are likely to generate profits. With Reckitt likely to
show further substantial gains, full year profits could exceed Pounds 21m.
Although the shares may pause for breath following their recent rise, they
remain a relatively attractive option on a forward multiple of 16.4.

FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Ranger in Pounds 13m agreed bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ranger Oil, the Calgary-based oil explorer, yesterday announced a sharp drop
in first-half profits as it unveiled an agreed Pounds 13.2m bid for Union
Jack Oil, the UK independent.
Ranger, which already owns 21 per cent of Union Jack, is offering 75p a
share for the company, valuing its target at Pounds 16.5m.
Net profits in the second quarter fell from Dollars 4.7m to Dollars 390,000
(Pounds 252,000), on revenues 15 per cent lower at Dollars 32.5m. First-half
profits to June 30 fell by 64 per cent to Dollars 4.3m.
Average of crude oil and natural gas prices were Dollars 3.41 lower in the
first half at Dollars 13.79. There is no dividend.
The group said Union Jack would provide extra production and cash flow from
its interest in the Claymore field in the North Sea. Ranger has recently
been hit by lower oil prices and falling production out of the North Sea as
exploration programmes have been reined in.
Ranger has been a significant shareholder in Union Jack, originally set up
as a vehicle for institutional investment in North Sea exploration, since
its foundation in 1981.

FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Barclays may reduce capital - Dollars 900m
of preference shares could be repaid as tier 1 ratio increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays is thought to be considering reducing excess capital later this
year by buying back up to Dollars 900m (Pounds 580m) of preference shares.
The bank is concerned that it may otherwise build up too high a ratio of
capital to risk-weighted assets.
Barclays yesterday disclosed a rise in its tier 1 ratio of core capital  -
including equity, retained earnings and preference shares - to risk-weighted
assets from 6 per cent at the year-end to 7 per cent at June 30.
The bank is thought to be considering ways of reducing its tier 1 ratio if
it continues to climb at this rate. Although banks in the US have built up
ratios of more than 7 per cent, a higher ratio could prompt concern at
excess capital.
One barrier is that Barclays would have to gain the Bank of England's
approval for such a move because its tier 1 ratio is a key measure of
financial strength. The Bank might approve such a move if it believed
Barclays had recovered fully.
The repayment of preference shares might be unnecessary if there was a
strong increase in loan demand in the second half of the year.
An alternative to buying back the shares would be to increase the full-year
dividend by a large amount.
Barclays is also thought to be considering repaying Dollars 1.3bn in dated
loan capital which has a coupon of between 9.75 and 11.625 per cent.
Although this would reduced the overall capital ratio, it would not affect
the tier 1 ratio.
This is thought to be a more immediate prospect than the buying back of
preference shares because it would not involve regulatory approval in the
same way. The main advantage would be to reduce a drag on earnings from the
high coupon.
Barclays yesterday disclosed that it had maintained a net interest margin at
3 per cent, while domestic net interest margin rose from 3.9 per cent to 4
per cent. Some 0.2 per cent of the margin was because of interest rate
hedging.
The bank's total capital rose to Pounds 10.8bn at June 30 against Pounds
10.6bn a year earlier, while total assets fell from Pounds 169.3bn to Pounds
161bn, and weighted risk assets fell from Pounds 107.5bn to Pounds 94.7bn.

time, there were profits of Pounds 103,000.
Turnover declined from Pounds 1.17m to Pounds 886,000.
The result reflected the impact of low oil prices, while production was also
slightly lower. A return to profit was expected in the second half.
Losses per share were 0.22p (0.6p earnings).

FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: UAPT holders urged to accept lower offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UAPT-Infolink yesterday wrote to shareholders urging them to accept the
lower of two concurrent takeover offers, to avoid the risk of a referral to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, writes Simon Davies.
UAPT has become the target of the attentions of two US credit information
groups, and has taken the unusual step of recommending shareholders to take
550p from Trans Union, instead of 600p from Equifax.
The rationale for the advice is that although a 500p offer from Equifax was
originally recommended, the bid is conditional upon their being no referral
to the MMC, due to Equifax's position as a UK competitor of UAPT.
The board argues that shareholders who accept the higher offer could risk
the removal of Trans Union's offer and then the lapsing of Equifax's, due to
a referral.
UAPT has been backed in its decision by Sir Gordon Borrie, a non-executive
director of UAPT who is also a former Director General of the Office of Fair
Trading, which makes the decision on referrals.
The OFT is unlikely to make a verdict for several weeks, and the Trans Union
bid will lapse on August 31.

FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Ex-Hartstone director gets Pounds 235,000
pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former director of Hartstone has received payments totalling Pounds
235,000 from the struggling hosiery and leathergoods group which last month
announced a Pounds 30m rescue rights issue.
Mr Trevor Brentnall, former head of the group's leathergoods division, left
the company in February.
It is believed he is the director named in the accounts who received a
compensation payment of Pounds 100,000, in addition to remuneration and
pension of Pounds 135,000.
Mr Brentnall, a former partner with City solicitors Turner Kenneth Brown,
joined Hartstone in 1990. He was appointed by Mr Stephen Barker, former
chief executive wholeft Hartstone in June last year with a Pounds 60,000
pay-off, but is suing for a further Pounds 340,000.

Hemingway Properties returned to the black in the six months to June 30,
with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.25m compared with a loss of Pounds 581,000.
The group, which in June spent Pounds 30.2m on nine properties, saw turnover
rise 48 per cent from Pounds 4.58m to Pounds 6.79m. Rental income
contributed most to the increase, rising from Pounds 2.19m to Pounds 4.19m.
Property sales remained stable at Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 2.39m).
Hemingway now has a property portfolio worth Pounds 140m, some Pounds 120m
of which was acquired in the past year. Mr Stanislas Yassukovich, chairman,
said the group would 'continue to seek out property transactions'.
Earnings per share worked through at 0.66p (losses 1.07p). Mr Yassukovich
said the board expected to be able to recommend a final dividend of 0.4p.

FT  10 AUG 94 / CU in Pounds 322m rights to fund Victoire buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial Union, the UK's strongest general insurance company, yesterday
announced details of a Pounds 322m rights issue to help finance its Pounds
1.5bn acquisition of Groupe Victoire from Suez, the French holding company.
The deal, signalled in June, coincided with further indications of a
recovery in the UK general insurance market, with both CU and its rival,
Perth-based General Accident, reporting better than expected first-half
results.
CU reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 181m - up from Pounds 66m - while GA
posted even more impressive figures, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 203.2m,
compared with Pounds 124.7m.
Both companies have benefited from reduced claims, as well as efficiency
improvements, more careful underwriting and rate increases, which followed
industry-wide losses between 1990 and 1992.
CU expects to pay about FFr12.5bn (Pounds 1.5bn) for the main part of Groupe
Victoire's life and general insurance interests, although the final price
will be determined by Victoire's first-half performance. Approximately
FFr800m of the consideration will be paid in the first half of 1995.
The rights issue is on a one-for-eight basis at 475p per share compared with
yesterday's closing price of 563p, up 11p.
Societe Generale, the French bank, will acquire a further 21m shares at
533.89p, through a conditional placing and subscription agreement to raise
Pounds 111.2m, increasing its stake in CU from 3 to 6 per cent.
Suez will buy CU shares worth Pounds 70m, acquiring a stake of about 2 per
cent.
Societe Generale will also underwrite the rights issue along with Kleinwort
Benson and Morgan Stanley, while its UK stockbroking arm, Societe Generale
Strauss Turnbull, is arranging sub-underwriting with Hoare Govett and
Cazenove.
CU will pay some Pounds 200m from internal resources and is to borrow a
further FFr7.65bn after agreeing five-year bank facilities with a syndicate
consisting of Societe Generale, Citibank, Barclays and National Westminster.
The loan will increase CU's debt to Pounds 1.1bn, raising gearing to 55 per
cent.
Mr John Carter, chief executive, said the deal would increase the proportion
of revenues generated by life insurance and improve earnings quality.
Suez, which should be left with cash of around FFr8bn, intends to increase
its interests in the financial services sector, according to Mr Gerard
Worms, its chairman. He said the group might invest further in life
insurance and was interested in expanding its Banque Indosuez subsidiary's
presence outside Europe.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Thomson buys into the market for UK holidays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thomson Travel Group, the UK's biggest overseas holiday company, yesterday
made its first move into domestic tourism by announcing the acquisition of
Marrhigh, which runs a holiday cottage business. The vendors are a group of
institutional investors led by 3i.
Marrhigh operates the Country Holidays Group, the UK's biggest holiday
cottage letting agency. Neither side would say how much Thomson was paying
for the group, but the sum is thought to be about Pounds 34m.
The acquisition marks a significant departure for Thomson, which has never
before sold UK holidays. Thomson is the UK's biggest tour operator, selling
more than 4m overseas holidays a year. Lunn Poly, its retail chain, is the
UK's largest travel agent with 730 high street outlets. Britannia Airways,
its charter airline, is the biggest in the country.
Mr Paul Brett, Thomson's group chairman, said Country Holidays was an
attractive purchase because it was the UK market leader. Its 6,000 cottages
are expected to accommodate 350,000 holidaymakers this year.
The overseas holiday market is dominated by large groups such as Thomson,
Airtours and Owners Abroad, which use their buying power to drive down the
cost of accommodation and transport. By contrast, the UK domestic tourist
market has traditionally been fragmented and dominated by small companies.
The Lancashire-based Country Holidays Group was the subject of a Pounds 14m
management buy-out in 1989 from Mr Philip Green, its founder. Finance for
the buy-out was provided by a group of institutional investors led by 3i.
Its properties are also marketed under the Character Cottages and Haywood
Amaro brand names. The group recorded pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.1m in the
year to October 1993. Pre-tax profits in the year to September 1992 were
Pounds 492,000.
Mr Brett said he regarded the UK cottage holiday market as a substantial
business which could be expanded. He said that despite the growth of
overseas package travel many people took their main holiday in the UK. He
said there was also a large weekend break market.
He said Country Holidays' existing management and 200 employees would remain
in their jobs. Thomson has not yet decided whether to sell UK cottage
holidays though its Lunn Poly outlets. The cottage holidays are currently
marketed to the public through a catalogue.
Thomson has its own direct sales holiday company, Portland. Mr Brett said
there was scope for collaboration between the two direct sales
organisations.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Fight breaks out over US painkillers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An ugly spat broke out in the Dollars 2.3bn-a-year US painkillers market
yesterday when the maker of Advil, the second biggest-selling
non-prescription analgesic, accused two companies of making false claims in
advertisements for a rival brand.
American Home Products, which makes Advil, said it had filed a lawsuit
against Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products company, and Syntex,
another US drugs group, for making misleading statements about their
painkiller Aleve, launched on the US over-the-counter market in June.
Procter &amp; Gamble is also involved in a dispute with Unilever, the
Anglo-Dutch consumer group, over soap powders.
Advil is a branded version of ibuprofen, which has grown in popularity at
the expense of older aspirin-based analgesic products.
In June, sales of Advil and other established analgesics, such as the
top-selling Tylenol, were threatened when Syntex joined with Procter &amp;
Gamble to launch Aleve, an over-the-counter version of the drug naproxen
sodium, previously sold only under prescription.
Yesterday American Home Products accused Procter &amp; Gamble and Syntex of
misleading consumers with 'unwarranted and unsubstantiated claims' for
Aleve's effectiveness. Among the most serious, it said, was the suggestion
that Aleve lasted longer than Advil because the dosing interval was longer.
The longer interval was because of safety concerns.
Procter &amp; Gamble said all its claims for Aleve were true and it would
vigorously defend them.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Film success lifts PolyGram
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The low-budget movie Four Weddings and a Funeral helped PolyGram, the
London-based music and film group, lift half-year net income 14.7 per cent
to Fl 234m. (Pounds 85.5m).
PolyGram, which is 75 per cent owned by Philips of the Netherlands, said
that while music markets worldwide were healthy, its performance had been
held back by a paucity of new hits.
Mr Alain Levy, president, said the group would now begin making bigger
budget films and look for other companies to help share the costs.
Four Weddings and a Funeral, which topped the film charts in the US, the UK
and France, has so far grossed Dollars 125m (Pounds 81m). Mr Levy expected
final takings to be Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m. Only 35 per cent of the final
profits from the film were included in the first-half results.
Mr Levy said the first half had been PolyGram's most active period so far in
the film business, with seven new releases. Several of these had been
unsuccessful, however, including Backbeat, the story of the fifth Beatle.
He said revenues from films and non-music videos rose 56 per cent and now
represented 10.9 per cent of group sales.
While PolyGram's music sales had been hampered by a lack of new hits,
prospects for the second half were good, with albums expected from Stevie
Wonder, Boyz II Men, Amy Grant and Vanessa Williams.
Mr Levy said the classical music market had improved. Luciano Pavarotti's My
Heart's Delight had sold 400,000 copies. The singer extended his exclusive
worldwide contract with PolyGram into the next century.
PolyGram had failed to acquire rights to this year's football World Cup
concert featuring Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras. These had
gone to Warner. The three tenors' recording of their World Cup concert in
1990 had been a best-seller for PolyGram.
Group net sales rose 14.1 per cent to Fl 3.6bn. Income from operations rose
6.6 per cent to Fl 340m. Earnings per share rose 8.3 per cent to Fl 1.30. Mr
Levy said the smaller increase in earnings was the result of last year's
issue of 10m new shares.

FT  10 AUG 94 / No coasting now the easy gains are over: How Barclays Bank
has rebounded so far and so fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of a bank that has taken only 18 months to
switch from making a Pounds 242m loss to rivalling Lloyds as the most
profitable and best capitalised of the big UK banks, had little truck
yesterday with the suggestion that Barclays made too much money in the first
half.
Mr Taylor, who joined the board nine months ago to restore Barclays'
fortunes, pointed out that its average post-tax return on equity for the
past six years had been 4 per cent. 'That sort of return does not just
damage banks, it destroys them,' he said.
Barclays made an annualised return on equity of 23.6 per cent (21 per cent
excluding an Pounds 87m surplus from disposals) and its tier 1 ratio of
shareholders' funds to risk-weighted assets rose to 7 per cent. These were
in line with Lloyds' 21.9 per cent return, and 7.1 per cent tier 1 ratio.
Given Barclays' loss for 1992, and its decision to cut its dividend then,
its Pounds 1.04bn pre-tax profits for the first six months impressed
outsiders. 'We're starting to see the makings of a very great bank if they
stay on track,' said Mr Hugh Pye, banking analyst at Barclays' investment
bank BZW.
Yet a closer examination of the results does not suggest a bank coasting
towards ever higher returns. Operating profits fell by Pounds 108m to Pounds
1.23bn as it shrank loans and competed in an over-crowded UK market. All but
Pounds 23m of the Pounds 701m rise in pre-tax profits came from a fall in
bad debt charges.
The fall in bad debts was more pronounced than at other banks. Its Pounds
306m provision is only 0.29 per cent of loans and advances, compared with
0.80 per cent in the same period last year. This is only just more than half
Lloyds' figure of 0.55 per cent (excluding problem country provisions).
Although the ratio of total provisions to troubled and non-performing loans
rose from 31.8 to 35.9 per cent, the low level of new provisions could
indicate that Barclays either over-provided for bad loans during the worst
times, or is making inadequate provisions for fresh problems.
In practice, it is hard to calculate what a normal level of provisions
should be. Given continuing low inflation, bankers have started to guess at
long-term provisions figures of about 0.7 per cent for a full year. This is
not far from Barclays' half-year charge of just below half that.
Mr Taylor was unwilling to make predictions, pointing out that bad debt
charges in the last economic cycle rose to well above former peaks. 'It is
difficult to keep in mind how extremely high by historical standards
provisions have been. They really have been out of the window.'
Mr Pye argues that Barclays' swing in provisions may be more pronounced than
other banks' because it made large bad debt charges late in the last cycle.
'Their bad debts have been rather squashed up, so I don't think it is a sign
of imprudence that the charge is so low,' he said.
Even if provisions are appropriate, their low level means that Barclays will
have to improve operating performance in the next year to sustain rises in
profits. The UK clearing bank's 5 per cent operating improvement was largely
due to staff cuts, and income is under strong pressure.
Mr Taylor exhibited a mixture of caution and bullishness about the
prospects. On the one hand, he argued that it would be impossible to
maintain return on equity of above 20 per cent given the degree of
competition in retail banking. 'It is bound to be competed away to some
extent.'
On the other, he also emphasised the strength of operating businesses such
as Barclaycard. Their size would help them to design and sell products at
lower cost.
'We are starting to exercise that leadership. We're not sitting here waiting
for people to slice bits off us. They do that at their peril,' he said.
Mr Taylor said Barclays would continue to try to employ capital better,
cutting higher-risk assets and shifting capital towards those with a lower
risk-weighting and higher margins. Securitisation and other measures helped
reduce its risk-weighted assets by 7 per cent to Pounds 94.7bn.
Yet the easiest gains may be over in terms of reducing its poor assets,
while higher margins on those such as mortgages have already narrowed. This
will make it harder to find good uses for the bank's growing equity capital
 -up from Pounds 5.33bn to Pounds 5.9bn, with retained earnings of Pounds
530m.
This might not appear too pressing a worry given Barclays' return on equity
in the first half. Yet Mr Taylor emphasised that the bank has yet to prove
that it can make consistent returns. 'We are conscious that we owe our
shareholders a fair bit, and we are beginning to pay it back.'
If anything, that may make Mr Taylor's personal task harder. Having been in
place full-time only since the start of the year, he cannot claim much
credit for yesterday's results. By the time shareholders look to him to
demonstrate his worth, Barclays will be operating in a tougher world.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Senators detect CIA's concealed spy centre: Perry orders
investigation into agency's Dollars 310m secret office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Central Intelligence Agency, ever adept at the art of disguise, appears
to have surpassed itself by concealing an entire office complex  - duping
the residents of suburban Washington, Congress, and perhaps even President
Bill Clinton.
The undercover building, disguised as a corporate centre for Rockwell
International, the Los Angeles-based defence contractor, was this week
unmasked as the new headquarters of the secretive National Reconnaissance
Office, which operates all US spy satellites and is run by the Pentagon and
the CIA.
Mr James Woolsey, director of the CIA, will go before the Senate
intelligence committee today to explain to furious senators how details of
the Dollars 310m (Pounds 200m) complex - almost one fifth the size of the
Pentagon - were slipped under their noses.
The committee wants to know why it was not informed about the cost, scope
and even location of the four-building compound, being constructed on a
68-acre site at Chantilly, Virginia, 30 miles outside Washington.
Mr William Perry, defence secretary, said he had ordered the Pentagon to
investigate construction of the building. President Clinton declassified its
existence on Monday after prodding from angry senators, who discovered the
project during a congressional audit of intelligence facilities.
Dissatisfied with the information the Pentagon and CIA were providing them,
the legislators requested a review of NRO financing and went public with
their findings.
Mr Clinton himself may have been unaware of the project, now dubbed the
'Stealth' building, according to Senator Dennis DeConcini, chairman of the
intelligence committee. Mr DeConcini told Mr Clinton about the project last
week. The intelligence community, Mr DeConcini said, 'faced the question:
how do you hide an elephant on a football field? That's what they did, and
with great pride.'
Rockwell was listed as the official purchaser of the site in 1990 and
obtained special permits to build a high-security fence around the facility.
A Rockwell spokeswoman said yesterday it was 'constructing a facility in
northern Virginia to support certain government contract facilities of our
defence electronic businesses'. Construction 'was being performed by Collins
International Service Corp, a Rockwell subsidiary. All details are
classified,' she said.
The senators' public announcement forced the CIA to release a brief
statement that Mr Woolsey and Mr John Deutch, deputy defence secretary, will
be reviewing the project's history and how Congress was updated on its
progress. The release stated that 'no other information about the NRO or
this project has been declassified'.
For Mr Woolsey, the emergence of the grandiose over-budget project, aimed at
accommodating 3,000 NRO employees, is another embarrassment. He has been
trying to rebuild the CIA's public image, badly tarnished recently by the
Aldrich Ames spy case and critics' claims that the agency is obsolete.

FT  10 AUG 94 / UK visible trade deficit widens to more than Pounds 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A big jump in imports of precious stones pushed the UK further into the red
in May, with the visible trade deficit widening to Pounds 1.03bn from Pounds
770m in April.
However, the Central Statistical Office estimates that the trend is for a
narrowing visible deficit, with exports rising faster than imports. If oil
and erratic items, such as precious stones, are excluded, the trade deficit
increased only slightly from Pounds 1.44bn in April to Pounds 1.5bn in May.
The May deficit was in line with City expectations. 'Many commentators
warned that as we came out of the recession the trade figures would not be
particularly good, but in fact the figures show a continuing upward trend,'
said Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister.
But Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'These trade
figures are disappointing news for the economy. They are yet more evidence
of how weak and sickly the recovery really is.'
Figures for Britain's worldwide trade are released around three months in
arrears, thanks to the European Union's single market. Information on trade
among EU countries takes longer to collect than figures for trade outside
the Union. Britain's trade with its EU partners is growing strongly. In the
three months to May, export volumes, excluding oil and erratics, were 6 per
cent higher than in the previous three months, while imports were up 4.5 per
cent.
However, the UK's deficit with EU countries widened slightly in May, to
Pounds 377m in May, from Pounds 304m in April.
Of UK imports from the EU, half of the growth came from Germany, while
growth in exports was concentrated on Ireland, Italy and Spain. Outside the
EU, there was a marked increase in imports from other OECD countries, a
category dominated by Japan.
The UK is continuing to benefit from a rise in North Sea oil production,
which has boosted oil exports. The UK had a trade surplus in oil of Pounds
1.13bn in the three months to May, the highest three-monthly total since
1987.
The CSO said its estimate of the trend showed export values were rising at 1
per cent a month and imports at 0.5 per cent per month. In volume terms, the
improvement is less marked. Excluding oil and erratics, export volumes are
rising by just over 0.5 per cent a month, while imports are increasing by
just under 0.5 per cent per month.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Japanese investors fall under curse of pyramids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese investors, in common with their counterparts in Moscow and the UK,
are finding that innovative local companies have yet to perfect the
profitable pyramid scheme.
Government figures yesterday suggested that police found 331,000 investors
stuck in pyramid schemes in the first seven months this year, more than
double the 163,500 affected for the whole of last year.
Multi-tiered marketing, as proponents prefer to describe such schemes, is
not illegal in Japan. The ministry of international trade and industry
releases occasional warnings to take care in dealings with certain
companies, and urges mainstream employers to warn their workforces.
The pyramid companies are called nezumiko ('mice networks') because of their
constant need to breed. Unlike MMM, the subject of Muscovite riots, Japanese
pyramid companies often have a product of sorts to sell.
But they rely on the same principle: paying anything near their projected
dividends requires continuing recruitment of participants who will be
progressively less advantaged as the pecking order grows.
The losses have been mounting quickly this year. Stakeholders' losses
reached Y76.2bn (Dollars 770m) in the first seven months, up from Y29.5bn in
1993 and just Y7.1bn the year before, when barely 30,000 people were caught
out.
In the latest known case, Sun Flower, a Tokyo company selling water and air
purifiers, fax machines and health foods, recruited some 280,000 agents by
telling them they would earn as much as Y1m a month. The agents were
expected to buy products themselves, and police say that few made any money
except the 20 executives subsequently arrested.
In February, police accused directors of an Osaka waterbed maker of
illegally persuading people to part with at least Y230,000 for one of its
products, plus Y10,000 apiece to join a scheme where they would earn
commission not only from those they recruited but from all those beneath
them in the chain.
Agents of such companies canvass acquaintances or sell door-to-door in their
spare time. Most are young white-collar workers, often newly relocated to
big cities and inspired by the expectation of getting rich quickly at a time
when regular employers are cutting bonuses.
The pyramid companies sometimes offer credit terms to get recruits started,
but Ms Keiko Furukawa of the Tokyo metropolitan government consumers' centre
says there are other seductions. One company making jacuzzi attachments held
regular barbecues for members.

FT  10 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: PolyGram
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget Four Weddings and a Funeral. The real story of PolyGram's film
business in the first half was Four Flops and a Hit. The cost of the turkeys
almost swamped the profits from Four Weddings, the low-budget British comedy
that has already grossed Dollars 128m, and there was only a modest reduction
in losses from its non-music interests. By not breaking out the numbers
PolyGram allowed some analysts to assume that profits from the core music
business actually fell. Although this notion was quickly scotched, the 8 per
cent rise in group earnings per share was pedestrian by PolyGram's
standards. To be fair, income was depressed by other start-up losses while
the rights issue-funded acquisition of Motown diluted earnings.
All record companies are becoming more weighted towards the second half and,
after a very quiet first half, PolyGram has a strong release schedule coming
up. Of course, there is no guarantee they will all be hits, though at least
the performance of albums tends to be more predictable than films. The
response to Four Weddings only underlines how difficult these are to judge
and chairman Mr Alain Levy insists the success has not gone to the corporate
head.
The fact that one of the songs from the film is topping the UK charts shows
there is value combining music and movies under one roof even if, like Mr
Levy, one does not buy all the multimedia hype. While he is coming round to
the idea that movie-makers may need to have interests in television
broadcasters, shareholders should not be too alarmed. He is not one to throw
money around in a hurry.

FT  10 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: General Accident
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's interim figures from General Accident show just why Commercial
Union has chosen the right time to expand overseas. After three years of
rising premiums, the UK is turning in exceptional underwriting profits. But
the handsome returns on equity now being enjoyed by the composite insurers
are unsustainable. While the 2 per cent fall in GA's shares yesterday partly
reflected disappointment over the group's investment performance,
shareholders may also wonder where the impetus for growth will come from.
With underwriting losses outside the UK amounting to Pounds 51m in the
second quarter, there is clearly further room for self-help. An improvement
in the results of GA's London market operations, lower reinsurance costs and
better luck with the weather would all help. Yet modest gains could easily
be eroded as the UK cycle starts to slip back. Without an upturn in the US
underwriting cycle it is difficult to see the North American businesses -
which account for 44 per cent of premium income - delivering spectacularly
better results. Having paid down the debt taken on for the disastrous
purchase of NZI Corporation in 1988, GA might take a deep breath and start
looking for acquisitions again.

<TEXT>
While the details of Commercial Union's purchase of Groupe Victoire have
barely changed since the deal was announced in June, there is nothing in
yesterday's funding package to worry shareholders. Gearing of around 50 per
cent looks comfortable, especially since UK insurance operations are close
to their profitable peak. Although the deal will dilute earnings this year
and next, investors looking for a decent long-term return might welcome the
addition of debt to the funding mix. The low levels of gearing seen
elsewhere in the sector may be too conservative to deliver a decent return
on shareholders funds' once the UK insurance cycle turns down.
It is equally difficult to see the presence of Societe Generale and
Compagnie de Suez on the share register as anything but helpful for an
insurer with serious ambitions in France. CU's asset mix will also stand out
from the crowd once Victoire has been absorbed. The group's property
portfolio will treble as a proportion of total assets to 16 per cent, among
the highest in the sector. If CU has its timing right, investment gains on
its large slice of residential Paris could more than make up for early
dilution in terms of earnings.
Neither influential shareholders nor decent investment returns will help CU
if Victoire does not perform as an insurance company. If Victoire delivers
on its promise, though, the structure of the deal could prove to be the
icing on the cake.

FT  10 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Barclays' happy return
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unlike other banks which blame the weakness of UK loan demand for their
stagnant balance sheets, Barclays is making a virtue out of the Pounds 10bn
first-half fall in its customer lending. The bank says this reflects
deliberate adjustments to its loan portfolio to eliminate assets which are
too risky for the returns they offer. After the ravages of the recession
during which Barclays was far too heavily exposed to property and
construction, this is perfectly sensible. Barclays is right to make a start
even before its sophisticated new approach to credit assessment and loan
pricing comes into force next year.
But weeding out the unwanted assets is a much easier job than adding new
ones of the desired quality. For now Barclays is making a handsome return.
Yet the bank admits that earnings cannot exceed 20 per cent of shareholders'
funds indefinitely. Once the return slips it will need higher volume to
maintain profit momentum. It cannot ignore the weakness at the operating
level where profits fell by 8 per cent despite rigorous control over costs.
The miracle cure designed by Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' new chief
executive, will not be complete until he has shown that safe lending does
not mean no lending. Few indeed are the bankers who manage consistently to
lend money at rates which are both competitive and remunerative. Barclays
might steal a march if it can refine its risk assessment to the point where
its judgment is sharper than that of other institutions. Even so its
prospective growth does not appear to warrant a tier one capital ratio of 7
per cent. Rather than kowtow to the rating agencies, Barclays should
consider using its retained earnings to pay some of its expensive preference
share capital back. After all, it is easier to impose discipline on lending
if capital is a scarce resource.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Leading Article: One country, two states
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Sunday's agreement between China and Taiwan was in itself a limited
affair, confined to mundane issues on which the two governments have an
obvious common interest. Yet one of those issues - the repatriation of
airline hijackers and illegal immigrants - is of considerable emotional and
ideological significance. Not so long ago any migrant who reached Taiwan
from mainland China, by whatever method, would have been welcomed as a
refugee from communism, following in the footsteps of the Chinese
nationalist government which fled to Taiwan in 1949.
That the two governments are now able to agree on such an issue, or indeed
on any substantive political issue, marks an important change - as does the
fact that the agreement was negotiated in Taiwan by a senior Chinese
official, Tang Shubei. Inevitably, the breakthrough has fuelled speculation
that the two sides might be moving towards reunification, which both still
claim as their ultimate goal. The difference between them is ideological
rather than ethnic or national, so if ideological differences can be
overcome reunification seems a logical end result. The example of Germany,
where reunification came about through the fall of communism and the triumph
of democracy, should be encouraging from Taiwan's point of view.
Taiwanese wary
Yes, but the example of Vietnam, where reunification came through the
triumph of communism, is closer in space if further off in time; and in
China's case the disparity in size is so much in the mainland's favour that
Taiwanese are understandably wary. A vocal minority of them, represented by
the Democratic Progressive Party, favours independence for the island.
President Lee Teng-hui, himself born in Taiwan, is believed privately to
share their views.
Certainly that seems the only logical interpretation of his vigorous
campaign for UN membership. The UN is an organisation of sovereign states,
in which China's seat has been occupied by the Beijing regime since 1972. Mr
Lee is not seeking to reclaim that seat but to win separate membership for
his own state, which amounts to a claim of separate sovereignty.
His campaign has no chance of success so long as Beijing opposes it. The
majority of UN members, including the other four permanent members of the
Security Council, decided long ago that mainland China is too important -
geopolitically and now economically as well - for its government's wishes on
such a sensitive point to be ignored. But that has not stopped Taiwan, as an
emerging economic power, from playing a major role in the regional and
global economy. It is a founder member of the Asian Development Bank, and is
now negotiating to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It would
be good if a way could be found for it to participate, with or without full
membership, in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund as well.
Options open
While the Taiwan business community is increasingly keen on closer ties with
the mainland (having already invested there on a grand scale), more than 40
per cent of the population favours neither reunification nor independence.
Indeed, it makes good sense for Taiwan to keep its options open as far as
possible, while observing how China develops. In responding to any pressure
for reunification from the Chinese side, Taiwan is entitled to expect
international support in insisting that this can happen only if and when its
people so decide. As a first step, China should unequivocally eliminate any
threat to seek unity by force.
In making their judgment, the Taiwanese will rightly reject any suggestion
that they should adapt to communism, and will look instead for evidence that
China is adapting to the system which has made Taiwan such an outstanding
success. On the economic side the signs are encouraging; but in terms of
political democracy the mainland has not yet begun to follow the path boldly
charted by Mr Lee since he came to power in 1988. Taiwan will watch with
particular interest to see how Hong Kong fares when sovereignty there
reverts to China, under the principle of 'one country, two systems', in
1997.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Flying high with the dragon: China's aerospace industry
offers a lucrative target to western airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The signing of an aircraft manufacturing deal this week between China and
Boeing marks a further significant penetration by the west's aerospace
industry into China's rapidly expanding civil aviation business.
Like its competitors, Boeing knows that in signing its biggest manufacturing
agreement with China, involving Chinese production of a fuselage section of
the US manufacturer's popular 737 twin engine airliner, it is playing for
high stakes. There is big money for western manufacturers and airlines in
what has become the world's third-largest aviation market after the US and
Japan.
For China, the stakes are equally high. Boeing's increasing involvement in
the country's aviation sector, together with other international airlines
and manufacturers, should improve air safety after an era in which standards
have been sacrificed for rapid growth. Since the Beijing government
sanctioned the development of regional airlines in the 1980s, a combination
of lax regulation and heady expansion has led to an alarming number of fatal
air crashes.
'What we are seeing is an industry trying to do it all at once,' said Mr Tom
Gallagher, a senior vice-president of the US Chase Manhattan bank. The
Chinese are trying to set up airlines, build airports, buy aircraft, train
pilots, and develop maintenance capability and a safe and unified air
traffic control system, while air traffic grows by more than 20 per cent a
year.
'This adds up to a most daunting task. Will China be able to pull it off?'
Mr Gallagher asked recently.
Some 500 people have died in air crashes in China since 1992. The accident
in June involving a China Northwest Airlines Russian-built Tupolev TU-154,
killing 160 people, again focused attention on what the Chinese civil
aviation authorities had warned were inadequate airline safety standards.
Only a few days before the China Northwest crash near the historic city of
Xian - the worst in the country's history - the new head of the Civil
Aviation Administration of China launched an air safety drive, after
revealing that 'several tens' of near-accidents had occurred this year,
including aircraft going off runways and engines 'stopping in mid-air'.
'The Chinese have realised they have been getting a bit thin to ensure
safety standards and they have decided to curb growth a little to ensure
better safety,' said Mr Pierre Jeanniot, director-general of the
International Air Transport Association (IATA), the trade organisation
grouping 224 airlines which China joined last year.
The unfavourable attention drawn to China's air safety record by the Xian
crash is expected to hasten a process already under way. Chinese airlines
are seeking closer ties with foreign carriers to help them upgrade safety
and cabin service, as well as securing greater co-operation between China
and western aircraft manufacturers.
China recently announced it was opening its aviation sector, including
airlines, airport terminals, maintenance and catering facilities, to foreign
involvement, with a 35 per cent ceiling on foreign investment. While
representatives of foreign carriers are scouring the country looking for
joint ventures, establishing partnerships will not be easy given the gap
between business cultures and operating procedures.
In spite of the difficulties, several foreign carriers are lining up to do
business in China:
British Airways is among a group of large international airlines stepping up
efforts to participate in the modernisation and expansion of the Chinese
airline market. 'We feel there are considerable long-term opportunities in
China,' said Mr David Holmes, BA's director of government and international
affairs.
BA is already co-operating with China Southern, the Guangzhou-based carrier
and one of the eight largest Chinese airlines operating western aircraft. BA
has formed a joint engineering venture with China Southern and has recently
sold the airline computer services. It is also talking with Shanghai-based
China Eastern Airlines about pilot training, engineering and computer
reservation systems.
Although BA is not pushing at this stage to take a stake in one or more
Chinese airlines, its longer-term ambition is to negotiate a marketing
agreement with a large Chinese carrier to co-ordinate services at Beijing
airport. Qantas, the Australian carrier in which BA has acquired a 25 per
cent stake, is targeting smaller regional carriers and has been in
discussion with airlines in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Yunan, but officials
stress these are only preliminary talks.
Lufthansa of Germany was among the first big international airlines to
invest in China. Its maintenance joint venture with Air China at Beijing
airport called Ameco (the Aircraft Maintenance and Engineering Corporation)
employs nearly 4,000 people. Also in Beijing, the German carrier recently
inaugurated an aeronautical apprentice training centre; it has also opened
an office, shopping and hotel complex in the Chinese capital.
The US Lockheed group and Hutchison China Trade Holdings are involved in an
aircraft maintenance venture with China Southern in the south of the
country.
Singapore Airlines (SIA), Cathay Pacific and Japan Airlines have invested in
a maintenance facility with Xiamen Airlines, south of Shanghai.
'China is one of the three major growth areas we have targeted for the next
decade, together with India and Vietnam,' said Dr Cheong Choong Kong, SIA's
managing director. SIA, one of the world's consistently profitable airlines,
has been approached by several Chinese carriers and has already provided
technical co-operation to Chinese regional airlines for the past five years.
It has recently taken a 40 per cent stake in Beijing airport's ground
handling service company and another 40 per cent stake in Beijing airport's
in-flight kitchen company providing meals for airlines operating in and out
of the capital.
These initiatives will almost certainly be just the beginning of more
extensive links between Chinese carriers and foreign airlines and service
organisations. 'Most of China's airlines are looking for assistance in a
number of important areas such as pilot training, engineering and
maintenance, and ground and cabin service training,' explained the Beijing
representative of a large European carrier.
China's increasing preoccupation with safety and improving industry
standards is also expected to continue encouraging Chinese carriers to buy
modern western airliners.
Recent studies indicate that China will experience explosive growth in
demand for western aircraft, with one forecast predicting a fivefold
increase to the year 2010 in the country's current commercial aircraft fleet
of about 350 airliners. According to Chase Manhattan, China's requirements
in the next 15 years might exceed 1,200 new aircraft worth Dollars 90bn.
This is far more than previous forecasts by, among others, Boeing, which
predicts demand for 800 aircraft worth Dollars 40bn, and the European Airbus
consortium, which expects China to buy 620 aircraft between now and 2011 to
replace older, largely Soviet-built aircraft and provide capacity for
growth.
Chase's forecast is based on passenger growth of 20 per cent annually until
1998, dropping to 15 per cent a year to 2004 and then to 10 per cent a year
in the six years to 2010. However, after surging 33 per cent in 1992,
passenger growth slowed to less than 20 per cent last year, in part
reflecting the credit squeeze instituted by the Chinese authorities last
July.
Even if Chase's assessment proves to be wildly optimistic, there is no doubt
that the Chinese market will continue to be the world aviation industry's
biggest prize for the foreseeable future. In 1974, the country's civil
aviation fleet had just 12 aircraft. Last year alone, Boeing delivered 46
airliners to China or 14 per cent of its 1993 production totalling 330
aircraft. China will take delivery of 36 additional aircraft this year,
which again will account for 14 per cent of Boeing's total 260 airliners
this year.
Boeing staff also provide support for Boeing aircraft in 13 cities
throughout China. The US manufacturer trained more than 800 pilots and
maintenance engineers from China last year, is advising the Chinese
authorities on air traffic control systems and procedures, and since 1980
has bought parts made in China for its aircraft programmes.
Boeing's European rival, Airbus, clinched orders worth about Dollars 1.2bn
last year and now has three Chinese airlines operating Airbus equipment,
including China Eastern in Shanghai, China Northwest in Xian and China
Northern in Shenyang. In addition, two Chinese manufacturers - the Shenyang
Aircraft Corporation and the Xian Aircraft Company - make parts for Airbus
aircraft.
McDonnell Douglas, the other US airliner manufacturer, has also sought to
build close ties with China through joint production of MD-82 twin-engine,
150-seat airliners with the Shanghai Aviation Industrial Corporation.
China's market is not only proving a bonanza for aircraft manufacturers, but
for suppliers of a whole range of aviation equipment. Rolls-Royce, for
example, is supplying 42 of its RB211-535 powerplants for Boeing 757s bought
by Chinese airlines, and says it is confident of winning further orders.
But China's current policy of buying or leasing new or virtually new
equipment is proving expensive, especially when considering the low
utilisation rate of modern western aircraft by Chinese airlines. The Chase
study shows that average aircraft utilisation in China remains low, rising
from only 4.7 hours a day in 1990 to 5.2 hours in 1992. This compares with
11 hours for SIA, 10 hours for Cathay Pacific and 8 hours for Korean
Airlines.
Such a low aircraft utilisation rate is largely the result of the country's
inadequate infrastructure, notably air traffic control, the number and
condition of airports, airspace limitations and the need for better trained
ground and flight personnel. It should eventually improve if China goes
ahead with ambitious plans to upgrade 50 airports during the next 10 years,
as well as build an additional 90 airports to bring the total to about 200
by the end of the decade. At present, there are 109 airports in operation,
of which only 40 have instrument-landing systems and only 12 can handle
Boeing 747 jumbo aircraft.
The cost of operating new fleets of western-built aircraft will also
inevitably increase, as the maintenance holiday that comes with a young
fleet gradually disappears. In turn, this will put additional pressure on
building new maintenance facilities and training personnel. For this reason,
Chase recommends that Chinese airlines consider, in the short term at least,
buying or leasing used western aircraft.
The high cost of modernising and expanding its aviation industry has
prompted China and its airlines to seek overseas capital. Shanghai-based
China Eastern and Guangzhou-based China Southern are among 22 Chinese
companies selected for stock market listing abroad. Xian Aircraft
manufac-turing, China's biggest aerospace company, is also one of the chosen
22.
China Southern is said by aviation industry observers to have advanced
furthest in preparation for a New York Stock Exchange listing, but recent
reports suggest that China Eastern may be allowed to go first. Goldman Sachs
and Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment banks, have been advising
China Southern and China Eastern respectively in what are certain to be
high-profile listings.
While China's poor air safety record may deter some investors, Hong Kong
stock market experts believe this is unlikely to have a significant impact
on the offer price.
'The industry's centre of gravity is moving east and a lot of future growth
will come from China,' says IATA director-general Mr Jeanniot. But he also
warns that the dilemma facing Chinese civil aviation is that, with annual
growth rates of 20 to 30 per cent, 'you simply can't acquire experience that
rapidly'.
Privatisation can provide a solution to funding problems, but it cannot
resolve air safety issues. As Mr Jeanniot emphasises: 'One area of aviation
you will never be able to privatise or corporatise is safety enforcement.'

Picking the right epitaph is likely to become even more tricky now that a
Church of England court has upheld a decision by a Blackburn vicar to ban
the use of words such as Dad and Mum on gravestones. There has already been
a spirited correspondence on the subject in the Daily Telegraph.
Clearly, the vicar would not have allowed the gravestone in Tombstone,
Arizona: 'Here lies Lester Moore, four slugs from an A 44, no Lez, no
Moore'. Nor would he have countenanced Observer's favourite epitaph
concerning the famous head waiter - 'God finally caught his eye.'

FT  10 AUG 94 / Observer: Ryrie rules
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So the City of London has a soul after all - though it is perhaps something
of a pity that it takes a disaster of Rwandan proportions to stir it.
An extremely pukka collection of financiers have appended their names to the
City of London Emergency Rwanda Appeal (COLERA), launched yesterday and
chaired by Sir William Ryrie, former boss of the IFC, the private sector arm
of the World Bank.
The target is to pull in Pounds 1m over the next fortnight. 'City people are
not always what they seem,' says Ryrie, who has mostly found himself pushing
on an open door. Fully alive to the criticisms of aid donations not reaching
their targets, Ryrie has asked for progress reports from the charities
concerned which, he adds, will be a 'good discipline' for them, too.
Cheques, please, payable to COLERA (Rwanda)/DEC, and addressed to Disasters

Merchant bankers' verbal pirouettes on their clients' behalf do not always
stand up to scrutiny. Take Service Corporation International's agreed bid
for Great Southern. Schroders had drafted the usual spiel for the statement
by Great Southern chairman James Smillie, which went on about the offer
being 'in the best interests of shareholders, employees and customers'.
Since Great Southern is in the burial business, its customers are rarely in
a position to appreciate the niceties of the undertaker's performance. The
exalted claim was excised in the nick of time.

Bet this angle hasn't occurred to The Hecklers, a band of musical terrorists
on the rampage in Britain trying to discourage the 'sonic sewage' of avant
garde music. But perhaps the death in Copenhagen of a female okapi over the
weekend was not in vain.
This giraffe-like African beastie has just keeled over, stressed out by the
sounds of opera singers practising the - relatively tuneful - Wagner opera
Tannhauser. Its male companion and the calf were less affected and are still
alive to tell the tale. But just think what a blast of late 20th century
music might have done to the rest of the family.

Out of sight out of mind, so to speak. Four months after the passing of
Richard Nixon, the 20th anniversary of his Watergate-induced resignation
merited not one line in the Washington Post, the newspaper whose reporting,
more than any other, contributed to his dramatic downfall.
Careful scrutiny even of the classified advertisements revealed not a single
job opening for plumbers at the White House or the Watergate complex.
In fact the only anniversary recognised by the Post at all was a helpful
article on who did not go to the Woodstock rock festival, which took place
25 years ago this weekend - and it failed to include Nixon in the list of
those who were otherwise engaged.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Observer: Shareholders' banker
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is such a thing as a popular banker, then Sir Eric Faulkner, the
former chairman of Lloyds Bank who has just died, fitted the bill.
He spent over 30 years at Glyn, Mills &amp; Co, a small bank where a
disproportionate number of City bankers cut their teeth. Sir Jeremy Morse,
Sir Richard Lloyd, Alan Moore, Alex Ritchie, John Sclater and John
Butterwick are just a few of the figures who learnt their trade under Sir
Eric.
He would probably have stayed at Glyn, Mills but for a quirk of fate. Sir
Reginald Verdon-Smith, chairman of the Bristol Aeroplane Company, had been
lined up to take over from Sir Harald Peake as chairman of Lloyds in 1969.
But Sir Reginald withdrew after a Public Accounts Committee report
criticised the excess profits made by Bristol Siddeley Engines on official
contracts.
Meanwhile, Glyn, Mills was on the point of merging with the National Bank
and William Deacon's, and Faulkner probably realised that he was not going
to get the top job in a group dominated by the Royal Bank of Scotland.
One can only wonder what would have happened if he had taken charge of the
Royal Bank of Scotland rather than a rudderless Lloyds Bank which had just
been refused permission to merge with Barclays and Martins Bank.
The Royal Bank drifted for more than a decade until it became an obvious
takeover target. By contrast Lloyds Bank, the smallest of the big four, set
off to become a successful international bank. When the secondary banking
crisis struck in the early 1970s, it was Faulkner, as chairman of the
Committee of London Clearing Bankers, who helped organise the various bank
rescues.
If only the City had bred more bankers in Sir Eric's mould then the
high-street banks might not have had to tap their shareholders for so much
money to shore up their balance sheets in the 1970s and 1980s.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Balancing the scales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's skirmishes in the Bay of Biscay are the latest reminder that the
world has too many fishermen chasing ever fewer fish. Intimidating the
competition is no solution. But neither is a policy regime which feeds the
pressure it purports to regulate.
Faced with what they considered to be slipshod enforcement of the European
Union's existing net-size restrictions, Spanish fishermen last week took
matters into their own hands. Although the Spaniards' tactics cannot be
condoned, member governments are correctly concluding that they must tighten
their enforcement of the rules, if others are not to take the same route.
What they are reluctant to consider is fundamental changes to the rules
themselves.
A larger, more vigilant force of inspectors may calm the waters for the time
being. But the Spanish will still feel aggrieved at the sight of British,
French and Irish boats using drift-nets to catch tuna, while the native
fleet boasts only old-fashioned rods and lines. Spain has long argued, with
the European Commission's support, for an all-out ban on drift-nets. The UK
successfully resisted this in the spring, but will have to face the issue
again when the Commission discusses it in the autumn.
For those wishing to avoid a repeat of this week's on-board disputes about
the size of particular nets, an outright ban has a clear appeal. But, as
yesterday's House of Lords committee report points out, the environmental
case against such nets is not clear-cut. In fact, the Commission's support
for the ban has all the hallmarks of a band-aid solution. A policy of
prohibition would be easier to enforce, certainly, but it would not tackle
the underlying problem.
Net technology
In the event of a ban, users of drift-nets would understandably feel that
they were being penalised for reacting rationally to the incentives provided
by the current regime. Permitted to catch fewer and fewer of the white fish
closer to home, they have diversified towards tuna, for which there is no
quota, using the latest net technology to catch as many as possible. For all
their complaints, the Spanish have done much the same. What they lack in
technology they make up in numbers, with 17,000 vessels, a third of Europe's
entire fishing fleet. In both cases, it is the incentives to fish which must
be changed, not merely the way fish are caught.
Europe currently has 40 per cent more boats than it needs to catch a
sustainable number of fish, because governments have not yet found a way to
make fish as valuable to fishermen alive as dead. Owing to that worldwide
failure, the UN estimates that more than half of all of the world's major
fisheries are in decline. All have reached, or exceeded, the maximum safe
yearly catch.
Fishing communities
A sustainable world fishing industry would be a much smaller one. European
and other governments are politically, and morally, committed to helping
fishing communities adjust. Yet they are also obliged to ensure that the
industry does not first extinguish the world's fish population. As currently
pursued, the two strands of policy are at odds. By and large, fishermen are
being subsidised to fish themselves out of a job. This must stop. The focus
of subsidies should be on inducing exit from the industry, not on helping to
shore up the dwindling revenue that the industry provides.
Yet even a more vigorous effort to reduce the industry's size will take
considerable time. And a smaller industry will tend to over-fish existing
stocks if the fishermen who remain are not given a stake in doing otherwise.
Ideally, existing members of the industry should be awarded individually
tradable rights to a certain percentage of the allowed catch. Each fisherman
would then have to decide whether it makes sense to sell these to someone
else, or pay an additional licence fee to take up those rights.
Experiments along these lines in New Zealand and Iceland have shown that a
determined government can overcome the numerous obstacles involved. Even so,
without international agreement on reducing the size of the world's fishing
fleet, a country or even a region can only go so far in preserving
tomorrow's fish supplies. What is needed is a global framework. Next week's
UN convention on the subject ought to provide a start.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Crest equity settlement project on
target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J R E FOOTMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am disappointed by your newspaper's coverage of the Crest equity
settlement project. Thus far, the Crest team has missed no deadline, made no
change to its timetable for implementation, and has kept to its original
budget projection. And yet the headline on August 4 said 'Further delays hit
Crest system'.
As the Bank has stated many times Crest is not operationally dependent upon
a move to rolling settlement on a T+5 basis. The fact that the Stock
Exchange will take no decision on the date of T+5 until October has been in
the public domain for months. It has no bearing on the Crest timetable.
The Crest project has been on time and on budget since the design phase
started in August last year. Nothing has changed that picture.

FT  10 AUG 94 / TV farce in search of a theme tune: An attempt to bring a
little harmony to European media ownership rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Media magnate Mr Rupert Murdoch sends a flutter through the UK political
system by hinting that the previously right-leaning newspapers he controls
might back Labour leader Mr Tony Blair. In Italy, Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi is still dogged by controversy over a possible conflict of
interest between his political duties and Fininvest media empire. These are
just two examples of why media ownership in Europe is a sensitive topic.
But the need to tread carefully has not stopped European Commission
officials overseeing the progress of Europe's single market from tackling
the subject. They are worried that, because media ownership rules differ
between countries, investment in the industry is being hampered.
'If the status quo is maintained,' says a Commission official, 'the European
market will not attract potential international investment in the media. In
addition, existing national players in the media will try to expand in other
markets around the world which will result in a loss of investment in the
Union.'
The challenge identified by the Commission is how the European Union can
take advantage of advances in broadcasting technology which are paving the
way for, among other things, pay television, video on demand, and a
proliferation of specialised channels.
The ideal solution, according to many Commission officials, is to harmonise
rules on media ownership at EU level - a position the Commission is likely
to adopt next month when it considers draft proposals from the directorate
responsible for the single market.
But it may be harder to sell such a policy to the 12 EU member states.
Asking nations to dismantle their legislation on media ownership - even with
the laudable aim of improving the investment climate - will prompt searching
debates about the EU's role in regulating the media, as well as discussions
in the industry, with politicians, the European Parliament, and the
Commission.
Those in the Commission who would like harmonisation will hope the anomalies
in the current patchwork of media ownership rules will give impetus to their
proposals.
For example, in the UK, there is no limit on the number of satellite
television stations that can be owned by one person. In Italy, no one person
can own more than three satellite or terrestrial stations. In France and
Spain, the limit is one.
In the Netherlands, newspaper publishers with a market share of more than 25
per cent are not allowed to own a TV channel. The same applies in Italy but
with a threshold of 16 per cent. In the UK, a newspaper owner, no matter
what the market share, cannot own more than 20 per cent of a terrestrial
channel, but there is no limit on ownership of satellite channels.
The problems created by such differences have surfaced during a consultative
exercise the Commission carried out last year among 70 companies and
industry organisations. It found that many companies believe European-wide
action to smooth out such wide inconsistencies is urgently needed.
As the Italian media group L'Espresso said in its submission: 'The
disparities which exist between national rules create distortions in the
allocation of investments by penalising those countries in which legislation
on media ownership is more rigid.'
Another concern to emerge from the consultation exercise was the fear of
publishers that out-dated rules on cross-media ownership would deny them the
opportunity to take advantage of developments in electronic media.
Not all the companies consulted agreed on the need for harmonisation. 'The
media pluralism regulations have proved no barrier to cross-border
investment by News International in the media,' said Mr Murdoch's News
International, which owns The Times and The Sun newspapers. Similarly,
Fininvest said: 'The limits on capital investment in television stations
imposed in varying ways and degrees in many countries do not in themselves
constitute a decisive restriction on international competition.'
Nevertheless the industry consensus was that national regulation should be
harmonised. 'I would say that so far there has been an amazing degree of
consensus,' says Ms Angela Mills of the European publishers council, the
media lobby group. 'We think it is right that the Commission should do this
now because of the impact of new technology.' Others point out that some of
those media companies less than enthusiastic about harmonising ownership
rules - such as News International and Fininvest - have an interest in
protecting their dominant positions in their base countries.
But even with most of the industry backing the principle of reform, it will
be hard to formulate a set of European-wide rules satisfying everyone.
Commission officials believe the best way of winning support for their
proposals is to take as pragmatic an approach as possible. Thus plans
expected to be unveiled next month would set two criteria for judging
whether a media organisation should be allowed to expand its interests:
first, the current audience size of the organisation, and second, the other
media interests controlled by its owner (the 'controller' test).
Setting rules of media ownership according to audience size would be
particularly appropriate if, as expected, technology leads to a
proliferation of 'theme' television channels. 'This is much better than
looking at the number of channels, because channels have very different
audience sizes,' says a senior Commission official.
The problem would lie in measuring the audience size and deciding at what
point a media operator should be prevented from expanding. These points are
the subject of a further study by the Commission.
But the more controversial point will almost certainly be the so-called
'controller' test. Here many member states are likely to argue the principle
of subsidiarity should apply, and that it should be up to nation states to
decide how much media influence an individual should be allowed. On the
other hand, some in the media industry fear lax controls would not achieve
the goal of harmonisation.
Channel 4 Television in the UK has told the Commission that 'in view of the
high standards of regulation on ownership already set in some national
states . . . it would be appropriate for a directive to set minimum (but
adequate) transnational standards'. The Commission is still considering how
a 'controller test' could be applied in practice. But it envisages its
proposed rules reflecting experience at a national level and dovetailing
with existing EU competition and company law.
The Commission is adamant that judging media ownership issues according to
its two criteria would not go beyond what is necessary to create a single
market.
But the balance will be hard to get right. Further consultations will follow
the publication of the Commission's proposals next month. It will then be up
to member states to decide whether to proceed with a new European directive.
Submissions sent to the Commission during its first consultative exercise
give some flavour of the arguments for and against new EU rules - and the
lobbying will only intensify. 'We think that, because of political pressure
from the European Parliament, this measure could end up being very
restrictive. We don't think the Commission can deliver,' warns one media
company executive.
Small wonder the Commission is treading gingerly. As one official puts it:
'This is a very emotional issue. We know what we want, but we know that in
this area, perhaps more than any other, we have to find a consensus first.'

FT  10 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unfair to suggest Abiola should join
Nigerian government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From ALHAJI ABUBAKAR ALHAJI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, My attention has been drawn to the editorial comment 'Time to help
Nigeria' (August 3).
I have to thank the Financial Times for showing keen interest in Nigeria's
economic and political affairs. However, its judgment on political issues
has to be viewed against the background that it specialises in economic and
financial matters. It is in this light that I am interpreting your
suggestion for a coalition government in Nigeria at this moment to be headed
by Chief MKO Abiola for a period of two years as no more than a simplistic
Solomon-type of judgment. The fact of the matter is that the present
government in Nigeria has articulated a political programme which Nigeria as
a nation has accepted and is now being actively implemented.
The first phase of the programme was the election and inauguration of the
constitutional conference to draw up a political agenda, including a
timetable for holding elections at all levels of our political system with a
view to returning the country to a truly democratically elected government.
The conference was inaugurated on schedule on June 27. During the
inauguration speech the head of state, the commander-in-chief of the armed
forces, elaborated his administration's thinking on the current political
developments in Nigeria, including the assurance that his government will
not unduly interfere with the recommendations of the constitutional
conference. He reiterated that the ban on political activities in the
country will be lifted in the first quarter of 1995, when the political
agenda, as recommended by the constitutional conference and approved by the
provisional ruling council, will begin to take effect.
Given this national consensus, it is unfair, to say the least, for your
paper to suggest that a person currently charged with treason against the
state should be called upon to become a head of another interim government
for any period of time.
As far as the vast majority of Nigerians are concerned, the question of
Chief Abiola, June 12 and what have you is now a matter of history. As for
Chief Abiola, the possibility or otherwise of his contesting any future
elections will depend on the outcome of the ongoing judicial process.
Let me emphasise that Nigeria now has a political programme that it believes
in and which it intends to implement. We are aware that attempts are being
made by some organisations in and outside the country, using the most
undemocratic means including arson, intimidation, kid-napping etc, to derail
the political programme and to destabilise the nation.
It is in the light of the foregoing that the Nigerian government and people
will remain eternally grateful to the British government, and in particular
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, for their understanding and support
during the crisis and for the ongoing political programme.
Finally, I would like to use this opportunity to call on all peoples of
goodwill to support the government and people of Nigeria so as to ensure
that the ongoing constitutional conference finishes its work peacefully and
the country is returned to a democracy within the shortest possible time.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Join the dots: Viewed from afar, Clinton's foreign policy
looks rather less chaotic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago, when I told a British friend I was going to Washington 'to find
out whether Clinton has a foreign policy', the predictable response was:
'Well, I can save you the fare.'
Since then, the US president's reputation in Europe has improved. His
success in winning congressional approval for the North American Free Trade
Agreement was generally appreciated, as was his contribution to the Uruguay
Round. This year, he has been on three trips to Europe, and on the whole has
made a good impression.
Meanwhile, the US and Europe have learnt to work together on Bosnia, the
single most divisive issue of 1993. The results fall well short of the
miraculous, but the US can claim credit for providing the muscle which has
enforced a kind of peace round Sarajevo, and for converting the bitter
struggle between Croats and Moslems into a wary truce, if not a wholehearted
alliance.
Even Clinton's U-turn on relations with China, de-linking trade from human
rights, has won more applause than brickbats in Europe, where it is
generally regarded as part of the necessary learning process that every new
US administration has to go through.
It was therefore a slight shock to discover, on returning to Washington two
weeks ago, that criticism of Clinton's foreign policy performance there is,
if anything, more widespread and scathing than a year ago. The claim is not
that it has got worse, but that it has failed to get better, and that after
one and a half years in office this failure has become damaging to the
president's domestic prestige. A series of personnel changes in the state
department and National Security Council have indicated, but not cured, a
foreign policy malaise within the administration, and it is now widely
assumed that secretary of state Warren Christopher will himself be
sacrificed after the mid-term elections in November.
Actually I suspect the real failure is in domestic policy, which was
Clinton's own chosen priority in the campaign that brought him to power. He
gets little credit for an economic recovery which many seem to regard as
statistical rather than real. Healthcare reform, the Clinton priority of
priorities, has apparently backfired on him - or at least his sponsorship of
it has become an embarrassment, so that Senate Democrats prefer to bring in
their own version without the Clinton label.
That reflects the erosion of public faith in his integrity caused by
Whitewater, and in his competence caused by tales of chronic indecision
seeping out of the White House, notably in The Agenda: Inside the Clinton
White House, the recent book by Bob Woodward - and that in turn affects
perceptions of his foreign policy performance. Indecisiveness was one of the
main charges levelled against him at a Republican foreign policy forum two
weeks ago.
Perhaps the most trenchant was James Baker, secretary of state in the Bush
administration, who says he will decide at year's end whether to run for the
Republican presidential nomination in 1996. After conceding that in some
areas - Russia, the Middle East, trade - the Clinton administration had
built on his own successes, Baker complained that there was 'no overall
sense of dir-ection, . . . no sense of consistency, . . . fragmentation in
authority, . . . a tendency to view foreign policy through the lens of
domestic politics . . . and a seeming inability to understand the importance
of American leadership.'
Yet in a conversation with Baker last week, I found that he disagreed more
with the manner than with the substance of the Clinton foreign policy -
except, rather surprisingly, that he favours a rapid extension of Nato which
could even include Russia. Not only east European countries such as Hungary,
but also Ukraine and Russia would be less likely to go to war with each
other if they were inside Nato, he explained. He felt the US should have
been 'more resolute' in dealing with North Korea (but 'I don't mean sending
troops or starting a war'), and that in Somalia it should have stuck to its
original mission of famine relief, rather than changing it 'to one of
nation-building'.
In Bosnia, Baker said, the president's promise to send 25,000 US soldiers to
implement the peace plan should 'be taken with a grain of salt - I'm not
sure Congress will let him'. His main criticism was not so much that Clinton
had failed to use force, as that 'on six or seven occasions' he had said he
would and then not followed up, thereby damaging US credibility. Baker
believes that US leadership in the post-cold-war world should be based on
'selective engagement': 'We have to look at each crisis and determine
whether our national interests, principles and values require that we become
involved.' In the Gulf war they did so require, but 'you can't make the same
argument in Haiti'.
The charge of vacillation is hard to rebut. It may be preferable to a
knee-jerk response to each crisis, but undoubtedly public zigzags such as we
have witnessed on both Bosnia and Haiti do make for a loss of credibility.
More consistent presentation of foreign policy is one of the main objectives
of David Gergen, the Republican spin merchant now seconded to the state
department after a year struggling to put a gloss on Clinton's domestic
policies.
Good luck to him. But we outsiders should not let ourselves be bemused by
the detail of presentation. We might do better to think of the Clinton
foreign policy as a pointilliste painting. From close up, it looks a
terrible mess. Stand far enough back and you get a more or less coherent
picture, for which 'selective engagement' would be as good a title as any.
What a pity Baker thought of it first.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Ukraine must have assistance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CHRISTINE BATRUCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Congratulations for the objective and comprehensive analysis by Jill
Barshay of the situation in Ukraine since Leonid Kuchma's accession to the
presidency (''Twere well it were done quickly, August 2).
I agree with her that one is likely to see rapid moves towards economic
reform in Ukraine. However, unlike Barshay, who sees the parliament of
Ukraine as the main obstacle to economic reform, I feel it is a case of
shared responsibility with western powers. Indeed, the west has been
promising economic assistance to Ukraine since independence, yet has not
delivered. Should the G7 not release fairly quickly a portion of the
promised Dollars 4bn, the pro-Russian tendency might be strengthened. This
could spell disaster, not only for Ukraine's independence, but for the
west's interest in keeping a proper balance of power in the area.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Commercial power of Tory conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TIM COLLINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was amused by the Labour Party's claims in your story 'Companies
queue to appear at Labour's show' (August 8) that it has the largest
commercial exhibition of any political party in Europe.
This is, needless to say, another wholly unreliable socialist statistic. We
expect to raise well above three quarters of a million pounds in commercial
income at our conference, the organisation of which has been contracted out
to CCO Conferences, compared to Labour's claim of Pounds 600,000 for its
conference.
Our exhibition is, as usual, completely sold out and has a steadily growing
waiting list. This is despite the fact that we charge significantly more
stand for stand than Labour. Many companies have told us that they would
exhibit at the Labour conference solely for reasons of balance - and only if
they could secure a space at ours first.
British companies continue to recognise that their commercial interest will
only be served by the continuation in office of the Conservative party - the
only party committed to deregulation and low personal and corporate
taxation, and the only party opposed to socialist idiocies such as a minimum
wage and the Social Chapter.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The movie Ruthless People (9.00 ITV) is quite funny by modern standards:
Bette Midler plays a shrew of a wife who is kidnapped, much to the joy of
her husband (Danny DeVito) and makes the life of her kidnappers hell.
Unfortunately ITV is showing a version censored for American television, so
perhaps it will make more sense to watch Witness. This is a documentary
marking the 25th anniversary of the murder of film star Sharon Tate by
Charles Manson and his gang. The thesis here is that the Manson murder
became a political symbol in the US and brought to an end the 'peace and
flower power' era of the 1960s (9.00 C4). By all accounts the short drama by
Andrew Davies in BBC2's Stages series, A Few Short Journeys Of The Heart, is
another of those high technology production numbers which television
occasionally tries in the effort to break out of the prison of filmed
naturalism (9.25). In BBC1's big documentary series The Human Animal,
Desmond Morris moves on from the hunting instinct to the way in which man's
shelter has developed so rapidly, from mud hut to skyscraper (9.30).

FT  10 AUG 94 / Arts: It is flair, not formula, that counts - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Back you come after a few weeks absence and still they are running around in
circles shrieking 'Look out] Here comes the information superhighway] Don't
panic] Don't panic] The information superhighway is coming to your
television]' As with religion and politics, the more excited the devotees
become, and the more often their claims are repeated, the greater the
suspicion that they are talking nonsense.
With communications technology these bouts of hysteria crop up regularly.
Fifteen years ago the techno freaks were rushing around shouting 'Look out]
Here comes convergence] Don't panic] Don't panic]' Organisers of day
conferences made lots of money, and miles of column inches were devoted to
the idea of all the mass media melting into one.
Of course it did not happen. Telephones and cinema and television and
publishing did not converge to any significant degree: how many ordinary
people (not working in mass communications) do you know who use the
telephone to download information onto their television screens? When did
you last buy a shirt via teleshopping? Yes, you can see Hollywood movies on
your television, but then you always could. When lectured on the revolution
about to happen on your television screen by a man with five ballpoints in
his breast pocket, the acronym to remember is 'Gigo': garbage in, garbage
out. What matters to most of us is not the way in which facts or
entertainment reach us, but the quality of the content. It would be nice if
the instruction book (it has to be a book, obviously) could be written in
English rather than translated from the Japanese by a wild eyed teenage
virtual-reality freak in an anorak, but that aside we really do not care
much whether we use DAT or laser disc, cable or satellite.
And yet the BBC has just sent out a glossy silver leaflet announcing the BBC
Networking Club, and the first line of type on the front page (naturally
they would not use anything but the 600-year-old medium of print to get this
across) says 'Nowadays it's not who you contact, but how you contact them]'
That is the sort of fatuous assertion that makes you despair of what was,
until quite recently, a great organisation concerned almost exclusively with
producing radio and television programmes, many of them outstanding. Inside
the leaflet, among promises of a 'guided tour of Cyber Town' and
instructions on how to 'configure your WWW browser' is the suggestion that,
with this new network, known as Auntie (quite a good undergraduate joke in
the 1960s) you will be able, for instance, to 'find out more about your
favourite BBC tv and radio programmes'. Those who have tried using the
existing on-screen text services to check a late programme change, and
waited endlessly while the 'page' numbers click round, only to find that the
schedule has not, anyway, been updated, will have their own views on that.
Presumably the launch of the Auntie club is prompted by the fashionable
notion that the BBC, instead of just going on making excellent programmes,
should become (West Coast accent, please) a 'vertically integrated global
media conglomerate', or some such thing. Yet the BBC's greatest strength has
always been in giving free rein to individual flair and talent, not in
serving some pre-ordained formula. One of the best series now on screen is
Billy Connolly's World Tour Of Scotland, a programme unlike any I have seen
before. Connolly toured tiny venues in some of the remotest parts of
Scotland, and programme makers Willy Smax and Bill Tennant have combined
clips from his stand-up routines there with bits of travelogue - often
strikingly sentimental, but proudly so, not apologetically - to create a
form of fond autobiography which is strongly flavoured, vivid, and
enormously appealing.
If you want to know what it means to be Scottish this series is far more
powerful than anything emerging from The Tales Of Para Handy which works to
a depressingly familiar formula: start with a book and choose for the lead
someone who is already highly successful in some other series, in this
instance Gregor Fisher, aka Rab C Nesbitt. Why choose Kriss Akabusi to
introduce the happy-clappy programme Summer Sunday on BBC1? Up to now he has
been known not for his religious faith but for his sprinting . . . but also
for wilder enthusiasm than anyone else in the British athletics team. And
there is the clue. We now have yet another series presented with the formula
that used to be reserved for teenybopper pop shows, all squeaky hysteria,
windmilling arms, and screams of 'Hallo Scarborough]'
The best programmes rely not upon some wild-eyed concept of advanced
technology, nor upon slavish adherence to a formula, but upon the unique
vision of a talented individual. It is true of Desmond Morris's The Human
Animal which, tonight, considers human living quarters, having looked last
week at the way that the hunting instinct remains with us in modern urban
surroundings. Morris's theories may not all prove correct in the long run,
but he thinks interestingly and argues persuasively about what makes human
beings behave the way they do. Far from adding to the programmes, the
occasional rinky-dink electronic tricks actually detract.
Michael Moore's TV Nation on BBC2 on Fridays is another series which has
value solely because of the idiosyncratic approach of its presenter. Moore
is the American who made the in-your-face documentary Roger And Me, about
the catastrophic effect on Flint, Michigan, of the closure of the town's car
factory. Now he is making a whole series which holds your attention - and
entertains, even when matters are pretty serious - by continuing to be
equally bull headed. Last week he blithely investigated what influence in US
government you or a lobbyist can buy for Dollars 5,000; the contrast between
President Clinton's description of the town where he was born and other
people's descriptions of the town where he grew up; and the reasons why
North Dakota is the least visited state of the union. Asked why anyone
should visit, the governor says 'You can still get lost here'.
It is the content that counts. Even if the information superhighway does
come crashing into our sitting rooms in time to be a boon to our
grandchildren, it will still be the content that counts. Nowadays, as
throughout history, it is not how you contact people that matters but what
they have to say.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Arts: Hampstead Theatre wins Ramsay Award
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first Peggy Ramsay Foundation Award, all Pounds 50,000 of it, has gone
to London's Hampstead Theatre. It will enable the theatre, and its director
Penny Topper, to put on a no-expense-spared-production of Rona Munro's new
play The Maiden Stone.
Peggy Ramsay was the draconian theatrical agent who numbered most of the
leading playwrights of the past generation, from Orton through Ayckbourn to
Hare, among her clients. When she died in 1991 she left an estate of over
Pounds 1m 'to benefit writers in need of assistance.'
The trustees of the foundation decided to give a substantial sum each year
to a new play, to enable it to have the best possible production. Six
selected theatres sent in scripts of planned projects and Hampstead won.
On average a new play at Hampstead costs Pounds 35,000 to put on, and the
small stage means that the cast rarely exceeds six. Munro's play, which is
still a work in progress, is an ambitious project involving a troupe of
travelling players in the 19th century whose wanderings take them to a
remote village in the north of Scotland.
The extra money will be spent on costumes and sets, and on training up the
large number of children required in the cast. By the time it opens early
next year the Hampstead stage will be buzzing with all the flair that money
can buy.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Arts: A tribute to Glock - Promenade concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Proms paid tribute to Sir William Glock on Sunday, as well they might.
During his reign as Controller of Music at the BBC (1959-1972) he effected a
revolution in British music, which badly needed one. This double-length
programme echoed perfectly his own soigne tastes: passionate respect for the
Viennese classics and the early modernists (Ravel, Stravinsky), a great -
and back then, unfamiliar - interest in the roots of Western music before
Bach, fastidious attention to what was new.
Those of us who were around at the time will not forget the excitement of
the 'Invitation Concerts', which spotlit serial and post-serial music for
the first time on the BBC. Such continental-influenced stuff had been
granted only minimal air-time before. Only a few Londoners who attended
coterie concerts were (imperfectly) aware of the most potent musical
developments elsewhere.
With Glock, the Third Programme suddenly became for many of us our main
entree to serious new music, both by foreigners and by adventurous young
Brits: Maxwell Davies, Goehr, Birtwistle - even adventurous older Brits
(Lutyens, Maconchy), and also an exiled Spaniard (Roberto Gerhard, once a
Schoenberg pupil) - so long as they met Glock's severe standards for
radically new musical thought. There is probably some truth in recent
charges that Glock was hoity-toity about 'contemporary' British music in the
post-Elgar, post-Bliss, post-Walton tradition; but in the late 1950s and the
'60s, that vein had no semblance of vitality.
Lutyens was represented here by the second performance (only now]) of a BBC
commission from Glock's days, The Tears of Night for counter-tenor (James
Bowman), soprano trio and ensemble: nocturnal, grave, hieratic, curiously
affecting. I remember Gerhard's 1960 sextet Libra from some performances
that made far more vivid sense of it than this Prom account, efficient but
unimaginative under Martyn Brabbins: where were the abrupt surprises, the
dangerous glee, the uncanny suspension at the end when the mock-primitive
flute arrives?
We missed those. But the Nash Ensemble also figured as accompanists to
Skaila Kanga's artful harp in Ravel's Introduction &amp; Allegro (it is time to
admit that this is an imperishable, superbly constructed work, not just a
charming confection); and the New London Consort remembered the late David
Munrow's style in sets of lively Renaissance dances.
Quite rightly the concert included a post-Glock piece, George Benjamin's
recent Sudden Time. It meets every Glock criterion - articulate thought,
professionalism, a refusal of any cosy routine - and positively
over-fulfills its brief. As conducted by the composer with his customary
precision, its friendly, consonant, unexpected sounds both gave pleasure and
promised further depths to fathom.
At the beginning and the end we had grander stuff. Colin Davis led an
irresistible Haydn Symphony no. 99 and Mozart's B-flat Piano Concerto K. 450
with Imogen Cooper. I confess to finding her by turns sentimental (downright
smoochy with the second subject of the first Allegro) and elsewhere too
muscularly forthright, but I may be stupid; certainly she is a thoughtful
artist, perhaps too self-consciously self-effacing.
The best things in the concert came from Pierre Boulez. In Stravinsky's
Symphony of Psalms he took the first movement far above the composer's
tempo, which lost the sense of a measured introduction but gained the effect
of a seamless prelude to the central double Fugue - which he read as
prescribed, and transparently; the Finale too, which rose to its awesome,
timeless rewards in the long coda.
Then his own Cummings ist der Dichter (with the BBC Singers and electronic
enhancement) came to exact, volatile life, as never before in my experience.
It postdated Glock, I think, but it served as an ideal model for what he has
treasured most: clarity, economy and calculated originality - a joy to hear.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Arts: 'The Street of Crocodiles' - a riveting dream -
Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Street of Crocodiles - Theatre de Complicite's 1992 stage adaptation of
stories by Bruno Schulz, currently back in London after one round of
international tours and before another - is a riveting, bewildering dream.
It has a dream's crazy jumps from one kind of reality to another, and the
heightened bizarrerie of a dream too. What kind of dream it is changes while
we watch: illusion, reverie, nightmare.
The work is not in every respect a success. Many of its details are
confusing; a great deal of the scenario published in the programme will come
as a surprise to those who only read up after the performance (myself
included); certain scenes are too prolonged; and the cartoon grotesquerie of
the characterisations becomes sometimes wearying. Yet it has a peculiarly
compelling stage life, with its own weird inner logic.
The hero, Joseph, is a lone figure at work in a library. He opens certain
books; his thoughts take wing. Now he is teacher to a class of unruly
pupils, now son and brother to the members of his own eccentric family, now
a forlorn lover forever pursuing one girl through the whirling world. In his
mind, however, it is the members of his family household who people all the
scenes he imagines or remembers. In particular, he is haunted by his father,
an intelligent man forever in flight from the minutiae of daily existence
and in pursuit of larger realms of thought. 'Wood is alive,' proclaims his
father amid the carpentry class he is trying to teach; and - his idee fixe -
'The migration of souls is the essence of life.' Joseph backs his father,
even when his father's obsession with birds, books, and the life of the
mind, makes domestic existence intolerable for almost everyone else. At one
point during the central dinner scene, the members of the family turns into
his father's birds; at another, they turn into his impertinent pupils in the
schoolroom.
I never understood why some of this German family spoke in Spanish. Or why,
in one episode, the maid Adela has an extra pair of shoes attached to her
ankles. Or why, early on, we see a man - seemingly in defiance of gravity,
body parallel to the floor - walking slowly down a wall towards the floor.
Yet such deranged details as these help to give Street of Crocodiles its
perverse vitality.
Other details have a resonant poetry. When the 'pupils' all round up against
poor Joseph and strike him round the stage, his staggered, flailing, retreat
acquires the rhythm of a crazy dance. When the maid Adela attacks the
household's junior menfolk who pester her one summer, she chases them like
flies - whereupon Joseph's father, the constant bane of her prosaic
existence, becomes a vast wasp, hovering the more angrily for her
aggression. When, finally, Joseph tries to keep the world out of his
father's once magical shop, the people beat on the door and start to sing a
polyphonic chorale that turns into, of all things, 'Worthy is the Lamb that
was slain': which in turn prepares us for the way they will assail him and
sacrifice him.
What helps Street of Crocodiles most is the cast. The whole ensemble is
brilliantly committed, and there are some first-rate individual
performances. Outstanding is Cesar Sarachu as Joseph. It is the devout
economy of his playing that stops this work from ever becoming too
overwrought; his sincerity and innocence place into perspective all the
oddballs around him. Finest of these is Lilo Baur as the maid Adela. Her
impatience with his father's unworldly and unrealistic ways creates immense
tension round the home; she is a perpetual dynamo - a smouldering, even
demonic, force, even though she appears to champion conventional values.
Simon McBurney directs, and also adapted the stories (with co-director, Mark
Wheatley). Thanks largely to him, Theatre de Complicite has become one of
Britain's flagship companies. The irony about this is that its performing
style - full of heightened mime and caricature, with exaggerations and
repetitions, underlining points in a method that is basically
expressionistic - is highly European. Though some of its performers are
British, few British virtues or vices are in evidence. Is it a sign of
things to come that one of our most individual troupes looks as if it
derives from the other side of the Channel?
At the Young Vic until September 3.

Harwood, who has been with Warburg for 17 years, is the latest in a growing
list of Warburg economists who have defected to rival institutions. A year
ago John Shepperd and Nigel Richardson moved to Yamaichi International and
at the start of the year Kevin Gardiner joined Morgan Stanley.
Harwood's departure underlines Warburg's position as one of the more fertile
hunting grounds for City economists. Because of its reputation, the firm
appears to have little difficulty recruiting bright young economists some of
whom are subsequently tempted away by firms prepared to pay more than
Warburg.
Kleinwort Benson lags well behind Warburg Securities in the areas where
Harwood has made his name. He has been variously the firm's chief UK and
international economist and most recently head of global asset allocation.
In the latest Extel ranking Warburg was rated number one in international
equity market coverage, and number three in global asset allocation and
international economics.
Edmond Warner, 31, KB's head of strategy and economics who joined from
Baring Securities just under a year ago, says Harwood's job will be to 'beef
up' macro-economic research and international marketing. Albert Edwards will
continue to be responsible for global strategy research.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Herbert, 61, who recently retired as chairman and chief executive of
the Tussauds group, owned by Pearson, has just joined the board of Royal
Armouries (International), the company formed to operate the UK's first
private finance initiative in the arts sector, the Royal Armouries in Leeds.
The Leeds-based collection, due to open in early 1996, will be stocked
largely by material from the Tower of London, but will not, says Herbert, be
taking historically important and London-related items - such as Henry
VIII's suit of armour - from the White Tower there.
'It's moving part of the Tower of London collection to Leeds, but in turn
that means that remaining items, such as the crown jewels, will be able to
have more space for display than previously,' says Herbert. The Leeds
project has a combination of private and public sector finance totalling
Pounds 42.5m.
A trained accountant, Herbert started his working life with Peat Marwick. He
joined Madame Tussaud's (as it then was) in 1967 as its first-ever qualified
accountant. He became finance director in 1971, eventually taking on the
role of chief executive in 1976.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Business and the Environment: Credit where credit is due -
An ambitious attempt to rate companies according to their greenness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The concept of environmental risk is gaining ground in business circles. But
how does it affect a company's standing in the market and the way it
behaves?
One of the more ambitious attempts to relate environmental risk to the
traditional features of a business, such as its credit standing,
geographical location and payment performance, has just been completed in
the UK*.
It was prepared jointly by Risk and Opportunity Intelligence, an economic
analysis firm, and Environmental Auditors Ltd, an environmental consultancy,
using information about 330,000 companies in the Dun &amp; Bradstreet database.
EAL ascribed an environmental risk rating to each of the companies in the
database, based on its industrial category. Risk, in this case, meant how
'dirty' the business was and how likely environmental factors were to affect
its performance. Thus dry cleaners and garages achieved low rankings and
service businesses scored higher.
ROI then compared these ratings with the credit ratings which had already
been ascribed to the companies on a scale of 1 (best) to 5 (worst). The
surprising result (left-hand table) was that the more environmentally risky
companies tended to have the lower credit risk. That is the opposite of what
might be expected, namely that dirty companies are also the more risky
financially.
The reason for this paradox is to be found in another part of the research
(right-hand table). This shows that environmental risk rises with both the
size of a business, and also in many cases with its age. In other words,
bigger and longer established companies are dirtier. This is not surprising
when considering Britain's large companies today: they are usually
decades-old manufacturing or chemical companies with household names.
Thus, ICI and Shell only earn middling environmental risk ratings because of
the nature of their businesses, but their credit rating is the very best. On
the other hand, a newly formed publishing firm consisting entirely of
white-collar workers would earn a high environmental rating, but could pose
a large risk financially.
That particular finding applies whether a company is measured by the size of
its turnover or by its tangible net worth.
But another aspect of the research puts a different twist on this. ROI and
EAL compared a company's environmental risk rating with its payment
performance. This showed that companies with a high environmental risk
tended not to settle their bills promptly. Could this be another version of
the frequently observed fact that large industrial companies like to keep
their creditors waiting? Companies with low environmental risk, in other
words the newer service industries, were prompter payers, although if they
were late they were very late.
The survey found that the companies with optimal risk are, by these
measurements, 11 years old. That is the point at which the environment and
credit risk lines cross. Any company younger than that tends to have a lower
environmental risk and a higher credit risk. Any older is more risky
environmentally, but stronger financially.
The survey also looked at how environmental risk is spread around the
country. Not surprisingly, perhaps, the south east stands out as having by
far the highest proportion of low-risk companies because it has the most
service industries, such as finance, and relatively few manufacturing
companies. The regions with the greatest number of high-risk companies were
the West Midlands and Wales, again hardly a surprise given the amount of
manufacturing and mining in those areas.
One of the more intriguing findings relates the riskiness of a company to
its age. This shows that older companies tend, in general, to be the dirtier
ones. But there are a couple of wrinkles. There is a sharp jump in dirty
companies formed in the late 1930s and early 1940s, presumably a legacy of
the war effort when production was all that mattered. After the war, the
number of new dirty companies fell steadily as various pieces of
environmental legislation were passed, such as the 1956 Clean Air Act, the
1974 Control of Pollution Act and the 1989 Water Act.
But, curiously, the line then starts rising again. After 1990, more dirty
companies were formed. This can be interpreted in two ways. It can mean that
pollution regulation is not biting and that the authorities are tolerating
lower standards.
A more likely explanation, however, is that technology has now advanced to
the point where it becomes possible to start up dirty companies again, but
within the standards set by new pollution controls. If so, that is a healthy
development because it suggests a rebirth of manufacturing.
Niall Fraser of ROI says that some of the findings of the survey may seem
obvious. But he says: 'No other study has included such a vast number of
businesses.'
He believes the research could provide a useful tool to measure performance
among bank loan portfolios, investment funds insurance companies and company
suppliers. It has been used by stock analysts to assess the soundness of UK
clearing banks by classifying their exposure to various levels of
environmental risk.

FT  10 AUG 94 / Business and the Environment: A hole in the net of fishing's
future - Skirmishes over cod and tuna reflect worsening stock depletion
worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This month's clashes between fishermen about cod and tuna in the Arctic and
the Bay of Biscay are symptoms of a wider problem - the depletion of fish
stocks around the world.
The Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) calculates that there have been 20 such
incidents worldwide in the past 18 months, as fishermen move into rivals'
hunting grounds in search of new outlets to remain profitable.
They are caught in a vicious circle. As fish stocks become more scarce, they
fetch a higher price, raising the incentive for fishermen to intensify their
effort.
The problem, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO), is exacerbated by the subsidies that governments provide
to fleets, for example, in aid to shipbuilders, or grants for fishing gear.
It is also difficult to measure a resource at the mercy of changes in
weather or currents. Fishing quota systems are based on scientists'
estimates of stocks and may be in error by up to 20 per cent, says John
Caddy, head of the FAO's marine resource service. 'If they make the mistake
several times, there's a possibility the stock will become seriously
depleted,' he said.
The EU's common fisheries policy has helped create conflicts between
fishermen by allocating quotas to single species like cod, says Indrani
Lutchman, fisheries officer for the WWF. That creates heavy pressure on
those species and drives fishermen to other zones when stocks fall.
Defenders argue that conflicts between fishermen would be greater if oceans
were open to all comers, especially as declining stock leads to collapse in
areas such as Newfoundland.
The catch from the world's oceans has been falling since it hit a peak of
86.4m tonnes in 1989, according to the FAO. Three years later it was about
80m tonnes.
Most of the north Atlantic, north Pacific, Mediterranean and Black Sea is
overfished, as are the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. More fishing in
these areas will produce smaller catches.
The greatest decline is in the most highly valued fish, such as sole and
plaice, and in standard-priced finfish like cod, haddock, and mackerel.
Overfishing is also affecting marine and lake fish such as sardines and
tilapias.
As fleets turn to new fishing grounds, these, too, are at risk of
overexploitation, says the WWF (see graph). The Anglo-Spanish confrontation
in the Bay of Biscay is about albacore tuna. There are no EU quotas for
albacore, but that may change if driftnet fishing practised by French and
British vessels depletes the population, as scientists fear.
Lutchman wants these dangers addressed at a United Nations conference
starting in New York next week on managing fish stocks in the high seas,
beyond the reach of individual countries' 200-mile exclusion zones.
She believes global fleet reductions are the answer. Management regimes,
using enforced quotas and restrictions on fishing tackle, can also work, for
example off north Norway, where stocks are healthy. Such controls are the
FAO's preferred solution, since they allow stocks to recover and reduce the
number of discarded fish, which account for more than 10 per cent of the
catch in many fisheries.
The FAO also advocates a return to exclusive fishing rights - allocating
specific areas or stocks to certain groups of fishermen - to encourage
conservation. Caddy cites the huge investment in artificial reefs around the
Japanese coast, which protect stocks from predators.
But global solutions require agreements between coastal states,
long-distance fishing nations such as Japan, Korea and Spain, and
unregulated fishing vessels flying flags of convenience.
That is one challenge facing the UN conference, which began work in 1993 and
is due to wind up at the end of August. Even if a treaty were thrashed out,
the question remains of burgeoning populations facing dwindling supplies.
The FAO proposes that smaller fish caught as feed for animals and fish
farming should be used for human consumption instead, as quality and
freezing methods improve. About 30 per cent of the world catch is turned to
fishmeal.
Without such a shift, the outlook for the human diet is gloomy, says the
FAO. If more and more sea fish are caught purely for fish meal the danger is
that humans will no longer enjoy fish from the wild. 'The impact would be
the loss of the present wide spectrum of food items that the existing 1,000
commercial species now provide, to be replaced by very few species providing
only differences in flesh, colour and texture.'

FT  10 AUG 94 / Management: Just in time to fuel the debate - Japanese-style
working practices lead to lower profit margins in the UK

Can it really be true that enthusiastic UK users of Japanese-style practices
in human resources and relations with suppliers, as well as in production,
suffer from lower profit margins than companies which have been less
inclined to follow the trend?
That is the conclusion of a study* published this week by the University of
Cambridge. It found that, in spite of big improvements in manufacturing
efficiency and sales per employee, high users of methods such as
just-in-time stock control (JIT) and kaizen (continuous improvement) had
lower profitability than low users.
It sounds like a direct challenge to the management and manufacturing
consultants who have been promoting these concepts among UK companies during
the past decade. They have been quick to respond.
Adrian Reeve, director of the Hampshire-based consultancy World Class
International, says there is tangible evidence that implementation in the UK
of these Japanese-style practices and other world class manufacturing
techniques does indeed raise profits.
He says a recent benchmarking exercise in the Midlands by World Class for
the Engineering Employers Federation found a clear relationship between the
adoption of these practices and a higher profit margin. A parallel exercise
for engineering companies in the north produced the same result.
Nick Oliver, co-author of the Cambridge report with Gillian Hunter, is
sticking to his guns, although he stresses that the findings are
preliminary.
The results could even be reversed as the UK emerges from recession, he
suggests: the negative effect of excessive employment, resulting from
concessions made to win workers' co-operation for Japanese-style methods,
could become a benefit because companies will have the skills they need to
exploit better market conditions.
At the very least the findings of the Cambridge study will start a debate,
because scant attention has been paid to tracking the financial benefits -
or otherwise - of introducing Japanese-style methods into UK manufacturing.
This is because of the inherent difficulties in doing so. Complicating
factors include the financial condition of companies before they start
introducing the methods, the vagaries of market conditions, and differences
in profitability and the competitive environment among industrial sectors.
It is often difficult or even impossible to separate from all these external
factors the effect on profits of a specific change in methods, particularly
when the change involves 'people issues' which by definition cannot be
quantified numerically.
Moreover, any process of change is likely to generate disruption and costs
for a year or two, producing financial benefits only later. The Cambridge
study found that the peak for introducing new manufacturing methods was
reached around 1988, and the study continued to 1992, giving just about
enough time to assess the benefits.
Oliver says the findings are not all bad news. First, the use of Japanese
production methods does result in reduced stocks, as is clearly intended by
JIT.
Second, sales per employee among the high users shows a greater improvement
during the period 1986-1992 than those of the lower user group. The
performance gap becomes noticeable around 1988, by which time most companies
had introduced Japanese methods, and widens to a differential of about 30
per cent in 1992.
The operating profit margin of both low and high users fluctuates between 6
and 8 per cent from 1986 to 1990. But after that it falls sharply for the
high users, to about 4 per cent in 1992. In contrast, the low users' average
profit margin rose to 9 per cent in 1991 before dropping back to about 7 per
cent in 1992.
One explanation for this may be that it is simply a random variation. Or
some of the costs of implementation of the methods may not have filtered
through until 1990-91, although this is not wholly consistentwith a 1988
peak for their introduction.
That leaves a third explanation, according to the study: that for some
reason the high users of Japanese methods proved more vulnerable to the
recession - or at least to an economic environment that is fluctuating and
unstable - than did the low users.
Oliver believes that the fragility of Japanese lean production methods may
explain the financial performance.
Companies can lose orders to competitors if they have de-stocked
excessively. Cultural differences in attitudes to kaizen may also be to
blame, he suggests: in Japan, a group of workers which comes up with a new
method would pass on the financial benefits to the company, whereas a
similar group in the UK could in some circumstances retain the benefits
themselves as time saved.
No one is saying that trying Japanese methods is a waste of time in Britain.
But the Cambridge study does further reinforce the argument that they cannot
simply be applied anywhere and by anyone without regard to local conditions.
More research into the link between lean production and profits in the UK
environment is needed.
